surrounding parishes. The city of St. John is
a hive of industry and trade, while Iberville

aristocracy and middle class. Farmers make

glory of the colony and, sînce Canada was

stability. I pay tribute to, these industrious

Honourable 'senators, I should like to,
point out a few significant events which have
taken place since parliament adjourned last
June.
Let me first mention the anxiety which
we ail felt upon hearing of the grave illness
which struck His Majesty the King; the
fervent prayers which we, together with al
the peoples of the Commonwealth and of the
civilized world, offered Up to Heaven, and
our gratification upon hearing the good news
of the King's convalescence. Honourable
senators, I know I arn faithfully conveying
your feelings when I offer to His Majesty our

SENATE
ardent wishes for his rapid and full recovery,
and again assure him of our respectful and
unfailing loyalty.
I have been impatient to mention the enthusiasm with which Canadian people greeted
Their Royal Highnesses, the most gracious
Princess Elizabeth, and ber prince charming,
the Duke of Edinburgh, when they literally
came down from heaven at Dorval. This visit
will be a milestone in our history. It is to us
a most pleasant reminder of former royal
visits, that in 1860, of His Majesty King
Edward VII, then Prince of Wales; those in
1901 and in 1908, of Their Majesties King
George V and Queen Mary; -and that in 1939,
of Their Majesties King George VI and Queen
Elizabeth.
In rendering to our Princess our most
respectful homage, we pray the Holy Ghost to
shower upon her His ineffable gifts, to help
her fulfil the heavy duties of ber high office
as nobly, gracefully and unfailingly as did
her illustrious parents. We are happy to find
in Their Royal Hightnesses those family
virtues in which simplicity and distinction
are so harmoniously blended, and of which
Their Majesties, the King and Queen, gave
such a shining example to the world from
day to day.
The warm welcome already given Their
Royal Highnesses in Quebec and Ontario is
only a foretaste of what awaits them in all
the provinces of Canada. The whole province
of Quebec is happy at the thought that, after
having toured our great country, our royal
guests will soon come back to Montreal. We
wish them health, joy and happiness during
their stay in Canada, and extend those sane
wishes to their dear children, Prince Charles
and little Princess Ann.

our western institutions and that, in order
to be effective, such an alliance must have
sufficient military power to deter any possible aggressor.
It was in this spirit that the signatories of
the treaty united to preserve universal peace
and security by organizing their collective
defence.
The basic principle, affirmed from the very
outset, is that of a defensive alliance to
ensure peace and not to make war. That
doctrine was already well recognized by the
Romans, who proclaimed that whoever wants
peace must prepare for war-Si vis pacern.
Unfortunately, as history teaches us, after
growing rich with the spoils of the peoples
they had conquered, the Romans soon lapsed
into materialism and sensualism, and left the
defence of the empire in the hands of legions
recruited in other lands. This policy of
decadence led at once to internal strife, and
ultimately to the invasion of the barbarians
and the destruction of Rome.
Today the international situation involves
similar dangers. That is why freedom-loving
nations decided to unite in developing their
military power and to ask of their citizens
such sacrifices as are required for the success
of the common cause. An integrated army
was therefore organized in Europe, the
supreme command being entrusted to the
great General Eisenhower, with headquarters in Paris.
Each country that signed the Treaty contributes armed forces, according to its means,
to this army which is growing daily, yet too
slowly in the estimation of our best inforned
leaders. To ensure perfect unity of action,
this defensive alliance must now become the
nucleus of a true commonwealth of free

OCTOBER 16, 1951
(Translation)
Honourable senators, the Speech from the
Throne summarizes the legislative program
which the government intends to submit. I
do not propose to analyse it in detail. However, I feel I should mention here the questions
of inflation, of social welfare and of national
defence.
I will deal first with inflation. Inflation has
become a real nightmare in every country.
Things that cost ten dollars in 1939 now cost
twenty-two. The purchasing power of our
dollar has therefore been reduced more than
half and the cost of living index is steadily
rising! Everyone is anxiously wondering
where it will stop. How could we remedy
an evil which causes so much distress, which
jeopardizes the well-being, the health and
even the life of so many people, especially
low-wage earners who cannot supplement
their earnings, retired persons who live on
savings accumulated during a lifetime of labour, the sick, the invalids, and so many
others?
To answer such alarming questions, we
would have to go into the manifold causes
of inflation. This has been done already
many times, and findings have been made
public. Let me simply point out that the
economic and monetary situation of Canada
today is quite different from what it was in
1939. For a long time we have had no
unemployment. Our program of industrial
expansion to develop our natural resources
and to implement our national defence policy
puts into circulation enormous sums of money
which the public immediately uses to buy
commodities that they need or merely fancy.
On the other hand, war needs -and priorities
cut down the amount of available goods,
thereby creating competition between consumers and forcing prices up!
If Canadians continue to jostle and outbid
one another for everything offered for sale,
where will inflation stop?. Outstanding economists therefore urge us to buy less, to buy
only what is essential and to practise selfdenial in favour of those whose needs are
greater than our own. They tell us that we
benefit therefrom, for we shall be keeping our
money and helping to check inflation. Our
government will help us as it has already
done by every means at its disposal:
By credit restrictions. These have caused
recrimination in certain quarters, but how
much more lament would be heard if the
dollar value kept abruptly growing less and
less. Credit restrictions reduce the volume
of money in circulation; they check or, at
least, slow down inflation.
By taxes. The requirements of national
defence are enormous. It would be unfair

to shift that burden solely upon future generations. It is therefore advisable that the
amount of money in circulation be reduced
by taxation and that part of it be used for
defence. What good would our money be
unless we are free? Let us ask enslaved
nations what they would be willing to pay
to escape from their bondage! There has
been criticism of budget surpluses. Did not
the Minister of Finance act wisely in using
our surpluses to reduce our national debt?
By savings. Thrift, at this time, has
become a patriotic duty. The government
urges individuals and corporations to subscribe generously to its loans and to entrust it
with their savings. Some, who remember the
experience of the last war, advocate the
re-establishment of controls. But there have
been great changes in the situation. Since
1939, the amount of money in circulation has
increased almost tenfold. If the last war had
gone on for another year, it would have
been hard, for that same reason, to keep
controls in force. As far back as 1943, rising
costs made it necessary to allow certain
producers to lower the quality of their
products. Price ceilings were maintained, but
consumers received less for their money. And
what about the black market? No, as the
Prime Minister so aptly pointed out in his
speeches in parliament and in his radio broadcasts, the reimposition of controls today would
do more harm than good.
Like yourselves, I have read and noted, the
speeches of our political opponents and the
editorials published in certain newsp5apers
violently attacking the Government because
it has not reimposed controls. It is amusing
to reread what those same people were saying and writing not so long ago. If we
glance through the Commons Hansard, we will
note the fiery speeches delivered by certain
members of the Opposition who clamoured
for the abolition of controls. For instance,
on page 1297 of the debates of March 12,
1947, Mr. John Hackett, K.C., then member
for Stanstead said:
Another form of control which is particularly
burdensome is the war-time prices and trade board.

Comparing the situation at that time with
that of 1920, he added:
We did go through a short period of turbulence,
but we escaped the clutches of all these controls!

Were I not reluctant to overtax your
patience, I could quote many speeches in the
same vein. And yet those same people criticize us today for not reimposing the very
controls which they found so evil not so long
ago!
To sum up, the first remedy for inflation
is to reduce the amount of money in circulation. The second is to encourage savings,
and moderation in buying. The third is to

SENATE
promote greater production per hour of labour
and to increase hours of work without additional pay. The interests of the worker, of
the employers and of the general public alike
are at stake. If prices go up it is because
there are not enough goods to go around. Let
us, therefore, increase production without
increasing the demand by putting more money
into circulation. If we all use these three
means on a broad enough scale, inflation will
halt, the value of our currency and the cost
of living will be stabilized.
I come now to social legislation.
The fundamental principle of liberalism is
to unfetter the individual; to help him overcome the obstacles which prevent him from
reaching a comparative degree of well-being
and of earthly happiness, objects of his
legitimate ambition. I view with a great
deal of gratification the progress accomplished for more than thirty years by the
party in which I have served as a humble
worker, as a humble soldier in the ranks.
Our great leaders, the Right Honourable W.
L. Mackenzie King and the Right Honourable
Louis St. Laurent, were deeply convinced that
social injustice is inhuman, evil and immoral.
They have always preached and applied the
same creed; they have always endeavoured
to improve the living conditions of all classes
and to relieve distress.
We all of us have sought to help our
fellow men acquire more wealth and greater
well-being. We have endeavoured to ensure
a fair.er distribution of goods and to abolish
privileges.
From the standpoint of culture and civilization, scientific discoveries and economic
progress are of value only if supported by a
social policy based on distributive justice.
Modern progress does not consist in creating
a race of slaves and of automatons, as in
Russia. It consists in dispelling fear, in
ensuring the respect and freedom of the
human being. There is still much human
misery in many countries, but in Canada
wise legislation has already given us a notable increase in material welfare.
Let us remember too, that Canada has
striven at the same time, to share substantially in the settlement of world problems.
If, without foreign assistance, we have been
able to go through two world wars, a worldwide depression and the still lasting period
of retrenchment and sacrifice, we owe it to
our leaders who have managed to preserve
our people from scourges which, elsewhere,
assail humanity. They had faith in the lofty
destiny of Canada. Above all they endeavoured to apply the principles of social justice
through a wider distribution of the wealth
of this world.

I will now enumerate here social security

a federal measure. The number to benefit in
first year more than 700,000; annual cost for
the same year is estimated at $343 million.
I should like now to refer to national
defence.
The Canadian people are a happy people.
Compare them with other people on earth
and tell me which nation we could envy. Our
vast territory is protected on three sides by
oceans, bounded on the south by the most
powerful republic in the world. Unlike what
is happening elsewhere, instead of being
dangerous and disquieting, this neighbourhood is a factor of security. For close to 150
years we have been living at peace with our
neighbours and on neither side is our boundary, four thousand miles in length, fortified
or guarded. Evidently, at times, this neighbourhood causes difficult problems between
us but we study them in a spirit of understanding and justice, and we abide by the
decisions of our international commissions.
In two world wars our sons, fighting side by
side, have shed their blood on the same
battlefields for the defence of the same cause.

This has further increased and strengthened
the friendly understanding which bas long
existed between our two nations.
We are constantly uncovering new wealth
in our soil, though yet its surface has barely
been scratched. Our yearly production runs
into billions of dollars and far exceeds our
actual needs. Because of the volume of our
export trade, we have achieved quite a high
standing among the great nations of the
world.
The Canadian people owe their origin
mainly to two races which, since the beginning of the Christian era, have brought the
greatest amount of credit to mankind. They
are still receiving contributions from all the
countries of Europe. We therefore benefit
from European culture, Greco-latin culture,
enriched by twenty centuries of Christianity.
We enjoy a large measure of political and
religious freedom and our parliamentary
institutions are a source of content for our
peaceful and disciplined people. If an example
were needed of the harmony that exists in
Canada, would it not suffice to recall that,
since the beginning of the present century,
two French Canadian Catholics have been
elected Prime Ministers of this country by
English-Protestant majorities: Sir Wilfrid
Laurier and our present Prime Minister, the
Right Honourable L. S. St. Laurent. Again
I say the Canadian people are a happy, free
and united people.
They are also a generous people. When
the liberties and the way of life of the
western world were threatened by unjust
aggression Canadians, upon being called,
answered: "Ready, aye ready!" Immediately
they raised forces and rushed to the assistance of our mother countries: both the old
and the new. This very day, some of our
soldiers are fighting in Korea; while others
are stationed in Europe. This Canadian
generosity was very graciously emphasized,
the other day, by our charming Princess
when she said: "By dedicating yourselves to
righting wrongs and errors in far off lands,
you have set yourselves up as the knights
errant of our present tragic world". A true
and very apt phrase, well depicting the feeling which has guided Canadian policy,
especially since Canada's part in international
affairs has taken so much importance.
But this abundance of wealth which I have
mentioned, this liberty, this political stability,
this culture, these ways of life, these institutions, in short, this national heritage we owe
to divine Providence and to our ancestors, all
this is now seriously imperilled.

ZENATE
for a lasting peace, for sincere co-operation
between the nations of the world. It seemed
evident that countries that had co-operated
in time of war could and should co-operate
all the more in ensuring world peace. To
this end was created the United Nations
Organization.
Unfortunately, these hopes
were unfulfilled. Stricken with megalomania,
those groups which, by revolution and
violence, had enslaved the Russian people,
dreamt, and still dream today of extending
their domination over all nations. Instead of
peace based on freedom, independence and
equality of all nations, on a policy of noninterference in the domestie affairs of other
States and on effective limitation of armaments, these groups now seek to establish
their rule over the whole world.
For a long time, their system of espionage
and infiltration, cleverly directed from
Moscow, has successfully penetrated all
western
countries,
fostered
uneasiness,
strikes and revolts, sabotaged political and
social institutions, and caused the masses to
rise against their governments. The examples
of Bulgaria, Rumania, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia and Poland clearly demonsitrate the
promptness with which the communist hordes
can carry out their designs of economic and
political subjugation. Communist ideologists
proclaim as obsolete the concepts of national
sovereignty and independence; they urge the
creation of a world State, of a world government, according to the Soviet formula,
and, naturally, under the domination of
Moscow.
Whenever a country falls into their hands,
their first thought is to "liquidate" the leading classes and all those whose views do not
coincide with their own. Remember the
trumped up political trials, the tortures, the
concentration camps, Siberia! Fifteen million
human beings, we are told, have been torn
from their homes, have died from privation
or tortures or are ending their lives in exile!
By such results, you may judge the value
and form of their civilization. Yet, both in
the United States and in Canada, thousands
of people would like their country to adopt
such a regime!
It was in order to resist that enslavement
that the western nations decided to unite in
order to organize their common defence. No
doubt, that means bitter self-denials and
heavy sacrifices for all. But, without this
community of free nations, without this
defensive alliance, unity of action would be
impossible; we could not overcome the
aggression with which we are threatened by
certain totalitarian and tyrannical powers.

(Translation):
War is a great ordeal. It is the scourge of
God. Just as gold can only be purified by
fire, so humanity .can be purified only in the
crucible of suffering. When prosperity is
too great and too prolonged, morals decline
and characters weaken.
The record of
humanity shows it.
At certain times,
humanity seems to forget to kneel before its
Creator, to implore His clemency, His mercy
and His forgiveness. God is a Father, the
best of fathers. He castigates well because
He loves well, but He does not spurn the
contrite and repentant sinner. That is what
is being preached to us by our spiritual
leaders, who are at this moment making
urgent appeals. Let us turn to God! Let us
rearm morally! If our conversion is sincere
and sufficiently embracing, God in His kindness will perhaps divert from humanity a
new cataclysm so dreadful that the one
caused by the two world wars would pale in
comparison.
But it is also written "Heaven helps those
who help themselves". Let us respond with
the same alacrity to the appeals made by a
government that we have elected in all liberty
to look after the sacred interests of the
Canadian homeland.

SENATE
THE SENATE AND ITS WORK
MOTION
Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson: Honourable

senators, with leave of the Senate, I should

like to move:

That the Rules of the Senate be amended by
striking out paragraphs 5, 17 and 19 of Rule 78 and
substituting the following:
5. The Committee on Transport and Communications, composed of not more than seventeen senators.
17. The Committee on Finance, composed of not
more than seventeen senators.
19. The Committee on External Relations, composed of not more than seventeen senators.
And by adding a new Rule 78A, as follows:
78A. The senators occupying the positions of
Leader of the Government and Leader of the
Opposition in the Senate shall be ex officio members of all Standing Committees of the Senate.

As honourable senators know, any motion
to amend our rules requires two days' notice.
Therefore, unless I have unanimous consent,
I cannot proceed now. I have already communicated to a large and representative crosssection of members of the Senate my reasons
for proposing these changes in our rules, and
I should like to have permission to give an
explanation to ail who are present at this
time.
The Hon.

the

Speaker: Honourable sena-

tors, is it your pleasure that the honourable
gentleman have permission to speak on this
motion, of which notice has not been given?
Some Hon. Senators: Agreed.
The Hon. the Speaker: The

honourable

gentleman may proceed.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators
may recall that last year I moved the following motion:

That a Special Committee of the Senate be
appointed to inquire into, and report upon, whatever action in its opinion may be necesary or
expedient to enable the Senate to make its maximum contribution to the welfare of the Canadian
people.

It will be recalled that after considerable
debate I withdrew the motion and at that
time indicated that I might have some proposals to make in the matter at this session.
I have already been asked about it, and I
wish to say now that I intend to proceed with
the part of the proposal that I had in mind
last session which has not already been deaIt
with by the Senate.
Let me explain. When I introduced the
resolution last session I made some personal

suggestions as to some things that I thought
might be inquired into by a committee, if
honourable members were agreeable. Those
things might be roughly divided into two
classes: One, things as to which we ourselves
could take action in committee; and the other,

things that we might recommend to the government. I think it is safe to say that there
was general agreement by honourable members that a special committee was not necessary to consider my motion; that whatever
discussion there was could be had in this
house. I think it is safe to say also that the
discussion we had in the house was chiefly
on two or three of the major points that I had
suggested might be considered in committee,
concerning proposals which would require
action by the government, and which we ourselves could not put into effect. For instance,
as honourable senators may recall. one of
my suggestions was that the special committee might consider recommending that
future appointments to the Senate be subject
to a retiring age of seventy-five. Another
suggestion was that the committee might
consider recommending some procedure for
Senate appointments that would assure our
always having in the Senate at least a minimum representation of political parties other
than the major parties.
Varying views were expressed with regard
to those matters, but it is my considered
opinion that even if we had been unanimous
about them we could have done nothing more
than make recommendations to the government. The views that were expressed are
on record and available to this government
or any future government which in its wisdom may see fit to pay heed to them. I therefore cannot see that any useful purpose would
be served by further discussion on my proposal of last session to create a special committee for the consideration of these matters.
So at this time I wish to direct my attention
to suggestions that it is within our power
to implement for perfecting our organization
and enabling the Senate to render greater
service to the public.
Since I have been a member of the Senate.
and particularly while I have occupied the
post of government leader in this house, I
have been struck by one or two outstanding
facts. The first of these is that we are greatly
handicapped by having major legislation come
over to us from the other house late in the
session. In an endeavour to reduce that
handicap I have tried to have as much legislation as possible introduced in the Senate,
and I have been reasonably successful in this.
In the main, however, aside from measures
that have no financial incidence, the important pieces of legislation are introduced to
parliament in the House of Commons, and do
not reach us until relatively late in the session. The bill that we ordinarily receive
last of all every session, the Supply Bill, is

OCTOBER 16, 1951
sometimes in our hands, as honourable senators know, not more than an hour or even
half an hour before parliament is due to
prorogue.
Ever since I have been leader of the government I have been faced with the contention that this house is not given sufficient time to consider important measures,
including bills that could not be classified as
money bills. I think that in one respect we
have overcome the handicap under which the
Senate formerly laboured. I refer to the
reference of the estimates at the last session
or two to our Finance Committee, before
the bills based on those estimates have
reached this house. Honourable senators
know full well that this committee has done
such excellent work that when we have got
the Supply Bills we have found ourselves
thoroughly acquainted with their details.
Honourable senators, the suggestion I now
wish to make to you, and which is embodied
in the motion, is that this principle of dealing
with legislative measures in anticipation,
whch we have applied to Supply Bills, be
extended to other major pieces of legislation
that we are forewarned of in the Speech
from the Throne. Too often we have no
opportunity for studying measures of this
kind until the very last part of the session.
I am suggesting that, in order to provide the
necessary machinery, we change the size of
and our procedure with respect to six of our
committees. The standing committees which
I would propose changing are the following:
Transport and Communications, Finance,
External Relations, Natural Resources, Canadian Trade Relations and Immigration and
Labour. I would leave as they are the
committees on the Library, Printing and the
Restaurant, Standing Orders, Banking and
Commerce, Misoellaneous Private Bills, Internal Economy and Contingent Accounts,
Tourist Traffic, Debates and Reporting,
Divorce, Public Health and Welfare, Civil
Service Administration of Public Buildings
and Grounds.
I would suggest that for the present my
motion apply to only three committees. If
the new system is satisfactory, when the
house sees fit, the other three committees
may be included.
The memberships of certain committees
have varied from time to time, ranging from
a high of fifty to a low of nine. When I
came to this house three of its standing committees, namely, those on Canadian Trade
Relations, Natural Resources, and Immigration and Labour, each had a membership of
nine. I suggest that ultimately the six committees which I have specified should each
have a maximum membership of seventeen,
and that no one senator be appointed to more

than one of these committees. In that way
seventeen senators will have the responsibility for the consideration of matters
referred to any one of these committees.
Exceptions would be made in the case of the
leader of the government in the Senate and
the leader opposite, both of whom would be
ex officio members of the committees. Honourable senators may recall that the membership in some of the committees was increased
at my suggestion. It is, however, my belief
that they have, in some instances, become
unwieldy.
If honourable senators agree to try out
the proposals I have put forward, I assure
the house that the changes will not necessarily
be like the law of the Medes and Persians,
which altereth not and cannot be recalled. In
my opinion, the proposals have some merit,
and, indeed, none of the senators with whom
I discussed them had any serious objection.
I suggest that tomorrow morning we proceed to select the membership of the committees. True, the selection committee may
not be able to make appointments that will
be entirely satisfactory; nevertheless, such
changes as appear necessary can be made
later. Having set up the committees they
should be organized, and a chairman elected
to each.
After having consulted with these three
committees to which I have made specific
reference, I intend on Thursday next to
refer certain important subjects which will
be coming to us in the near future. To the
Transport and Communications Committee,
I propose to refer the report of the Royal
Commission on Transportation. That means
that the four pieces of legislation having to
do with railways will be considered and
studied by that committee. I need hardly
say to honourable senators how perplexing
and difficult is the problem of equalizing
freight rates in Canada.
It is indeed a difficult problem, and has farreaching consequences. I intend, therefore, to
ask the Standing Committee on Transport and
Communications to study, at its leisure, all
the aspects of the legislation, and to report
back to this house as to whether or not we
should place on the legislation our seal of
approval. I submit, honourable senators, that
in following this method we would be following the system adopted for the study of the
estimates prior to their arrival in this house.
Further, I propose to refer to the Standing
Committee on External Relations, subject to
consultation with that committee when it is
set up, the bill which has been introduced
having to do with the sending of Canadian
troops overseas under NATO. This committee will be asked to study the question and

SENATE

report back to this house. I need hardly say
that the sending of troops overseas in peacetime is a new procedure for Canada. Although
such a step may meet with the general
approval of the Canadian people, it is an
important one, as was so eloquently stated by
the seconder of the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne (Hon. Mr. Wood),
and will have far-reaching consequences.
I am sure all honourable senators would
wish that the excellent services of the Finance
Committee be continued. We are unable to
refer the estimates to that committee at the
present moment for, as far as I know, there
will be no estimates before the house. We are
fortunate, however, in having the Public
Accounts for the past year printed. I shall
table these, and suggest that they be referred
to the Finance Committee, with perhaps some
specific recommendations as to the matters to
be inquired into and reported upon.
While I cannot assure the house of the
complete success of this new procedure, it will
at least be an answer to two problems
presented to me: first, that we should have
more time to consider and study legislation;
and second, that the fifty-one members
nominated to the three committees will have
something for which I have been continually
asked, namely, more work. I have every
reason to believe that there will be considerable opportunity for work by the three committees.
It has been my experience in the Senate,
that whenever a standing committee or a
special committee undertook to do a job, it
was well done. As I approach the reference
of the subjects I have mentioned to the committees specified I have every confidence that
the work performed will be of the same high
quality as the work of the committees of this
house in the past.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members, I
will not delay the house for more than a few
moments.
My friend from Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte)
just asked me whether a senator would serve
on only one committee. The answer is "no".
Apart from the six committees which the
honourable leader has specified, the other
standing committees namely Banking and
Commerce, Private Bills, Internal Economy,
Debates and Reporting, Divorce, Restaurant,
Civil Service Administration, Public Health
and Welfare, Public Buildings and Grounds,
and Tourist Traffic will all remain as they
were, and members will be appointed to them
in the usual manner.
The honourable leader of the government
said, there would be coming to this house
four pieces of legislation affecting railways

and based on the report of the Royal Commission on Transportation. As I understand
the procedure proposed, following some preliminary discussion in the other bouse these
pieces of legislation will be referred to the
Standing Committee on Transportation in this
house, before which all delegates who wish to
make representations may appear. I understand that the government leader (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) is quite willing that any or all of
the seventeen members on the committee on
transportation should attend meetings of the
like committee in the other place, listen to its
proceedings, take part if they want to.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: -and
examine witnesses.
Hon. Mr. King: That is in accordance with
the present rule. There is nothing new about
that.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I explain to my
honourable friend from Kootenay East (Hon.
Mr. King) that I was answering a question,
and trying to avoid any misunderstanding.
He and I had the pleasure of attending the
sessions of the Committee on Transportation,
and we know what went on there. What I am
saying is for the information of those who
were not present at those meetings. I hope
there will be no misapprehensions, because
the experiment is worth trying, and I should
like the bouse to be unanimously in favour
of it. When the four bills dealing with railway
matters come here from the other place,
they will, of course, be introduced, receive
first and second readings, and go to our
Transportation and Communications Committee. My suggestion, which I believe is
acceptable to all members of the house, is
that when bills of this type are reported back
from committee they should be referred to
Committee of the Whole House. One difficulty
about this has been that it is practically
impossible for one minister, even with the
assistance on occasion of deputy ministers,
to cope with the details of all legislation
sponsored by , some nineteen ministers in
another place. The railway bills, however,
could be dealt with by a committec of seventeen members who know the subject-matter,
who have discussed the bills, examined the
witnesses, and therefore are fully informed;
and those honourable senators who, not being
members of the committee, might lack information as to this legislation could address
questions to their colleagues who are members
of the committee.
Such a system would provide, what
hitherto has been sorely lacking, a public,
informed discussion of legislation. It is true
that we discuss bills in committee, but nobody
knows about it except the members of the
committee themselves. If the discussion is

OCTOBER 16, 1951
carried on in the house, members of the committee will show, or should be able te show,
that they know their subject, and those who
are not on the committtee will gain an understanding of the subject which they have
never had since I have been a member of
this house. Speaking only for myself, I think
the suggestion is worth trying. It rmay not
work. I recall a rule which was made some
years ago, and to which I was bitterly
opposed, which was never acted on, and has
since disappeared. It may be that the present
proposal, after a two or three year period of
trial, will prove unworkable. Well, then,
surely we are big enough and our work is
important enough and the problem is large
enough for us to adopt some other system
which will better serve our purpose.
I do not favour this change merely for the
sake of change. I am in faveur of it because
the Senate will be better informed about
important legislation before it is brought into
the house, and our committee having made a
full examination of a particular bill, will be
better able to advise the rest of us and,
incidentally serve the public without regard,
I hope and trust, to any bias on political or
other grounds.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask my honourable
friend a question, which could be more readily
answered, perhaps, by the leader of the government? I want to get the matter clear
in my mind. I think the honourable leader
of the opposition made the statement that
when railway bills go before the House of
Commons they are referred te a committee
of that house. That, of course, is se. But I
understood him also te say that members of
the Senate committee may appear in the
committee of the House of Commons, ask
questions and examine witnesses. Is that the
fact? I doubt it very much.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think that the government
leader should answer that.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Members of a Senate
committee cannot take part, except by invitation, in the proceedings of committees of
the other house. But there is precedent for
such an invitation. In 1940-I believe, in
August-when I was net a member of this
house, the Unemployment Insurance Bill was
introduced in the other place. It was referred
te a committee of that house. That committee invited members of the Senate te attend
its sessions, te discuss the subject, te crossexamine witnesses, but net, of course, te
vote. That is the incident which I believe
the honourable leader of the opposition had in
mind. I am sure that, if a committee of this
house desires te participate an invitation
could be obtained from the committee in the
other place, addressed either te members of

our committee or, as was the case in 1940,
te all members of the Senate. I repeat,
however, that such participation would be
only upon invitation, and would net entitle
our members te vote.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Referring te a point which
arose today in conversation with one of the
honourable senators from Newfoundland, may
I say that nothing in this suggested procedure
will take one iota of authority from this house.
A bill will come here from the other place,
as heretofore, for first reading; it will come
before us for second reading; it can be sent
te whatever committee this house chooses
te send it te, and I hope, if it relates te
railways it will be remitted te this Transportation Committee. The committee will
proceed to hear witnesses and will call for
all such evidence as its members require.
When it is reported back te this house, instead
of immediately receiving third reading, as
has been customary in the past, it would go
te Committee of the Whole and be the subject of a thorough discussion.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I fully understand that the
bill would come te this house, go te committee, and be afterwards returned te this
chamber. What struck me as rather peculiar
was that members of our committee would
be entitled te go before a committee of
the House of Commons, ask questions and
elicit evidence. It is a natural course, and one
te which I suppose no member of the House
of Commons would object, for any honourable
senator te go te a meeting of a committee of
the other place and listen te the evidence and
proceedings; but that he or any member of
our committees should take part in all activities of that committee in the other place,
except for voting, is almost unprecedented. I
hope it is so.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I happen te have in
mind this particular incident, because it was
mentioned te me, and I had the Clerk look
up the facts. A specific invitation, net fror
the House of Commons but from its committee, was extended te members of the
Senate te participate in the proceedings. Net
many honourable senators attended. I think
there were five of them at the first meeting
and seven or eight at two subsequent meetings. One of them was the honourable senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden), who took a
leading part in the examination of witnesses.
Of course he did net vote. But, as I have
said, our colleagues were present by
invitation.
Hon. Mr. King: I do net wish te hinder or
delay the adoption of the proposal. I concur
largely in the remarks of the government
leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson) and sympathize
with him in his desire te enable the members

SENATE

to find useful employment and his suggestion
that committees be appointed to go into
session and make inquiries into rnatters that
are before parliarnent. But I wonder why at
this, our first meeting, we should be asked to

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Perhaps I may make

from the opening of this session I have had in
rnid the question of what ta do about the
sittings of the Senate. 1 have no legisiation

probable that a short time will elapse before

my honourable friend, at which we discussed
the best procedure to follow. I had thought
we would carry on until Friday with the
dcbate on the Address in reply to the Speech

f rom the Throne, and then I intended to move
an adjournrnent for perhaps two weeks. It
was my desire to implernent my motion by
Friday so that those members who will be
here during the adjournment, and who are
able to forrn a quorum, could function. In
view o! what my honourable friend has said,
however, I shall not be able to make my
motion until Thursday.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The honourable senator

Prayers and routine proceedings.
COMMITTEE OF SELECTION
FIRST REPORT
Hon. A. K. Hugessen presented and moved
concurrence in the report of the Committee
of Selection.
He said: Honourable senators, before I
submit the first report of the Committee of
Selection there are a few words of explanation that I should offer the house.
Your committee met this morning, but we
were faced with this difficulty, that there is
on the Order Paper for consideration by the
Senate this afternoon a resolution with reference to three of the standing committees
of the Senate, and this resolution, if passed,
will very considerably alter the numbers of
members of these committees. I refer to the
Committee on Transport and Communications, the Committee on Finance, and the
Your
Committee on External Relations.
Selection Committee felt, therefore, that we
could not properly make recommendations
with reference to these three committees
until the Senate has dealt with the resolution moved by the honourable leader (Hon.
Mr. Robertson). This interim report, therefore, deals only with the remaining standing
committees and joint committees of the
Senate, except for the Committee on Divorce.
In our view, as no private legislation is to
be introduced during this session, it is
unnecessary to constitute the Committee on
Divorce for the current session.
I understand that the honourable leader
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) is going to suggest, when
this resolution which stands in his name has
been considered this afternoon, and after the
Order Paper has been concluded, that the
Senate adjourn during pleasure so that the
Committee of Selection may meet again and
report to the house with respect to the three
committees that to now have been excluded.
This will depend, of course, upon the action
which the Senate chooses to take upon his
motion. I hope that we shall be in a position before very long to submit recommendations to the Senate with respect to the membership of these three committees.
There are two other matters which perhaps
I ought to mention. In making our recommendations with respect to the various standing committees we have taken into consideration the suggestion contained in the leader's
94703-3

resolution, that the leader of the government
in the Senate and the leader opposite should
be ipso facto members of all standing committees. We have therefore struck their
names from the membership lists of the committees of which they were members last
year.
Hon. Mr. King: Are they not members of all
committees now?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I do not think so.
Hon. Mr. King: That has been the practice.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: It may have been the
practice, but it is certainly not a rule of the
Senate. The motion of the honourable leader
would make it a rule. The fact is that after
having removed the names of the two leaders,
and because of deaths and for other reasons,
there are quite a number of vacancies in
certain of the committees. I am going to take
the liberty of reading the names of the members suggested for each standing committee,
and indicate the number of vacancies in
each, so that any honourable senator who feels
that he would like to serve on a committee of
which he is not at present a member, may
have the opportunity of making representations and having his name added. At the
conclusion of the reading of these names, I
propose formally to move the adoption of the
report, but I would not ask the Senate to
adopt the report this afternoon. I would ask
one of my honourable friends to move the
adjournment of the debate, so that the Senate
will have a chance to look over the lists of
names between now and the next sitting, so
that we can give final consideration to the
report then.
The report is as follows:
The Committee of Selection appointed to nominate
senators to serve on the several standing committees
for the present session, have the honour to report

them to serve on certain of the standing committees, namely:

THE SENATE AND

ITS WORK

MOTION TO AMEND THE RULES

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Robertson:
That the Rules of the Senate be amended by
striking out paragraphs 5, 17 and 19 of Rule 78
and substituting therefor the following:

OCTOBER 17, 1951
"5. The Committee on Transport and Communications, composed of not more than seventeen
Senators.
17. The Committee on Finance, composed of not
more than seventeen Senators.
19. The Committee on External Relations, composed of not more than seventeen Senators."
And by adding a new Rule 78A, as follows:
"78A. The Senators occupying the positions of
Leader of the Government and Leader cf the
Opposition in the Senate shall be ex officio members
of all Standing Committees of the Senate."

Hon. J. H. King: Honourable senators, when
I rose last night during the debate on this
motion I tried to make it clear that it was
not my intention particularly, to delay the
matter before us, but rather to take exception
to an attempt at the opening of the session
to set aside one of the most important rules
of the Senate-the rule which requires two
days' notice of a motion to amend the rules.
I thought it rather unwise to proceed unless
we understood exactly what was involved,
and I therefore moved the adjournment of
the debate. From my own experience here I
know that a motion of this kind is very rare;
if my memory serves me, it is usually moved
a short time before the prorogation of Parliament. The leader of the government then
gives two-days' notice that the rules are te
be amended se that government business may
have precedence over private business. That
is a proceeding with which we are all
familiar, but I have not known this kind of
motion te be presented as early in the
session as this one has been.
I repeat that it is net my intention te delay
action in this matter. I am in full sympathy
with what has been suggested by the leaders;
I concur in it; I understand it is the result of
consultations among various members, representative of the entire chamber. Nevertheless,
I thought it fitting te bring te the attention of the house the point that the rule with
respect te notice should be abrogated only
under great stress of necessity. Two days'
notice is net too much te ask in respect of a
change of the rules of the Senate. I have
nothing further te say: I concur in the motion.
Hon. Saller A. Hayden: Honourable senators, I have no definite views as te whether
the numbers of the three committees mentioned in this resolution should remain as at
present, or should be reduced te seventeen
each. Several years ago we thought it advisable, for the purpose of giving more representation to the membership of the Senate,
te increase the numbers of members on these
committees, and the three committees which
are particularized in the motion were
enlarged se that at the present time there
are fifty members of the Finance Committee,
fifty of the Transportation and Communications Committee, and thirty-five of the
94703-3j

External Affairs Committee. For the two firstnamed committees the quorum established
at the beginning of each session was, I
believe, nine: what it was for the Committee
on External Relations I do not recall. But
the size of the quorum is a matter for the
committee to establish each session, at its
first meeting after its constitution. As I have
said, three years ago we thought that the
larger numbers would enable more members
to participate in the hearing of evidence and
in discussions, so that more senators would
be informed on the details of the subjectmatters inquired into. The fact that this resolution is now before us forces the conclusion
that the change has not worked out in
accordance with expectations; that information obtained in the committees did not percolate down to all members, as it was hoped
it might; and it is now supposed that these
committees will be more workable if their
numbers are reduced to seventeen each.
As far as my view goes, I cannot see how
committees can be made more workable and
more efficient with a membership of seventeen than with a membership of from forty
to fifty. I think there is a possibility that
with the larger membership, and more
honourable senators having the right to
attend, sit at the table, and enter into discussions, more will in fact attend, feeling it
their duty to be there, and that consequently
more will be informed of what goes on.
However, whether the numbers on a committee be seventeen or fifty, it will require
the will and the effort of all its members to
make it function well. As far as I am concerned, I am satisfied with the work of these
committees in the past three years. They
have done a good job, whether their numbers
fell to a bare quorum or there was an
attendance of 95 per cent; and I believe that,
whether the membership is reduced to seventeen or not, this record will persist.
My reason in rising today has nothing to
do wiýth the inherent right of the Senate te
change its rules and to reduce or increase
the number of the members to be assigned te
committees. My purpose in speaking is to deal
with some of the reasons which were given
by the leader of the government and the
leader of the opposition in support of this
resolution. The leader of the government
thought that as a result of his motion the
Senate committees would get more work,
and that this would result in more work
for the Senate itself. My honourable friend
the leader of the opposition thought that
this new system would provide what has
hitherto been sorely lacking, namely, a publicinforming discussion of legislation. The leader
opposite also thought that senators would

SENATE
be better informed about important legislation
before it was brought into this bouse, because
it would first be fully inquired into in
committee.
What I desire to point out is that the
recommendations which have been made in
support of this resolution could equally well
be made whether the committee is comprised
of seventeen, twenty-five, forty, fifty, or the
entire membership of the Senate. Everything
depends, first, on whether or not the subject
matter to be considered is referred to a committee. Secondly, the benefit to be derived
is dependent, not on the size of the committee, but its capacity and the effort it puts into
its study. As a matter fact, I feel that if a
committee has only seventeen members, with
,a quorum of five or seven, there might be
some feeling of frustration on the part of
witnesses summoned to appear before it. They
may say "The Senate feels that a committee
of five or seven is sufficient to consider these
important matters which may be the foundation for legislation". How are senators going
to be better informed because committees are
smaller?
They can only be better informed
if, as happens at the present time, a bill is
reported back to the bouse and opportunity
is given for debate. The present procedure
allows ample opportunity for discussion, so
that everything which has been elicited in
committee may be brought forward and discussed in the house. In this way, any
honourable senator may acquire information
that has been developed in committee.
So far as the lack of information in the
Senate is concerned, I feel that honourable
senators who have explained legislation in
this house have given a full and fair development of the subject matter under discussion.
There bas always been considerable catechizing of the person explaining legislation. Why
has it been introduced? Why does it have to
go as far as it does? Such questions can be
unlimited, the only limit being in the ability
of the person explaining to answer them.
As I have said, I have no fixed view as to
the numbers who should serve on the various
committees. That is entirely a matter for
the majority of senators to decide. It may be
fifteen, seventeen, twenty-one or fifty. I am
impelled, however, to speak earnestly about
the reason stated for reducing the committees,
namely, that it will enable senators to become
better informed and will overcome the present lack in getting enough information to
senators when dealing with legislation that
comes before them in this chamber. In my
opinion that assertion is 100 per cent wrong.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators, it
was not my intention to take part in this

debate, but after listening to the remarks
of the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden) I feel that I should say something at this time. I am not the sponsor of
this motion, of course, but I support it. Many
of the statements which have just been made
could be applied contrariwise. I have not
been a member of the Senate for very long,
but I think I have done my fair share of committee work, and I have been very glad to
do it.
I have done much committee work since
first coming to parliament in 1930, and I do
not agree with the remarks the honourable
senator from Toronto has made about witnesses being summoned before small committees of five or seven members. I have sat
in at meetings of Senate committees where
the membership has been fifty, and I have
seen witnesses speaking to only seven members. I always wondered where the rest of
the members were. Therefore, so far as
that part of my friend's argument is concerned, it works both ways.
This is the way I understood the remarks
of the leader of the government, and the
remarks made in committee before the Senate met. The suggestion was made that legislation forecast in the Speech from the Throne
would be sent to these three committees,
and that they would do something which has
not been done before-they would find out
the complete particulars of the legislation
before the bill came to this house, which is
not the case now. Then, when the bill was
referred to committee and reported back to
the Senate, there would be six or seven
senators, who had been on the committee
who would be in a position to answer any
questions about it. It was suggested also
that when legislation is reported back to this
house the Senate will sit in Committee of
the Whole in full view of the public and the
Press Gallery. In this way they will know
that we are really earnest in our efforts to
thoroughly examine legislation that comes
before us. If I am wrong in my understanding of this motion, I should like to be put
straight. For the reasons I have given, and
others, I intend to vote for the motion
presented by the leader of the government.
Hon. Norman P. Lamberi: Honourable
senators, I am sorry I did not hear the discussion on this motion yesterday, but I have
read the report of the debate in Hansard.
I should like to point out that Rule 5,
which it is proposed to change, has reference
to the Committee on Transport and Communications, which has a membership of
fifty. The history of this committee has been
very different from that of some of the other

OCTOBER 17, 1951
standing committees in question. I think
that the Committee on Transport and Communications and the Committee on Banking
and Commerce have been identified with
some of the most important legislation which
has been brought before parliament during
many years past. The outstanding feature
of my first session in the Senate, 1938, was
the handling of the Transport Bill by the
Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs, and Harbours, as it was then known.
The work of that committee had a great deal
to do with the final outcome of that matter.
As to the relationship of the provinces to
these very important national matters, I do
not need to refer senators back farther than
to 1903, when the Railway Act came into
existence; or to 1922, when there was a very
important development over the Crowsnest
Pass Agreement. I think that the Turgeon
Report, with its recommendation for zonal
rates and the possibility of completely changing transportation economics in this country,
introduces once more that feature of provincial concern in whatever action we may
take. It seems to me that to reduce the
number of members of the Transport and
Communications Committee at this time
would be to suggest very definitely that the
Senate is relinquishing its active interest in
the very important subject-matter that has
been assigned to this committee in the past.
I have no objection at all to the proposed
reduction in membership of the other two
committees-the Committee on Finance and
the Committee on External Relations-because
I do not think that they are in the same class
at ail as the Transport Committee, from the
point of view of subject-matter or of historical record.
As to the bill which will be brought down,
first in the other house, to implement the
Turgeon Report, I regret very much that the
government, which is responsible for the
procedure in parliament as a whole, could
not have seen its way clear ýto refer the
matter to a joint committee before bringing down the bill. That could have been
easily done. This proposed amendment of
the Railway Act to make it fit in with recommendations of the Turgeon Report will be,
I suppose, the most far-reaching and vital
measure that the representatives in parliament
have had to deal with for many a year, and I
think that for the purpose of keeping public
opinion informed on the matter we should
have proceeded through a joint committee.
The Turgeon Commission, which held sittings
over a period of nearly three years, followed
court practice with respect to the presentation of material to it. That is, only lawyers
were allowed to appear before the commission.
Agricultural, labour, manufacturers and other

organizations. for instance, were not permitted to make representations except through
It is no secret that that prolegal counsel.
cedure created a certain difference of opinion
while the commission was sitting. My point
is that full opportunity should now be given
to all sections of the country to present their
views and suggestions on the Turgeon Report
to a committee comprising representatives of
both houses. I say it is particularly important
that the Senate, because of its historical connection with the development of transport
legislation in this country, should be represented on the committee.
One other matter that has come into my
mind while I have been thinking about the
work of the Transport Committee is the prospect of establishing a new and larger field
for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
While no bill has so far been brought down
to deal with the subject, we have at least
the prospect of mass communications. In the
past the jurisdiction of the Board of Transport
Commissioners in matters of communication
has been limited largely to telegraphs, but I
am assuming that whatever development is
undertaken in radio and television will come
under the head of mass communications, and
may be-of course, I do not know whether
it will be-brought under the jurisdiction of
the Transport Board. That is something about
which we can express an opinion when the
legislation comes before us. I wish to say
now that I do think our Committee on
Transport and Communications should deal
with this whole question of radio and television.
And here again I feel that, having in mind
the public reaction to these things, the government would be greatly benefited if a joint
committee of both houses were to consider
the question. We all know something of what
is involved in this-a suggestion of a larger
and more extensively subsidized form of communications through the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation; but I do not believe that the
people of the country have begun to appreciate all that is involved in the setting up of
a tremendous state organization in this field.
There is of course already a state organization for broadcasting, but the proposal is to
add to its powers over television and radio
communications. Nothing but good would
have resulted from the appointment of a joint
committee, where public reactions to the
government's proposals could have been
studied.
I have made these remarks in an endeavour to emphasize the distinction that I see
between the Committee on Transport and
Communications and the other two committees mentioned in the motion. My suggestion

SENATE
that the membership of the Transport Committee be not reduced this session is made
because of the proposed legislation mentioned
in the Speech from the Throne. I am, of
course, not at all suggesting what attitude
anyone should take towards the measures
when they come before us. There will be
opportunity to deal with them at that time.
I am disappointed that we are not going to
have a joint committee of both houses on
the Transport Bill, but I do think that if it
is at all possible there should be a joint
committee on the radio and television matters.
Hon. Gray Turgeon: Honourable senators, I
had not intended to speak in this debate
until I listened to the remarks of our colleague from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert). The
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), the
senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) and others have recommended that the
Senate should more often consider bills in
Committee of the whole. When this motion,
which would reduce the membership of some
committees to seventeen, has been agreed to,
I think the Rules of the Senate should be
changed to enable senators, if they wish, to
meet in Committee of the Whole to consider
reports from committees, particularly those
from committees whose membership has been
limited.
Hon. Mr. Euler: We do not need a rule for
that.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is the rule now.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Then we should be particular to see that it is done.
It has been said that senators who do not
belong to a committee may attend its hearing
and participate in the debate, but may not
vote.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That is the rule now.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Naturally, quite a few
senators do not attend meetings of committees of which they are not members because
of their inability to vote.
In a committee of seventeen members the
majority in favour of a report is bound to be
small; it cannot be more than seventeen, and
may be only nine or ten. It seems to me that
if the Senate made it a rule of practice to
receive reports of committees, particularly
those of the smaller committees, in Committee of the Whole, we would then all have
the opportunity to cast our vote or to take
part in the debate in this chamber.
The honourable senior senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) has pointed out that a
great many recommendations heard by the
Royal Commission on Transportation were
representative of geographical areas in

Canada. To a large extent that is true of
the proceedings of the Senate, because its
membership is based on geographical divisions rather than on population or political
doctrine or affilation.
My friend from Ottawa spoke particularly
of the Committee on Transport and Communications and the committee having to do
with the Massey report. When these committees make their reports, all senators
should be given an opportunity to discuss the
matters in question in Committee of the
Whole. In that way we will hear representations from the various geographical
areas, and each senator may register his vote
if he wishes to do so.
I wish to compliment the honourable senator who has just spoken upon the tenor of his
speech, and to join with those who have suggested that we should consider reports in
Committee of the Whole, particularly reports
of the proposed smaller committees.
Hon. Gordon B. Isnor: Honourable senators,
perhaps I may be permitted to express my
thoughts briefly, notwithstanding the fact
that they differ from those expressed by the
brilliant senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden). Naturally, that honourable gentleman, with his legal qualifications, is more
or less of a guide to me in rnany matters; but
I feel that neither he nor I may be entirely
wrong in our approach to this subject.
The introduction of this motion by the
leader of the government impressed me very
much, and I felt that when I had an opportunity I should compliment him on having carried
forward from last session the thought that
the Senate should exert greater effort in the
interests of the people of Canada. The
streamlining of the committees by reducing
their membership from fifty or thereabouts to
seventeen, and placing on such committees
senators particularly interested in the subjects to be referred to them, should bring
about the results that the leader desires.
I should like to remind the honourable
senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) that
most men today have specialized branches of
activity, such as he has in his own profession. For instance, when one went into a
classroom a few years ago he saw from fortyfive to sixty pupils. Today, modern schools
have considerably reduced classes, the simple
reason being that they can give more concentrated study to the subject before them.
I think that illustration demonstrates better
reasoning than the argument advanced by my
honourable friend, for it, as was said by the
honourable senator from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid), could be used in support of
either side of the question.

OCTOBER 17, 1951
i am all for reducing the size of certain
committees, provided that the attendance will
be maintained. In that way a -committee can
better give the required study to the subject
placed before it. Further, the individual
senator is unable to serve effectively on a
number of committees, and by reducing the
membership, the personnel of committees
will be selected in the light of the work for
which they are best suited.
I certainly intend to support the motion.
Hon. Jacob Nicol: Honourable senators, I
have found it rather difficult to follow the
logic of some of the arguments that have been
presented in support of the motion now
before the house. It appears that the leader
wishes a small committee to study a certain
matter which will be placed before it, and
thinks that in that way the members will
be better informed. The purpose of a committee is, I think, to infori the members
of the house with respect to legislation. Now,
how can a small committee be better
informed than a large committee? I think
it was the honourable leader opposite (Hon.
Mr. Haig) who made the suggestion that a
small committee would report to Committee
of the Whole. But when the house meets in
Committee of the Whole to consider the
report of a small committee, it will not be
as well informed as if that committee had
had a membership of say forty.
It seems to me that the purpose of a committee is to study legislation and save the
time of the house. There are, in fact, few
bills which need to be referred to a standing
committee. Why not, therefore, refer a large
number of bills directly to Committee of
the Whole, and thereby save time? The
arguments in support of the motion do not
seem logical.
Two or three years ago the rules of the
Senate were amended. I objected to the
amendment, but I did not express myself in
the house. Today a similar resolution is
before us again, and although I believe the
motion will go through, and I know that the
honourable leader has only the'best interests
of the house at heart, I respectfully beg to
differ with him; and this time I want my
dissent to be registered.
Hon. C. B. Howard: Honourable senators,
I have only a word or two to say. I believe
that if we make the proposed change it will
be a step backward-as far as the Senate is
concerned.
Not long ago, when I was Whip on this side,
a certain piece of legislation was submitted
to a large committee. Its members sat
around the table, and successfully adjusted

differences between two outstanding companies in a manner beneficial to both companies and to the people of Canada. Had the
membership of that committee been small,
its actions might have given rise to a debate
in this chamber, and probably the solution
would have been less satisfactory.
To put it another way: if the Senate is a
house of revision, whose duty it is to take
into consideration the interests of all sections
of Canada and watch legislation to avoid
injustice to any part of the country, a larger
committee is much more representative and
serviceable than a smaller committee. If we
were to follow through the suggestion of my
honourable friend and colleague, it might be
argued that another place would be greatly
improved if its membership were reduced
from 262 to 100.
I am convinced that to adopt this motion
would be a move in the wrong direction.
Hon. Arthur Marcotte: I wish to say a word
on this motion. I hope the honourable leader
will not be offended when I say that it seems
to me rather childish. How is it possible to
improve a committee by the mere process of
reducing its membership? In my experience
of twenty years in this chamber, this is about
the third time that we have tried to improve
things. At one time, after studying the two
methods of proceeding-whether by small
or by large committees-we concluded that
the larger the committee the better.
After all, what is the aim of this resolution? To reduce the quorum? No, because
the quorum is to be the same as before. If
with a large committee the quorum is about
the same, it would seem to follow that the
larger the number on a committee the better
it can operate. That has been my experience
while a member of this chamber.
I always smile when I hear honourable
senators talk about operating by means of
Committee of the Whole. We have tried that.
We have invited ministers of the Crown to
appear before us here so that we could get
more enlightenment. Did we get it? We
never got it.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: In fact, only on two
occasions have ministers attended here. I
remember when one of them-the Minister
of Transport, I believe-spoke to us. After
the meeting he came to me and said, "Senator,
I thank you: you were the only one on your
side who listened to me. The others were
gone". Why? Because what he said did
not interest us, since there was nothing he
told us which we did not know before. Much
has been said about the benefits to be obtained

SENATE
from smaller committees, and from explanations given at meetings. I invite honourable
senators to read what the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) said yesterday. He
wants improvements. But of what kind? I
can find nothing in his explanation which will
correct one single defect. Can he assure us
that the government will change its practice
of bringing down important measures in the
last week of the session? We could not enforce
such a change: we have no power to do it.
Would it not be better to have more members on our committees?
Maintain the
quorum at the same figure but give the
opportunity to other senators to attend, to
listen, to speak and to vote. The larger the
committee, the better work it will do.
I may be wrong, but the reasons so far
advanced for the change do not begin to convince me that our rules will thereby be improved. As for meeting in Committee of the
Whole, the existing rules provide for that;
all that it is necessary to do is to follow the
rules as they are, and then we shall be on
the safe side.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think we are trying to take
too long a view. This is one session; next
session we can change our procedure if we
see fit. As a matter of fact, those of us who
were at the conference of the senators know
that while the suggestion was made that the
committees be composed of seventeen members each, the leader of the government
pointed out that we could fix the number at
twenty-five, or thirty, or whatever figure we
saw fit. He thought that to start with seventeen would be a good number. As regards
attendance, I wish some members of the
Finance Committee, on which I have served
every year, would stand up and tell us how
many times they have attended its meetings.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Very few. Most of the work
was done by the steering committee of that
committee, who got together, found out what
was to be done, and then called the committee together again. There was a very slim
attendance. In any event, this amendment is
not like unto the laws of the Medes and
Persians-unalterable. As the honourable
member from Kootenay East (Hon. Mr. King)
told us, tomorrow we could bring in notice
of an amendment, and two days after we
could again change the rules.
Let there be no misunderstanding. I said
a year ago that I was satisfied with the rule
the Senate has been applying. I believe it
has made for the finest kind of service to the
people of Canada. But I have met many other
people who thought differently. Now the
leader
of the government (Hon. Mr.

Robertson), in a spirit of fairness, of sincerity
and of humility, comes forward and tells us
that he withdraws the suggestions he made
last year but he thinks that this new proposal
is one whereby the Senate, within its own
confines, can give greater service. Personally
I would suppose, were I chairman of one of
these committees, that I had a better chance
of bringing together seventeen people to do
a particular job than of getting fifty.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: What about the
quorum?
Hon. Mr. Haig: The quorum has nothing
to do with it.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: Oh, yes, it has.
Hon. Mr. Haig: You can have a quorum of
any number you like. For the Banking and
Commerce it is nine, and frequently we
have an attendance of ten, and it is pretty
hard to get them there. Its members like those
of the Finance Committee, do a lot of
individual digging and hard work.
The scheme as embodied in this motion
may not work, but it can do harm to try it
for one session. Candidly, had I been the
leader of the government, I would not have
introduced this motion. In my heart of
hearts I do not believe it is necessary. But I
have often been wrong, and the government
leader is as capable as I am, and probably
more capable, of deciding upon and presenting a measure to improve the service of
the Senate to the people of Canada. I am
prepared to give this scheme a trial. That is
all I ask of my colleagues. If when we meet
again next 'year we find the results unsatisfactory, I will be the first man to stand up
in this chamber and say so; and if a majority
agree with me, we can make a change. In
any event we are acting within the measure
of our own powers; we are doing our work in
our own house: and I may add that it is no
new suggestion that we should operate in
Committee of the Whole. I am persuaded
that if I were a member of the Transport and
Communications Committee and held the
same views as does the honourable senator
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert), I would
attend every meeting of that committee. I
would be so well informed on the matters discussed before that committee I could answer
every question asked about them in this
house. I do not think I am boasting when I
say that I can do that now on matters of
finance, and this is because I have taken a
deep interest in the work of our Finance
Committee and have faithfully attended its
meetings.
This motion is not for the purpose of
wrecking the Senate, or even reforming it; it

that proposal in full, for instead of having a
full membership of 102 in the Senate just
now we have fifteen vacancies. But my suggestion is that this session we try the experiment with only three committees, they being
ones to which I anticipate very important
legislation will be referred.
The senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert) has mentioned the traditionally
large membership of the Committee on
Transport and Communications. I should
perhaps have omitted this committee from
my suggestion, for I would have no fixed
ideas on this matter were it not for the
important and complex Railway Bill which
we are expecting to have to deal with. Also
I thought it would be well to have the
membership of that committee reduced, so
that those members who are remaining in
Ottawa during the expected two weeks
adjournment of the Senate could proceed to
function. It is true, of course, that any
senator, whether appointed to the committee
or not, may attend its sittings. But my
experience has been that, as a rule, senators
are not eager to attend committees of which
they are not members and on which they
cannot vote. For instance, though I have
frequently invited senators who are not
among the fifty members of the Banking and
Commerce Committee to appear and take
part in proceedings of that committee, I have
usually found them diffident.
Honourable senators, the proposal that I
have made in my motion may prove to be
entirely wrong, but I should like to see it
given a trial.

of interference by anyone with the royal
tour. The people of my province, along with
other Canadians, are most happy that the
royal couple should set such a fine example
of the virtues of home and family life as we
know them.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I wish to say a few words
to the honourable mover (Hon. Mr. Vien) and
the honourable seconder (Hon. Mr. Wood) of
the Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne. I say candidly and with the best of
good will that I was a little disappointed
with the speech of the honourable mover.
Certainly, he is a most eloquent parliamentarian, a well educated man and one who,
like many others, has given great public
service to his province and to the country
at large. Nevertheless, I was a little disappointed in his remarks, because I felt that
he read too much of his speech for it to have
the proper effect on the members of this
house. True, he gave a fine summary of the
accomplishments of the Liberal party during
the past fifteen or sixteen years. I think,
however, he overlooked one important point,
which appears in the Minutes of the Proceedings of this house on June 21 last, at pages
412 and 413. Had he had those pages before
him, I am quite sure he would have included
in his speech some of the facts they contain.
There it is shown how the expenditures of
government in every department-municipal,
provincial and the federal-have
shot
upwards within the past fifteen years.
Hon. Mr. King: We are growing.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The costs are still growing.
I was delighted with the speech of the
honourable senator who seconded the motion.
I thought he showed great judgment in his
references
to grain-crop conditions
in
Western Canada. He is a true westerner,
and he set clearly before you the problem
that we of the West face in the matter of
production. Although Alberta also produces
oil to some extentHon. Mr. MacKinnon: Everything.

Hon. Mr. Haig: -and
Saskatchewan
possesses some oil, and probably some
radium, the prairies are mainly dependent
upon grain crops. I advised the honourable
senator from Regina (Hon. Mr. Wood) that
I intended to steal some of his thunder. This
season the prairie provinces gave every sign
of producing the best grain crop ever raised
in our country, but unfortunately, because of
rains which began in August and continued
through September into October, much of the
crop will never be harvested. As the honoureble senator mentioned, probably one-third

of the grain will be non-millable, that is it
cannot be converted into flour. Nevertheless
this year's harvest, plus the heavy carry-over
from last year, confronts the transportation
system with a weighty problem.
In this connection I want to congratulate
the government upon having appointed Roy
Milner to supervise the organization of grain
transportation. I know him well. He was,
I believe, born in Winnipeg, and after some
years spent in Alberta returned to Manitoba.
He knows the grain business, including the
problems of grain transportation, from beginning to end. He is reliable, possesses much
business ability, and also-something that I
think is needed to handle a system of this
kind-lots of guts; the resolution to carry out
what he thinks should be done. No doubt he
will have a fair amount of trouble to overcome in his new position, but I know of no
other man in my experience of the western
provinces who, under the very difficult circumstances of the times, is capable of doing
a better job.
Having complimented the honourable
member from Regina on his address, I want
to congratulate the government-though let
nobody suppose that I am a supporter of this
government.
An Hon. Senalor: You are a young man yet.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I want to congratulate the
government upon the manner in which they
have handled the drainage problem connected
with the Red River floods last year. Canada
and the world at large responded magnificently to the flood emergency, and we Manitobans, especially the inhabitants of the Red
River valley, can never be too grateful to
people in this country, and in every part of
the world where our calamity was known,
for the way they "came through" and helped
us. Especially I would express my appreciation of the action of the Dominion Government and Parliament. Not only did they
respond readily to our request for moneyfinancial aid is not always the most important-but we have been inspired by the
promptitude with which they made available
engineering skill and created conditions
which I think will protect us for many years
from a recurrence of flooding. In a word,
what has been done is to erect, in urban areas,
permanent driveways at a height of fortyfive feet above the datum line along the Red
River valley. These roads are being used
today as highways. A flood of the dimensions
of the one last year would require the heightening of the roadway by two and a half
feet; but there is of course plenty of room
for the provision of this additional protection.
One-fourth of the cost of this work falls on
the province, three-fourths, or approximately

OCTOBER 18, 1951
three and a half million dollars, on the Dominion Government. The work has been well
and economically done, and on behalf of
the people of Manitoba, and especially those
in the city of Winnipeg and the Red River
valley, I thank the Canadian Government
and the Canadian people for what they have
done in this regard.
Next I wish to discuss the housing problem. I think the government made a mistake
some six or seven months ago when it
changed the housing regulations so that larger
down-payments would be required on new
homes. The housing problem in Winnipeg is
not as serious at the present time as it was
a year or two ago, but I understand that it
is a vexing one in Montreal, Toronto and
Vancouver. The housing question goes to
the very root of family life. Unless housing
accommodation is satisfactory there cannot be
proper family life. The profession to which
I have the honour to belong constantly has
to meet the problem of broken homes. One
of the things which saddens a lawyer's heart
-and many of us do have a heart-is to see a
home broken up because four or five children
are forced to live in a three-roomed house. I
realize that the problem facing the government is a serious one; but the people of
Canada will insist upon its solution. And
the problem is one that I think can be solved.
I am glad to see that the government propose
to afford some let-up in the regulations for
purchasing new homes, but I think they will
have to go further and revert to the regulations which existed prior to the last seven or
eight months.
I have mentioned the ccst of administration
on municipal, provincial and federal levels in
this country, and I recall the examination
made by a committee of this house just about
four months ago. If we are going to carry on
adequately the preparation for a war of freedom, spending large sums of money to
properly equip our armed forces, and if we
are going to make any effort at all to keep
the cost of living down, we have got to do
something about the cost of civil government. I am not referring at all to the spending of the Defence Department. There might
be some criticism of that, but I am not going
to talk about it today. I do know that if
administration some ten or twelve years ago
cost so much money, there is something wrong
if the cost has doubled or trebled today, with
no corresponding increase in the population
of the country. The people of Canada have
to be advised about, this. But I shall not
go into the details of this question now
because it was covered fully a year ago.
The Speech from the Throne forecasts
legislation dealing with NATO, of the dispatch
of soldiers to Europe, the development of the

St. Lawrence Seaway, the construction of a
causeway to bridge the straits of Canso,
certain developments in Western Canada, and
old age pensions. I shall deal more fully with
these in a moment, but first I want to say that
nobody can object to these proposed undertakings as a whole. Nobody can object, for
instance, to the St. Lawrence Seaway, if it
will do what the engineers predict-cheapen
the movement of goods between Ontario and
Quebec and the western provinces and
Europe. It is all to the good if it will lower
the cost of transporting fuel from the Maritime Provinces to Fort William, and the
carrying of iron ore from Quebec to the ovens
of Ontario and the United States.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: May I say just one
word? The honourable leader opposite (Hon.
Mr. Haig) has said that nobody could take
objection to these projects. Well, I would
take strenuous objection to the St. Lawrence
Seaway. I think it would be detrimental to
the Maritime Provinces, which are badly
handicapped now. It would simply mean
that they would be still further handicapped.
Ontario and Quebec would benefit, of course,
and it rather appears that many people think
Ontario and Quebec constitute the Dominion
of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I have very great respect
for the opinion of the honourable senator
from Margaree Forks (Hon. Mr. MacLennan\
but I must respectfully submit that this development will take place in any event. Let us
take the construction of a causeway to bridge
the straits of Canso for rail and road traffic.
I do not think the province of Manitoba is
particularly interested in whether or not those
straits are bridged; but I feel that in a country as large as ours one section cannot say,
because a certain development will not help
it, that it should not be carried out. As far
back as I can remember in politics, there has
always been somebody who said that he was
going to build a causeway across the straits
of Canso; and I would like to see it finished
in my lifetime.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: These undertakings, the St.
Lawrence Waterway, old age pensions, and
so on, will cost somewhere around a billion
and a quarter dollars, and I want honourable
senators to remember that figure.
An Hon. Senator: The cost will be more
than that.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Then, of course, there are
the defence estimates, which I am not touching on; the cost of civil government, which
I have already covered; and the cost of good
roads, and so on. That brings me to the
subject of my address, inflation. Communism

SENATE

is one of the primary evils of the world, and
the civilized world is spending its energy in
getting ready to prevent a catastrophe resulting from the inroads of communism. At the
same time, I am not sure at all that the communists will not win if we lose out on
inflation.
Now, I am going to do something that I
criticized another member for doing: I am
going to read from some notes, because I want
to make sure that I express my views clearly.
The government's policy, largely, has been
to meet and prevent the cost of living from
going up. We have taxes on income, sales
taxes, excess profits taxes, excise taxes and
generally the greatest tax levy in the history
of Canada, even including wartime. In addition to this the government have withdrawn
their support of dominion bonds, with the
result that the cost of interest has gone up.
They have also instituted credit restrictions
and "what have you", in the hope that as
a result the cost of living would at least stand
still. But the cost of living, instead of standing still, has continued to go up; and undoubtedly the sales tax and such taxes have of
themselves helped to make it go up.
What enters into the cost of anything? In
the flrst place, there is the cost of the
primary article or articles used in the manufacture of the thing. Secondly, there is the
labour used in all stages of manufacture.
Thirdly, there is the interest or profit on the
capital employed in the operation. By the
cost of labour, as I use that expression here,
I mean what is paid to every individual who
has anything to do with the article manufactured, whether be works with his hands or
his head. The cost of the finished product
also includes the costs of transportation and
all the other things used in converting the
product from its raw state to its manufactured condition. in which it is used by the
public. Some articles require more labour
than others. For some, the original cost is
greater than for others. On some the interest is
greater than on others, because the capital
involved in the operation is greater. But by
and large the three elements that I have
mentioned enter into every process of manufacturing or production that we go into. Now,
the two classes--on one side, the person who
owns the capital involved, and on the other
side, the people who furnisb the labour,
by which again I mean labour in its widest
sense-divide up the results. If you increase
the profits beyond a certain point, the price
of the article has to be increased; and there
is a similar resuit if the costs are higher costs
for any part of the labour, whether physical
or mental, because the producer simply says,

"All right, if my labour costs for the production of the article are ten cents higher, I will
add that amount to my sale price." He has
no difficulty in making sales so long as there
is a demand for the article he produces, and
as things are now it looks as if the demand
for most consumer goods will exist for a
long time to come.
I think the Minister of Finance said recently
that the present strong demand arises because
too much money is chasing too few articles,
and the problem is to increase the supply
of goods in proportion to the money available.
Well, the government decided to impose more
taxes and restrict credit facilities, so that the
people would not have so much money to
spend. But prices continued to go up, and
it is not difficult to see why. After all, why
should the owner of a factory oppose the
demands of bis workers for higher wages
and salaries? He can add the increased labour
costs to the price of his goods. The situation
is not so bad for people who are able to
increase their incomes to meet the higher
cost of living. But under present conditions
a large number of people are unable to charge
more for their services than they are charging
now, or to add to their income in any other
way. I refer to people such as ministers,
teachers, civil servants, middle-class people
living on their savings, retired workers, old
age pensioners, widows of war veterans, war
veterans themselves, and so on.
As I say, some people are able in one way
or another to increase their incomes to at
least some degree as the cost of living rises.
Let me illustrate. j am not aware of what
the very brilliant lawyers in Toronto do,
for I am not in their class, but I do know
that the members of the Law Society in Winnipeg have raised their fees as one means of
endeavouring to keep up with the higher cost
of living. When I was a student a man
could have his will drawn by a lawyer
for $5. Later the charge was put up to $10,
but now it is $25 for even a very simple will,
and it will go still higher if the cost of living
continues to rise. Now how can pensioners,
for instance, meet a situation like that? And
what about all those elderly people who are
living on very small incomes-pensioners,
superannuated people, and those who are
depending upon the income from their own
small savings?
The expenditures on our huge defence
program are entering into the money stream.
And if the government carries out, as I assume
they will, the projects mentioned in the
Speech from the Throne, there will be further
large sums poured into that stream. For
instance, there will be about $800 million
for the St. Lawrence Waterways, about $23

OCTOBER 18, 1951
million for the causeway at the Straits of
Canso, and $300 million or more for pensions
to people over seventy. All this additional
money will increase the demand for goods.
The other day the Winnipeg Free Press
said, quite properly, that somebody must tell
the people of Canada we cannot go on doing
that kind of thing and continue to live in the
same old way as in the past. Some people
may say that senators have not much cause
to complain, that we are in a fine position,
that we are paid $6,000 now instead of $4,000,
as we were when I was appointed here sixteen years ago. But of course, we are not
really paid as well now as we were then, for
the dollar is worth only about half as much
today as it was in 1935.
I do not believe that the government have
properly faced the problem at all, or that the
means which they have suggested for dealing
with it will be effective. I am told that the
cost of living has not increased as rapidly
since the budget was brought down as it did
before; but we all know that it has increased.
Recently, in trying to find out what kind
of things the people are interested in, I did a
little figuring which may be of interest to the
house. I analysed the results of the four
federal by-elections that were held early this
summer. Two of these elections were in a
western province, and the others were in
widely separated provinces. Every one of
the elections went against the government,
and I tried, without having regard to political
considerations at all, to find the underlying
reason for this. I may have reached a wrong
conclusion, and I may be criticized by some
of my friends for expressing it; but I say to
you quite candidly that I do not think the
people intended to vote against the government as a government, but against their
failure to deal with the problem of the high
cost of living. To avoid a misstatement on this
point, I should perhaps break the rule again
and read from my manuscript.
I am going to refer now particularly to the
by-election in Queens, Prince Edward Island,
a constituency with which I am not very
familiar. Angus MacLean, who was the successful candidate in the by-election, received
a majority of 453 votes. He and his opponent
both had been candidates in the preceding
general election. As is usual, the same
number of votes was not polled by each candidate in both elections. In the general election
MacLean received 476 more votés than he got
in the by-election; and Miller, the defeated
candidate in the by-election, received 655
fewer votes than he got in the general
election. It would appear to me that the
question of the cost of living must have been
the reason for the change. The facts and

figures I have given apply to the same constituency and to the same two candidates.
I come now to the constituency of Waterloo
South. There the successful candidate in the
by-election was of the same party as was the
member elected in the general election, but
in the by-election he polled over 200 more
votes than the candidate for his party had
polled in the general election. I may say that
as far as popularity was concerned the two
men were about equal. I know that constituencies vary, and that local conditions
influence by-elections, but this illustration
applies to a constituency in which the candidate of the party that was successful on both
occasions-the Progressive Conservative party
-gained some 200 votes in the by-election.
The C.C.F. candidate increased her vote in
the by-election by some 200 votes, notwithstanding the fact that there were fewer total
votes polled. It is notable that the government candidate dropped nearly 1,900 votes in
the by-election. It is impossible for me to
come to any other conclusion on these facts
than that this was a demonstration of criticism
of the government because of its failure to
solve the problem of the high cost of living.
I come now to a constituency closer to
home, that of Winnipeg South Centre, where
an amusing phenomenon occurred in the
results of the total votes cast. In the by-election the Progressive Conservative candidate
polled 584 fewer votes than he did in the
general election; the Liberal received 9,574
fewer votes than the Liberal candidate
received in the general election, and the C.C.F.
candidate polled 3,235 fewer votes than were
polled by the candidate for that party in the
general election. The net result was that the
Progressive Conservative candidate was
elected by majority of 736 votes. Knowing
that seat very well, and having lived there
for nearly thirty-eight years of my life, I
would say that apart from some incidents that
may have influenced the voting, the basic
problem was the cost of living. Although
there were fewer votes polled in the by-election, it is quite plain that the Liberal voters
-leaving out personalities-stayed at home.
While they would not vote against their
candidate, they would not vote for him. I
repeat that the problem that influenced the
voting as much as 95 per cent was the cost
of living, and the result indicates that the
people were determined that not only the
government, but the Parliament of Canada,
should know of their attitude on the subject.
I come now to the constituency of Brandon, where in the general election the government candidate was a citizen of the town
and the opposition candidate was an outsider. The candidate who represented Labour

SENATE

in the by-election-I would not call him a
Ccmmunist but he was quite close to the
Communists-did not poll many votes. In
the by-election the positions of the two main
candidates were the reverse of what they
had been in the general election: the Progressive Conservative candidate was a local
man and the Liberal candidate was an outsider. Let us compare the results of the
two elections. In the general election the
Liberal candidate had a majority of 4,113, and
in the by-election the Conservative candidate
had a majority of 2,753. It should be noted
that Brandon is about half rural and half
urban, and that in the rural area the problem
of the cost of living was not as vital as in
the urban part of the riding. I am familiar
with this area, having been brought up on a
farm near there, and know what the real
issue was.
I strongly believe, honourable senators, that
the widespread problem of the high cost of
living was brought into sharp focus by those
four by-elections. While some may argue
that there was a local issue in ea-ch of these
constituencies which may have influenced
the voting, the cost of living was the fundamental issue which the people faced, and
that is the issue which now demands the
attention of the Parliament of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Euler: What is the remedy?
Hon. Mr. Howard: That is the question.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I expected my friend to
ask me that question, and I will give him
my answer. The remedy is for the government of this country to boldly say that they
will cut their ordinary expenditures by 50
per cent. Of course such a decision might be
bad business for the government, should they
face further by-elections. The people do not
like to have certain services cut off.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Apparently it is bad now.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes; it is bad, but if the
government hold a general election next June,
as is now suggested, they will wonder what
kind of cyclone hit them. I can tell them that
it will be a cost-of-living cyclone.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Well, maybe you are right.
Hon. Mr. Haig: This is one problem as to
which we as Senators should warn the people
of Canada that their government cannot continue pyramiding services without increasing
living costs. For instance, an increase of
from eight to ten per cent in sales tax is
bound to raise prices. My friend from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden) argued that the tax did
not apply to food. Well, there are lots of
other things which enter into the problem of
the cost of living. Take shoes, for instance.
The other day I paid $15.00 for a pair of shoes

which a few years ago cost only $7.50. The
other day a smart young minister in my home
city, whom I am quite sure is a dyed-in-thewool Liberal, and never voted for me, asked
me when I was going to Ottawa. When I
replied that I was going the next day, he
said: "Jack, do one thing-bring down the
cost of living". He pointed out that he had
a family of four children and bought a lot of
milk. Then I asked him what about the
meat problem, and he said: "What is meat?
My children see it only in the butcher's window". As a further illustration of high prices,
I might mention a lady who recently
remarked to her husband: "Our grandchild is
old enough to have a bed of his own. Let us
buy him one for his next birthday." They
agreed to do this, and when the husband
asked, "What will it cost, about $15.00?" She
said, "Oh no, it will be about $45.00."
Teachers, clerks, pensioners, the people who
neither belong to unions nor own businesses
-all the little people-are powerless in the
face of these conditions.
While I admit that the problem is a difficult
one, and that other countries are afflicted by
it to a greater or lesser extent, I never
thought that in my lifetime the cost of living
in Canada would exceed that in the United
States. I recall that two years ago, when the
cost-of-living index stood at 146 or 147, the
Minister of Finance conceded that it might go
up a little more, say two or three points. It
now stands at around 189. Part of this
increase is blamed upon the primary producers; but only about 25 per cent of it can
be laid to them. The major advances have
been in practically every category excepting
rent. In the case of houses subject to controls
the rental increases have not been outstanding but it must be remembered that houses
built since 1947 are rented on the basis of
their total cost; and the sort of house which
costs $10,000 today, cost only $6,000 twelve
years ago.
Hon. Mr. Wood: Four thousand.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, I wanted to be moderate. Obviously, therefore, the rental value
of housing has doubled. Added to this is the
fact that our municipal taxation has risen
considerably. Yet only 39 per cent of the
total increase in living costs is attributable
to rent.
I hope that what I have said will induce
other honourable senators to join the campaign to reduce the cost of living. Ours is
a great country. We are engaged in a terrific struggle to preserve freedoms which we
love as intensely as we love our native land.
It can be said without immodesty that members of the Senate occupy a very high position in the public life of Canada, and that
while we are subject now and again to a

OCTOBER 18, 1951
little sniping from here and there, the people
at large realize that we are devoted to our
country and determined to do what we can
in the national interest. That at any rate
is my conviction after having been for sixteen years a member of this body. But the
higher our position the greater our responsibility to tackle this probiem of inflation energetically, with a determination to bring home
to the government the seriousness of the
situation. The minor measures that have
been taken so far may do some good, but
they are neither drastic nor thoroughgoing.
The problem must be attacked with the same
kind of determination that we showed in
two world wars, especially now that we are
confronted with the most insidious challenge
to liberty that any people has ever known.
So let us carry to every person in the country the message that the cost of living must
be reduced; let us prevail upon the government to take action to bring it down, or
there will be but one fate in store for this
country-a "bust" at the end of the road.
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, I need hardly say that I concur in
what has been said by those who preceded
me with regard to the recent illness of His
Majesty, and that I join with all the members of this chamber, indeed, I believe with
all people throughout the world, in the feeling of relief that his recovery seems to be
so rapid, and in the hope that it will be
permanent. It has been a great satisfaction
to us to receive His Majesty's personal message in response to the expression of good
wishes which you, Mr. Speaker, transmitted
to him on our behalf earlier this session.
In a modest way I, like others who have
spoken, participated in the ceremonies
attending the visit to Canada of Their Royal
Highnesses, and I am delighted that they
are receiving everywhere so warm and enthusiastic a welcome.
May I compliment the honourable senator
from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien) on his
speech in moving the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne? His long parliamentary experience and wide knowledge o!
business matters were reflected in a very
able and comprehensive address. The honourable senator from Regina (Hon. Mr. Wood),
who seconded the motion, dealt primarily,
as did the leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig) with a matter of particular interest
to both honourable senators, namely, crop
conditions in the West. It is a subject that
I am not in a position to discuss; but I am
sure that all members are glad to have had
him explain it in such a lucid and concise
manner. It also gave me great pleasure to

hear the speech of the leader of the opposition. I have little to say about it in the way
of criticism, chiefly, perhaps, because there
was little in it with which any thinking person could disagree. Regarding his references
to the last four by-elections, I have made no
such analysis as he did of the probable
effects of those contests on the future of
this government. To what extent the results
were due to the causes he indicated I do not
know. But the particular party which is
represented on this side of the house has
come to look upon the loss of by-elections
before a general election as a good omen.
We lost several important ones before the
last general election.
In more serious vein, I agree with him
that the general problems outlined in the
Speech from the Throne bring in their train
issues of much gravity. It has been pointed
out, and I need not enlarge on the matter at
any length, that the principle of old age
pensions has been pretty generally accepted.
I agree with what was said, as I recall, by
the leader of the opposition himself, that the
chief point of contention will be the financial
this legislation
provisions for making
effective.
The report of the Royal Commission on
Transportation and the legislation arising
therefrom are matters to which, I am sure,
the most earnest and careful consideration
will be given. It is proposed that the bills
which are being introduced in the other
place shall be referred to committee for
study. No doubt, procedure in committee
will be much the same as that followed in
connection with-for example-the legislation relative to bankruptcy: evidence will
probably be received from those whom the
various provisions may affect.
Later in the session I shall give notice of
a resolution with respect to the participation
of Canada in the NATO arrangements. This
in itself is nothing new, but the simple truth
is that it is a momentous question, charged
with great problems which I am sure will
continue to evidence themselves as time goes
on.
Like my honourable friend opposite (Hon.
Mr. Haig), I should like to say a few words
about inflation. I agree with the honourable
gentleman that this is one of the most
important questions confronting Canada and
the whole western world today, and that if
we are unable to remedy the situation it may
eventually result in a condition which would
raise grave doubts as to the success of our
way of life as compared with Communism. I
do not find fault with my honourable friend
for asking the government what it is going
to do about inflation. I suppose this question

SENATE
is taxing the best minds in this country and,
indeed, on this continent, and will continue
to do so. I have wondered whether the
Senate, which bas taken the lead in many
things, could do something constructive about
this problem. I do not know that it can, and
I am far from attempting to indicate any
course which the Senate might follow.
I want to draw upon the economic belief
in which I was brought up. There were two
fundamental beliefs in our household: one was
belief in the Shorter Catechism, and the other
was the belief that business competition is
an excellent thing. This was the first political
doctrine of which I was aware. It was argued
that if there was insufficient internal competition it was wise to import whatever we
needed to satisfy our requirements. This
doctrine of competition is not a profound one,
but I am convinced that it applies to the
western world today. In order to solve the
problem of the rising cost of living the western world has got to adopt something of the
fundamental principles of free trade from
which it bas so long departed.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I remember that one
day when I asked our old friend the late Dan
Riley to participate in a certain debate, he
replied, "I may, but I have lost all interest
in politics because there are no free traders
left in the world".
My honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig) has made a thorough study of inflation.
But let us examine why we have a rising
cost of living and what means may be found
to bring it down. A tremendous purchasing
power has been brought about by certain
definite factors. One of these factors is our
armament program, which has not yet reached
its zenith. Another factor is extraordinary
optimism on the part of business investors.
There is practically no limit to what can
take place in the development of natural
resources in Canada, and there is a worldwide demand for these natural resources
which we have in such vast abundance. This
terrific demand will likely continue. The
whole picture is further exaggerated when
you superimpose upon it the various municipal, provincial and federal government
expenditures that cannot possibly be curtailed.
I think my honourable friend said something
to the effect that the temporary expedient
of restricting credits so as to curtail purchases
can be avoided if we increase production
sufficiently. No one can deny that fact; but
this is not an easy thing to accomplish,
nor can it be accomplished quickly.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Have we not been doing
that?

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Yes, we have, and
presumably the purpose of a great deal of
our capital construction is to increase our
facilities for greater production. But the only
way by which we can increase production
rapidly enough to keep down the cost of
living is through competition, whether
between manufacturers, or labour, or retailers,
or wholesalers, or individual tradesmen or
other classes. As I see it, there is no immediate prospect that our own production alone
can be increased sufficiently to meet the tremendous demand for consumer goods, and
if I am right in this we are likely to have,
as for one reason or another we have nearly
always had in this country, a steadily rising
spiral.
The situation is further complicated because
the ordinary laws of supply and demand
which operated prior to the last war have
been more or less set aside. For instance, the
old idea was that high prices stimulated
production, but that when production became
large enough to meet demand, prices would
start to drop. But for one reason or another
we have developed a pretty rigid set-up which
prevents that old law of supply and demand
from operating. For instance, during the
last war agricultural producers and others
acquiesced in the placing of limitations upon
prices for their products, and parliament
passed legislation establishing floor prices for
certain products. Well, what happens with
respect to goods whose prices are subject to
such controls is that production, however
large it may become, can never cause the
price to fall below the established floor. I
am not suggesting at all that it is in the
agricultural field alone that there has been
interference with the law of supply and
demand. We have a very well organized
labour structure in this country. I do not
say that in the future we could not possibly
be faced with conditions which would cause
the wage scale to decline, but I think there
would have to be a very serious economic
upheaval to bring about decline of any consequence. My point is that more or less
throughout our whole economy the ordinary
law of supply and demand does not function
as it used to do.
As to production itself, it has to be renembered that certain factors are interfering
directly with that. For example, for purposes
of defence of the western world we are
taking into the armed forces 150,000 young
men, who for the time being will cease to be
producers of capital or consumer goods. And
then, of course, the large quantities of basic
materials that we use for war purposes will
reduce the quantity of materials available for
production of civilian goods.

Gracious Majesty, and her sailor husbandare proceeding across Canada, having winged
their way to our shores across the broad
Atlantic on the modern magic carpet, which
seems so appropriate a means of transport
for a princess of our time, and yet was
chosen through untoward circumstances
lending special significance and sentiment to
this visit.
I am sure that all honourable members
and all citizens of Canada have been deeply
perturbed in these past weeks by the serious
illness of our Sovereign, of whose gracious
personality many of us have keen recollection through the royal visit of 1939. We are
all aware of how nobly he bore himself
through the trying years of war, how devoted
was his attention to duty in that terrible
time, and how greatly, on those occasions
when he spoke to his peoples, he was able
to inspire courage and hope through the
expression of his own simple and unquenchable faith in God and the right. To the
secular leadership that is an obligation of
the Crown, George the Sixth has added also
a spiritual leadership which has been a
bright light in England's darkest hours and
has forged a new bond of understanding and
affection between the sovereign and his
subjects. I feel, honourable senators, that
I am speaking the minds of all members off
this honourable house when I say that our
sympathy for the King in his illness, and for
bis family in their time of anxiety, is born
of deep ties of admiration and affection, and
that it is our most earnest hope that the
progress His Majesty has made towards
recovery since his operation will continue, so
that he may be fully restored to health, long
to reign over his loyal and devoted subjects
in all parts of this great Commonwealth.
The visit of Princess Elizabeth had necessarily to be postponed one week, so that she
might be near her father during the most
anxious period after his operation. We are
glad to take it as an assurance that His
Majesty is well on the road to complete recovery that Her Royal Highness has found it
possible to fulfil her program in Canada, and
that she and her consort are now undertaking the arduous cross-Canada tour planned
for them with complete freedom from
anxiety, so that Princess Elizabeth may enjoy
to the full the many things we wish to show
her with pride, and the evidence of our
affection for the Royal Family which we are
all anxious to display.
I speak on these matters with deeper feeling because I come from an island that you
may know as the tenth province but that we.

who live there and have imbibed from birth
its great traditions, will continue, without
prejudice to our new political associations, to
think of as the Loyal and Ancient Colony, the
Birthplace of the Commonwealth, the First
Jewel in the Crown of Empire. The aircraft
bringing the Princess to Canada was intended
to fly non-stop, but I was pleased indeed to
note that, as a gesture which my fellow
Newfoundlanders also have much appreciated,
there was a brief halt at Gander, so that the
oldest colony and the newest province was
the first part of Canada to welcome our royal
visitors, as it will also be the province that
will bid them farewell and Godspeed. May
I add, honourable senators, that I am convinced that in Canada Her Royal Highness
will find a people keenly appreciative of the
part played by the Royal Family in creating
a common bond between us and all other
members of the Commonwealth? The King
is our sovereign. The Princess is our princess.
They have set us a noble example of service
at its highest and most devoted level, of
which we cannot fail to take note, and which
I am sure it will be our earnest and anxious
pleasure to recognize in the warmth and affectionate nature of the welcome which has
greeted and will continue to greet this charming royal couple throughout the length and
breadth of this great land.
Speaking as a Newfoundlander, I may say
further that we who came from that birthplace of civilization on the shores of the new
world are actively cultivating a great pride
in this vast new nation of which we have so
recently become a part. It may be said that
Canada is like a great joint stock company,
and I assure you that no people throughout
the length and breadth of this land are more
prepared to assume unlimited liability
towards the Canadian way of life than are
the people of the newest province. Never in
the history of our country has there been a
greater need for faith and loyal service than
at the present moment. Never did this nation
and the Commonwealth, of which it is so
important a part, require so urgently the
strenuous and united support of all its members. In the present terribly uncertain state
of international affairs an active vigilance is
more than ever necessary as the price of
liberty.
But, while we on our part are fully prepared, even anxious, to do our share in this
partnership of nations, we are at the same
time aware that our new partners have
responsibilities also to us; and while for the
most part we have received a hearty welcome
into the partnership of Confederation, nevertheless some of the great utility corporations
of Canada seem slow to recognize us as being
entitled to equal rights and privileges with

OCTOBER 18, 1951
the other provinces. If any honourable senators have had occasion to telephone to Newfoundland, no doubt they were astonished to
find that ours is still an overseas service, and
that we are an outside country just as we
were prior to confederation. It is more than
possible that honourable senators are not
aware of the wide spread existing between
long distance telephone rates obtaining
throughout the mainland of Canada and those
applied to Newfoundland. It is true that we
are separated from the mainland by a comparatively small body of water, about as wide,
shall I say, as those separating Prince Edward
Island and Vancouver Island from the mainland; yet nobody ever hears "overseas service"
mentioned when he calls anyone on either of
those islands. The story is to be found for
all to read in the table of rates contained in
every Bell Telephone directory. The minimum charge for a long distance call from
Ottawa to Vancouver at night or on Sunday
is $3.10, and the daytime minimum is $4.60.
In comparison, the flat minimum toll from
Ottawa to Newfoundland, which as the crow
flies is much closer to Ottawa than the
Pacific coast, is $7.50-the same as the charge
payable for calls to Bermuda and the
Bahamas. It costs more, for instance, for
anyone in another Maritime Province-like
New Brunswick, for instance-to telephone
Newfoundland, or for us to call them, than
it costs to telephone from New Brunswick to
Victoria, a distance more than four times as
great. And the same proportional rates apply
when we communicate by telephone back and
forth with Ottawa. These rates are exorbitant and ridiculous.
In a word, after more than two years of
confederation, trans-Atlantic telephone tolls
are still in force between Newfoundland and
the mainland. Yet no other province is
included in the overseas service of the telephone company. The service is operated by
radio-telephone from Montreal and the reason
for this excessive rate is, as you probably
know, a monopoly enjoyed by Marconi under
a concession granted by the Commission of
Government in about 1936 or 1937 for thirty
years. It seems to me that this concession is
so obviously against the public interest that
it ought to be cancelled or modified. I regret
that a clause about telecommunication rates,
like that on freight rates, was not included
in the terms of union. I propose that steps
be taken without delay to abolish a discrimination which is, to put it mildly, unfair,
unjust and unnecessary.
The question of long distance telephone
rates has always been a contentious one in
Newfoundland, for-there is probably no other
part of Canada where telephone facilities
are as important as they are in the tenth

province. Newfoundland, because of its geographic location, is far removed from mainland centres of commerce and industry and,
to keep the wheels of business turning
smoothly in the island, it is necessary to maindirect communication with
tain constant
mainland sources of supply. If this were not
done, if long distance telephones were not
used, Newfoundland's businessmen would be
placed at a disadvantage, as they would find
it impossible to keep abreast of changing
market prices and conditions, and they would
frequently find themselves loaded down with
merchandise and provisions which they could
not afford to sell competitively; or, if many
merchants were affected in this fashion at
the same time, the cost of living for all the
people of Newfoundland would suffer.
Also, it is important to remember that many
of Newfoundland's major industries are
wholly dependent, for machinery replacement
parts and other supplies, upon mainland
manufacturers. When a plant breaks down
in Newfoundland it is not merely a matter of
sending to a supplier right on the doorstep
for a replacement. In Newfoundland, such
equipment must come thousands of miles and,
in order to reduce the time involved, the
placing of such orders by long distance telephone has become quite commonplace. But
it has also become quite costly, and some of
our smaller industries, operating on a very
fine margin, just cannot afford the luxury of
calls to mainland centres at today's rate. Consequently, production is reduced, as is employment.
There are dozens of other examples of the
hardship and inconvenience which result
from the present high telephone rates. But,
perhaps most important of all is the fact that
in Newfoundland the telephone can often
mean the difference between life and death.
Internal long distance telephone rates are so
costly as to be prohibitive for most of those
who live in the thousand or more scattered
small settlements around the coast of the
province. Today, the telephone network in
Newfoundland has been extended to many
communities, but the rates still place its service beyond the reach of most. This is an
extremely important consideration. For instance, Newfoundland isolation means that
there are far from enough doctors and nurses
to go around. This means that when illness
strikes in a remote community it is often the
telephone which is the only means of summoning medical aid. Mercy flights to bring
patients to hospital must also be summoned
by telephone, and one such operation may
often entail several calls, running into a sizeable sum of money. The doctor and the plane
costs are usually borne by the government,
but the people themselves must stand the

SENATE
cost of the long distance calls, and usually
it is considerable. In Newfoundland the telephone can help to save lives, and it frequently
does, but much more could be done if the
rates were brought into line.
Of course, too, there is one workaday but
important job that the telephone could do in
Newfoundland if prices were more reasonable.
It could help to eliminate isolation. If our
people, who live in these remote coves and
villages, far removed from large centres of
population could only communicate with
one another easily and inexpensively, the
entire pattern of their lives would be changed.
They would not be so cut off from one
another. They would have an opportunity
to talk back and forth-to learn what is going
on in other neighbourhoods, and it would
be much easier for them to do business with
one another. If the rates for long distance
telephone were lowered to permit such a
development, it is a certainty that the
increased business would more than make
up for the original loss of revenue.
Before I conclude these remarks today I
must refer briefly to a matter that is causing
the deepest possible apprehension not in
Newfoundland alone, but in all the Atlantic
provinces: I mean the new railway freight
rates legislation that is to come before us.
Speaking as a Newfoundlander, I will confess
frankly to you that the Newfoundland people
had no idea, before their country became
a province of Canada, of the life-and-death
importance of freight rates in the economy
of a province. Being somewhat to blame,
perhaps-if one may call it blame-for the
union of Newfoundland with Canada, I feel
the responsibility rather heavily. It is true
that some of us had occasionally heard echoes
of freight-rate discussions and debates in the
Maritime Provinces, but the echoes were
rather weak by the time they reached us and
we paid very little attention to them. Our
fiýrst rude awakening came after we became a
province, when we found that the railway
freight rates defined in the Terms of Union
were not in fact given us. It took a long
and expensive effort by the Government of
Newfoundland to give effect to the principle
so clearly laid down in the Terms of Union.
In the meanwhile the people of Newfoundland
had lost some millions of dollars in freight
charges.
We had no sooner recovered from that blow
than this latest iniquity confronted us. This
present proposal, if carried into law, will cost
the people of Newfoundland millions of
dollars a year. It will drive the cost of living
to unreachable heights; it will cripple our
existing manufacturing industries, and strike
a death blow at our many new and projected

industries. It will be resisted by the government and people of Newfoundland by all the
means within their power-and when I say
"all the means" I speak the simple truth. Only
a coward accepts assassination without fighting, and the government and people of Newfoundland are not cowards. I believe I can
today inform this house and the people of
Canada as a whole that before the people of
Newfoundland accept a proposal that would
raise freight rates from 50 per cent to 100
per cent above present levels, they will fight
with a ferocity and an unconventionality not
often seen in this Canadian nation. My words
are extreme, but so is the danger to my province and to the other provinces of the
Atlantic.
Honourable senators, I move the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate

While I am on my feet I should like to
make a few impersonal remarks about the
proposed legislation to deal with freight rates.
As the honourable gentleman from Bonavista
(Hon. Mr. Petten) has emphasized this afternoon, this is a most serious problem and, in
my opinion, it chiefly concerns the fringes of
Canada-the East and the West-and also
the Prairie Provinces. This legislation is to
be referred to the Committee on Transport
and Communications, and if my arithmetic
is correct eight of the seventeen senators on
that committee come from Ontario and
Quebec, two provinces that I did not think
had any transportation problems at all. I just
wanted to make that observation.

CANADA'S PARTICIPATION IN PEACE
EFFORTS
MOTION

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved:
Resolved, that this House approves the continuation of Canada's participation in the efforts being
made through the United Nations to establish
international peace, and in particular to defeat
aggression and restore peace in Korea, and by the
North Atlantic Treaty Nations to deter aggression
and promote stability and well-being in the North
Atlantic area.

He said: Honourable senators, there is little
I need add by way of explanation to the
wording of this resolution, of which notice
was given.
The subject is not new. Canada has been
associated with the United Nations in the
military operations in Korea, and I am sure
her participation has met with general
approval. This resolution is being introduced
in both Houses of Parliament, and its adoption
will remove all doubt as to the acquiescence
of parliament in the matter of sending Canadian forces out of the country from time to
time.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I have no criticism whatsoever of the motion.
Indeed, I believe that the policy of making
it clear that parliament authorizes military
participation is most appropriate.

I do not consider this a proper time to discuss any phases of the war in Korea or the
proposal to send Canadian troops to Europe.
I expressed myself on the matter of defence
yesterday, and I emphasize my position today.
I do not propose to discuss expenditures for
military purposes because, in the first place,
I am not properly informed, and secondly, I
would not want anything that I or my associates might say to suggest in the slightest
degree that there should be any hesitancy on
the part of the people of Canada about standing four-square against aggression, whether it
be in Korea or elsewhere.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the opening of the session and the motion of Hon. Mr. Vien for an
Address in reply thereto.
Hon. Mr. Petten (Continuing): Honourable
senators, having thrown down all kinds of
metaphorical gauntlets yesterday, I think I
will be very quiet, dull and prosaic this
afternoon.
As Canada moves forward into the second
half of the 20th century with a new vigour
and dignity to play her role among the free
nations of the world in forging a pattern for
enduring peace, it will become more apparent
to some, whose vision may yet be obscured
by prejudice or ignorance, that the act of
Newfoundland in joining confederation augmented the jurisdiction of the parliament of
this country over the northern half of the
North American continent, excepting Alaska,
and thus enhanced the national stature of
the Dominion.
It has been said before, and bears repeating, that the justly-proud claim to Canadian
domain represented in the inscription carved
in stone over the entrance to the Peace Tower
of these Houses of Parliament-"The wholesome sea is at her gates, Ier gates both East
and West"-became a reality only when Newfoundland joined confederation on April 1,
1949. Prior to that date Canada deferred to
Newfoundland, in the right of the United
Kingdom, on all international questions
involving the waters of the northwestern
Atlantic and the territorial waters of Newfoundland. Today the Government of Canada
has the sole authority and responsibility for
entering into international discussions and
formulating policies in respect of the interests
of Canada where other nations are concerned.
With Newfoundland in confederation as the
tenth province, the Parliament of Canada
gained the exclusive right to approve treaty
commitments or other international agreements in respect of the territory of Newfoundland, including Labrador, and the territorial
waters and international waters adjacent
thereto. The physical assets which accrue to
Canada with confederation include that vast
empire of natural resources, Labrador, with

110,000 square miles of territory, a part of the
mainland of Canada contiguous to the province of Quebec and formerly the sovereign
territory of Newfoundland; the 42,700 square
miles of land which comprise the island of
Newfoundland itself, with its 6,000 miles of
coastline; the hundreds of thousands of square
miles of continental shelf, detached and
semi-detached
from
its shores,
which
embraces the greatest potential fishery of the
world; the vast, almost immeasurable reaches
of forest, sustaining the largest pulp and paper
operations in the British Commonwealth, only
the fringes of which have yet been exploited;
the tens of thousands of square miles of rugged glacial terrain only now giving up,
through discovery by scientific means, the
secrets concealed down through the centuries
of hitherto unbelieved mineral resources
of iron, pyrite, gypsum, magnetite, asbestos,
coal, copper, lead and zinc; the fabulous
resources of water power, and many magnificent harbours.
Above and beyond any material benefits in
natural resources or in the greater powers
vested in the Parliament of Canada which
accrue to the Dominion as a result of confederation, is the strength which arises from

the 350,000 people who inhabit Newfoundland,
becoming thereby citizens of Canada by
choice. The most enduring asset of any
nation is the rich character, industry and
spiritual asset of its people. Here are a people
of English, Irish and Scottish descent who not
only retain the virtues of their ancestral
traits, but have added to them the rich qualities of perseverance, tolerance, adventure
and independence which the demands of the
country have engraved upon their character.
More than one hundred thousand persons in
Newfoundland depend directly upon the
fisheries for a livelihood; another one hundred
thousand depend upon them indirectly for
their living. Seventy-five per cent of the total
economy of Newfoundland hinges primarily
upon the harvests of the sea.
Ever since I gained the honour and distinction of having a seat in this chamber, it
has been my privilege to listen to the debates
of the honourable senators from various parts
of Canada, covering many subjects, and
thereby to assimilate and reach an understanding of the diversified and intricate
problems relating to the economic and social
welfare of the people of this Dominion.
Honourable senators, then, will bear with me
if I venture to express disappointment over
the fact that, in the debates in this chamber
and in the House of Commons on questions
involving the primary industries of agriculture, fishing, mining and lumber, concern for

OCTOBER 19, 1951

SENATE
Newfoundland was already old in history
when the development of the Canadian
nation was still in embryo, and deep are the
scars of the struggle for settlement against
the resistance of non-resident overlords. By
sheer courage and dogged determination the
forebears of Newfoundland's present population battled their way for a place in the
sun, defied oppression and made their way
to establish homes and gain the freedom to
wrest their way of life from the sea. Today
more than one-third of the total landed
weight of fish produced in Canada annually
is taken from the waters off the shores of
Newfoundland by more than twenty thousand
Newfoundland fishermen.
The production of fish is to the economy of
Newfoundland what the production of grain
is to the prairie provinces. This is true also
of some areas of the coast of Nova Scotia,
New Brunswick, Quebec and Prince Edward
Island where, as in Newfoundland, the
economy is based upon fish, or nothing. In
that day when the energies of Canada were
concentrated on the vast agricultural development of the West, with its accrued benefits
to industrial Ontario and Quebec, the claims
made by the Maritime Provinces that thousands of citizens residing on the frontier coastline of Canada's Atlantic seaboard were being
by-passed in the concentration of effort on
the great Canadian West were ineffective. Had
it not been for the accident of history, which
precluded Newfoundland from joining Confederation 80 years ago, the concentrated
fisheries economy of Newfoundland, added
to the claims of the Maritimes and Quebec,
would have presented a much more formidable case before the parliaments of this
country for equal treatment of the development of fisheries with the development of
agriculture, mining and forests in the West.
Development of the fisheries at that time
would unquestionably have progressed at such
a pace that today the fishing fleets plying in
the waters of the Northwestern Atlantic
would have been predominantly of Canadian
registry. Instead it is the reverse. More
than two hundred deep-sea fishing craft of
Portugal, Spain, Italy, France, the United
States and other countries dominate the
Grand Banks, which geographically and
economically are more natural to the economy
of North America than to the economy of
countries who exploit these vast natural
resources at high costs from across the
Atlantic. The combined Canadian deep-sea
fishing fleet comprises only about ninety
vessels.
It is fortunate, indeed, that on the eve of
the greatest need for assured supplies of fish
to meet the diminishing supplies of animal

protein from agricultural production on a
world-wide scale, Canada has at the helm of
the State a man whose statesmanship and
candour engender confidence.
From the
beginning of his parliamentary career, the
Right Honourable Louis St. Laurent, Prime
Minister, has evidenced keen understanding
and knowledge of and concern for the development of fisheries. During the discussions
which preceded the Terms of Union under
which Newfoundland came into confederation,
it was a source of delight to the Newfoundland delegation that in the Prime Minister
they found a man with a breadth of knowledge and understanding of the fisheries, and
particularly a full grasp of the social side of
the problem to be faced in Newfoundland. As
well as in parts of Quebec and the Maritime
Provinces, in gearing the fisheries economy to
provide the opportunity for fishermen to earn
a just wage and the industry to make a fair
return on capital invested.
Flanking the Prime Minister in these negotiations leading up to the Terms of Union, the
Minister of Fisheries, The Honourable R. W.
Mayhew, played a leading part, and I would
pause to pay tribute to the wisdom, judgment and fine business principles which have
predominated that minister's dealings with
fisheries problems in Newfoundland since it
joined confederation. The problems entailed
in integrating the fisheries administration in
Newfoundland with Canada are not simple,
nor does the future hold great hope that the
deeply entrenched habits, customs, traditions, private prerogatives, and some bad
habits, if you will, can be changed quickly to
keep pace with the North American economy.
The entente cordiale which has been maintained between the Department of Fisheries
and the Government of Newfoundland can
in no small measure be attributed directly to
the qualities of statesmanship of the Honourable R. W. Mayhew and Premier J. R.
Smallwood. These two leaders co-operated
closely in the establishing of the Fisheries
Development Committee of Newfoundland
under the chairmanship of Sir Albert Walsh,
K.C., thereby providing a most encouraging
example of very active federal-provincial
relations. The committee has been charged
with the task of recommending a program for
fisheries development in Newfoundland, and
also the share of responsibility to be borne
by the two governments, by the industry and
by fishermen in carrying it out.
It might well be that the creation of the
Fisheries Development Committee of Newfoundland can be taken as evidence that the
hiatus of 80 years during which Newfoundland has not narticipated in the economy of
Canada is to be bridged, and that the full
energies of the governments of Canada and

OCTOBER 19, 1951
Newfoundland will shortly be dedicated to
the proposition of speedily providing the
assistance necessary to enable the Newfoundland fishermen to prosecute the sea fishery
with the same vigour, vitality, vision and
achievement as obtained when, a century
ago, the energies of Canada were placed
behind the vast agricultural development of
Western Canada. Even as one of the western
agricultural provinces might suffer from economic circumstances or the vagaries of nature,
or other causes beyond their control, reflecting adversely upon the economy of their
neighbouring province, so too in Newfoundland, or Nova Scotia, or New Brunswick, or
Prince Edward Island, or Quebec, adverse
conditions in the fisheries in any one province
would reflect similar difficulties upon other
provinces and, in fact, upon the whole of the
Atlantic fisheries.
With the development of modern plants for
processing fresh and frozen fish fillets, with
speedy refrigerated transportation and handling facilities enabling consumer packages of
these commodities to be offered for sale in
markets from the metropolitan centres down
to the smallest hamlets throughout the United
States and Canada, with the advent of modern
devices for navigation and the detecting of
fish populations, the discovery of new fishing
grounds and new species of fish, the development of modern fishing vessels, gear and
equipment, and modern techniques for processing for both food and non-food uses, the
yet undeveloped fishery resources of the
Northwest Atlantic offer Canada the greatest
potential source of protein food since the Red
River wagons blazed the trails which led to
the opening up of the vast agricultural lands
of Western Canada.
Settled in more than 1,300 communities
along 6,000 miles of coastline, in Newfoundland and parts of Labrador 20,000 fishermen,
representing a population of over 100,000
souls, prosecute the inshore fisheries by
methods which are today little changed from
those which prevailed when John Cabot
discovered Newfoundland 400 years ago.
These people represent the fifth, sixth, seventh
and eighth generations born in Newfoundland.
Their homes are their castles. They are
hardy resolute and independent. They represent the families from whence came the
captains of the schooners and barquentines
that plied the trade lanes of ýthe world
before Canada's t.rade was born, the men
who rounded Cape Horn to play a leading part
in the development of the fisheries on the
Pacific coast. These are the families whence
came the thousands of men who today hold
positions of prominence in law, in education,
in medicine, in science, in art, and who settled
in the metropolitan centres and in the small

towns and. villages of the United States and
Canada. These are the people who decided
that their native Newfoundland should join
confederation, assuming thereby the responsibility of making their contribution to the
affairs of Canada, and expecting in return
that the Government of Canada would do
justice by them. These are the tens of
thousands of families who today face sharply
up to the proposition of changing their
methods of fishing to meet the modern demand
for low-cost volume production in a world
geared to mass production techniques. These
are the people who live in widely scattered
and decentralized communities, incapable
themselves of bringing about the change
which would enable them to maintain a
standard of living equal to that prevailing
in Canada generally, and to contribute to their
community, to their church and to the state,
and uphold the dignity of the individual person. They are not responsible for the dislocation of world trade which precludes the sale
of their product on an historical basis, nor
is it within their power, without guidance,
leadership, direction, scientific research and
engineering, and financial assistance, to bring
about the continued production of a large
proportion of the world's demand for salt
fish which is essential to the welfare of
consumers abroad.
Perhaps it is not too great a stretch of the
imagination to believe that in 1952, in the
program to be recommended by the Newfoundland Fisheries Development Committee, a formula will be prescribed through
which the Government of Canada and the
Government of Newfoundland, co-operating
with the industry and the fishermen, can
bring about an integrated development, sustained where necessary by the financial
resources of the governments and of risk
capital, to the end that this bountiful resource
and necessary source of human food will be
maintained and developed on a basis in keeping with modern standards. It may require
financial assistance to enable the development
of new and improved types of boats, gear and
equipment, to provide centralized handling
and processing facilities in order to bring
about concentration of effort in producing
salt codfish of the highest quality at minimum
cost. It may require building programs and
the encouragement of ancillary industries on
much the same lines, and on no less a scale
than the development undertaken in the Tennessee Valley and in the Mississippi rehabilitation projects of the United States, or other
similarly great efforts which stand today as
a monument to the genuine unselfish effort
of men dedicated to the proposition that if
a free world is to obtain, and democracy
survive, an equality of opportunity must be

SENATE

established whereby men will have the incentive to work so that their families may
prosper.
Under the Terms of Union of Newfoundland in confederation, a five-year period was
provided to enable the integration of relationships between the Government of Canada
and the Government of Newfoundland, and to
bring about a blending of the economy of
Newfoundland into the pattern prevailing
in Canada. More than half of this five-year
period bas elapsed. The benefits that have
accrued to the people of Newfoundland
through the social legislation of family allowances, old age pensions and unemployment
insurance have had a great influence upon the
way of life in that province. The older
people feel now that they do not need to fear
age, and as of the lst of January next, when
the means test will be abolished, this feeling
will be even more widespread. Labourers no
longer fear unemployment brought about
through no fault of their own, and they
jealously guard against any abuse of this
social service. Mothers of large families no
longer have the fear of want, for the family
allowance assures minimum sustenance, if
need be, in time of stress. In facing up to
the problem of determining the future welfare of the people engaged in the codfish
industry of Newfoundland, it may be that,
viewed in its true perspective, the task of
integrating the Newfoundland fisheries into
the economy of Canada will require the kind
of treatment that was accorded during the
development of Canada's great agricultural
West and down through the decades when
fabulous sums of money were spent by the
Government of Canada and deemed to be in
the interests of the nation.
During the past two years the Government
of Newfoundland has given financial assistance in supporting loans and guaranteeing
bond issues to the extent of approximately
$3 million in aid of the fisheries, for the purchase of modern fishing vessels and the
development of modern processing and refrigeration plants. Private enterprise bas spent
in the same time upwards of $3 million, and
plans yet in blueprint envision millions more
of risk capital seeking the opportunity of
participating in the development of Newfoundland's fresh and fresh-frozen industry.
Neither the Government of Newfoundland,
nor private or co-operative enterprise is
standing still, as beggars, waiting for alms.
They move forward, and the best brains of
the country are concentrating now on devising the means of placing the fishing industry
of Newfoundland in a position to capitalize
on the opportunities afforded through the
support and assistance that is envisioned from

the Government of Canada. In Newfoundland it is not as if the fisheries were, as in
the case of other provinces, third, fourth,
fifth, sixth or lower down the scale of importance to the general economy. The fisheries
potential of Newfoundland is the potential
of the eastern seaboard fisheries of Canada.
Very little is yet known of the resources of
the shore fisheries of Newfoundland. Biological research is again under way, but
much greater effort in this direction is warranted. Within the last two years Canada
bas joined with other nations in a treaty
under which the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries
Commission has been established, the purpose of which, in the beginning, is to bring
about biological research and other studies
leading to the full utilization of the vast
fisheries resources of the international waters
adjacent to the shores of Newfoundland. It
is our fervent hope that the headquarters
of this Commission will be located in St.
John's.
Within the last two years the Government
of Canada has assumed an important role in
the administration of the production and
conservation of fisheries in Newfoundland,
which is the responsibility of the federal
government. It will take time to bring about
the integration enabling the statutes of
Canada to be promulgated in respect to the
fisheries, and concurrently the Government
of Newfoundland will be considering the
nature of provincial legislation and enabling
laws necessary to administrative co-ordination.
Through the Fisheries Research Board of
Canada, a fine example of experimental fishing bas been conducted for the past two years
with substantial proof that long line fishing
can be utilized to give more mobility and
greater opportunity to fishermen located in
areas where this method of fishing can be
successfully conducted.
Concurrently the
Government of Newfoundland is spending
large sums of money in doing its share of
experimental fishing and exploration of fish
populations.
When one reflects upon the problems which
face the Honourable R. W. Mayhew, Minister
of Fisheries, in coping with situations that
exist in fisheries from the Pacific to the
Atlantic, one realizes the magnitude of his
task. His guiding hand and the advice of his
technical experts played a large part in protecting the Pacifie Coast Fisheries of Canada
within the terms of the Peace Treaty recently
concluded with Japan. The activities of the
department, through representation in the
Councils of FAO of the United Nations, in the
International Whaling Commission, in the
Pelagic Sealing Treaty, in the problems which
arise in that widely scattered and largest

all appreciate, too, the contribution made
by the mover. It required outstanding ability
to construct a speech such as he delivered.
I also want to join with those who have
expressed their loyalty and devotion to the
members of the Royal Family; and, with
others, to voice the hope that our King will
soon regain his normal health.
The production of oil in Alberta has given
rise to almost world-wide attention. The
Conservation Committee in that province will
allow only so much oil to be produced, but
existing wells can produce and have produced
as much as 170,000 barrels of crude oil a
day. In fact, one field, alone, the Redwater
field, has produced 90,000 barrels a day. What
that means in this era of airplanes and automobiles may readily be understood. There is
no doubt that the present great demand for
oil fuel will be continued and increased.
The provincial government is fortunate,
because it owns 93 per cent of the oil rights
in the whole province. Any company can
go to the provincial government and lease
the rights on almost any number of acres
by paying in advance one dollar an acre and
signing an agreement to start exploration
immediately. If the company strikes oil, it
is given three months in which to draw out
a diagram of its lease in alternate blocks in
checkerboard fashion. The company goes
ahead with production and pays land rent
to the farm owner for disturbing his farm.
The company also has to pay the government
a royalty of about 14 per cent on all oil it
produces. The company retains half of the
blocks in its lease; the alternate blocks revert
to the government, which auctions them off
to the highest bidder. If any company is
cautious and does not wish to explore an
unproven field, it can buy the rights to one
of these blocks. Companies sometimes pay
a million dollars for one of these blocks, and
drill in what is practically a proven field.
Precautions have been taken to see that flyby-night operators do not put down a well
and siphon off the oil from somebody else's
well. The government endeavours to give
protection by normally permitting only one oil
well on each forty acres. This system has been
found to work in Texas, and it appears to be
working successfully in Alberta.
While drilling for oil, sometimes going

inland fisheries of the world, which stretches
from the Great Lakes through Ontario and
the three Prairie Provinces to the North West
Territories, and in the administration of the
Fisheries Prices Support Board, are but some
of those which can be mentioned. All of
these matters and many more, are dealt with
by the Minister of Fisheries, and he takes
them in his stride as a seasoned statesman.
We in Newfoundland are aware that not the
least of the problems the minister has had to
face in recent times is one related to the use
of water power in British Columbia and other
parts of the dominion, including Newfoundland, where hydro development could well
threaten the propagation of salmon species
which spawn at the headwaters of the rivers
that are their habitat in the early period of
their life cycle.
I am sure that my words echo the sentiments of all of the people of Newfoundland
in saying that we have confidence that the
magnitude and importance of the fisheries of
Newfoundland are fully recognized among
the administrative heads of the Government
of Canada. Because of its significance, I
venture to hope that the Honourable Senators and members in the other place wil rise
to every occasion which may be presented
to them to recognize that the bond in confederation can only be as strong as the confidence of the people.
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
I venture to take part in this debate for one
reason and one reason only, and that is to
urge the government to increase during the
present session the basic war pensions. It
seems to me that those whose health has been
broken by the stress and the strain of war
service, those who are disabled by wounds
received in battle, and perhaps particularly,
the dependents of those who have made the
supreme sacrifice, should be paid more at this
present time, when the cost of everything
they have to buy is so greatly increased. I
realize that nothing can repay these people
for what they have contributed. I recognize
also that others on fixed pensions are having
a hard time. But I have always felt that
the ex-service men and women were the last
who should be asked to undergo another
sacrifice.
I have just learned that in the other place
the Minister of Veterans' Affairs has made
the following announcement:

the wholesale exportation of gas, although
it does permit some to be exported to the
United States for war purposes. Naturally
the people in the province want to encourage
industries to come in, and, indeed, some
large industries have been attracted by the
low rates for gas.
Honourable senators, there is one other
subject about which I wish to speak. The
Province of Alberta lies close to the foothills
and the ranges of the Rockies, and the rivers
which flow eastward over that province have
their origin in the eastern watershed of the
Rocky Mountains. It has been found, of
course, that the highest peaks catch the most
moisture, but it has also been found that in
places where the slopes and valleys are well
forested, and where there is vegetation, the
accumulation of rainfall is 25 per cent greater
than on treeless terrain. I would point out
that moisture is of such great value that the
provincial and federal governments, acting
together, have taken vigorous steps to protect
the vegetation and the forests on the eastern
slope of the Rockies, so that there will be a
more abundant supply of water for irrigation
purposes.
In order to store the water which flows
down the eastern slopes, the Dominion
Government has constructed a very large
reservoir at St. Mary's Dam. This reservoir
is from five to six miles wide and sixteen to
seventeen miles in length, and holds a tremendous body of water. The official opening of the St. Mary's Dam was a colourful
event, and marked a great step forward in the
history of irrigation. A platform was erected
and thousands of people from the neighbouring countryside gathered to witness the opening ceremony. The Indians from the nearby
Blood Reservation, who came on their ponies
dressed in all their gaudy colours, added a
great deal to the scene. The Minister of
Agriculture, the Right Honourable Mr.
Gardiner, was inducted into the Blood Indian
Tribe under the name of Thunder Chief. He
also was honoured by being allowed to dance
with Mrs. Shot-in-Both-Sides, who happens
to be the wife of the Chief of the Tribe. I
may say that our popular colleague from
Lethbridge carried out his part of the program with great dignity. There was also
another group who came from the neighbouring desert of Medicine Hat. They were
dressed in the costume of those ancient people,
the Arabs, and added much to the novelty,
dignity and impressiveness of the whole
ceremony. They did all the necessary bowing
and praying, and their prayer being that
irrigation be brought as rapidly as possible
to the desert from whence they had come.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, dressed
in their gold and scarlet, were there too, and
they brought a band with them from Regina
which provided music for the day. The whole
event was one that will be remembered for
a long time by those who were fortunate
enough to be present.
This irrigation project will change the
whole situation in the southern part of the
province. It will provide water for about
a half million acres of land. The federal
government installed the reservoirs and connecting canals, and put up about half the
cost, which will not be recoverable directly.
The province put up the other half and will
distribute the water to the farms. The provincial government will, of course, recover
quite a lot of money from the settlers. There
is no question that productivity will be
increased. The land at present is range land,
and it takes about thirty or forty acres to
feed one animal. A family can now eke out
a bare existence on 640 acres, but when part
of the land is irrigated, eighty acres will
provide a good living for a family of five.
More than that it will provide the people with
a community life, which in those sparsely
settled districts is but a dream at the present
time. These irrigation structures are of a
permanent nature. They will be a great
blessing not only to the people of the present
age but to the people of the future. Some
4,000 years ago a canal was built in Egypt,
and that canal is still supplying water to the
thirsty soil, and the people in the Land of
the Pyramids have many times been saved
from destruction and famine by the water
from this canal. Irrigation in Canada will
pay its dividends too, because it will enable
the people to produce much more food; and
wherever food can be obtained in abundance,
there people will settle in great numbers.
Some of those who settle on these irrigated
lands are in need of long-term loans. The
banks do not provide such loans, and it seems
that the Farm Loan Board is afraid both
of dry land and irrigated land in that district.
I am told that not a single loan has been made
within 100 miles of where I live. I do wish
that some representative of the Farm Loan
Board would go to that area, for if he did
he would find that 90 per cent of the farmers
working irrigated land under present conditions can meet their obligations when they
become due.
In closing, I should like to pay tribute to
those enterprising men and women who risk
their capital to drill deeply for oil. It is
fortunate that they have received such good
results; they have brought to the surface
a very valuable asset.

OCTOBER 19, 1951
I also wish to pay tribute to the Right
Honourable Mr. Gardiner for what he has
done to help further the irrigation works in
the West. He has gone out to, that part of
the country many times to inspect the situation for himself; he has given freely of his
Urne; and he has induced the goverrnment to
advance the capital cost of these works,
which will bring happiness and contentment
to large numbers of our people.

I still have to wink my eyes. In British
Columbia we witnessed a peculiar incident.
There were so many photographers present
a a certain affair that the police began to
push them back; and afterwards, by way of
protest, the photographers staged a sit-down
strike. To my mmd it was plainly ridiculous
and childish for photographers to feel peeved
because of an attempt to prevent them interfering unduly with
the royal couple's
activities

NOVEMBER 6, 1951
Having mentioned His Majesty the King
and the royal tour, I should perhaps say
something about the recent general election
in Great Britain. I think that those of us
who know anything at all about events over
there will not only congratulate the new
Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Winston Churchill, but will also extend to him
our sympathy in the great task that confronts
him and his government in endeavouring to
rectify the results of the six years of what
I would call experimental rule. During those
six years many British people were living
in a false heaven, so to speak. They were
certainly living mostly on borrowed money,
and I doubt whether they could have carried
on but for the help received from the United
States and this country. Although approximately $3 billion a year was paid out in
Britain for subsidies, the cost of living could
not be kept from rising. I think that should
be a lesson to those people who contend that
our government should take steps to reduce
the cost of living by controlling prices. If I
remember correctly, it was a member of the
Social Credit Party in my own city who said
that the new government in Great Britain
would not bring about any change. To my
way of thinking he was entirely wrong. For
one thing, we are going to hear now the
voice of Britain in the councils of the nations;
and I believe no one will contradict my statement that Britain's voice has not been raised
there very loudly in recent years. There are
times when it is necessary for a country's
representatives to use strong words, and I
have no doubt that Mr. Churchill will use
them when necessary.
One of the speakers in this debate dealt
with conditions on the Prairie provinces and
spoke about wheat. He mentioned the weather
on the Prairies and its effect on the growing
of wheat. Of course we have a great deal
of sympathy for the farmers, who depend on
favourable weather for the growth of the
crop which gives them their livelihood.
In passing, I may say a word about the
weather in British Columbia during this past
summer. There was a period of one hundred
days of sunshine without rain. It was the
driest summer I have seen since I went to
that province in 1909. The government sent
some scientists by plane from the city of
Ottawa with a view to bringing rain. Well,
I thought the people of Alberta had learned
a lesson about rainmakers, when they hired a
man by the name of Hatfield, and paid him,
I think, $3,000.
Hon. Mr. Horner: More than that.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I should like to warn the
government against taking such action.
94703-5j

Previous to the arrival in British Columbia
of the so-called rain-makers, a man from
the south of us came and offered to bring
rain for a certain sum of money. Immediately
this was announced the cherry growers notified him that if he was successful they would
sue him, because rain would spoil their crop.
It is indeed dangerous for the government
to attempt to interfere with the weather.
God knows, the government has enough
trouble these days, and it gets blamed for
most things, quite apart from the weather.
When one person wants rain, another may
want dry weather. An incident occurred in
the United States last year involving two
states, one of which sent up some airplanes
to drop dry ice to make rain. While I do
not think this action had any effect on the
weather, rain did fall, and the other state
launched a lawsuit against the rain-making
state, complaining that the rain fell on the
wrong area and not where Nature intended.
From time immemorial attempts have been
made to solve the lack of rain problem. As
good a solution as I have heard of is one
that was offered by a man living in the city
of Calgary. He wrote and said that if the
provincial government in my province would
pay the fares to Vancouver of a club consisting of eight persons, of which he was one,
they would guarantee to bring rain. He
pointed out that this club had observed that
every time they decided to go on a holiday it
always rained, and he was quite sure that if
they arranged a holiday in Vancouver rain
was sure to fall. That rather amusing formula compares favourably in so far as results
are concerened with that of the so-called
rain-makers. But I specifically wish to warn
the government that it should not participate
in such activities, for the good reason that
there are some people who do not want rain,
and it would lead to trouble.
I wish now to return to the subject of
wheat. My information is that in spite of the
unfavourable weather conditions on the
prairies, many elevators are bulging with
wheat. Just before leaving British Columbia to attend the present session I bought
some wheat-I keep a few chickens- and I
paid $3.95 for one hundred pounds of grain
that in former years would have been discarded. I arn perplexed to know why the
people of my province should have to pay
such a price for small, shrunken and generally poor-quality grain. It is time that some
investigation was made to clear up this question. Of course there are those who will
say that the cost of hauling affects the
retail price. Let me point out that as far as
freight rates are concerned, the Dominion

SENATE
Government is at the moment paying all the
transportation costs on feed wheat, so that
does not enter into the matter.
Hon. Mr. Horner: The miller gets milling
wheat for less than that. Why did you not
buy from him?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I would have been prevented
from doing so, and I will tell you why when
we get into a discussion of the bill related
t, freight rates, which is to come before us.
We are in a peculiar position in British
Columbia. Wheat can be bought outside this
country cheaper than it can be bought in
that province, but we cannot get it at the
export rate. At one time I appeared before
the Board of Transport Commissioners and
proved that at one time in the thirties we
could buy Alberta wheat in China, and
it back to British Columbia
transport
cheaper than we could bring it directly to
that province. That information is on the
records of the commission, and can be seen
today. It is all very well to ask a high price
for milling wheat. God knows, the farmers
should get all that is coming to him; but
why we in British Columbia should have to
pay an exorbitant price for poor wheat is
more than I can understand. Certainly, if
we get the grain at a fair price our province
will offer a ready and a growing market for
those wheat-producing areas which today
have storage problems.
The senator from Bonavista (Hon. Mr.
Petten) had something to say about the
danger to fisheries from hydro-electric power
dams. Prior to his remarks I had thought
that the only place where this danger existed
was British Columbia. In our province there
is a huge cartel, or combine, known as the
Aluminum Company of Canada, sometimes
called Alcan.
It has been given by the
provincial government a vast heritage in the
finest water-power site in the entire world. I
make that statement without fear of successful contradiction. I am told that when the
dam is filled it will contain so much water

that there will be plenty for power development during the entire twelve months of the
year. Engineers have informed me that
although application was made for a million
and a half horse-power, the dam, when filled
will easily develop two million horse-power.
I do not propose to enter into a discussion of
the agreement between the provinces-that is
a subject for another time-but I wish to
support the position taken by the senator
from Bonavista (Hon. Mr. Petten).
The International Pacific Salmon Fisheries
Commission, through the government has for
some months been negotiating for a certai.
quantity of water to maintain a species of

salmon called sockeye, which this year
brought $1,500,000 to the fishermen of the
Fraser River and the United States. It has
been pointed out to the Aluminum Company,
and to the government, that unless the water
is maintained at a certain level the streams
through which the salmon go to spawn will
be so low that the adult fish will not be able
to get up to their spawning grounds.
I warn honourable senators of the dangers
of these great cartels. They have no thought
whatsoever of fish. As a matter of fact the
vice-president of this particular company
remarked in the course of a conversation that
for the past thirty years he had been fighting fishing interests. "Our main concern",
he said, "is to produce power for aluminum;
we are not concerned with a few fish or a
few fishermen." One sees the consequences of
that attitude across the line, where the damming of the Columbia to provide hydro-electric power has destroyed sockeye salmon
fishing in that river. We hope that the
Aluminum Company will pay more attention
to the representations which have been made
to them. We believe that there is a place
for power development and for fish as well.
All that is necessary is that power interests
shall be reasonable, not ruthless and greedy,
as they have been whenever and wherever
they wanted to obtain hydro-electric power.
I wish now to speak for a few minutes on
the Japanese peace treaty and the mission
which has just gone to Japan. The honourable
the Minister of Fisheries and the other Canadian delegates are splendid men, but I am
rather perturbed that the United States mission numbers ten, against our five. I have
every confidence in the Minister of Fisheries;
I recognize his wisdom and ability; but the
influence and power of the American mission
are not to be underrated. May I point out
to honourable senators, all of whom may not
have had an opportunity of studying the
terms of the treaty, that it should have contained a provision to prevent the Japanese
fron operating off the Pacific Coast shores
and depleting our fisheries; but American
interests, and notably Mr. Dulles, brushed
aside these considerations. I have had some
experience with Americans on commissions,
and, though I have found them to be splendid
and able men, I am not unmindful of the fact
that they are Americans, and naturally they
keep their eye on United States interests.
While nothing definite can be stated until the
outcome of the deliberations of the committee
now in Japan has been made known, I am
rather concerned, as I have said, about the
size of the United States delegation, and I
believe Canada's representation should have
been numerically equal to theirs. There are
theorists who call themselves economists, who

NOVEMBER 6, 1951
know little and care less about fisheries; and
to refuse the Japanese an opportunity to
deplete the coastal fisheries of this country
does not conform to their kind of dream of
a Utopian world. That is the kind of mentality we have been up agaipst in endeavouring to protect the fisheries interests on the
Pacifie Coast.
There is another reason why I am somewhat perturbed at the present situation. Two
years ago the President of the United States
sent a delegation to Japan to investigate
the fisheries of that country, and to acquaint
themselves with the views of Japanese fishermen and fishing interests. I have before
me a copy of the report they presented to
the President. The delegation point out that
it was made plain to them by every Japanese
fishing association, every fisherman, and
every cannery owner, that it was their intention to fish as widely as possible in the seas
of the world, and that to restrict them would
strangle the economy of their great country.
We must bear in mind that at the Yalta
Conference the United States and Great
Britain agreed to the cession to Soviet Russia
of the southern half of Sakhalin, and thereby
took away the living of 150,000 Japanese
and fishery products worth about $3,000,000
a year; and that the MacArthur line precludes the Japanese from fishing near
Sakhalin. I hold no brief for the Japanese,
as anyone who was in the House of Commons
when I have spoken there concerning them
will know. The honourable senator from
Edmonton (Hon. Mr. MacKinnon) smiles: he
has heard me a good many times in the other
place on this subject. But one must be
fair and look facts in the face. Here is a
nation of 85,000,000 people living in a country
about one-third the size of British Columbia
with a population of only a little over a
million. Before the war about a million
and a half Japanese depended for their
livelihood on the fishing industry. In their
small country they cannot grow enough produce to support their population, so fish has
become their main article of diet. Yet Allied
statesmen handed over to Soviet Russia all
the island of Sakhalin, whose southern half
was ceded to Japan by the Peace Treaty of
1904. And as an extra gift, Russia has
received all the small islands scattered over
700 miles of the Pacific which had belonged
to Japan from time immemorial. We in
British Columbia are somewhat concerned
about these things.
I would remind honourable senators that
Canada has two gateways. Broadly speaking,
until recently general attention has been
directed mainly towards Europe, and very
little regard has been paid to the problems

of the Pacific. In my opinion this is a dangerous attitude: we should take more interest
in what is occurring in the Pacific region, and
in the activities not only of Russia but of
other countries. I trust that the projected
agreement will include not only provision
for protecting our coastal waters but other
matters which I think are serious and important, and I hope that the Canadian delegation
will not back down. The United States would
like to confine Canadian fishermen to coastal
waters, which by the old "cannon-ball law"
extend only three miles from shore. We need
a policy which will preserve our right to
fish on the high seas. But for the agreement
entered into by two countries to preserve
halibut and sockeye salmon there would now
be none left. And there are more things to
be discussed with Japan tan fishing for
halibut, cod or salmon. Her rights under the
whaling convention should be discussed. Then
there is the fur seal fishing off the Pribilof
Islands. At one time the Pribilof Islands,
acquired by the United States in 1876, had a
herd of 5 million seals, but as a result of
ruthless slaughter this herd was eventually
reduced to something like 500,000. Finally
the United States, Russia, Japan, and Canada
reached a sealing agreement, and the herd
was built up to about 4 million seals just
prior to the commencement of the last war.
Incidentally, honourable senators will recall
that just before the last war broke out Japan
signified her intention of withdrawing from
this sealing treaty. According to the terms
of the agreement Canada undertook to prevent
its fishermen from killing seals on the high
seas while the animais were on their way up
to the Pribilof Islands, and in return our
country received three or four hundred thousand dollars a year from the United States
government. All these matters are extremely
important to us. I fully realize that the
United States has been spending something
like $1 billion a year for the last four years
in Japan, and during that period has loaned
Japan some $400 million annually. During
the time that General MacArthur was in
Japan no Canadian could trade with that
country; all trading rights were reserved for
the United States. I suppose the Americans,
because of their huge expenditures in Japan,
felt justified in keeping those rights to themselves. But our businessmen in British Columbia are wondering just where they are going
to stand in matters of Japanese trade now that
that country is on her own, so to speak, and
particularly when the Americans leave
Japan's shores after having looked after that
country for some four or five years.
It is unfortunate, I think, that the treaty
with Japan was not proceeded with despite
the lack of sanction by Sovief Russia, who

SENATE
only declared war on Japan some six days
before that country capitulated. Russia did
nothing at all to help in the overthrow of
Japan, and it was only after the atomic bomb
had been dropped on Hiroshima that Russia
declared her intention of going to war against
Japan. To my mind the United States should
have gone ahead and seen to the signing of
the treaty in 1947. It would have been signed
at that time except for the objections raised
by Soviet Russia, who has endeavoured to
block the making of a treaty during the past
four years. These are important matters.
I wish the delegation from Canada the best
of luck and I trust that when the conditions
of the agreement with Japan are made public,
the points I have just mentioned will be
settled to our advantage. But I am not overlooking two facts: the strength and bulk of the
American commission, ten men as against our
five, and the more important fact that the
Japanese are now sitting with the treaty
practically signed.
It should have been
written into the treaty that the Japanese were
to be prevented from fishing off our shores
and depleting our fisheries. I trust that the
Japanese will be reasonable, for they, unlike
the Canadian and American fishermen who
have taken the precaution to see that our
supplies of halibut, sock-eye salmon and
Pribilof seals have not been destroyed, have
always been exploiters rather than conservationists of fisheries.
I now come to the proposed legislation as
outlined in the Speech from the Throne. I
realize that many of the subjects touched
upon will come before us later in the form of
legislation, and therefore it is not my intention to deal at any length with those matters
now. I should like to make the comment,
however, that the legislative program proposed in the Speech from the Throne is a
little too heavy for the time which has been
allotted to us at this fall session. This
session was called primarily so that parliament could deal with what we may call a
universal pension, but the Throne Speech proposes legislation dealing with freight rates,
the C.B.C. and other matters. I think honourable senators will agree with me that it
is going to take every minute of our time to
get through this agenda before Christmas,
and I trust that the many important pieces
of legislation will not be dilly-dallied with
until the dying hours, so that an honourable
senator will not be looked upon as committing a crime should he rise in his place and
ask questions or take objection to any phase
of the legislation.
I should like to make mention of something
with regard to the sending of Canadian troops
to Europe. I wonder how many of my colleagues received a small booklet entitled

Canada Off To Europe?
I would advise
honourable senators to read this booklet,
because in my opinion it is one of the finest
instruction
pamphlets
any
government
department bas ever put out. It instructs
our soldiers how to conduct themselves when
they are in European countries, and stresses
the fact that they should not forget that they
are acting in the capacity of Canadian ambassadors. I want to commend the government
department which published this booket.
We in British Columbia are watching the
St. Lawrence Waterway proposal, because
it is our view that when this undertaking
is completed all the provinces will bear its
cost but the great benefit will go to perhaps
one province. It will place a greater burden
on the railways because of the loss of railway traffic, and we are a little afraid that
this loss of traffic from the great industrial
province of Ontario will result in the railways increasing freight rates elsewhere. In
my opinion freight rates affect only eight
provinces, and in support of this statement
may I draw your attention to the fact that
in the last rate increase of 21 per cent asked
for by the railways, the two great provinces
of Canada made no protest or took no apparent interest whatsoever because of the
competition provided by water transportation
and trucking transportation in these provinces. The result of this is that the railways
give the provinces of Ontario and Quebec
cheaper freight rates than were given to the
other eight provinces.
This special session was called to deal
principally with what is known as the universal pension. Legislation on this matter
will come before us later on, so I am not
going to deal extensively with it just now,
but I believe it is important to make one or
two remarks on the subject. Personally I
wish the government had done away with the
means test entirely for people at sixty-five
as well as for those at seventy. Any who
have had dealings with the means test must
have realized the reluctance which many
people feel in answering searching questions asked them by investigators and on
forms that have to be signed. And if, as is
generally agreed, the dollar today is worth
only 50 cents as compared with the 1939
dollar, will anyone say that $40 a month is
enough for a needy person in this country?
I cannot enthuse greatly over the granting
of $40 a month to the well-to-do and wealthy.
There is a question, I know, of treating everyone alike, but under the proposed system
I doubt if anyone who is now fifty years of
age or over can pay in all that he will
receive or be entitled to receive. I am also
opposed to placing a limit of $60 on the tax.
I may be alone in the Senate in holding

NOVEMBER 6, 1951
this opinion, but I should have liked the
government to take the forward step of
making pensions available to persons of
sixty-five and over without a means test,
and placing the pensions on a contributory
basis, in the real sense of that term. Although
I have not the figures, I believe that if all
incomes above the exempted level had been
made subject to a straight tax of 2 per cent,
the amount received from this source might
have been sufficient to pay the whole shot.
I may be wrong in this, but when the bill
is before us we shall no doubt have an
opportunity to get the information.
At present there are in Canada 320,000
persons in receipt of a monthly pension of
$40-it is $50 in British Columbia and
another province-and all these people have
been subjected to the means test. The new
legislation is not going to help that class.
And among the 380,000 who the Honourable
the Minister of National Health and Welfare
says will Scome under the new scheme of
pensions payable at age seventy there will
be many to whom the pension will be just
so much more "pin money." Is that desirable, with conditions and prices as they are
today? And who dare say that the present
high prices will not rise? In my opinion
prices may be higher next year than they are
today. The Civil Service is going to get a
raise, the unions are beginning to ask for
more money, and I cannot see how prices of
goods can remain stationary while wages and
salaries are going up.
Despite the present high prices we may look
back next year upon 1951 as being not too
bad. I say that because, after all, we must
differentiate between high prices and inflation. The $325 million to $350 million which
will go out next year, starting on the lst of
January, may cause a rush of spending that
may very well increase inflation, but which
certainly will not tend to bring down prices.
I believe the cost of living is going to remain
high for some time to come. I commend to
honourable senators a splendid suggestion
which was recently made by the American
Federation of Labour, that its members, if
given an increase in wages, would be willing to produce more. I think that is the
first ray of hope that has been cast on the
dark economic situation for some considerable time. Certainly up to the present it
has not been a usual thing for a branch of
organized labour to promise that it will try
to produce more in return for higher wages.
It is also pertinent at this time to say a
few words concerning the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, for the Speech from the
Throne forecast legislation affecting that
body. It is well known that last year the
CBC had a deficit of $242,000 and overspent

the one million dollars provided by parliament during the year. I wonder how far the
CBC will go in its extra expenditures if not
curbed: The extra expenditures amounted to
$242,000 last year and run to over a million
this year, and nobody knows where the end
will be. I suggest to honourable senators
that before we vote the additional money
which the government is asking for the CBC
we should consider how much the taxpayers
of Canada want to spend on radio. To my
mind it is an open question whether the
present bureaucracy of the CBC was ever
desired or will ever be approved by the vast
majority of Canadians. In my opinion the
CBC should be made to eut its cloth to fit
its suit, and forget about an extra pair of
pants. At a later date, when the legislation
is before us, I shall have plenty to say about
the gross expenditures which to my way of
thinking have been made by the CBC without any apparent control whatever.
I wonder how many senators listen to CBC
broadcasts. How many heard the broadcast of news this morning, for instance?
Those who did were given an example of
how the CBC treats parliament. It referred
at some length to the question of an office
that had been occupied by a former member
of the House of Commons, and to the services
of a stenographer that had been available
to him. You rarely hear anything about the
serious minded speeches made in parliament,
but any flippant references the CBC usually
plays up. Whether the majority of people
like that sort of thing I do not know, but I
feel that when reporting parliamentary news
the CBC should tell the people about some
of the really worth-while speeches-for there
are quite a lot of those, and a great deal of
hard work goes into the preparation of some
of them. Of course, I do not expect the CBC
to pay attention to any remarks of mine,
because I have said too many things not in
its favour. I am sure I am off its list, but
I think I will be able, when the time comes,
to prove that some speeches made over it
are subversive.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: You are not worrying,
are you?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I am not worrying a great
deal about being left off its list, but I shall
save my remarks about the C.B.C. until the
measure affecting it comes before us.
I wish to speak for a few moments about
the question of price fixing, one of the most
popular topics before the people today. I
commend the government for the statement
in the Speech from the Throne that it intends
to do something about the problem. I do not
say that the government is backing down on

SENATE
its proposal-I hope it is not-in the appointment of a committee to study the subject. In
fairness, I must say that it will allow an
opportunity for both sides to be heard. I am,
however, astonished that some active Liberals
are not supporting this proposed measure. I
should like to remind them of a definition
given by the late Mackenzie King of the
difference between a Liberal and a Conservative. I do not know how many honourable
senators, when speaking on a public platform have had a member of the audience ask
the question: "Mister, can you tell us the
difference between a Conservative and a Liberal?" but I know that some speakers have
floundered about, trying to say that it was
a state of mind, and this and that. The late
Mr. King put it concisely this way: "When the
general interest conflicts with the particular
interests the Liberal has always supported
and stood for the general interest". It is true
that times may change, but principles are
immutable. Actually the people of Canada
are divided into two camps of thought; one
is for the particular interests and the other
represents the general welfare of the rank
and file of the Canadian people. There is no
doubt as to which camp I am in: I am for
the general interest, and that is why I support
legislation to eliminate price fixing.
In Great Britain price fixing, cartels and
combines are looked upon somewhat differently than they are in this country; but the
British attitude has been growing here. There
is in my home town an agent for the General
Electric Company who tells me that he pays
them $12 for an electric kettle which he retails
at $15, and that no one in Canada is allowed
to sell below that fixed price. Across the
border, in the State of Washington, the same
kettle can be bought for $8.50. But be that
as it may; this agent received a letter from
the manufacturer stating that if he would
send in the names of a friend or two, or of
employees, they would allow him to sell an
electric kettle to such persons for $12, and
that the wholesale price to him would be $9.
That agent thought that the retail price of
$15 had to be maintained, yet the rule of the
combine permitted him to sell kettles to a
few of his friends, upon the names being
supplied, at $12.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Would the honourable
senator permit a question?
What do you
mean by "the rule of the combine"? I am
not clear on that.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I probably used the word
"combine" in the wrong sense.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I think you did.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I thank my honourable
friend for correcting me on that point. Having

read a report of some of the litigation on
combines, I realize now I perhaps used the
term in too wide a sense.
Hon. Mr. Hayden:
with yourself.

You

cannot

combine

Hon. Mr. Reid: No. I stand corrected. In
Ottawa I recently saw two signs, printed I
think in Toronto, in two stores, containing
these words: "Pre-Korean prices.
Shirts
formerly $4.95 now $3.95". If those stores
are rnaking a profit on shirts at $3.95, which
I am sure they are, how much were they
making when they were selling them at
$4.95?
That situation can be multiplied
many times over in Canada, and the general
feeling on the part of the public, in spite of
all the arguments to the contrary, is that the
controlling of prices is a curtailment of free
competition as we know it. It is my strong
personal conviction that the system of fixed
prices retards competition, and we had better do something about it before it reaches
the proportions it has in some of the continental countries. When the Safeway Stores.
for instance, first started, the housewife
could go there and pick up certain goods at
two cents or five cents less than the regular
price.
She served herself, paid the cashier
and carried the goods home. But today there
is little difference between the prices in the
Safeway Stores and in those large outlets
such as Eaton's and the Hudson's Bay stores.
Such big stores as I have mentioned are
today delivering goods to points forty and
fifty miles away. The little merchant, who
was once able to sell cheaper than the big
stores, is today faced with competition on the
same price level with deliveries being made
to the customers' doors. Certainly, he cannot
afford to give that delivery service unless he
charges extra for it or foots the bill out of
his own profits.
Honourable senators, some of whom may
b' merchants, probably are wondering how
far I will go in my argument on this price
question. I would point out further that the
agent for General Electric, to whom I referred. is not allowed to handle electric ranges:
but a garageman on the corner, who got in
a little ahead of the agent, has set aside a
corner of his shop where he sells ranges.
Yet the company refuses to sell stoves to the
agent. There is serious danger to free conpetition today in the refusal of the manufacturers to sell their goods to certain
people and in the fixing of prices, for if you
dare to sell below the price that has been
set or agreed upon, you may be penalized or
put out of business. There are many housewives whose husbands are not earning a
great deal. One has only to go into a five-andten cent store in this city, or any store special-

NOVEMBER 6, 1951

izing in the general class of products, to see
housewives hunting around for bargains,
because if they can pick up something a little
cheaper than it can be got elsewhere it is
good economy. If ever we adopt a system
under which nothing can be sold for less
than a fixed price, it will mean higher prices.
I know that the Prime Minister made some
reference to prices across the line. I am not
going to enter into that phase of the subject,
other than to say that whether goods in the
United States are cheaper or dearer depends
on where you buy them. I know that there is
competition in that country. I have travelled
across the United States eight times in as
many years, and it is my personal experience
that the same article may be had at different
prices in different cities. But everywhere I
bought anything I was able to buy it cheaper
than it could be had in British Columbia. In
Canada, so far as most articles are concerned,
competition is non-existent. The price in
Halifax is much the same as in Ottawa or in
Vancouver, and there is practically no variation even in the interior of British Columbia
in spite of the added cost of transportation.
That is so whether what you buy is a box
of matches or a shirt.
In my opinion it is time we had a quality
standard in this country, and I suggest that
the matter is well worth study by a committee
of this Senate, assisted by the Bureau of
Statistics. Many goods which are advertised
as wool do not contain more than 40 per cent
of wool. So far as I know there is no imposed
standard. One suit or one pair of socks may
look the same as another, but there can be
a vast difference in the quality and in the
quantity of wool which the article contains.
The time is coming, if it is not already here,
when people should be able to buy according
to a quality standard. Then, if an article
were guaranteed, or advertised as containing
a certain percentage of wool, the buyer could
be sure that it did in fact contain that
quantity.
I have a word or two to say about the Combines Investigation Act. I trust that when we
reassemble a committee will be set up to
consider this legislation, because in my
opinion if any statute requires overhauling
it is this particular Act. We have had many
exposures of the activities of these combines,
the latest, perhaps, having to do with bread.
Will anyone contend that a $10,000 fine is an
adequate penalty for a group of large bakeries
which controls the bread of the people? We
need the kind of Combines Investigation Act
which will discourage monopolies. I know
that some investigation has been made of the
practices of bakeries, and manufacturers of
glass and matches, but we have barely
scratched the surface. To vary the metaphor,
94703-6

the really big fish have been left alone. Some
of the worst offenders are operating as patent
holders, and our laws are powerless to control
them. I will cite only one or two cases
which have been brought to my attention by
a professor of the University of British
Columbia who has made a study of this matter. He points out that many large concerns
hold patents and enjoy a monopoly of them.
Nobody can go imto certain businesses without
the use of one of those patents. It is well
known, for example, that no outsider can
obtain a match-making machine. That means
that he cannot make matches, because the
patent rights of the machinery are held by
a combine or cartel. That is but one instance
out of many. This professor says that the
Du Pont Company and the Rohm and Haas
Company of the United States, and I. G. Farben of Germany and a company in Great
Britain, had a cartel agreement under which
the American monopoly in a dental plastic
-one of a group of products-was assigned
to the American companies. The same product
was sold at two prices: 85 cents per pound
for industrial purposes, such as ash-trays, and
$45 per pound for dental plastics. When it
was discovered that the powders were being
"bootlegged" to the dental laboratories the
chemists of the Rohm and Haas Company
were given instructions to stop it. They put
forward the suggestion that if "a millionth of
one percent of arsenic of lead" were put in
the commercial product, and it was used
by the dental laboratories, the latter could
be sued under the Pure Food and Drug Law.
I will mention only one other instance,
and this, again, relates to the General Electric Company. They were accused of forcing
all manufacturers of bulbs for flash-light
lamps to reduce the life of the bulbs from
300 to 200 hours. They hold a patent on
these products.
I trust that our investigation next year will
be a one hundred per cent affair, and that
we shall find out how many patents are held
by large companies, especially those with
headquarters in Europe or in Great Britain,
who will not permit the purchase or sale of
articles they control excepting through particular firms or organizations working under
restrictive conditions. I believe the Senate
could do some really useful work with
regard to combines.
I have just a word or two to say about
free enterprise. We should bear in mind
that the conception of free enterprise held
in Europe, including Great Britain, is not
the same as ours. I have made reference
to this matter on previous occasions, both
here and in the other place, and I think
that one or two recent occurrences in our
own province are worth mentioning as a

SENATE
reminder of the extent to which we have
lost our individual liberties. Recently a man
was brought before the courts, and what do
you suppose was the charge? He was charged
with selling to a firm milk that was betternot poorer-than the regulations permitted.
In my early days I thought that laws were
designed to protect the public from poor or
adulterated food. But this man sold milk
with 3.5 cream or fat content, when the
prescribed content was only 3-25. So he
was brought before the courts.
Hon. Mr. Bishop: Who prosecuted him?
Who brought him before the court?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Inspectors. There is a
law in our province which prohibits the
selling of milk above a certain quality and
below a certain price. In the cities ot Vancouver and New Westminster the Safeways
Stores offered to sell milk for 3 cents a quart
less than the prevailing rate, but were prevented by law. Their argument was that
the delivery of milk was too costly, and that
housewives should be allowed to buy milk in
their shops, take it home, and thereby save
3 cents a quart.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Is there a milk board in
British Columbia?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes. There is a man
known as a "milk czar." When one man is
empowered to do these things he is called
a "czar."
So these stores are not allowed
to sell a quart of milk for 3 cents less,
although people are willing to go there and
carry it home. It must be delivered. Strange
to say the delivery requirement is supported
by certain unions, their reason being that to
permit the customer to carry his milk home
would deprive some men of their jobs. In
the face of these things people get up and
talk glibly about "free enterprise." I have
been a Liberal all my life, but when I hear
the utterances of certain Liberals in my
province, when I see that every move they
make is favourable to cartels and combines
and the curtailment of liberty in some form
or another, I say "If that is your outlook, be
honest, and tell the people you are Liberals
no more; you now want to regiment the
people and deprive them of their freedom."
For example, I could not go into the taxi
or the trucking business in my district. A
board is set up to control these things, and
if I went before them they eould tell me,
"Oh, you will not be allowed to operate;
there is a taxi business a mile away," so I
would not be allowed to invest my money
in a new taxi business. If I wanted to go
into the trucking business I could be given
the same story. If that principle is to be
applied to the taxi business and the trucking
business, it could be made to apply to such
merchants as haberdashers, and so on. I

just wonder what merchants would say if
they were told they could not start up in a
certain business because there were too
many already in that business, that there
was a man with a store on the next corner
who had to be protected? I am against such
restrictions of individual liberty.
In closing I wish to say that business is
booming in the province of British Columbia
at the moment. I think it certainly can be
said that the last frontier has been reached
in the United States and that the new frontiers
of endeavour are now to be found in Canada.
The northern part of Alberta, Saskatchewan
and British Columbia are now being looked
to by the American industrialists and investors, and they are pouring hundreds of
thousands of dollars into our North. I am a
little worried, however, about our Canadian
dollar. When I study the American picture
and the money the Americans are pouring
into Canada and the profits they are taking
out from the produce of our mines and forests,
I cannot understand for the life of me why
our Canadian dollar should be at a discount.
Do honourable senators realize that the
Americans are financing and doing business
on a deficit budget; that they are spending
billions of dollars simply by writing on paper?
It is true that they have something like $23
billions worth of gold hidden in a vault in
their country, but that gold reserve is not
used any more to bolster currency. We in
this country have a better and more sound
financial economy than has the United States.
and yet our dollar is at a discount. When I
go across the line I am told by the Americans
that they cannot accept my dollar except at
a 5 per cent discount. I resent that situation.
I draw the attention of honourable senators to
it, and I say that the sooner our dollar is on
a parity with the American dollar the better
it will be. I believe that our dollar is being
manipulated-and there may be reasons for
it; but I think if it were allowed its freedom
our Canadian dollar would be above the
American dollar because of the financial position of this country as compared to that of
the United States.
Honourable senators, I am sorry for having
taken up so much time. I did not intend to
cover so many subjects, and I shall leave the
remainder of my remarks until the various
legislation forecast in the Speech from the
Throne comes before us.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Honourable senators, I

SENATE
of both houses of parliament to consider the
interim report of the committee appointed to study
Combines Legislation, tabled in the Senate Tuesday,
November 6, 1951; and to consider appropriate
amendments to the Combines Investigation Act
based thereon;
That the following senators be appointed to act
on behalf of the Senate on the said joint committee, namely, the Honourable Senators Aseltine,
Beaubien, Burchill, Dupuis, Fogo, Godbout, Golding,
Hawkins, Horner, Lambert. Pratt and Vaillancourt.
That the committee have power to appoint, from
among its members, such subcommittees as may be
deemed advisable or necessary; to send for persons,
papers and records; to examine witnesses under
oath; to sit during sittings and adjournments of the
Senate, and to report from time to time;
That the committee have power to print such
papers and evidence from day to day as it may
order for the use of the committee and of parliament, and that Rule 100 of the Senate be suspended
in relation thereto;
That a message be sent to the House of Commons
to inform that house accordingly.

He said: Honourable senators, I should
perhaps say a few words in connection with
this resolution.
It arises as a result of a
resolution adopted in the other place late
yesterday, suggesting to this house that we
join with them in appointing a joint committee for the purposes set out in that resolution. With regard to the resolution that I
have just moved, I should perhaps direct the
attention of the Senate to the fact that of the
twelve senators nominated to be members
of the Joint Committee, three have been
selected from each of the four great geographical divisions of the country. The only
other feature of the resolution to which I
should perhaps direct attention is the proposed waiving of Rule 100 of the Senate.
That merely has reference to the question
of printing. Rule 100 says:
All papers laid on the Table stand referred to the
Joint Committee on Printing, who decide and
report whether they are to be printed.

The resolution provides for the printing
by the joint committee of its own proceedings.
The background of this resolution is, I
think, familiar to all honourable senators. It
arises from the interim report made on the
Ist of October of this year by the committee
set up approximately a year ago by the
Minister of Justice to report on combines
legislation in general. The chairman of that
committee was Mr. Justice MacQuarrie, of
Nova Scotia, and in consequence the committee is customarily referred to as the MacQuarrie committee. I understand that copies
of the interim report of October 1 have been
circulated to all senators, although it was
not until yesterday evening that there was
an opportunity formally to lay the report on
the table of the House.
The interim report deals specifically with
one feature of the committee's investigation

into combines, namely, resale price maintenance. I do not want to discuss the report
at any length now, but with a view to giving
the house a birds' eye view of what is
involved I should perhaps read the first
two paragraphs of the report and as well a
short paragraph at the end.
In the introduction to the report the committee says:
Among restrictive trade practices, resale price
maintenance is probably the best known and has
been widely analyzed and discussed. By resale
price maintenance we understand the practice designed to ensure that a particular article shall not
be resold by retailers, wholesalers or other dis-

tributors
supplier,
Measures
different

that is, in most cases, the manufacturer.
to enforce the prescribed price may take
forms, such as warnings, fines, the denial

of supplies, and withdrawal of discounts.
Resale price maintenance may be estabished

cither on a collective basis by an agreement among
rival

suppliers

(horizontal)

or

on

an individual

basis by a single supplier (vertical). The collective
schemes need not be discussed; they are generally
recognized as being against the public interest and
illegal in Canada. Consideration will therefore be
restricted to the maintenance of resale prices by
individual suppliers.

That is the subject which the committee will
study, namely, the maintenance of resale
price by individual suppliers.
The MacQuarrie Committee then proceeded
to consider at some length the various arguments submitted in favour of and against
this practice, and on page 21 of the interim
report its recommendations are summarized
as follows:
The committee, therefore, recommends that it
should be made an offence for a manufacturer or

other supplier:

1. To recommend or
prices for his products;
2. To refuse to sell, to
take any other form of
forcing minimum resale

prescribe minimum

withdraw a franchise or to
action as a means of enprices.

That, honourable senators, is the conclusion
of the MacQuarrie Report.
The report was received prior to the opening of this session of parliament, and the
subject was referred to in the Speech from
the Throne in the following words:
The government has received an interim report
from the committee studying the combines legislation recommending that suppliers of goods should
be prohibited from requiring or inducing distributors to resell such goods at fixed or minimum
resale prices. You will be asked to consider legislation arising out of the committee's interim report.

The setting up of the joint committee
arises out of that statement in the Speech
Lrom the Throne, and the procedure is similar
in substance to that which took place when

a joint committee of the two houses xvas set
up to consider old age security.
I am
informed that the government is extremely
anxious that the committee begin functioning, and it is desirous that parliament shall
be in a position to deal with this matter and

NOVEMBER 7, 1951
to pass the legisiation recommended by the
MacQuarrie Report prior to, the end of the
present session.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the honourable
acting leader a question? Are the powers
gîven to the committee by the resolution circumscribed? In other words, is the scope of
study by the committee limited to the recommendations in the MacQuarrie Report, or are
its powers wider than that? For instance,
will the committee be able to deal with the
entire combines legisiation?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The committee will be
confined to this one phase of the combines
legisiation, the reason being that it is the
only phase on which the MacQuarrie Committee has yet reported.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
I propose to adjourn the debate, but before
doing so I wish to express entire agreement
with the remnarks of the acting leader of the
government. I think the committee sbould
be formed as soon as possible, in order that
it may give adequate and careful consideration to ail the representations that will be
made bef are it. However, this is the first
time I have heard the resolution, and in

consenting to its presentation this afternoon
I informeci the acting government leader
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) that I would adjourn
the debate. I so move.
The motion of the Hon. Mr. Haig was
agreed ta, and the debate was adjourned.

Hon. Mr. McDonald inquired of the government:
1. What was the production in Canada, and imports into Canada for the years 1939, 1949 and 1950,
for the following fertilizers:
Mixed fertilizers (solid),
Nitrogen solution,
Ammonium sulphate,
Ammonium nitrate,
Ammonium phosphate,
Cyanamide,
Superphosphate,
Natural phosphate rock,
Bone meal or bone flour,
Muriate of potash 50 per cent,
Muriate of potash 60 per cent,
Sulphate of potash.
2. What was the value per short ton of the imported fertilizers and fertilizer materials for the
above mentioned years?
3. (a) What were the sales in Canada, with prices
charged by leading fertilizer companies, by provinces, of fertilizer materials and mixed fertilizers
for the years ended June 30, 1939-40 and 1949-50?
(b) What was the cost per ton of producing
ammonium nitrate the last year it was manufactured
under the jurisdiction of a government department
-what was the cost for the last period for which
there is a record?
4. What amount of granulated Sydney slag has
been sold during the last two years? Realizing the
importance of this product to the Maritimes, bas
the government given consideration to making
funds available for the erection of a plant which
could turn out finely ground slag at low cost to the
farmers?
5. What progress has been made by investigation
and development towards making it possible for
Canada to produce her own requirements of phosphoric acid and potash since the Senate, through its
Standing Committee on Natural Resources, in the
1947 session, made an enquiry into the possibility of
attaining self-sufficiency in commercial fertilizer
supplies for our farmers?
6. Can an estimate be given of the savings effected
by the farmers of Canada through buying high
grade fertilizers not requiring filler?

Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,

as this inquiry deals with material which has
to be obtained from a number of departments,
I think it should stand as an Order for Return.

the

committee in favour of or against the proposed
legislation will have an opportunity to do so.
Therefore, any member who has any respect
for his own judgment-to say nothing of
whether anyone else respects it or not-will

have to postpone expression of his views on

the legislation until the committee's hearings
are concluded.
I presume that reports of the
committee's proceedings will be printed and

distributed for us to study, and as a basis
for our opinions on the legislation.
But the point I wish to make is that the
motion is a most peculiar one.
So far as
I can remember, this is the first time during
my

membership

in

the

Senate

when

the

Speech from the Throne has promised legis-

lation, and then, suddenly, out of the blue,
the government bas requested parliament to
appoint a joint committee of both bouses to
investigate the subject that is to be covered
by the proposed legislation. Surely if the
Speech from the Throne means anything it
means a promise by the government to intro-

duce the legislation that is forecast in the

speech.

I admit that because of unavoidable

delays, or for other reasons, it may at
times be found impossible to have legislation

passed before the session ends. The government is not positively bound to see that
legislation mentioned in the Speech from the
Throne is passed by parliament in the current
session. But it was anticipated that the com-

bines legislation would be introduced and
passed at this session. However, the minister
in charge of combines legislation has
announced that there have been so many
requests from various people to have the
matter further considered that the government
bas given in and recommended the appointment of a joint committee for this purpose.
Now, here is a surprising feature. The
custom of having fixed prices for certain
goods has been in effect, I suppose, from
time immemorial-at any rate, for a long
while-in this country, in Britain, in the
United States and other countries; but I doubt
if it bas anything to do with those goods and
services which influence the cost of living
index. I understand that the First Minister

NOVEMBER 8, 1951
made the statement in the other place that
he thought it had only a slight effect on the
cost of living. I agree with that statement.
Why should legislation of this character
be proposed at all? Let us examine what
is back of the proposal. I have in my hand a
copy of the interim report by the MacQuarrie
Committee. Like a report for consideration
by a court of appeal, it sets out the arguments
on both sides of the question. A careful
study of the document reveals to me only one
argument in favour of the bringing in of the
proposed type of legislation. The report
contains only two significant paragraphs in
this respect. They are to be found in section
4, on page 8, under the heading "Submissions received". The first paragraph reads as
follows:
As indicated above, the committee received a
great many briefs, nearly all of which made some
reference to resale price maintenance. They reveal
divergent opinions on the subject. Although there
are some notable exceptions, in general the associations representing manufacturers, wholesalers
and retailers favoured resale price maintenance.
On the contrary, co-operatives, labour unions,
farmers' and consumers' associations expressed
opposition to the practice.

I have been in public life for about thirtyfive years and am well known in the city of
Winnipeg, yet in all those years I have never
been asked by any organization or person
to support legislation of the .character now
proposed. True, there have been protests
against combines for various purposes;
indeed, only recently we had two or three

emphasize that no one has ever approached
me requesting legislation prohibiting a manufacturer from setting the price at which his
goods shall be sold. I doubt if any senator
has received such a request, except perhaps
within the past two or three weeks.
Let us examine from a practical point of
view the subject under discussion. Suppose
I manufacture tooth paste, for instance, and
fix the resale price at fifteen cents a tube;
and the merchants and the little men al over
the country stock up with it. Now, there are
hundreds of other kinds of tooth paste on
the marketHon. Mr. Euler: Not at fifteen cents.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But Haig & Haig's tooth
paste must be sold at fifteen cents. Well,
make it twenty-five cents.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Why not say thirty-five
cents?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Very well; the cost has
nothing to do with the illustration. Why
should anybody object to Haig & Haig-?
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: It is good stuff.
Hon. Mr. Haig: My friend has something
else besides tooth paste in mind. Haig &

Haig, who, we will suppose, are manufacturing tooth paste, are told, "You may not price
your tooth paste at 35 cents a tube; you must
let the price be fixed by the market." But
whom is hurt by Haig & Haig's price fixing?
The public can buy a dozen other kinds of
tooth paste at whatever price the manufacturers choose to sell it for: why should my
Haig firrn be singled out because I want 35
cents? If I am badly -advised, I may not be
able to get anyone to sell my products.
There are other factors involved. For
example, why am I more likely to buy a
product of Ford Motors, General Motors, or
Chrysler? The reason is that those companies
maintain depots right across Canada, and if
any of their cars cause trouble it is easy
to get them repaired. The same principle
applies to any manufactured article for which
service is maintained across the dominion;
and the producer will probably ask .a certain
fixed price. Now whom does that hurt?
The Prime Minister has admitted that control is not likely to affect the cost of living
to any extent. In my opinion it will not
be affected at all. Is the present system
objectionable to the retail merchant? He is
not kicking about it; he is the very man
who is complaining of the proposal to impose
restriction. Are the big dealers-Eaton's,
Loblaw's, the Hudson Bay, Simpson's-kicking about present conditions? Oh, no. Is the
small corner store-keeper protesting? Quite
the contrary; he wants the present system to
be continued. Then what is the purpose of
the proposed legislation? It can have only
one object-to pretend to the people of
Canada that we are doing something to cut
down the cost of living. And why should
we indulge in a pretence of this kind when
we know that it cannot have that effect?
Why do we not tell the people the facts?
Why does not the government of this country
inform the people that a great many changes
will be necessary if the cost of living is to
come down. You cannot go on spending
millions of dollars and yet hope that by
fiddling with such trifling matters as the
price of tooth-paste, the cost of living will be
reduced. And it is with such little things
that the motion has to do.
I am quite willing to fight for any legislation which by any stretch of the imagination
can be expected to bring down the cost of
living. But such a device as is proposed can
be described only by one word, and that a
bitter one,-humbug; unadulterated humbug.
To judge from editorials in one of the newspapers in my city, one would imagine that
these proposals are an important element in
fighting the increased cost of living; and the
government is praised for the measures it
proposes to take. The editorial page of one

SENATE

Winnipeg paper contains a lengthy article on
this thesis. Last evening, while talking to
a very able young man who operates a
medium-size drug store in my city, I asked
him, "what will be the effect of the proposed
amendments if they go through?" "Well," he
said, "probably some of the big stores will
sell this and that article below cost, and if
I want to compete, I shall have to cut my
price too; but let me tell you, John T. Haig,
we will get the money back on something
else. I have to live, and to make a living
for my wife and children I must get a profit
on the goods I sell." That is the complete
picture.
I am pleased that our house will be represented on the committee; I think it is an
honour that the Senate has been asked to
take part in the deliberations of this committee. I am sorry to say, however, that in
my humble opinion honourable senators on the
committee who expect to accomplish anything
in the way of solving our country's problems
are going to be greatly disappointed. Such
legislation as this can lead us nowhere.
If honourable senators read this interim
report through they will find in it everything
I have said. One of the general conclusions
in it is that the crux of this price-control
problem is the device known as the lossleader. Now, it is my opinion that this is
where legislation should be directed first. For
instance, let us take the price of oranges. I
do not know about other cities, but in Winnipeg a certain type of California oranges are
selling at 50 cents a dozen. Now, if one of our
big chain stores-Safeway, Hudson's Bay or
Eaton's-advertise oranges at 12 cents a
dozen, you will nevertheless find that many
people will not go to those stores to buy their
oranges. One of our big stores advertised
sugar at about half the market price, and the
ordinary wholesale merchant came to the
retailers and said, "Well, what about sugar?
I see that the Safeway stores are advertising
it at a very low rate." The retailer said, "Well,
let the consumers go to Safeway to buy their
sugar, but let them buy the rest of their
goods from us". The result was that within
two months the Safeway stores had to stop
selling their sugar at the reduced rate. This
cannot be done on big items, but on little
things the big stores are able to attract the
people by what are called loss-leaders, and
more than make up the loss on them by the
sale of other goods. That is what is referred
to in this interim report, and it is stated that
when time is available a report will be made
Dn that subject as well. I think that is going
about it in the wrong way. It is the little
fellow who does not like this legislation, not
the big fellow.

You may ask "What about the manufacturer?"
One result is inevitable. Manufacturers of price-fixed articles of a certain
type-I do not think the toothpaste manufacturers could do it-will have to start their
own retail outlets in order to meet the problem, and that will drive the little fellow out
of business, and I am persuaded that what is
desired in many cities is the competition of
the little fellows. We have no objection to
the large dealer, but we want to give the
little dealer a chance, and I believe that what
is proposed will affect him more adversely
than anybody else. I am convinced that this
feeling has been so widespread that the government has had to yield to the request of
the Canadian people for an investigation
before introducing the legislation forecast in
the Speech from the Throne. If this is not so,
why did the government say, "We will appoint
a committee"?
When this joint committee is formed and
its report is brought in, legislation may be
forthcoming, and if it is then we ought to
look into it most carefully. The Senate is
one body which ought to see that the small
dealer in Canada gets an even break with
the big dealer. The only government to
suggest a remedy such as the one before us
came from the socialist government in Great
Britain, and one would expect that.
Honourable senators, I feel that we should
vote for the setting up of this Combines
Legislation Committee because it will at
least give the people interested an opportunity to submit their views. I honestly
think that if the members of this chamber
were to read this interim report through,
they would reach the conclusion I have
reached, namely, that the combines legislation is absolutely unnecessary and will serve
no useful purpose. For a moment or two
it may give many people a feeling that there
will be a reduction in the cost of living:
but actually it will amount to nothing. I
hope that the senators serving on the joint
committee will listen with an open mind to
the representations made to the committee,
and I hope they will remember that the fixing of prices by a manufacturer is a longestablished practice in our country, and that
it is done by one man-not a combination of
men-who manufactures goods of a certain
standard of quality which must be maintained if he is going to hold the market all
across the country. We should see to it,
therefore, that before we disturb this system
there is ample evidence to convince the
Canadian people that what we are doing is
right.
Honourable senators, I am delighted that
this committee is being set up, and I only
hope it will make a thorough investigation,

NOVEMBER 8, 1951

and that the senators serving on it will not
leave all the investigating to the members
of the House of Commons. I hope they will
get all the facts before them, so that if and
when the combines legislation comes before
us they will be able to tell us what they
have learned.
Sorne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Gordon B. Isnor: Honourable senators, I should like to approach this debate
from the standpoint of one mentioned by the
honourable leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig), namely, the retailer. I, too, have
read this interim report several times and
have done so with a great deal of interest.
I wanted to find the definition of such things
as the maintenance of resale prices by the
individual supplier, and to study the presentations made by the various organizations
or individuals who appeared before the
MacQuarrie Committee.
Before dealing directly with the resolution
and the material contained in the interim
report, may I compliment the acting leader
of the government (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) on
his selection of twelve members to represent
the Senate on the proposed joint committee?
The procedure in selecting them was different
from that followed by the government in
setting up the MacQuarrie Committee. The
Honourable J. H. MacQuarrie, a member of
the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, appointed
as chairman of that committee, is a man held
in high esteem in his native province. I had
the honour ta sit with him in the Legislature
of Nova Scotia from 1928 to 1935. We in the
Maritimes have a great deal of respect for
his judgment, integrity and honesty. There is
no doubt that the other members of the
MacQuarrie Committee are also men of high
character and judgment, but they are all more
or less of the professional class. None of them
could be exactly termed as being in the commercial field-experienced retailers, wholesalers or manufacturers-and therein, I think,
lies a weakness in so far as the report is
concerned. On the other hand, as I mentioned
a moment ago, I am very pleased to note that
the acting leader of the government chose
not only four barristers-I suppose it is always
necessary to have legal advisers in the
membership of a committee-but in addition
chose two farmers, two lumber operators,
one machinist, one businessman, a manufacturer, and one whom I would term a
business manager.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: May I interrupt my
honourable friend for just a moment? I do
not want to take credit where none is due.
It was not I who was responsible for naming
the members of the committee.

Hon. Mr. Isnor: I can only go on the fact
that the honourable acting leader presented
the resolution in which the committee was
named. If credit is due to someone else I
know he will be good enough to pass along
my comments in that connection.
Now, honourable senators, in a country as
large as Canada, where manufacturers sell
from the Atlantic to the Pacific, the cost of
operating is naturally much greater than in
a smaller area with a larger population. I
think it is recognized as a common business
maxim that it is easier to sell to a nearby
community than to one that is far distant.
With this in mind, I think it would be safe
to say that in the two central provinces,
Ontario and Quebec, with their combined
population, amounting to 66 per cent of the
total population of Canada, and with their
concentrated buying power and their industrial life, a manufacturer would be able to
sell to better advantage than if he extended
his activities to the extreme east and west
of the country. I mention that as a background because I propose to show that that
is a factor in the resale price maintenance
policy.
Briefly, my remarks are based on the fact
that manufacturers in central Canada, by fixing resale prices, are extending to the eastern
and western sections of the country a business
arrangement which places these sections on
an equal basis with the central provinces.
While this object may be achieved in some
other way, I think this is one factor in favour
of the price maintenance policy.
As before stated, our domestic trade is
broad and complicated, including as it does
the transportation and distribution of goods
within the country through the media of
railways, steamships, and wholesale and
retail stores. Such operations, even if they
do not produce material goods, add substantially to the national income. The distribution
of goods at both the wholesale and retail
levels and the production of those services
which cater to Canadians as consumers constitute a phase of our economy in which
increased interest is being shown. I think
that is very definitely indicated by the representations that were made to the MacQuarrie
Committee, and by the representations which,
I gather from a statement of the Minister of
Justice, were made by people who wish to
have this matter referred to a joint committee of both houses.
I should have thought that any legislation
covering matters so vitally concerned with
our domesic trade and the relations between
the manufacturer, wholesaler and retailer,
would have been withheld by the government
until the 1951 census was completed. That

SENATE

census will no doubt give much useful
information on the subject of distribution and
merchandising services. Retail stores absorb
a large portion of the consumer dollar, and
the Dominion Bureau of Statistics, through
its Merchandlisinig Branich, has given considerable attention to the volume of business
in dollars and cents as well as to the amounts
of stock carried by stores. I am wondiering
what use, if iany, the MacQuarrie Committee
has made of this information in arriving at
the conclusions presented, in the interim
report. This is a source which the joint committee could. use to good- advantage.
During the post-war periodi merchandising
has undergone many changes. The backlog of
demand for durable merchandise created, by
wartime shortages has now beeni met. I say,
notwithstanding the view held; by some of the
people, that in certain sections there are no
merchandise shortages. It seems to me that
one only needs to look at the large advertisements in daily newspapers to see that department stores have on hand vast stocks of
goods that they are eager to dispose of, sometimes-and I am glad to isee this-at reduced
prices. It will be recalled that earlier this
year there was a so-called price war for a
\vhile between two or three of the large
departmenit stores in New York City. Goodis
which had accumulated. on the shelves were
thrown on the market, and people were able
to buy them at sacrifice prices. At that time
there was considerable reference to the practice of resale price maintenance, from which
the stores in question were at the moment
departing. If I recall correctly, prior to the
so-called price war the R. H. Macy Company
had been selling 3.3 per cent of the total
number of Mixmasters sold on the New York
market, but by offering this article to the
public at a sacrifice price they were able
to build their sales up to 52-6 per cent of the
total in that area. That was one of those
situations of a kind to which the leader of the
opposition referred as having a bad effect on
smaller stores, because when this large company increased its sales of the article about
twenty times there was not of course so much
business available for smaller stores.
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: How about the consumer?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: My honourable friend asks,
"Hou about the consumer?" In that particular
case the consumer may have benefited for
the time being, but, as we all know, the
average department store will not continue
to sell goods at a loss. We know that if a
store, by price cutting, succeedis in cornering
the business in a certain article it will soon
bring the price 'back to the old level. I do

not think that that price cutting will be of
any benefit to the consumer in the long run.
As I was saying, the backlog of demand
for durable merchandise has been met, and
shelves are now stocked with large quantities
of such merchandise. In fact, I think it can
safely be said that big department stores as
well as other retail stores have never carried
such large inventories as at present. I
remember reading a few days ago a newspaper article saying that stocks on hand were
far greater this year than in any former year.
Canadians spent almost $8 billion in retail
stores in 1949, the last year for which I have
the record, and this was the eleventh consecutive year in which retail trade moved
upward. About one-sixth of all Canadian
expenditures on goods is made in food stores.
The total estimated sales in food stores were
$1,270 million, of which $300 million were
spent in chain stores, which are recognized
as an important medium of distribution in the
food trade in Canada. Department stores are
also large scale distribution organizations, and
I think it is safe to say that only a small
percentage of the popular lines carried by
these stores are sold at maintained prices.
The MacQuarrie Committee apparently were
not very definite in their opinion on this
matter, but I think they finally came to the
conclusion that about 12 to 15 per cent of the
sales by department stores come under this
classification. I made an independent inquiry
on more than one occasion with respect to
this matter, and I venture the opinion that
the articles of this class would not exceed
10 per cent of the total volume of sales.
Hon. Mr. Howden: Do fixed prices
eliminate competition?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I had intended to come to
that point later, but I shall answer the
question now. It is a fallacy to say that
price fixing eliminates competition.
One
finds that competition between ten stores
carrying goods at fixed prices is as keen as
the competition between a similar number
of stores selling unbranded articles with no
fixed resale price. Does that answer the
question?
Hon. Mr. Howden: I do not believe it does.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: It is my opinion that the
competition among any ten retail stores
which are selling under a resale policy is
just as keen as competition among a similar
number of stores which are not.
I return to the subject of chain stores, and
by that I mean four or more stores operated
under the same ownership, exclusive of
department stores. These were represented
by 6,800 chain store units, and constituted
18 per cent of all the retail trade in Canada.

NOVEMBER 8, 1951

Hon. Mr. Howden: I apologize for disturbing my friend again.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: You are not disturbing me.
Hon. Mr. Howden: If, for instance, each
article was sold at one price all over the
country, there would be no competition. Do
you not think that a system of comparative
prices is the basis of competition?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I can answer that question
by offering an illustration. If you look at
tonight's Ottawa Journal, for instance, you
will most likely see there an advertisement
by a well-known shirt company, such as
Tooke, or Cluett Peabody, who manufacture
the Arrow product, or Forsythe or some other
well known make. The average retail buyer
will look over the articles of these various
firms, and decide which is the best product.
The fact that all may be sold at $3.95 does
not, in my opinion, eliminate competition. A
buyer might prefer the product of one firm
because of quality, fit or size. That is the
basis of competition, as far as the manufacturer is concerned. Another customer may
have a preference for a large-body shirt, and
one of the manufacturers I have mentioned
may specialize in such a product. Naturally
that buyer will buy shirts bearing that particular trade name, regardless of whether they
are sold at the same price as other makes or
not. On the other hand, a customer may
prefer a slimmer-cut shirt, and a closer fitting
collar. Competition is clearly shown by the
selection by purchasers of the product of one
particular manufacturer.
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: Do you not think that
if one brand of shirt was sold at $3.50 instead
of $3.95, it would make a difference?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I do not think it would
make any difference, for most manufacturers
talk quality rather than price. They sell
honest goods at honest prices, and they operate as close to the margin as possible.
Hon. Mr. Sambaugh: Then why is it that
when a store advertises goods at less than
the usual price, there is a crowd at the store
before the door is opened?
Hon. Mr. Isnor: They are not standard
makes of products.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: Yes, but they sometimes advertise standard makes.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I offer this observation,
that it is a trait of human nature to do what
my friend referred to. When a store advertises a shirt formerly sold at $3.95, for $1.95,
the crowd naturally turns toward that store
and for the time being a great many purchases
will be made there; but when the buyers
return home they may find their bargain is

not what they expected it to be. It is altogether likely that they will find the shirt
skimpy in some places, or that it is tight in
the collar or has other defects.
Now I will deal directly with the general
principle of resale price fixing. I do not
believe that anyeaction that may be taken,
no matter what it is, will have much effect
in so far as the over-all question of inflation
or high prices is concerned. The abolition
of price fixing may for a while-through
sacrifice sales and price wars-result in lower
prices to the consumer; but this situation
will quickly stabilize itself and result in no
actual saving to the consumer. Perhaps that
will answer the question of my friend from
St. Boniface (Hon. Mr. Howden).
Like others, I have every respect for the
high standing of the gentlemen who compose
the MacQuarrie Committee. But one must
remember that the manufacturer and wholesaler, as well as the retailer, must depend
for success on the giving of satisfactory
service. I was pleased to hear the leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) express that
thought, for only by the giving of service
can a man remain in business. The manufacturer, endeavours to produce an honest
article at a reasonable price, and he spends
considerable money in making his product
known to the public, often through the
medium of a brand name which denotes
quality and value. This name is a safeguard
to the consumer. The manufacturer then
distributes his product through either a
wholesaler or retailer, and in suggesting a
resale price he is carrying out a policy which
he believes is not only to his interest in
maintaining the high standardi of his product,
but which also offers protection to both the
retailer and the consumer.
There is no doubt in my mind that when
a buyer sees a well-known brand on an
article which has built up a reputation for
quality, and on which the price is the same
right across Canada, it inspires confidence;
and, in 99 per cent of the cases I believe the
branded article offers honest value and real
protection, as compared with an unbranded
article produced simply from the standpoint
of price.
I wonder whether the MacQuarrie Committee, the Department of Justice or any
branch of the government, could tell us
exactly what percentage of merchandise sold
by the manufacturer, wholesaler or retailer,
is included in the price maintenance class. I
venture to repeat my remark of a few
moments ago, that not 10 per cent of the
average sale of merchandise in any one centre
in Canada comes under that heading. In view
of this situation I again say that I question

SENATE

the actual benefit to be derived by the
consumer from the abolition of price
maintenance.
In conclusion, honourable senators, I should
like to thank those who interrupted me to ask
questions and those who just listened to what
I had to say and to offereconcisely what I
believe to be the arguments for and against
a policy of price maintenance. I shall first
enumerate the arguments opposed to the
policy of resale price maintenance.
Firstly, those who oppose this policy claim
that resale price maintenance eliminates competition. My reply to that argument is this:
from my own practical retail experience over
a period of forty years I have observed that
the competition between stores handling lines
which come under price maintenance is every
bit as keen as the competition between stores
who do not handle such lines.
I believe that this statement will be subscribed to by any practical and experienced
retailer.
Secondly, one hears the argument that price
maintenance bas induced some retailers to
enter manufacturing to maintain freedom of
action. In reply to this I ask, what is wrong
with a retailer manufacturing for himself if
he desires to place his own product before the
public? I do not think there is much to that
contention.
Thirdly, it is said that the retail firm, when
handling goods on a price-maintenance basis
ceases to be a complete business enterprise.
This is a fallacy, as the percentage of price
maintenance goods handled by any one store
is very small.
Lastly, it is asserted that price maintenance
eliminates competition among the manufacturers. This is entirely erroneous, as is evident from the keen competition which exists
among for instance well-known shirt manufacturers and hat makers. Every member of
this chamber wears a bat, and when he thinks
of bats he immediately thinks of one of the
well-known and advertised brands, whether it
be Stetson, Biltmore, Christie, or some other.
When one goes into a store and sees a Stetson
priced at $8.95 or $10.95 he knows that he
is going to get value as far as price is
concerned. All these firms have suggested
price lists, but this does not prevent keen competition among them. And what I have said
regarding particular lines applies equally to
many other large lines I could mention.
These, then, are some reasons given against
the policy of resale price maintenance.
On the other hand, strong arguments on
behalf of price maintenance have been
advanced by retailers all over the country,
small and large, by manufacturers, wholesalers and others. It is interesting to note

the types of individuals and interests presenting the case for maintenance as contrasted to
those who are opposed to legislation. I do not
want to draw any distinctions or comparisons
in this connection: honourable gentlemen have
read the report, and some of them heard the
evidence before the committee. I think we
can depend pretty well on the sound judgment
of business men, that they are not going to
advocate something which in the long run
will be detrimental to trade.
On behalf of price maintenance, it is contended, as I have stated, that it does not
eliminate competition, because price-maintained goods are still subjected to the competition of close substitutes by other
manufacturers of similar products.
Secondly, price maintenance helps to keep
the small independent retailer in business,
and prevents a concentration of economic
power in the retail field. It also provides an
adequate profit margin for the small retailer.
Thirdly, as was mentioned by the leader
of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)-it limits
the use of the "loss leader" device employed
by large stores to attract more business and
gradually eliminate rivals.
Fourthly, it keeps the big stores, which
have complete control over their own brands,
from extending their price-cutting to products also handled by the smaller dealers
who do not have their own brands.
In the fifth place, to deprive the manufacturer or the outlets, particularly the small
retail stores, of the right to fix prices is to
permit dealers to charge the public much
more than the manufacturer intended. This
would apply particularly in times of scarcity.
Finally, price maintenance protects the consumer. This, I think, is important. It fixes
fair prices and prevents the exploitation of
the public through excessive prices. It establishes orderly marketing conditions, without
which the public could not enjoy the benefits
of mass production.
I have not dealt with this question on lines
similar to those followed in the other house.
I have endeavoured to approach the problem from an entirely different angle.
I
trust that the information I have placed
before honourable senators, including those
who will form part of the proposed joint
committee, will be duly considered, and I
shall be very pleased to discuss privately
any detail which I may not have been able
to present here as clearly as some of the
speakers, notably the leader of the opposition,
who preceded me, would have done.
For the reasons given, honourable senators, I favour the reference of this question
to a committee, and I am very happy to find

NOVEMBER 8, 1951
that the personnel will include a representative and typical section of the membership of
the Senate.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
until I heard the speech of the leader of
the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) it was not my
intention to say anything on this motion, but
I feel that -certain things be has said cal for
some comment, if not for an extended, reply.
He began by drawing special attention to
the fact that as long as he has been in public
life and in this place, this is the first time
that, after a subject of legislation has been
announced in the Speech from the Throne, a
special committee has been set up to investigate it. This year other matters with which
committees are to deal have been included
in the Speech from the Throne. After a
commission had dealt with the subject of
freight rates and the government had forecast legislation on the matter, a special committee to consider the matter was appointed.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But the government submitted a bill on that matter to the house, which
read it the second time and then sent it to
committee.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I know that, but I think I
could cite many instances where, after subjects of legislation had been announced in
the Speech from the Throne and certain steps
had been taken by the government, a committee was set up to examine into the matter. Be that as it may, it is rather unfair to
say that this proposal is so much "eye-wash"
and that the government has no other purpose than to placate some section of the publie. Not so very long ago the government
was subjected to some criticism because it
had not carried out promptly enough the
recommendations of the Combines Commissioner. As we all know, this resulted in the
resignation of that official. There is on the
statute books a Combines Investigation Act
under which the Combines Investigation Commissioner is carrying on continually inquiries
with regard to combines and cartels; and
after an investigation has been made, a report
is presented to the government. Honourable
senators may imagine what the public reaction would have been if, after the first report
had been published, no action in respect of
price fixing legislation had been taken. I
said the other day that I hoped the Government was not "backing up". I do not believe
it is. It is my conviction that, in view of
the protests which have been made, and
realizing that the subject must be considered
from all points of view, it acted wisely in
setting up this committee.
In years gone by I have heard merchants
say, "My conscience would not allow me to
charge more than 20 per cent", but I

know of many instances today of merchants
charging anywhere from 75 to 100 per cent.
I have no business interest in this matter one
way or the other, but speaking as one of
the customers, and on their behalf, it is my
belief that fixed prices are not based on
efficiency; and there is no doubt in my mind
that the average housewife feels that price
fixing is a bad thing.
The speech to which we have just listened
has shown how necessary it is to set up a
committee to study this whole matter, but
the honourable senator from Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor) only dealt with one
phase of the situation. Let us take the case
of articles manufactured in the United States
and sold in Canada. The Canadian manufacturer who produces goods in this country
on an assembly-line basis has only a home
consuming public of about fourteen million,
whereas in the United States the manufactui-er of the same type of goods has a
wonderful home market of some 165 million
people. The American manufacturer usually
does not have to look outside his own country
in order to sell his articles. On the other
hand, many articles imported from the United
States, even allowing for customs duties and
sales taxes, are sold here at a price far beyond
anything the housewife in the United States
has to pay for them. A member of parliament
was lauded the other day when he advocated
a return to free trade. Many of us agree with
his sentiments, but while I believe in free
trade I realize that we could not easily revert
to a system of complete free trade without
some disorganization of our economic system.
For many years I have been endeavouring
to caution Canadians about the establishment
of new systems, because, generally speaking,
once a system is set up there is no getting
rid of it. One of the most striking illustrations
of this is what bas happened during the past
six years in Great Britain. It will be found
that the Conservative government which is
now in charge of the affairs of that country
will be unable to turn back from the paths
along which the Labour government had led
the people of the British Isles during the past
six years. During his election campaign Mr.
Churchill did say that he would remove the
steel industry from state ownership and give
it back to private enterprise. At the same
time the entire interests of the railways and
coal mines in Great Britain are being looked
after through a state-owned system, and
the Conservative government will no doubt
endeavour to continue along that path.
If we in this country do not watch price
fixing, which has come upon us bit by bit,
there will be no turning back from it. Is there
any honourable senator who will say that
free enterprise does not and should not

SENATE
include free competition? While listening to
the remarks of the honourable senator from
Halifax-Dartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor) I realized
that there are two sides to every story. The
fact remains, and I do not think even he will
deny it, that when prices are set they are not
set on the most efficient business basis.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Yes they are, and that is
the very point.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Here again I mention the
question of quality. We have no standard of
quality, and quality has a bearing on the
question too.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Very definitely.
Hon. Mr. Reid: When we talk about competition under price fixing we may be satisfied in our own minds that a clerk in one
store is more courteous and efficient than
a clerk in another store which sells the same
goods and so patronize that store, but apart
from this there is no competition. The
articles, their brands and their prices are
displayed in the windows of both stores, but
that is all there is to it. On the other hand,
the big stores offer a free delivery service
for the same goods. The point is that the
average consumer like myself is chiefly concerned with the price of goods, but has an
eye, of course, on their quality.
Honourable senators, let me refer again to
goods manufactured in the United States and
sold in Canada. Here we find the customs
regulations stacked against Canadian consumers. Let me give you an illustration. I
am sure that many of you are familiar with
the great firm of Sears Roebuck. A friend
of mine ordered one of their refrigerators as
advertised at a certain price in their catalogue, but when the refrigerator reached the
border
the
Canadian customs
officials
claimed, "Oh, that is not the regular price".
This Sears Roebuck catalogue displaying the
store's various articles together with their
prices had been sent out all across the country, so how could our customs officials possibly rule that my friend was not paying the
regular price for his refrigerator?
The
officials put down an arbitrary price for the
refrigerator, and my friend had to pay the
added cost. He appealed this ruling but he
lost the appeal.
Hon. Mr. Horner: The increased price
might just have been for duty purposes, and
he was really paying a higher price for the
article itself.
Hon. Mr. Reid: He did not pay a higher
price for the article, but lie had to pay duty
and a sales tax on the higher price set by
the customs officials.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Fair market value.

Hon. Mr. Reid: People get up and say that
price fixing is fair to the public, but it

depends on how you look at this, whether
you are selling or buying.
I remember
making a speech in the House of Commons
once about the high price we paid in Canada
for automobiles back in 1936 as compared
with the price paid for the same car manufactured and sold in the United States by
the same company. No one will deny that the
Ford Company of Canada and other companies are linked with the Ford Company of
the United States. The price of those cars
manufactured here and sold to our public,
as compared with the price in the state of
Washington, across the border, from B.C.
would have enabled us to pay the employees
of the Canadian company to stay at home,
and for nothing, because at that time Canadians were paying $650 more than the Americans for the same make of car.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Yet you could not induce

the Liberal government to reduce the tariff?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Once a system of fixing
prices is established you may never get
rid of it. I have heard people argue that
a manufacturer is entitled to 35 per cent.
Well, I only wish they would leave it at
35 per cent. And how is the figure of 35
per cent set? Is it set in the store that has
only a limited number of customers or in
a store which has many customers, such as
the one in which the honourable senator who
just sat down is interested? He has been
very successful, and I compliment him on
it, but lie will never make me agree that
free competition can exist where prices are
fixed.
Honourable senators, I trust that the delib-

erations of this committee will bring about
some remedy. I entirely disagree with the
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
when lie says it is just so much "eyewash"
for the government to introduce this combines legislation.
The honourable leader
opposite doubted whether
any senator
received a protest. Well, I have received
quite a number of letters, and they are all
from consumers who eulogize the government for endeavouring to take this step.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The honourable gentleman
is not quoting me correctly. I was referring
to the time prior to the proposed introduction
of the legislation.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Well, it is easily understood

why nothing was heard from the public on the
matter at that time. I doubt if there was
any senator or member of parliament who

knew that Mr. McGregor was investigating

NOVEMBER 8. 1951
fixed prices. I did not know, and if the leader
of the opposition knew it, I would like him
to say so now.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Prior to this matter being
brought up in the Speech from the Throne
why did not somebody protest to you or to
me against fixed prices Everybody knows
that this practice has been going on for forty
years.
Hon. Mr. Reid: No, it has not been going
on for forty years.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Oh, yes, it has.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It has not been carried
on that long under the same conditions nor
to the same extent that we find today.
My point is that the ordinary buying
public was not, I think, aware that Mr.
McGregor was investigating fixed retail prices.
I simply wished to make this clear because
of what the leader of the opposition said,
and I will not detain the house longer at
this time.
Hon. John J. Kinley: Honourable senators,
I had hoped to adjourn the debate, for I am
not prepared to discuss the resolution as I
should wish to do; but I understand the acting
leader (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) is eager to have
the resolution passed today, so I shall say
a few words. The resolution asks for the
appointment of certain senators to constitute,
with certain members of the House of Commons, a joint committee of both houses for
the study of amendments to the Combines
Investigation Act at this session. It seems
to me very important that at a time like this
members of parliament should investigate
anything that has any considerable bearing
upon the economic situation of our country.
But having listened to discussions on price
control, in the other house and here, and outside of parliament as well, I gather that
there is no unanimity of opinion on the matter. It seems to me that in resisting up to this
time any system of price control, the government has acted wisely, for nobody is sure
just what the effect of the control would be.
People who advocate it-as for instance, the
CCF-propose the payment of subsidies to
compensate producers and others who suffer
losses because of the fixed prices for their
goods. Well, if you do that, you are simply
taking money from the general public to
finance certain types of business, instead of
letting those businesses stand on their own
feet.
Another feature that I do not like about
price control is the cost of administering it.
The numerous officials required to do the
necessary work in order to make the control
effective have to be taken out of productive
industry and made public servants, supported

at public expense. Our already overcrowded
civil service would be still further extended
if we inaugurated a system of price control.
After all, we need not criticize this country
unduly because of prevailing high priceq, for
prices are high in other countries, and
economic conditions are probably as good here
as in any other country.
It is curious that though you sometimes
hear people suggesting price control, they
never want it to apply to the goods that they
themselves produce. I said to a group of
people down in my part of the country the
other day: "Where would you start applying
price control? Do you want to have the price
of fish fixed?" They replied, "Oh, that would
not be good". Similarly, the farmer feels
that he is not being paid enough for his
products and that their prices should not
be controlled.
Hon. Mr. Haig: There are some controls in
my province.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: The cost of labour is a
big element in the price of al goods, so it
would seem very difficult to fix prices unless
wages also were fixed. But labour is opposed
to this.
Complaints about high prices are heard on
every hand, but we need to realize that one
very important reason why we have them is
that in recent years many new factors have
entered into the cost of production. Take milk,
for instance. I recall when the retail price
was 6 cents a quart. Today the price is 20
cents, but the farmer does not get half of
that. What accounts for the increased price?
Well, for one thing, the law now insists upon
pasteurization; deliveries are more expensive,
help costs more.
Statutory requirements affect the cost of
nearly all kinds of goods today. I have been
in business, as a retailer and a manufacturer,
for about fifty-five years, and I could tell
some interesting stories about the ingenuity
of men in business.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I bet you could.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: But I want to say that I
believe that integrity in the commercial life
of Canada as a whole is at a high level. As
was said here, the average businessman of
this country has a conscience. He knows that
it is in his own interest as well as that of his
customers to try to deal fairly. After all, the
greatest asset that any businessman has is
his reputation for fair dealing, for if he loses
that, he will find the road more difficult.
I have heard considerable criticism of big
business in Canada. Well, it is an interesting
fact that no country which has not had big
business has ever become outstanding and
great. So long as big business serves the

SENATE
people well it will prevail, and no longer. I
agree that big business is apt to be selfish
to a degree. It likes to carry on transactions
in its own way; and if it is dealing with you
it will set the terms, and there is very little
you can do to change them. However, when
that is said it still remains true that big
business is usually progressive and efficient.
The resolution before us calls for the
appointment of a joint committee to deal particularly with the policy of resale price maintenance, a policy which requires retailers to
sell goods at prices indicated by the manufacturers. In a speech which he made in the
other house on the 2nd of this month the
Honourable the Minister of Justice said:
The MacQuarrie committee has reached its conclusions and has made its recommendations which
are-as honourable members who have read this
report know-of a most specific character. The
MacQuarrie committee has recommended in effeet
that the practice of resale price maintenance should
be prohibited. Now, therefore, there is a specific
and concrete proposal upon the record.

Now, honourable senators, one of the big
problems with which we in this country are
struggling is inflation. It seems to me that
that is a global problem, and that discussion
of any alleged iniquities in our commercial
life will not do much to reduce our cost of
living. This question of resale price maintenance has at least two sides to it, and some
important implications. Our Patent Act gives
an inventor monoply control over his invention for a period.
He can fix the price at
which his article is to be sold, but in so doing
ho would be going against the recommendation made in the MacQuarrie Committee's
interim report. Our Patent Act is a piece of
legislation that has merit.
It offers an
incentive to tho-e who would go forward and
create something, knowing that they will be
rewarded for their effort and that their product will be protected. Our Excise Act has
many effective regulations. For instance, no
one can buy aspirin in the United States for
consumption in this country. The same is
true of the Parker fountain pens and Vaseline.
The patent rights of the manufacturers are
protected. Then one must not forget the 10
per cent sales tax. That levy on top of the
sale price of certain goods amounts to quite
an item. The Customs Act, with its many
ramifications, has much to do with the price
structure of goods in this and other countries.
I come now to the specific question of
resale price maintenance. This is what
happens. A manufacturer approaches a merchant to handle his product. He says, "This
is my product, and I will allow you so much
for handling it; you will sell it at a certain
price and you will maintain that price". I
cannot see that there would be any incentive
for the manufacturer to allow more than a

fair margin to the retailer. In all my experience I cannot recall an instance of a manufacturer giving a retailer more than a fair
mark-up on protected goods. There are, of
course, instances of goods being introduced
on the market for the first time, and the
merchant being asked to push the product. In
those circumstances the manufacturer may
offer a better than average mark-up in order
to create a new market. But in the case of
an established product, only a reasonable
mark-up is allowed; the manufacturer is too
anxious for business to allow more.
Honourable senators, what is to be gained
by passing a law preventing a manufacturer
from establishing a retail price for his goods?
He is proud of his products, he wants them
sold at certain fixed prices, not at slashed
prices. What is wrong with that policy? The
department store in this country is a great
institution, and has been a far-reaching
medium in general merchandising. It is said
that the department store operator will slash
the nationally advertised goods in order to
attract people to his store. I believe that is
in part true. The slashing of the price on
one well-known article may cause people to
think that he is selling generally cheaper
than other stores. I do not say that he has
that thought in mind, but his methods may
have that effect. His big and quick turn-over
contributes to the situation, and cannot be
matched by the small retailers in the little
places throughout the country. It must not
be forgotten that in business one must first
meet expenses; and after that the margin is
mostly profit. The little man in the country
is restricted in his turn-over, and thereby
has a limited profit.
I call the attention of the house to the merchandising benefits enjoyed by department
stores, say in Toronto and Montreal. Through
their mail order business they deliver goods
to country places in which they pay no provincial or municipal tax, as does the local
merchant. The parcel post rates in Canada
are very low, and this is an added advantage.
Every householder has an Eaton's or a
Simpson's catalogue, and the merchant in
small towns is faced with the prices offered
in those catalogues.
I an not much in favour of the control of
prices generally, but it occurs to me that if
they are to be controlled the government
should start first with control of prices on
goods used in defence production.
These
items are most important, and the real reason
for inflation. There is a fundamental reason
behind the problem of inflation. The explanation is simply this: lower production and
higher consumption. We in this country are
now living at a higher level than at any
other time in our history; the purchasing

NOVEMBER 8, 1951
power of the people is at a peak; thousands
of young men have been taken out of industry and put into the military forces;
thousands more, who have remained in
industry, are producing articles for defence
purposes. The articles for use in domestic
life are, therefore, restricted. It is natural
that with the high employment we have
today the purchasing power of the people
should be equally high. The operation of
the law of supply and demand is bound to
push prices up. For my part, I have never
known a period of good times with low
prices. Within two or three years we may
well look back at this day and conclude that
our prices were not really so far out of line.
A short while ago the government undertook to restrict purchases of certain articles
by enforcing credit regulations. The buyer
of a new automobile had to pay down 50 per
cent of the total cost. This caused agitation.
The arrangement seems to be working out,
for after ail it seems reasonable to require
such a down payment on ýnew cars when
there are many used cars available. The
point is that it is difficult to satisfy everybody. The country is full of second-hand
cars.
Now, a word or two about the standard
of living. Ten years ago, few working men
Today the parking
owned automobiles.
places around manufacturing plants are so
crowded with workmen's cars that it is
almost impossible to get near the factories.
It is a splendid thing that our workmen
should own cars: a more equal division of
money enables everyone to share in the
nation's prosperity. Under these conditions
we should feel that after ail we are not so
badly off. From time to time spokesmen
of labour tell us that because of the high
cost of living the wages of the workers should
I do not know that that
be increased.
argument is altogether complimentary to the
labour movement. Unions have done a great
deal for labour in this country; through their
efforts labour today has attained a status it
never had before. If conditions of austerity
face this country, everybody should share
them; it is not to be expected that the
defence production program can be carried
through without some inconvenience and
somebody paying. Surely it is better that
the cost be distributed among the people than
that the Government should incur another
huge burden of debt through subsidy and
control expenses.
As I have said, I would have defence purchases controlled as far as possible. A firm
with which I am closely associated received
a contract for 100 furnaces for use at Goose
Bay. The heating system had to be installed
before the freeze-up, and it was intended

that the furnaces should be sent on a boat
which left last week. But although steel
from Canadian manufacturers was coming in
on an allotment basis,-so much every few
months, at about 6 cents per pound-and the
contract, after ail, was a defence job-none
was available for this purpose. Soon afterwards the firm were informed that they could
buy ail the steel they wanted at 12 cents
per pound. The company did not like the
idea of encouraging deals of that kind. They
looked into it further and found that the
steel offered them was imported from
European countries, that it cost the suppliers
a great deal more than 6 cents per pound,
that if the company did not take this steel
they would not get any -at ail. I suggest that
the fact that the Canadian manufacturers are
selling steel at 6 cents a pound is a credit

may well be proud of the fact that they have
not taken advantage of the present scarcity
to unduly raise their prices.
Hon. Mr. Horner: If they were doing this
defence work on a cost-plus basis, the more
they paid for the steel the more money they
would make.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I can assure my honourable friend that this contract was not on a
cost-plus basis. The company was a subcontractor for another contractor who
required a firm tender, but an additional $20
per furnace was charged because of the
increase in the cost of steel.
I believe that the government should go
slowly and be thoroughly informed on the
question of abolishing price maintenance as
between the manufacturer and the retailer.
Pricing arrangements have salutory effects on
business. They stabilize things; they make
secure to a degree a certain margin of profit.
I venture the statement that the over-all
mark-up of a departmental store is just as
high as the over-all mark-up of many of the
smaller stores in this country. The large
stores do not do business on a small margin.
They are merchandisers, and good ones. Their
advertisements are attractive; they carry a
wide range of goods, which assures them of
an extensive business from people ail over
the country; whereas the little man who
serves a small district must be prepared to
take-and make-what he can, and support
his community in taxes and services.
The Canadian Pacific Railway has been
complaining recently that the existing high
income tax is hurting it by reducing its net
earnings. This seems strange. I want to tell
honourable senators that the income and
business taxes are also hurting the little
merchant; his living costs have increased, and

SENATE

he cannot lay anything away to fortify himself against the future. Business enterprise
is affected in other ways. The businessman
needs capital. Borrowing it from the bank
increases his costs, and he is allowed no
hidden reserves. The fact that his surplus is
so largely absorbed by income tax restricts
him to a position where he cannot develop as
he should. I am not complaining about that,
because the money is needed for the defence
of the country.
We are living in troublesome times. We
are told that we must face austerity and
carry on without some things to which we
have become accustomed. Up to date most
of our troubles have been troubles of abundance. Is it fair to argue that the government has failed because it has not imposed
price restrictions?
I was amused at the
suggestion of the leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig), and referred to by the
honourable senator from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid), that the government, having
announced in the Speech from the Throne
that it would do certain things, should not
afterwards have set up a committee to investigate the subject on which it proposed to
legislate. It seems to me that that course
is an example of democracy at its best. The
government is ready to listen to those who
represent the views of the people. Business
organizations asked to be heard on these
important matters, and the committee will
function for the purpose, and will hear them.
That, it seems to me, is the right attitude and
I compliment the Government for going
slowly on a matter about which none of us
know too much.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Calvert C. Prati: Honourable senators, I shall not detain the house for long,
but I should like to pass a few remarks on
the subject of the debate today. I am keeping an open mind on this subject, but I do
not see from reading the MacQuarrie report
that price fixing as between the individual
manufacturer, the retailer and the consumer
has any great effect on the cost of living in
this country. Furthermore, I do not see
that a case has been made out that there
is injustice or evil-I do not think this term
is used in the report-in this business practice. I judge that the purpose of legislation
such as may be contemplated is to preserve
a balance of fair and equitable treatment as
between the manufacturers, the distributors,
and the consumers; in the words of the
MacQuarrie report, " . . . . for the encouraging and safeguarding of our free economy".
From this point of view there is nothing

more valuable our government can do to
bring in measures that will effect a real
safeguard.
On the other hand, I am not at all certain
that the implications of the report are so farreaching as to really call for a study of combines legislation with that particular issue
in mind. In dealing with legislation of this
type the first consideration should be fair
treatment to the consumer. He is the ultimate buyer and sets the basis for our whole
system of trade. I imagine that the practice
of price fixing by individual suppliers, which
does not apply right across the line but only
here and there, and which perhaps has
become a little more prevalent in recent
years, originated as a measure of consumer
protection, and is no less important because
it was not motivated by any idealistic thought
or feeling entertained by the manufacturer
for the consumer. It started, I should think,
from sound common-sense business practices.
After all, no manufacturer desires to have
his goods priced out of the range of the consumer. That is always the danger in times
of scarcity; but competition will take care
of this situation in times of ample supply,
when the great urge of the manufacturer is
to set up a demand for his goods. The
fact that the manufacturer has to maintain
a demand for his goods is a direct protection
to the consumer. As I look at it, the manufacturer must not neglect the distributor or
retailer, but he must keep two eyes and a
full gaze on the consumer.
Another point which occurs to me, arising
out of my experience in business, is that when
a manufacturer puts out a new line of goods
he has to create a public demand for them,
and so he spends a lot of money on advertising. When the demand is created and the
consumer reaches out for those goods, there
is a greater opportunity for the retailer to
edge up his price if no control is exercised.
He is thus cashing in unduly on the initiative
and the advertising expense of the manufacturer. The best practices in the world suffer
from abuses which have to be dealt with,
and although I do not know whether abuses
exist to any great extent in this instance, I
understand that the principle of fixing prices
down the line between the manufacturer and
the consumer is to safeguard the manufacturer's interest at consumer level and thus
get maximum distribution. I have seen cases
where goods, as the result of advertising and
attractiveness, have created a small public
demand, and manufacturers have deliberately
held down the price on those goods for no
other purpose than to stimulate the demand
for them.

fixing is wrong. As I said previously, however, the best practices in the world sametimes suifer from abuse, and perhaps at this
time there are abuses which cail for correction. I do not knaw.
Srne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

SENATE
articles manufactured by different companies
are available to the consuming public, and
so there is the keenest of competition.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: I wonder if there
really is competition.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: My honourable friend
says he wonders if there is competition. If
he thinks there is not, he assumes that there
is a combine between manufacturers to maintain certain prices. But if that situation
exists there is adequate statutory machinery
to deal with it.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: I am not saying
there is necessarily a combine, but by fixing
minimum prices manufacturers could achieve
the same result as if they had a combine.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: With all respect, I
submit that there is competition. To prove
that, all you need to do is to inquire about
the prices of refrigerators-a Frigidaire or
General Electrie or Admiral, or any other
make-and you will find that dealers will
quote different prices for different makes and
compare their respective advantages. It is
common knowledge in every trade that
manufacturers endeavour to produce their
articles on a quality basis, advertise them
nationally, get them into the hands of distributors and, through them, into the hands
of the consuming public, at a fiUr price, a
competitive price. That system has been in
effect in Canada, the United States, Great
Britain and many other countries for a long
number of years, and has been recognized as
good trade practice.
In the United States legislation was passedI
to prevent retail price fixing, but that legislation did not go as far as what is proposed
here. A manufacturer over there is not
allowed to fix retail prices, but if a merchant
enters into a contract to sell an article at
not less than a certain price, and later breaks
that contract by selling at a lower price, the
manufacturer is not compelled by law to fill
further orders from that merchant.
I referred to the electrical appliances field
simply by way of illustration, but I think
that the toothpaste field, mentioned by the
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), is
as good as any for the purpose. We all
realize that many different types of toothpaste are available to the public and that if
a manufacturer attempted to maintain a
minimum retail price consumers could purchase the product of a competing manufacturer. I submit, with all respect, that there
still is
competition among
the
best
manufacturersHon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: -and
quite a difference in prices.

there still is

I do not wish to take up the time of honourable senators by discussing particular problems, but I want to say that it is most
fortunate that the public on the one hand
and the manufacturers, distributors and
retailers on the other, are to have an opportunity of appearing before a joint committee
to develop their cases and to submit arguments for and against the proposed legislation.
It is, however, unfortunate that the whole
combines legislation is not now being referred
to a joint committee of both houses of parliament. That legislation is, I am sure, badly
in need of revision, but it should be revised
only after careful consideration by a joint
committee of the houses of parliament. I am
quite sure that many people who will be
affected by the proposed legislation, if it
passes, did not appear before the MacQuarrie
Committee. They may have submitted briefs
to that body, but I am convinced that they
never for a moment considered that the government had any thought of passing legislation to prohibit price fixing by manufacturers.
In that respect I feel that the full story of
the manufacturers, distributors and retailers
has not been told before the MacQuarrie
Committee.
It is regrettabe that this subject should
come before a joint committee of parliament
during this short session. If time does not
permit the full hearing of all representations,
I hope the committee will defer its report
until a later date, and then perhaps a broader
investigation into the whole combines act
legislation can take place at a subsequent
session of parliament.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Would the honourable
senator allow me a question? He mentioned
particularly price fixing by manufacturers.
Are there not many cases, known to most
of us, of price fixing by wholesalers who
import manufactured products?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: If the honourable
senator has reference to an agreement on
the part of the wholesaler to fix prices on
imported goods, that may be true, but I am
not aware of it. If my honourable friend's
question has to do with that situation, the
present legislation is broad enough to prevent
it. Such an agreement would be regarded as
a combine operating in the restraint of trade,
and could be dealt with under the present
provisions of the Combines Investigation Act.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I have only a few words to say in closing the
debate. First, I should like to thank the
house for the manner in which it has treated
the resolution which I had the honour of
submitting yesterday afternoon. As far as I
can recall, no speaker this afternoon has
objected to the resolution; I think it is practically common ground between us. that it is

NOVEMBER 8, 1951
wise that this question be submitted for consideration by a joint committee of both houses.
One's view on that bas been very considerably reinforced by the tenor of the debate
which has taken place this afternoon.
Obviously, this is a difficult question, and
there is more than one side to it. It is well
in our democratic system, therefore before
a proposal which will have a considerable
effect upon many classes of our population
becomes law, that there should be full and
free opportunity given to everybody to appear
before their representatives in parliament
and submit their views with respect to the
proposed legislation. This is just what this
resolution proposes.
I was very much interested, as I always
am, in the remarks of the leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Haig). The only criticism I would
offer is that in his enthusiasm he accused
the government of "humbug" in introducing
this resolution. Now, I do not think that
accusation can stand up in view of the circumstances of the case. By unanimous consent
of all parties in the other house, and I think
particularly at the instigation of the members
of the party to which my friend belongs, the
Minister of Justice more than a year ago set
up a committee known now as the MacQuarrie
Committee to make investigations as to the
manner in which the Combines Investigation
Act could and ought to be amended. The
committee sat for more than a year, and just
before the opening of the fresent session of
parliament it produced an interim report
containing a specific recommendation with
respect to resale price maintenance. In the
face of that unanimous report of the conmittee the government would, I think, be
negligent in its duty if it did not submit to
parliament at the earliest possible moment
legislation for the purpose of implementing
the recommendation the report contains.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: There has been a good
deal of discussion this afternoon as to the
merits of the report. Personally, I could
not enter into that argumentation for unlike
some honourable senators who are in business and know a great deal more about the
subject than I do, I do not feel qualified to
speak on it. But I do, as I have said, rather
resent the suggestion that the government,

because it has attempted to implement the
MacQuarrie report at this session, should be
accused of humbug. That, I think, is not an
accusation which should be made against the
government.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Has the legislation been
introduced?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The matter was
referred to in the Speech from the Throne,
and the legislation is presumably to come
out of the report of the joint committee
which is now being set up.
I have nothing further to add. I do not
feel that I can take any part in discussing
the merits or demerits of the proposed legislation. That, after all, will be the function
of the joint committee. I am certain that
the members whom we will appoint by this
resolution will do an excellent job, and that
they will take into serious account all the
representations made to them by the various
interests likely to be affected.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Honourable senators, just
one word. When the leader on this side (Hon.
Mr. Haig) used the word "humbug", he was
referring to an impression-which seems to
be shared by the honourable senator from
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid)-that the
committee is to deal with the entire question
of combines. That is not so. It is limited to
one question.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: The interim report.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Well, it seems passing
strange that, after the committee appointed to
study combines legislation has sat eighteen
months, this joint committee cannot be placed
in a position where it can deal with combines
legislation in its entirety.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I tried to explain that
point yesterday in my reply to the honourable
member for New Westminster. The only
reason why the committee is being restricted
to this particular aspect of the Combines
Investigation Act is because that is the only
aspect of it upon which the inquiry cornmittee has yet reported.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I know, but I am conplaining of the delay.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, November 13, at 8 p.m.

WHALING CONVENTION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Thomas Reid moved the second reading of Bill B, an Act to implement the International Convention

for the Regulation of

Whaling.
He said: Honourable senators, before dealing with the bill itself, may I take a minute
or two to explain the reasons which make
a measure of this kind desirable.
It may interest honourable senators to
know that for many years there has been
grave concern over depletion of the world
stocks of whales, and attempts have been
made by the interested countries to bring
about an international agreement for the
regulation of whaling. One of the first internationat conferences was held at Geneva in
1931, and resulted in what was termed the
Geneva Convention. Subsequent agreements
and protocols were concluded at London in
1937, 1938, 1944, 1945 and 1946. Because these
various agreements and protocols were for
short terms only, there was no continuing
methjd by which whaling operations throughout the world could be regulated by interConsequently, in
national arrangement.
December 1946 a further conference was held
in Washington. This resulted in the present
International Convention for the Regulation
of Whaling. At this conference there were
present representatives of the governments
of the following seventeen countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Denmark, France, The Netherlands, New Zealand,
Norway, Peru, USSR, the United Kingdom,
the United States, Iceland, Portugal, Sweden
and the Union of South Africa. Since then
the convention has been ratified by thirteen
of the countries which were present at that
meeting. The International Whaling Commission, established under the convention,
held its first meeting in London in 1949; the
second at Oslo, Norway, in 1950, and the third
at Capetown, South Africa, during this past
summer.
The oil produced from whales is an important product and is used extensively for
edible food purposes, while the meat is used
for animal stock-feeding purposes. In the
1950-51 season the world production of whale
oil amounted to 2,305,187 barrels as compared
to 2,165,505 barrels in the previous year.

The Antarctic is by far the largest whalecatching area, and during the whaling season
of 1950-51 the pelagic expedition to the
Antarctic included 19 factory ships and 241
whale catchers.
I would point out to honourable senators
that under the convention 16,000 blue whales
may be killed in one year, and last year some
16,413 were killed to produce food and oil.
The average length of these whales ran from
70 to 90 feet, and their average weight was
from 75 to 90 tons. The total whale meat
in a season runs to 1,200,000 tons. While
the use of whale meat as a food has been
held in great derision, those who have had
experience over many years point out that
one of the reasons why whale meat has
never been presented favourably to the consuming public is the method of killing
whales, which takes anything from four to
twelve hours. It is not my purpose to compare whale meat with beef, but if it took as
long to kill a cow as it does a whale, beef
would be just as tasteless and abhorrent as
whale meat.
In Canada, from about 1918 until Newfoundland came into the union, whaling
operations were chiefly confined to British
Columbia waters. In 1948 the industry was
revived in British Columbia, and has conIt
tinued since with increasing success.
should be noted, however, that whaling
operations have been carried on successfully
in Newfoundland for many years. Since that
island became a Canadian province Canada
has had four whaling plants in operation:
two in Newfoundland, one in Labrador and
one in British Columbia. The number of
whales taken and the marketed value of the
products produced in Canada for the past
three years are as follows:

Canada became a signatory to the International Convention for the Regulation of
Whaling, drawn up at an international conference held in Washington, D.C., in November 1946. The convention was ratified by
the Parliament of Canada by joint resolution
of the two houses in the session of 1948. At
the time of ratification no implementing legislation was deemed necessary, there being
then no established whaling industry in
Canada. Since that time, however, the situation has changed. With the coming of
Newfoundland into confederation in 1949,
the government acquired the responsibility
of carrying out the terms of the convention
in respect of the existing whaling industry

SENATE
in that province. Also, since then, a thriving whaling industry has come into being in
British Columbia. The government is now
faced with the responsibility of carrying out
fully the regulations adopted from time to
time by the International Whaling Committee, on which Canada is represented by a
The present commissioner
commissioner.
designated to represent this country is Mr.
George Clark, Assistant Deputy Minister of
Fisheries. Under the bill now introduced
the government would acquire the necessary
statutory authority to carry out Canada's
obligations under the convention.
Of particular import in the bill are the
clauses dealing with the licensing of whale
catchers and factory ships. It will be noted
that under section 3 an offence will be committed if the owner or charterer of a whale
catcher or factory ship fails to secure a
licence. It is only by a systen of licensing
that the necessary regulation and control for
the protection of whaling stocks can be
exercised.
Section 7 provides penalties for offences
committed under sections 3 to 5.
Section 6 makes provision for granting
authority to the Governor in Council to make
regulations for the carrying out of and giving effect to the provisions of the convention
and any regulations and recommendations of
the International Whaling Commission. Also
it should be noted that under this section
regulations can be made to permit native
Indians and Eskimos to engage in whaling or
whale treating without being bound by the
provisions of the convention or the regulations.
With the passing of the bill it will be
necessary to repeal section 9 of the Fisheries
Act, 1932, and this is provided for in section
10 of the bill.

The International Whaling Commission
determines its regulations on the basis of
scientific information furnished by the member countries. Continuing biological and
technological information is made available,
and it is considered that only by international
agreement can the world stocks of whales
be protected against depletion and, the existing population maintained and increased.
With the increase in Canada's interest in
whaling operations it is considered necessary
and desirable now to give the government
statutory authority to carry out the obligations assumed by Canada under the International Commission for the Regulation of
Whaling. It is for this purpose that the
present bill has been introduced.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask the honourable
gentleman a question? The bill does not
apply to the province of Manitoba, does it?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Well, I do not know. It
applies to all provinces, but any whaling done
in Manitoba does not really come under the
terms of the convention. That is, certain
kinds of whales are designated not ýas whales
but as porpoises. My honourable friend may
be referring to the Manitoba company that
operates in Churchill Bay. That company is
not catching whales within the meaning of
the convention, and so does not come under
this bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall the bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Next sitting.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at

AGE SECURITY

BILL

SECOND READING
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bil 13, an Act to provide
for Old Age Security.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of the legislation that is before us is, in
general ternis, familiar to ail honourable
members of this house. In essence, it seeks
to provide a pension of $40 per month to al
Canadians who have reached the age of
seventy, or, in the words of the parliamentary
commnittee whose report was laid before parliament in June of last year, it is "a universal
pay-as-you-go program applicable to ail persons seventy years of age and over, based on
the contributory principle and administered
by the federal government. The benefit should
be a flat, uniform amount of $40 a month
for ail eligible persons, and eligibility should
be based solely on age and a suitable residence
qualification".
May I say a few words regarding the'background of this legislation before reviewing
in any greater detail any of its provisions?
94703-7

The bill which is before us may be said to
represent the culmination of a quarter-century of public concern and governmental
action and planning with respect to the needs
of our senior citizens. This quarter-century
has seen the birth, growth and development
of a comprehensive social security program
for ail Canadians-the Unemployment Insurance Act, the Family Allowance Act, the Veterans' Charter, the national health program,
and other additions and extensions to the
health and welfare services provided at public expense by and for the people of Canada.
These great developments were a certain
sign of the times. They were the inevitable
response to a growing awareness of social
need among our people, to an increasing
acceptance of the principles of social justice,
and to a growing sense of social responsibility
on the part of Canadians, in common with
like-minded people in other progressive,
democratic countries throughout the world.
This is a record of achievement of which
we may be justifiably proud; but I believe the
legisiation before us today is the most practical and comprehensive approach to the
Problem of social need among our older
citizens that this country or indeed any other
country has yet devised-and I say "practical and comprehensive" advisedly.
We ail know that there is no magic formula
for social security. It can be provided only
through work. Social security must be paid
for out of production. The country's citizens
themselves, through their own hard work,
provide their governments with the financial
resources to maintain social services. Each
new social measure must be appraised in the
light of the need for it and the capacity of
Canadian income earners to carry the added
responsibility. To overburden our working
force endangers the stability of our economy,
which. provides the primary basic security
that individual social measures can only serve
to reinforce. But while each social measure
takes f rom production, it gives something in
return. Since it lnvests some of the wealth
of the nation in its own citizens, a responsible,
sensible program of social security can help
to raise their levels of health and living
standards, and just as important, to maintain their f aith in our f orm of society and in
its integrity. This legisiation has taken these
considerations fully into account. Surely no
social problem. was ever more carefuily
scrutinized than was this problemi of old age
security by the ail-party parliamentary committee established to study it in 1950. The
fact that after detailed study ail parties, and
subsequently ail provincial governments,
rallied unanimously to the support of the
universal no means-test pension plan originaily put forward by the federal government

SENATE
at the time of the Dominion-Provincial Conference in August 1945 is, I would venture
to say, the most emphatic endorsement that
any legislative proposal could hope to have.
Let me sketch briefly the record of achievement in the old age security field that has
resulted from a quarter of a century of
working of the Old Age Pensions Act, which
it is proposed the present Act shall supersede.
In the past twenty-five years, over 800,000
Canadians have benefited under the Old Age
Pensions Act. By the time that Act is repealed
at the end of this year, joint federal and
provincial expenditures for old age pensions
in Canada will have reached a total of $1,136
million. Of this sum, federal expenditures
will exceed $836 million. In the last two
decades the number of pensioners has
increased more than five-fold-from 63,000
in September, 1931, to more than 320,000 at
the end of September, 1951. The annual rate
of expenditure under the Old Age Pensions
Act has more than trebled in the last seven
years-from $45 million in 1943-44 to $137
million in 1950-51, a figure which includes
federal and provincial expenditures combined.
For the calendar year 1951, the last year in
which the Old Age Pensions Act will be in
operation, federal and provincial expenditures will amount to more than $141 million.
Thus it will be seen that even within the
framework of the existing Act an impressive
contribution has been made to the cause of
old age security.
Yet the government has become concerned
in recent years about two aspects of the
present system. First, the burden of old age
pensions has shown a rapid increase in recent
years, and second, there has been a growing
feeling that the present system inevitably
places a penalty on thrift. The belief has
been growing that some other system should
be found, embodying the principle of special
contributions to a fund created for the purpose, that would ensure for our aged people
in their later years a measure of social protection consistent with dignity and selfrespect, and without invidious distinction or
discrimination.
Under the present system, those who save
for their old age or who benefit in some
degree from industrial or other pension plan
are in part or wholly excluded by the means
test from receiving benefits through old age
pensions. At the same time, in addition to
those who have been unable, for one reason
or another, to save or to continue to earn
their living, others who receive full benefit
have made little effort to provide for their
later years. Under a plan involving the
feature of contributions, the people as a

whole are able to contribute to a special
fund established for the purpose, out of
which their pensions will be provided.
It Was pointed out in the 1945 proposals
which the federal government made to the
provinces with respect to fiscal and social
security matters, that the means test should
be eliminated after the age of seventy, as
it is regarded as unsuitable for the oldest
group in the community, the great majority
of whom are unable to support themselves
in remunerative work. The broad social
objectives outlined in 1945 by the federal
government have remained in the forefront
of its thinking and planning: witness the
close resemblance between the old age
security proposals set forth by the federal
government in 1945 and those which we have
embodied in the Old Age Assistance Act and
the Blind Persons Act passed last session,
and in the Old Age Security Act which is
before us.
I should like now, honourable senators, to
outline briefly the principal features of this
legislation. Consistent with the parliamentary committee's
recommendations,
this
legislation will provide that the age of
eligibility for universal benefit is seventy
years, and that the only qualifying requirement is a reasonable period of residence in
Canada. Benefits will be payable to aged
Indians and Eskimos on exactly the same
basis as to other persons. Retired employees
of industrial or commercial corporations, or
of municipal, provincial and federal governments, and retired missionaries and members
of the clergy or of the religious orders will
all be included. Similarly, disability pensioners and recipients of war veterans allowances will be eligible to apply. The benefit
to be paid will be at a flat uniform rate for
all, $40 a month. Benefits will in all cases
be provided as a matter of right, without
any form of means test. There will be no
provision of any kind for subsequent
recovery out of the estate of a deceased pensioner, nor for any liens to be placed against
his property. The program will be administered exclusively by the federal government and will be its exclusive financial
responsibility.
It is estimated that the cost to the federal
government in the first year of operation of
the Old Age Security Act will amount to
roughly $330 million, with the number of
beneficiaries rising from 700,000 in January
1952 to 730,000 in December of the same year.
In addition, it is estimated that the federal
share of old age assistance payments to
145,000 persons aged from 65 to 69 will
amount to $32 million in 1952, and that the
federal share of allowances to 8,000 blind

NOVEMBER 14, 1951
persons will amount to $3 million. In other
words, the estimated total federal expenditures in 1952 under these three enactments
replacing the existing Old Age Pension Act,
will be about $365 million.
The program will be financed on a "payas-you-go" basis; that is to say, sufficient
funds will be provided each year by special
contributions and ear-marked taxes, as
recommended by the committee, to pay the
cost of pensions for that year. A special
fund will be established-to be known as
the Old Age Security Fund-out of which the
pension payments will be made. The most
intensive study has been given to alternative financing plans, but the government
believes that the adoption of a program of
the kind that I have outlined, will provide
the simplest, most clear-cut and equitable
plan for old age security. As to the earmarked taxés which will finance this scheme,
it seemed most reasonable to utilize the main
taxes which at present support our revenue
system, namely, the sales tax, the individuel
income tax and the corporation tax. It is
proposed that the Old Age Security Act
shall impose taxes of three kinds: a 2 per
cent sales tax, a 2 per cent personal income
tax, and a 2 per cent tax on corporation
profits.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I ask my friend
a question at this point? The conmittee
which inquired into the matter of old age
pensions recommended that the scheme
should be accompanied by the contributory
principle. Has that principle been abandoned?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: It becomes obvious,
of course, that $365 million will not be
raised without .contributions from somebody.
The form in which such contributions are
asked for may not be exactly as envisaged
by the members of the committee, but the
pension scheme is financed by contributions
from income earners in this country through
taxation.
The 2 per cent sales tax will not be in
addition to the present 10 per cent sales tax.
Followiing the enactment of the Old Age
Security Act, and effective as of January 1,
1952, provision will be made for a reduction,
from 10 per cent to 8 per cent in the rate
under the Excise Tax Act; that is, a 2 per
cent of the tax under one Act is being transferred to another, with no change in the
over-all rate. The revenue from this source
should amount to about $145 million next
year. I may add that a sales tax is an
eminently equitable method of financing our
social security program. Where, under social
security provisions, the benefits are to be
universal, it is only proper that contributions
to the fund should likewise be universal. In
addition, under the sales tax method of
94703-7j

financing, throughout a wide income range
the burden will be roughly proportionate.
For example, by means of sales tax the $6,000a-year man will contribute about three times
as much towards the $40 a month pension as
will the man with an income of $2,000 a
year.
The proposed personal income tax will be
in addition to the tax at present in force. A
special levy of 2 per cent on taxable income
will be imposed, with a ceiling of $60 on the
amount of the tax. That is to say, the social
security tax will be 2 per cent of taxable
income or $60 a year, whichever is the lesser.
This tax will not come into force until July
1, 1952. For the first year as a whole the
tax will be only 1 per cent with a limit of
$30. On a full-year basis, this 2 per cent
additional on taxable income of individuals
should yield approximately $95 million.
The third item of revenue under the Old
Age Security Act will be derived from an
additional 2 per cent tax on corporation
profits, effective January 1, 1952. It is expected that in a full year this tax will produce
approximately $65 million. At present the
tax on corporations is 15 per cent on the first
$10,000 of profit, and 38 per cent on anything
in excess of that amount, with a 20 per cent
surcharge on the 38 per cent rate only, making the effective rate 45-6 per cent on profits
of over $10,000. The additional 2 per cent
will bring the rates to 17 per cent on the first
$10,000 and 47-6 per cent on profits above
$10,000. In addition to the federal tax there
are corporation income taxes of 5 per cent
in the eight provinces with which we have
tax agreements, and of 7 per cent in Ontario
and Quebec.
It is anticipated that the new federal
pensions will involve an expenditure next
year of roughly $330 million, though the figure
may be as low as $320 million. The three
taxes supporting the fund can be expected to
produce an annual revenue of from, say,
$300 million to $310 million. Taking these
figures as tentative only, the fund may show
a small deficit for the first full year.
As payment of the new federal pensions
will begin in January, 1952, it is estimated
that outlays in the current fiscal year-that
is, for the year ending March 31, 1952will be about $80 million. As receipts
from the 2 per cent sales tax will amount
to about $30 million, and as there will be
no appreciable collections of the 2 per cent
tax on corporations and none at all from the
personal income tax which is not effective
until July 1, there will, of course, be a
deficit in the Old Age Security Fund of
,approximately $50 million, as at March 31,
1952. To meet such a deficit, there is a

SENATE
special provision in the proposed legislation
whereby the Minister of Finance may make
temporary loans or advances, so that pensions chargeable to the Old Age Security
Fund may be paid. However, the minister
is required to review annually the state of
the fund, and if he is of the opinion that the
receipts are or will be insufficient to pay
the charges thereon, including the repayment of any temporary loans, he is to indicate what measures he recommends for
increasing the revenues. The purpose of
these provisions is to ensure that the fund,
at least after the first few months, will
be self-sustaining and that the revenue
sources are sufficient to ensure an adequate
flow of income to meet the pension payments and the repayment of loans.
These, honourable senators, are the basic
principles on which it is proposed to operate
the fund.
What will be the results of the new program
when it comes into operation in January, 1952,
after approval by parliament? First of all,
it will abolish the means test for some 320,000
persons now in receipt of old age pensions
on a means test basis. In addition, 380,000
persons not at present in receipt of a pension
will benefit for the first time, making a total
of 700,000 persons in all to benefit from the
provisions of the Old Age Security Act in
the first year of operation. Then, to this
total of 700,000 persons of 70 and over can
be added 145,000 others who will benefit
tnder the provisions of the Old Age Assistance
Act passed in June of this year, plus 8,000
under the Blind Persons Act, making a total
of 853,000 aged and blind persons in Canada
who will be covered by the legislative program being implemented this year to replace
the existing Old Age Pensions Act. Finally,
the benefits under this new legislation will
provide an invaluable foundation upon which
hundreds of thousands of Canadians can set
up their own retirement security programs.
This will be done in many ways: through
commercial or government annuities, through
the establishment or adjustment of industrial
pension plans, and through a wide variety of
other personal savings programs.
I am satisfied, honourable senators, that
this house will find, on examination of this
new proposed program, that on the score of
universality, wide coverage of persons benefited, general adequacy of benefit, absence of
means test, facility of administration, and
clear understanding of the cost of old age
security as a charge upon the nation's current production, the plan embraced by the
legislation before us stands second to none of
the comparable programs throughout the

world today. We are presently facing the
challenge of a ruthless and tyrannical regime
frorn abroad, which claims that only by its
system can social justice be assured to all. I
submit, honourable senators, that by such
measures as at present are before us for consideration we unanswerably refute those
claims. Our objective is to bulid for our
people a secure and free and fruitful way of
life, and the security which we will be providing for our older citizens through this
legislation is fully consistent with this great
objective.
Sorne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I know very little about
this matter, and I apologize to the house for
taking up time to ask whether the pension
is to be treated by the taxpayer as income?
Hon. Mr. Euler: Sure.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: If I have a taxable
income of $5,900, I shall have to add as
income this pension of $480?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: That is so.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: From that sum 2 per
cent, with a limit of $60, is taken; and when
My income exceeds $6,000 it seems that I
am thrown into a higher taxation bracket.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Maybe.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I wanted to be clear
on that point.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: There is no question that this pension payment is included
for income tax purposes.
Hon. Iva C. Fallis: Honourable senators,
as one who was a member of the Joint Committee on Old Age Security, I am naturally
very much interested in this legislation. I
have said before in this house, and I still
maintain, that to me the measure of a
country's greatness is the measure of the
initiative and industry and thrift of its individual citizens; and because I hold that view
very strongly I have not always been as
enthusiastic as some people were about some
of the social legislation which we in this
house have assisted to pass. I have always
been opposed to any legislation which I felt
would lessen in any degree that initiative
and industry and thrift of the individual
citizen; and I question whether I would have
been very enthusiastic about this legislation
if it had been presented to us in normal
times.
But we are living in a time which is not
normal. The story of the past few years has
been a story of constantly mounting costs
and a constantly increasing effort on the
part of those who have very small incomes,
and because of those conditions it seems to

NOVEMBER 14, 1951
me that the picture has been entirely changed.
It has been changed for everyone, but
especially for those whose days of earning
are over. It is a matter of common knowledge, as was mentioned by the leader of the
government-I do not need to remind honourable senators of it-that people who
retired a few years ago with an easy mind,
assum.ing that the relatively modest incomes
they had provided for were sufficient to keep
them in reasonable comfort for the rest of
their lives, have received during the past
few years a rude awakening. Faced with
increased rentals, with costs of fuel and food
and clothing soaring to new peaks every
year, and the end apparently not yet in
sight, many of these people have been forced
to dip into their small reserves of capital;
and so fear of the future and the tension it
causes have increased. The great majority
of people who are affected by this legislation
are not able to go out and earn more. It was
stated in the other place, I believe by the
Minister of Health and Welfare, that over
80 per cent of all Canadians over seventy
years of age are not capable of supporting
themselves by useful, remunerative work;
and, as the government leader pointed out
to date the assistance which has been given,
subject to the means test, has penalized the
thrifty. An individual who squandered all
he made as he went along could draw the
pension, but people with low incomes who
had been thrifty, who had managed to save
something for their later years, found themselves, though often in great need, just
beyond the reach of the pension. And we
all know of dozens of cases of people in
straitened circumstances who would not
apply for this pension because they felt they
would be accepting charity and that a stigma
attached to this form of assistance. So, for
these and other reasons, the members of our
committee unanimously agreed to ask for
the abolition of the means test.
I know that many people will say, "Well,
people should provide for their own old ageI did-and then they wouldn't have to receive
a pension". I do not blame anybody for
making that statement; I have made it myself
in the past. But sitting with the members of
this committee and examining the problem
from every angle, I came to see the other
side'of the picture very clearly. The fact
of the matter is, and we may as well face it,
that great numbers of people in this country
are engaged in work which is very worthwhile
in the communities in which they live and
necessary to the maintenance of our national
life, but which in itself is not sufficiently
remunerative to provide them with any degree
of security in their old age. I think, for
example, of the people who are engaged in
such strenuous manual labour that they

become prematurely aged, and who, when
they reach sixty, sixty-five or seventy years
of age, are not physically able to carry on
the strenuous manual labour they have performed in the past. I think of the great numbers of clergymen throughout Canada, particularly those in the small towns and rural
areas, who are very poorly paid. In these days
it would be almost impossible for them to lay
aside much for their old age. I think of
members of the teaching profession, and many
others who in the face of the high cost of
living today maintain a home, and feed and
clothe and educate their children, but have
little left to put aside for the years when
they will be forced to retire, no longer able
to carry on with their profession. These are
just a few examples of the many classes of
people in this country who, while doing most
necessary and worthwhile work, do not
receive sufficient remuneration to enable them
to provide for their later years.
It is true, of course, as many people say,
that in granting the universal pension you
are giving pensions to people who do not
need them. That is true, but I do not think
we should be unduly worried about that. As
a rule governments are very adept at taking
away any excess cash an individual may have,
and this government is no exception. I think
that we can safely leave it to the government
to devise ways and means of taking back a
good deal of what is received through the
pension by people who do not need it. On
the other hand, it seems to me that the one
great benefit which stems from the abolition
of the means test is that no ceiling is set
on the personal income, and those who are
able and willing to work after the age of
seventy may continue to do so without being
penalized. A second benefit is that labour
will not be withheld but will be available
at any time when we need the maximum
of assistance in carrying on the industrial
life of this country.
As we sat in committee we heard many
witnesses from various organizations and
representative bodies emphasize the importance of providing inducement to people to
carry on in their employment as long as they
are mentally and physically capable. To
those who may think that $40 a month is
a generous pension, one look at the cost-ofliving index will dispel any idea that we are
being over-generous. I noticed in the press
the other day that the Minister of National
Revenue was quoted as saying that $100 today
would just purchase what $40 purchased in
1936; so on that basis we are providing a
$40 pension which will buy $16 worth of
goods in terms of 1936. That is an indication
of how generous this pension really is.

SENATE
Before leaving this particular question I
should like to say that when the committee
was sitting I put up as good a fight as I
knew how to have the pension made available to women at the age of sixty-five. I
argued that women are let out of business
and industry at fifty-five or sixty, and that
women of sixty or sixty-five years of age
find it exceedingly difficult, if not impossible,
to gain employment in business or in industry. But as a lone woman in a committee of
thirty-nine members, I was simply a voice crying in the wilderness. I did have the satisfaction, however, of hearing many witnesses
admit in reply to questions I put to them that
it was quite true women are let out of industry and business at an earlier age than men,
that it is much more difficult for them to
secure positions if they need them at the
age of sixty or beyond.
Then we come to the question of financing,
with which the leader of the government
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) has already dealt so
fully. I should like to make a few remarks
from this angle. Some sections of the press
and some members of this house have
expressed regret that the committee did not
recommend a contributory system on the
insurance basis, similar to the system in use
in the United Kingdom. This would result in
each individual making his special contribution and receiving his pension as a right. That
system was very carefully studied by the
committee. Many of us were greatly impressed
by it because it would bring home to every
individual the fact that pensions cost money,
and that if one wished to benefit he must
contribute. I think I am correct in stating
that the chief reason for the rejection of this
system by the committeee was the difficulty
of coverage. Under this plan it is not possible
to make the coverage universal. It is comparatively easy under such a system to collect
from those employed in industry on a payroll
deduction plan, but it is exceedingly difficult
to cover many other such as housewives,
farmers, and those who are engaged in small
businesses of various kinds. So under an
assistance plan it would have been necessary
to provide for a very large percentage of pensioners, and this in turn would inevitably
have involved the continuation of the means
test. If any honourable senator is interested,
this whole matter is fully dealt with in paragraphs 32, 33 and 34 at page 105 of the report,
where the advantages and disadvantages of
that particular system are fully set forth. The
contributory system on the insurance basis
presents much greater difficulties in administration and involves a great amount of bookkeeping.
One great advantage of the plan which
has oeen adopted is that it will be easily

administered and will require a minimum of
bookkeeping. The committee felt that it was
simpler and easier to give universal coverage
in this way and then leave it to the goverament to devise ways and means of taking
the money back from those who did not need
it. The ways and means devised by the government were fully covered by the leader of
the government, and are embodied in section
10 of the bill. On this point I must confess
that I do not find myself in such complete
accord with the government as I have been
up to the present moment. The report of the
committee, on page 110, paragraph 64, bas
this to say on the method of financing:
The committee is in favour of the contributory
principle, not only because of the Importance of
this in raising total moneys required, but also
because of the importance of establishing a close
association in the mind of the individual between
his contribution to the cost and the ultimate benefit
he is to receive.

The senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) asked a question pertinent to that,
and the leader of the government gave an
answer implying that the money was to be
raised by a contributory system. I think one
has to stretch one's imagination just a bit to
think of the system adopted as contributory
in the fullest sense of the word. Those who
pay the 2 per cent income tax, I suppose,
will be making a direct contribution, but
the great number of people who do not pay
income tax will contribute only through the
2 per cent sales tax. Can there possibly be in
the mind of the average person in this
country any connection between a 2 per cent
sales tax levied at the manufacturer's level
and the old age pension? The average person
will not see any connection at all. Of course,
I have a pet aversion to hidden taxes. I am
not like my friend the senator from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden) who last year madle such
a very impassioned defence of hidden taxes
that before he had finished his speech I came
to the conclusion he was trying to convince
himself.
The method of contribution through a 2
per cent sales tax at the manufacturer's
level is one that I do not like. If a contribution has to be collected through a sales
tax, I would much prefer to see it at the
retail level, for two reasons. The first is the
one that I have mentioned. If we had to
pay a 2 per cent tax on the retail price of
everything we bought, and were told that
this tax was going into the Old Age Pension
fund, there would be a direct connection in
the mind of every purchaser between his
contribution and the pension to which he
will be entitled. My second reason is that
a 2 per cent tax levied at the manufacturer's
level means a tax of 3 or 4 per cent by the
time it reaches the individual. However, I

NOVEMBER 14, 1951
believe two reasons were given why it was
decided not to impose the tax on retail
purchases. One was that there is no existing federal machinery for collecting a retail
tax. The second was that in some of the
provinces .there is already in effect a direct
sales tax imposed by the province, and it was
felt that it would be confusing and unwise
to impose a federal tax in conjunction with
that. I think perhaps in some ways it would
be unwise, but I still would have preferred
the 2 per cent tax to be levied, at the retail
level.
I like subsection 3 of section 10 even
less. It provides that every individual liable
to income tax shall pay an old age security
tax of 2 per cent of his taxable income. I
do not think this is a fair division of cost.
Under this plan, if a man and wife are both
earning, the cost to their household will be
out of all proportion to the tax on the
majority of households. For example, if a
man and his wife are each in receipt of a
taxable income of $3,000 they will each pay
$60, which means for that household a tax
of $120 on a taxable income of $6,000. But
other households with a single taxpayer
may, have an income of $50,000 or $75,000 or
$100,000,-the sky is the limit-and still the
tax will be only $60. It seems to me a little
less than fair that a household with a taxable income of $6,000 should have to pay
$120 just because half of the income is
earned, by the wife, when other households
may have an income of up to $100,000 or
beyond and yet be taxed only $60.
I do not pretend to offer any solution for
that. I am not an economist or a tax expert.
Al that I know about finance is how to cash
a cheque when I am lucky enough to find one.
But I do think that the tax experts of the
Department of Finance should be able to work
out a more equitable distribution of costs in
that respect. Perhaps that will come in
future.
As for the present, I am very happy that
parliament is not longer delaying the passage
of this Act, because I know of the very great
need-increasing every day as the cost of
living increases-among a great number of
our population today. I am glad that we are
implementing a recommendation of a committee composed of members of all political
parties, a committee which gave so much
time and thought to the study of this problem.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from
Tuesday,
November 6, consideration of His Excellency
the Governor General's speech at the opening of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr.
Vien for an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators, I
wish to take part in the debate on the
Address, for it gives me an opportunity to
make a few remarks on my recent trip overseas as a delegate to the conference on world
government. But first I wish to mention the
very wonderful visit that we had from Their
Royal Highnesses the Princess Elizabeth and
the Duke of Edinburgh. I was absent from the
country for the greater part of the time that
they were here, but I was delighted at the
manner in which the Canadian people turned
out to welcome them. Altogether the Royal
visit was a very enjoyable one for our people,
as I hope it was for the royal couple. I may
say that I was passing by Buckingham Palace
at the time of the operation on His Majesty,
and I observed the great anxiety of the
British people in their concern for the health
of their sovereign. I was particularly pleased
that, despite the seriousness of His Majesty's
illness, the royal couple did not want to
disappoint the Canadian people, who had
made preparations for their visit. Also, I
think that in the circumstances our Prime
Minister acted very wisely in notifying the
royal couple not to consider themselves
obliged to leave for Canada by any certain
date. That, it seems to me, was very
thoughtful. Many honourable senators may
have visited Buckingham Palace and know
of the regard in which the people of Britain
hold the Royal Family. I was amazed to see
thousands of people stand all day long reading
bulletins on the King's health, and many
others on their knees praying that the operation he underwent would be successful. I
venture to say that in England's long history
there has never been a Royal Family that
enjoyed such an abundance of love and esteem
as the British people have for their present
King and his family.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Horner: I wish to congratulate
the mover (Hon. Mr. Vien) and the seconder
(Hon. Mr. Wood) of the Address in Reply-to
the Speech from the Throne. It is notable
that the mover read his speech. He spoke

been enacted under governments whose

SENATE
political views he shared. That long list
indicates, in my opinion, the main cause of
the inflation we are suffering today.
I have been both amazed and amused at
the stand taken by some Liberals on the
question of free trade. One used to hear
a great deal of talk about the Liberal free
trader, but it seems that the only one left
is now a member of the other house-and
he lives close to the American border; the
others apparently have disappeared until
election time.
The problems facing Canada, and indeed
the world, are to my mind extremely serious,
and we have got to make up our minds what
steps we are going to take to solve them.
We are all familiar with the unhappy position in which two world wars have left the
people of England. The fact of the matter is
that Canada is affected to the extent of the
$1 billion reduction in England's imports. It
may very well be that the greater part of
that amount will be trade lost to Canada. It
is rather discouraging to a Canadian under
a free-trade government to read in the Old
Country papers that, because of Canadian
dumping duties, no more British cars could
be exported to this country and 3,000 vehicles
already here would have to be returned.
Now honourable senators, we should be producing enormous quantities of food; and if
we expect England to purchase from us we
must be prepared to buy from ber. What
else can we do?
Turning again to the question of inflation
and the rising living costs, I agree with the
remarks of the senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid), that we cannot
expect low prices as long as we have demands
by labour for increased wages. But that is
not the most serious question. The hours
of work per day and the number of days per
week that labour puts in is the real problem.
If labour were prepared to work hard for
twelve hours a day, there would be no problem of free trade. Of course the International
Labour Organization keeps a close watch on
things; but when the people become desperate
they will do anything, even work.
Now may I give my views on some of the
causes of the high cost of living. One is the
high cost of government. For instance, the
holding of two sessions of parliament in one
year sets a very poor example for the
people of Canada in the matter of curtailing
expenditure. By way of contrast I point to
the action taken by Churchill, when he
recently became Prime Minister, of cutting
his salary and that of his ministers. I maintain that there is no justification for holding two sessions of parliament in one year.

The honourable senator from Queen'sLunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley) spoke about the
two world wars, and said that in Canada there
had been no scandal associated with the last
war. I would point out, honourable senators,
that there are different interpretations of
scandal, and that what was scandalous some
years ago is no longer so regarded. For
instance, a campaign fund donation of $5,000
was once looked upon as a scandal, and
resulted in the downfall of the government.
During the last war we saw the removal of
Japanese eastward from Canada's west coast,
and the confiscation of their property. A
royal commission, which is always costly, considered the matter and recommended reimbursement to the extent of some $256,000. I
maintain that that was a scandal of the first
magnitude. I would cite as a further example
of scandal the residence of the Prime Minister, which was renovated at a cost of some
$600,000. All the work was done on a costplus basis, with the one minor exception of, I
believe, the fence. I think that too is a
scandal of the first magnitude. Many more
such examples could be given.
If we are to call on labour, as we shall
have to, to work longer hours and do more
work we must set them a better example.
There are, fortunately, some signs that labour
is commencing to realize the need for doing
more work. To paraphrase an ancient biblical
injunction, we are warned that man must
earn his bread by the sweat of his brow and
labour with his hands for the things that are
good. The amount of labour that some perform is an evasion of that injunction, because
they don't sweat. It is a fact-which sometimes provokes me-that apparently man was
intended to work, for I feel well only when I
am working hard; and I believe I am imposing no injury on others when I urge them to
do the same. A man is happier when he is
working. Now we find the banks are applying for a five-day week. Probably it will be
based on a five-hour day.
What is the government doing in the
interests of Western Canada? I want to
protest against this business of crop estimating. People drive around in automobiles and
predict that there will be a crop of 500 million
bushels of certain specific grades; others
estimate the number of cattle that will be
available; and one estimate is about as right,
or as wrong, as the other. This system takes
no account of the weather conditions, which,
as happened in the last two years, make nonsense of their reports. In whose interests
are these estimates made? Supposing someone entered the plant of a manufacturer of

further payment is expected by the Canadian
farmer.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: But it won't be a dollar.
Hon. Mr. Horner: No, indeed. It cannot
possibly be more than 40 cents. The current
price at Minneapolis is $2.52j, the equivalent
in Canadian funds being $2.63. That represents a difference of about 50 cents per
bushel between the agreed upon .W.A. price
and what the Canadian farmer receives. The
benefit of the reduced price is enjoyed by
the consumer in eastern Canada. That is
entirely unfair. We were told by the honourable senator froin New Westminster (Hon.
Mr. Reid) that he pays 3 cents per pound
for frozen wheat. There seems very little
justificaiton for the miîllers selng bran,
which is the off ai from the wheat, at 3 cents
per pound, or somewhat more than they are
paying under the world agreement for the
whole wheat itself.
Hon. Mr. Hlowden: What would the honourable senator suggest to improve that matter?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Which matter?
Hon. Mr. Howden: The price of wheat in
Canada as compared with the price in the
United States.
Honi. Mr. Horner: 1 certainly would see to
it that the Canadian milis and the Canadian
consumers paid a price at least equivalent
to what is paid across the line, or that the
loss to the western farmer was made good in
some other manner by the public.

I havé spoken before about the causes
whieh have brought on this impasse. Honourable senators will rememnber that in the
first years of the last war the price of No.
1 dairy butter was set much too low. In our
town it was 32 cents per pound. I maintain
that the price should have been at least si.xty
cents. People were discouraged, and many
who inteneded to go into the dairy business
abandoned the idea: they said, "We cannot
possibly pay our hired help if the government expects butter to be produced for that
price"l.
As a result of crop damage, we in Western
Canada have any amount of feed and no

would make a remark like that. Had Mr.
Churchill been Prime Minister in the late
thirties we would not have had the last war,
and you ought to know that if you know anything". We had it hot and heavy. I subsequently learned that this fellow was apparently high up in the Labour government, and
I am quite sure that my reaction to his remark
was reported to his headquarters in London.
About that time I found in an English newspaper a recent picture of Churchill and a
verse about him which I should like to place
on record:
This is the face that fired us-wise but warm.
This is the heart that touched us-tough but true.
This is the chief who thunders in the storm:
"Let it roar and let it rage! We shall corne
through!"
This is the voice that cries without a cease,
"Courage in war and kindliness in peace."

Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I think this is a very
neat verse, and it fits the description of Mr.
Churchill as I have always thought of him.
Honourable senators, I was disappointed
that during my trip I was unable to get
to Germany, because I should like to have
learned for myself just what is their outlook
on the world picture. I am concerned about
their attitude and what we can hope for
from them. I am firmly convinced that had
Churchill been Prime Minister of England
following the last war we would have
established peace with Germany some four
or five years ago, and we would not have
to wait for Russia to dictate when peace
with Germany should be made.
Like the honourable senator from New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid). I want to
commend the government department which
prepared this booklet entitled Canada Off To
Europe for our Canadian troops going
overseas. In view of what two world wars
have cost Canada, I want to repeat something
I said in this chamber on a previous occasion. I am convinced that a small Canadian
army of occupation, each soldier being a
diplomat, should have been kept in Germany
following the last war.
The question of trade is a serious problem
confronting the world today, but to my mind,
something even more important is man's

dignity. Though it may have taken a while,
I think that I have thoroughly learned the
lesson that all men should be treated as
human beings, regardless of their colour,
creed or nationality. Surely if we profess
to be Christians we cannot have any other
outlook. The affronting of man's dignity is
one of the real causes of the trouble in
Egypt, in China and elsewhere. The dignity
of people in these countries has been
offended by various slights. In my opinion
name-calling and flippancy should be entirely
left out of all future diplomatic negotiations,

which should be kept at a high level. It is
really alarming the way many Englishmen
have behaved in their dealings with what
some people call "the colonies", and with
other nations as well. Just here I should like
to tell the story of a Russian doctor who
escaped from the Russian communists some
thirty years ago. When this doctor and his
wife, who was also one of the medical profession, were making their escape through
China they did a good deal to help the

sick of that country. But, this doctor told
me, he would, not answer a sick call at night
unless it was thoroughly explained that be
was a Russian and not an Englishman. Honourable senators, with things in the world
going as they are today, such a story gives
one great cause for concern. I have been
told how Englishmen have kicked Chinese
rickshaw boys and thrown the pay on the
street rather than give it to them in their
hands. These acts are exceptions to the
rule, but what a great injury they can do
in times of crisis.
Ours is a great heritage, but it frightens
me to hear people boasting about the wonderful things we are doing and the high standard
of living that we enjoy. If you look at all
the great nations down through the history of
time you will see that ease and pleasure preceded their downfall. When we talk about
democracy and about training our families to
work, we must remember that we have
started along the road to socialism and that
that road runs downhill and is greased all the
way. It will be hard to ever come back.
As a member of the select committeee on
resolutions to come before the conference on
world government, I should like to say
something about the activities of that conference. Possibly the only justification for
my invitation to attend this conference was
that, in my humble way, I endorsed the
resolution presented in this house by the bonourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) a year or so ago. Honourable senators
will recall that when our colleague introduced
his resolution there was not much support for
it in this chamber, but I am sure that most of
us were delighted when the resolution was
finally agreed to. This trip was to be strictly a
pay-your-own-way proposition, but I thought,
"Well, if I can perform any useful service at
all I certainly would like to go." I wanted
to visit the Old Country anyway. The president of the British branch of the world
government association is Clement Attlee, the
British Labour Leader. Other British officers
are Henry Osborne, Mr. McAllister, Lord
Beveridge and Lord Boyd-Orr. At every
meeting there were representatives of all the
political parties in Britain except the
communists.

NOVEMBER 14, 1951
Delegates from twenty or more countries
attended the conference, which was held in
Bedford College, Regent's Park. It was a
beautiful setting, with a lovely park on one
side. The central building of the college,
which was bombed during the war, has just
been rebuilt. The site is only a few minutes'
walk from the Baker street crossing, and
Madam Tussaud's Waxworks are quite close.
We were put up at a very reasonable rate,
and benefited greatly from our friendly meetings with the delegates from the different
countries as well as from our formal
conferences.
I might mention one little incident just
to show how wide afield went the charge that
Churchill was a warmonger. A delegate
from India asked me what my politics were,
and when I told him, he said "Oh, my!
Surely you are not a Conservative and workI
ing for peace and world government!"
looked at him and told him that the only
people in Canada who ever did or would
want war are the communists.
I received a cable notifying me that, unless
I cabled back a refusal, I was to speak with
Mr. McAllister and Lord Beveridge at no
less a place than Edinburgh, and perhaps
Glasgow as well, though at the moment I
am not sure of that. Well, I did not cable
a refusal. I thought to myself that I would
go to Scotland and perhaps get out of making
a speech after I arrived. However, I didn't
run into any difficulty about this, because
apparently somebody on the ship had sent
word ahead, and I was dispatched to Cardiff,
Wales, instead. We had a very fine dinner
there. I was much impressed with Cardiff
and with Burke castle. In the centre of the
castle there is a huge keep, such as we
used to read about, and some of the old
Roman stones are still in the walls. We
attended a luncheon and were all given the
privilege of replying to the acting Lord
Mayor. The Lord Mayor himself came in,
in his regalia, but he had another very
important meeting to attend and could not
stay with us. I was given the privilege of
making a five-minute speech. One of the
castle rooms which we saw was described
to us as among the most valuable chambers
in the world. The man who was showing
us around pointed out, among other things,
remains of the old moat and mill. He said
that in olden days every farmer in the community had to bring his grain to that mill,
and that the lord of the castle took toll on
all of it. I said "Well, that is still being
done, but in a smoother way." That night
we had a banquet, at which Lord Winster
spoke. He made a very good speech. I
rather think he is a Conservative, because
he praised the old custom of letting people
try to improve their own affairs, and he
went on to show what England had accom94703-8j

plished in the past. I thought to myself that
I had one friend there, anyway, and when
he finished speaking I shook his hand and
said that I liked the stand he had taken.
He said: "I am awfully glad you did. You
know, one is never sure nowadays whether
it is safe to advise people to help themselves."
From there we were taken by bus to
Newport, where a huge new steel plant is
going up. It is being built entirely on ocean
sand, and the piling required to provide a
safe footing for the plant was greatly in
excess of what had been calculated on. The
plant is being constructed with assistance
from the Marshall plan, and when completed it will be one of the largest in the
world. We were shown through the whole
place. We watched the slag being dumped
into the furnace, and saw a huge heated
block of metal, three or four feet square, in
the process of being rolled into a long thin
sheet. The president and directors of the
steel company invited us to a small hotel
for luncheon, and again I was asked to say
a few words in thanks. In Wales there is
a notorious character named Arthur Horner,
a communist, but I gave assurance that no
alarm need be felt from my presence, because
any relationship between him and me was
very distant.
From there we went back to London. I
might mention here that a very friendly
Indian delegate, a lawyer, who had been
with us on the trip in Wales, bade good-bye
to us before we went back to London, for he
was going to visit another part of the country. Afterwards we met him again at Hyde
Park, in London, and his delight at seeing
us once more was very pleasing.
We also went to Dorchester, where we
were invited to dinner at an hotel. To give
some idea of the interest that the people
of London are taking in the world government
movement I would mention that after a
meeting in the Great West Hall, at which
Lord Boyd-Orr, Lord Beveridge and Mr.
McAllister were speakers, a collection was
taken up and the people present contributed
some £2,500, the equivalent of about $7,000,
for the purpose of helping to organize the
movement. Posters were hung up bearing in
large red letters the words "One world or
none". The select committee of which I was
a member heard many speakers. Indeed,
it occurred to me that if the leader of the
government in the Senate were there he
would have no trouble getting someone to
pick up where another left off, for they
seemed most anxious to express their views.
One most able fellow was, I think, Dean of
Law at the University of New Jersey.
I made three or four trips to Hyde Park
to hear the "soap-boxers". One more trip
and I would have crowded some of those

SENATE
fellows off their boxes. Some of the speakers, who harangue on almost any subject,
were flot bad; but the singing, both in Welsh
and in English, which continued until midnight and later, was really worth listening to,
and was most enjoyable.
1 was impressed by the appropriateness of
the remarks of a Methodist minister speaking in Westminster Hall. I cannot quote his
text, but it had to do witb the delivery of
the children of Israel. He went on to say
that as the children of Israel had survived
their pilgrimage from Egypt, s0 the people
of Britain had survived the menace of
Hitler's Germany.
Britain baving lived
through the German bombing, the minister
questioned whether the people of that littie
island would be able to continue to survive.
His political views were rather obvious, for
hie passed the remnark: that no one talked of
work for work's sake or as if one enjoyed
bis job. It occurred to me that that observation could be applied to the people of
countries otber than Great Britain. One
"soapboxer" in Hyde Park, in ranting about
conditions of work, said that property-owners
should be deprived of their property. Someone retorted, "property-owners work too," to
which the speaker replied, "There shouldn't
be any property-owners." At this point I
interjected the remark "You are not
interested in work; you only want money",
and I moved on.
It occurred to me that the cities in
England, like many of the cîties in Canada,
are much too large; but the farming areas
are most delightful. Many Canadian farmers
could visit to advantage some of the farms
I saw in England. I was pleased that Mrs.
Horner was with me at this particular portion of the trip, for I was able to point out
to lier tbe part the women were playing in
caring for the cows and s0 on. 0f course
over there the yards are paved, the bouse
is usuafly nearby and everytbîng is dlean
and tidy. I visited one farm, an attractive
place where a mother and daugbter were in
the process of bringing in tbe cows, the
finest herd of Ayrshires I bave ever seen.
The daugbter was a beautiful girl with lovely
bair and a fresb hair-do. I watcbed ber
particularly to see if she would muss bier
bair while tying Up tbe cows.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: You were only watching the girl.
Hon. Mr. Harner: I noticed tbat sbe did it
witbout displacing bier tresses. Wben the
mother found out that we were from Canada
sbe invited us into the bouse for some tea
and cake. I told hier we did not want to
interfere with people who were doing such
useful work, and we did not stay long.

In the potato-picking season in Ireland a
week's boliday is declared to allow tbe boys
and girls to leave school and belp witb the
potato barvest. I do not wisb to appear to
be picking on the one lady senator present
this afternoon, butHon. Mrs. Fallis: Be careful wbat you say.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I noticed tbat there were
a good many girls among the school children
who were taking part in farm. work. Tbe
women too help with the potato picking in
Ireland. They do it very effectively. They
use a two-bandled. basket, and there is a
picker on eitber side. When the basket is
full they take it to the pit. I did not notice
that this bit of out door work had in any
way hurt the figures or complexions of the
workers.
My wife and I bîred a car and drove from
Aberdeen north to Balmoral Castie, the home
of the Queen, wbere a relative of bers now
lives, and returned later to Aberdeen. After
visiting Edinburgh we drove to Nairn, wbere
Mrs. Horner found several cousins, some of
them farmers. One fellow, who farms somewbat extensively was busy breaking up a
piece of land on one of his tbree farms. I
questioned himi about wbether bie needed
more land and in bis broad Scotch accent
hoe replied, "I bave no need for more land,
but the governiment pries into everyonels
aff airs. 1 prefer the trees, but the government says I must break the land, s0 I have
to break it. You can't even kili a chicken
witbout the permission of the government."'
On our way down to Inverness we saw
some very fine stands of pine which were
planted some years ago. The farms in that
area were particularly good. I found unusual
interest in a small mill, operated by water
power which was said to have been running
the year round for more than a hundred
years. Later we passed by the battlefield,
now called Culloden Field, where the Scottisb clansmen were decimated.
One cannot but think that the Scottish
leaders did not use good judgment in their
choice of a battleground. They could have
found a better-protected location to meet the
English army upon its march from Edinburgb.
There is a burn or creek over whicb the
English crossed, and nearby, wbere the armies
met are cairns of stones wbere the heads of
the varlous clans feil. It is said that, no matter at wbat time of day one visits the place,
someone is going around looking at these
tombstones; and it was so when we were
there.
We also went to Inverness, a beautiful little
city in an attractive countryside. The day we
arrived was market day, and farmers were
coming in with truckloads of cattie and bogs
and sheep to be auctioned off. Not far froma

NOVEMBER 14, 1951
Inverness one enters broken country with
scattered hills. I had always supposed that
a peat bog lay in low land, but both in Ireland
and Scotland peat deposits are found in
uplands and mountainous areas. Going down
to Glasgow we passed "the Bonnie Bonnie
Banks of Loch Lomond".
We then took the boat to Belfast, and
friends at Ballymena drove us to Derry,
through Donegal, and to Dublin. There, on a
Saturday afternoon, we went out to the horse
races. Crowds were present, for it was a
beautiful day, and it took our taxi man nearly
an hour to make his way through the tangle
of motor traffic. The horses ran on the green
grass: some races were nearly as long as
three miles.
On the Sunday night we proceeded to Paris
via Folkestone and Calais. I had read in the
Bible of "the breaking of bread" but never
had I seen it going on until, when leaving a
Paris railway station, I saw a fellow with
bread heaped on a wheel-barrow. From the
shape of the loaves I thought they were wood.
The bread was unwrapped, but it was good
and tasty. It was quite odd to see someone
carrying a long stick of bread, breaking off
pieces and eating them as he walked along
the street. From Paris we visited Versailles,
and were fortunate in having the services of
a guide who explained in English the story
of the palace. It is about twenty miles from
the capital, in beautiful country. We then
went by train to Albert, and among other
places I visited the grave of a brother. We
found some little difficulty in making ourselves understood. If I may say something
useful to our Canadian children, I would
advise them to learn as many languages as
they can..Travel is becoming easier, the world
is getting smaller, and a knowledge of
languages is of great value to those who go
abroad. For those intending to enter diplomatic service it is, or ought to be, obligatory.
I berated Mrs. Horner and a companion who
had taught school, and told them to "swing
in" and make some use of their French. My
knowledge of French was acquired in a
lumber camp about fifty years ago, and I was
rather doubtful about using it in Paris.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Horner: At Albert we were fortunate in securing the services of a driver,
an Englishman who had married a French
girl and remained in the country .after the
first great war. During the last war he was
imprisoned for four years. He drove us out
to the military cemetery of Darloy-Bouillon,
and I would mention, as it may be of some
comfort to people in this country, that the
graves are perfectly kept; avenues of trees
have been planted, and the place generally
receives constant and good care. We then
drove down the Napoleon Road to Ypres.

Hon. Mr. Aselfine: "Wipers"!
Hon. Mr. Horner: That is what the boys
called it. At Vimy, where we saw the
wonderful memorial, the German and Allied

about forty-five yards apart. Vimy is a
ridge rather than a hill. There is an underground passage, and the trenches have been
fixed up as to look as much as possible like
they were during the war, but with rocks
substituted for sandbags. In the neighbourhood, all the way along, were graves of
Gurkhas, Australians and other overseas
soldiers. The Menin Gate is an amazing
structure, inscribed with the names of great
numbers of men who feil without proper
burial. From Ypres we proceeded to Ostend
and saw various parts of Belgium. In France
and Belgium the farmers as a rule follow
the European custom of living in cities or
villages and going out to work their land.
Much of the country is devoted to sugarbeet, and I was astonished to see that the
beet is pulled by hand, the women cutting
the tops off. The beets are stacked by the
roadways, and huge machines are used to
load them into trucks, by which they are
taken to the factories. I would say that,
for the size of the farms, too much machinery
is used by the English farmers, who perhaps could more profitably work with a'few
more horses; and that the reverse is true
of France and Belgium, where one frequently sees two, three or four beautiful
horses working in a team.
Looking back it seems to me that no one
can pass by the rows and rows of crosses
marking the graves of our war dead without
experiencing a feeling of frustration and
asking himself what all this really accomplished. The fact is that our youth went
overseas in the colours of our various royal
regiments, where they fought for the
Dominion of Canada, and I want to vigorously protest the insidious suggestion of
dropping the words dominion and royal from
our use. We have become accustomed to
these terms, and thinking of this I feel
like saying: Cursed be he who removes
the ancient landmarks that our fathers
established.
Honourable senators, I want to refer now
to a newspaper editorial dealing with the
British general election. It reads:

election figures show that 28,555,492
eligible voters turned out to cast

The writer goes on to warn that we might
lose our democratic freedom if we do not
get out and exercise our right to vote. In
this connection· I would be in favour of
adopting a system of compulsory voting.

SENATE
I want to corne back now to what Lord
Methuen and other people iii England suggested to me. England, with its population
of some fifty million people, has always been
a great manufacturing and exporting nation,
but today her world markets are narrowing
and she is sufferîng from a food shortage.
Incidentally, at this point I must say how
impressed I was when crossing the ocean
to realize what an immense task our sailors
accomplished in transporting troops and food
overseas during the last World War. This
accomplishment was indeed most remarkable
in the face of heavy storms at sea and the
German submarine menace. Now, supposing
a third world war cannot be avoided and
Great Britain is forced to ask for help in
order to feed her people, I think we in this
country should be prepared to open our doors
to about ten million Britishers. There rnay
be thuse in England who will say that they
cannot send ten million young men over
here; but we could take ten million children
and old folk. We should be ready to give
shelter to these people. One of the great
objections to such immigration has always
corne from labour interests, but the Saskatoon Star-Phoenix sounds an encouraging
note with the following news item datelined
November 1, 1951, Winnipeg:
Canada's population must increase by millions if
she is to provide and increase home market for
her greatly expanded production capacity.
Perey R. Bengough, president of the Trades and
Labour Conigress of canada, made that statement at
a special dinner given here in hjs honour.
Mr. Bengough said he f elt the needed population
should corne to Canada f rom Europe and particularly
England.
He said he belleved that much of
England's population must move to, prevent the
standard of living being reduced to that of the
Chinese.
Canada could care for a population of 35,000,000
easily, Mr. Bengough said.

I think this is the rnost encouraging sign
I have seen lately to find labour supporting
such a plan.
Han. Mr. Reid: Would the honourabie
senator permit me to ask a question?
Hon Mr. Horner: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Reid: In his travels through Great
Britain and Europe did the honourable
senator find any great desire among the
people of those countries to emigrate to
Canada?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Oh, yes. I arn glad the
honourable senator from New Westminster
(Hon. Mr. Reid) has asked that question. It
seems to me that the stumbling block in
the whle matter of immigration to this
country is the limited amount of capital that
would-be immigrants are permitted to take

out of their homelands. There are men with
capital who would like to corne to this
country, but they cannot bring their money
with them. Honourable senators well know
that years ago an Englishman, for instance,
coulýd go out to Western Canada and, start
farming with just a yoke of oxen. Tnday,
however, if the immigrant wants to farmn
for himself he must have a lot of modern
equipment in order to meet competition. He
might, of course, go into sheep raising in
the eastern provinces. Incidentally, coming
back on the same boat with me was a fellow
who was coming to Canada to look over
our farming prospects. It seems that he and
bis brothers and their father have farm
interests in the Old Country, having some
200 head of cattie and about 200 sheep.
This young fellow wants to farm in Canada,
but ail bis government will allow hlm to
take out of England is £ 1,000. Now, it may
be that some people in Canada would be
wiliing to say to prospective immigrants, "I
will sell you a farm on terms".
We must ail realize that we are part of
a great world organization. We on this continent find ourselves in a choice and favoured
position, and we should not be ready to
order people back to their home countries
when they are out of work. I hope we al
believe in a Supreme Being, because a world
crisis is quickly approaching, and if we do
not do our duty and our share we may soon
no longer exist as a nation. On one occasion
a certain rich young man-like the senator
from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), he had
many lands-was told by our Saviour to go
and seli ail that ho had and gîve it to the
poor, and we are informed that that young
man went away sorrowful. It may be that
the Saviour meant this advice for rich

long belîeved that the so-called "have"
nations will have to help the "have-nots".
In closing, 1 wish to emphasize that the
serious situation of today requires, i my
opinion, the greatest care on our part when
we are dealing with people of other nations.
I ar n ot pleased when 1 hear boasts of our
high standard of living. That sort of thing
doos not comfort me at ail; on the contrary,
I arn alarmed every time I hear the rernark
made. If we exercise the greatest care in
our dealings with other lands, things may
work out ail right. I hope they will.

SENATE
OLD AGE SECURITY BILL
SECOND READING DEBATE

CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Robertson for the second reading of Bill 13,
an Act to provide for Old Age Security.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
in rising to take part in this debate may I
say at the outset that when this legislation
was made public it was interesting to observe
how well it was received by all political parties, and by people generally throughout the
entire country.
I am speaking on this
measure now particularly because of the
interest I took in this very subject of
old age pensions some years ago. One of
the first speeches I made in the House of
Commons was in 1931, when I advocated a
contributory old age pension system. I mention this fact now to illustrate how far we
have moved along the road. But it has taken
time. There is no doubt that the present
legislation is a forward step in the interests
of the welfare of the Canadian people, and
one which I am sure honourable senators
will support unanimously. When advocating
an old age pension scheme on a contributory
basis while campaigning back in the 1930
election, I received five or six letters from
people who said that they could not support
me in my election bid because they felt I
was too much of a socialist, that I was going
too far to the left.
As I say, we have moved along. The
Senate, too, has moved along. I well remember that when legislation of this kind was
first introduced in this august chamber it
was turned down. Today, however, we see
all parties agreeing with the government in
this forward legislation, although there may
be some criticism here and there as to
methods or as to the amount involved. Today
we are on the march, and social welfare is
perhaps inevitable. It is a long while since
social welfare started in Great Britain, and
it has gradually grown until today there is
nothing more any British party or government can offer to the people of the British
Isles in the way of social legislation.
When we speak about the cost to the
people of Canada of such a system as this,
I well remember that in 1936 the Honourable
Charles Dunning, then Minister of Finance,
held up his hands with holy horror during a
debate in the other house when some opposition member proposed increasing old age
pensions at a cost of some $80 million. The
minister said, "Where would we get the
money?" Well, I am hoping some day to
meet him and ask him what he thinks about
it now, because I feel certain that he never
realized that one day Canada would be

spending
something like
$365
million
annually on old age pensions, not to mention
a similar amount for family allowances.
The honourable senator from Peterborough
(Hon. Mrs. Fallis), who spoke on this bill
yesterday-and I wish to compliment her on
ber speech-said something about the
encouragement of thrift. Well, I am gradually
coming to the view that thrift as we knew it
is outmoded, out of date. I hear people complaining about the price of milk and of eggs,
and asking how much the farmers get for
these products, but if you say to them, "Why
don't you cut down on your cigarettes or perhaps drink a little less liquor?" they will
reply, "Oh, no." They want to be able to
carry on, using as much of these things as
ever, but they are demanding that the government subsidize milk or other farm produce.
I think most senators were born and brought
up in the "root, hog or die" age, when every
boy and man was taught to work hard and
save, and put laway something for his old
age. That custom is gradually passing away,
if it has not already passed, and today our
people are looking to the state, to the government, to take care of almost every phase
of our life.
I maintain without fear of successful contradiction that our present system of granting pensions to people of sixty-five years or
over, subject to a means test, penalizes thrift.
The Honourable the Minister of National
Health and Welfare, for whom I have a
great deal of admiration, admitted this. In
a speech which he made on the present bill
in the other house on October 25, he said,
as.reported at page 381 of the House of Comnmons Debates:
. . . there has been a growing feeling that there
are inadequacies in our present program. Inevitably,
it places a penalty on thrift.

The present bill which provides pensions
for people who have reached the age of
seventy, without subjecting them to a means
test, may indirectly be giving some encouragement to thrift, but later on we shall have
before us a bill to amend the Annuities Act.
The Honourable the Minister of Finance, who
explained the bill in the other house, stated
that the annuities scheme offered people a
chance to put by some money now so that
upon reaching the age of sixty-five they
would have something coming in and would
not have to look to the state for help. I
claim that such a proposal is somewhat similar
to our present system of old age pensions,
and will have the effect of penalizing thrifty
persons.
In

speaking to the motion for second read-

ing of the Old Age Security bill here yesterday afternoon the leader of the government
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) reiterated some remarks

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from Wednesday,
November 14, consideration of His Excellency
the Governor General's speech at the opening of the session, and the motion of Hon.
Mr. Vien for an address in reply thereto.
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancourt: Honourable
senators, my first words will be with reference to our Sovereign. I pray that God will
protect him and give him perfect health. The
King for us is a symbol of authority, and
of unity of the commonwealth and perfect
co-ordination between all the members
thereof. God Save the King! Vive le Roi!
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: My second reference is addressed to Princess Elizabeth and
the Duke of Edinburgh. I heard today that
the royal couple had arrived back home safe,
and in an afternoon paper I saw this heading:
"Love for Canada will never grow cold, said
Princess." In return I beg to make this
statement: "Love for royal couple will never
grow cold, say all our people."
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: I wish also to
address a f ew words to His Honour the
Speaker. To you sir, I desire to convey my
best wishes, and the hope that you will be
spared for a long time to preside with your
customary great dignity over the delibera-tions of this chamber.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: I desire to congratulate the mover (Hon. Mr. Vien) and the
seconder (Hon. Mr. Wood) of the Address.
The mover gave us a realistic and objective
speech, and the seconder presented to us
certain aspects of the economic problem of,
his province.
I should like at this time to discuss inflation, a problem which faces all parts of our
country, and this portion of my remarks I
shall make in French.
(Translation):
I should like to say a few words on the
unrest about which everyone is talking and
complaiing, but to which no one seems willing to apply the proper remedy.

SENATE
Indeed, who does not hear today about the
excessive cost of living, about inflation? To
solve the inflation problem, everyone suggests
his own remedy. Some blame the government
and claim it should solve the problem; others
accuse the monopolies and just about everybody else. But who would think of accusing
himself?
To remedy an evil so grievous, which
affects everybody, we must seek its causes
and take the means necessary to remove them.
If a person has a tumour that could develop
into a cancer and does nothing to have it
removed, the tumour will grow more serious
and finally cause death. Certain remedies of
course may be applied, a narcotic may ease
the pain. One thing is sure, as long as the
cause remains, the cure is impossible.
I shall attempt, if I may, to analyse the
causes of the disease called inflation.
First of all, I would point out that the rise in
prices in the past few years is not of the same
type as the one that occurred from 1927 to
1929. If an economic collapse were to come,
it would not happen as suddenly as in 1929.
The inflation of today is not similar to the
inflation of 1929 because, first of all, the
present inflation does not stem, as in 1929,
from speculation. The inflation from which
we are suffering today derives from a war
usychosis.
From an economic standpoint, there is
always the law of supply and demand which
plays a part in the setting of prices. Every
war brings about inflation because production of war materials gradually supplants
the production of consumer goods. Works
for war purposes are not productive. As a
result of the scarcity of consumer goods,
supply being less abundant, prices begin to
rise. Some may say we are not at war.
No, we are not at war, but we must strive
to organize our own defence, because an
enemy is watching and waiting. If we fail
to organize, the enemy may pounce on us and
enslave us.
Therefore, the first cause of inflation is that
ever-present threat of war which forces upon
us huge expenditures to organize our defence.
The Soviet are responsible. Furthermore,
they plan, by resorting to cold war, to create
economic chaos in all western countries, so
that this confusion may give rise to local
revolutions. It would then be easy for them
to take over democratic governments and
subjugate us. The truth is there: the first
cause of inflation is Russia and her satellites.
The second cause of the unrest which
exists in the world tocay is inflation due to
the quest for pleasure on the part of too
many people, and, alas, to laziness on the part
of many others. People work less but want

to earn more, believing that they will thus
reduce the costs of production and the price of
goods. It is illogical and nonsensical to say
the least. Where people were previously
working ten hours a day, they now work but
eight, seven or even six hours; the rest is
leisure. In most cases those hours of leisure are
devoted to al kinds of expenditures which
are sometimes quite frivolous and have many
baneful consequences. Hundreds of millions
of dollars go into the purchase of liquor,
beer and soft drinks. All these things upset
and weaken the system.
Sad to relate, milk, a pure and vital food
item sells for twenty cents a quart. And yet
more money is spent on beer than on milk.
More money is spent in Canada on beer and
alcoholic beverages than on butter and milk.
And yet people complain that milk is too
expensive! It would be very surprising to
find out in how many families milk comes
after beer, when, indeed, it is not replaced
by it entirely. How illogical this is; we want
the cost of living to go down and yet we do
everything we can to make it rise!
The third cause of inflation is the overcrowding of cities. Fifty years ago 70 per
cent of our people lived in the country, 30
per cent in the cities. Today, the reverse is
true. It so happens that 30 per cent of the
people must feed the other 70 per cent. With
such a lack of balance, no wonder that prices
rise and that people are so unreasonable.
Without being pessimistic, I wonder how the
human race will be able to feed itself in a
few years. Possibly we may have synthetic
products which will seek to replace natural
products. How far will they succeed? There
is a real danger here to physical and moral
health.
Fresh lemonade made with real
fruit juice is infinitely tastier and healthier
than any artificial preparation. I am not
predicting anything, but in my mind's eye
I can see the people living on the land in
a few years. How happy they will be, how
simple their life will be compared to ours,
and how quietly they will be able to enjoy
their greait liberty. It is difficult to turn a
city dweller into a farmer, and we cannot
expect city-bred people to return to the farm;
but at east let us do all we can to make our
farm youth stay on the farm.
Such are, in my opinion, the three main
causes of inflation. Of course, such remedies
as can be applied cannot remove the causes
of inflation overnight. However, if every
one personally made an effort, in his home
and in his neighbourhood, to correct the evil
of which we complain, some progress could
be achieved within a few years and things
would be much better.
The government is being asked to control
prices, but wage controls are not wanted.

NOVEMBER 19, 1951

The farmer wants price controls on what he
buys but not on what he seils. Everywhere
the samie selflshness is apparent. People are
prepareci to control others but not to controi
themnseives.
Do you want another instance of a lack of
logic? A grouýp of fairly important business
men are pressing hard to prevent price controis. At this very moment, we are being
flooded with circulars stating that manufacturers, and even retailers, should and must
control the prîce of their goods. There are
people who do flot want governiment contrai of
prices but who want the price of the things
they buy ta be controlled. Thus we skip from
absurdity to absurdity, from inconsistency ta
inconsistency, and we fail ta realize that such
behaviour is at the root of the difficulties
we run into whenever we try ta solve this
problem. Do we imagine the world wili be
the better for it?
I have referred ta '<price contrais". I
believe I can speak wlth some authority in
this matter because during the last war I
spent four years on the Wartime Prices and
Trade Board. In those four years what vexations, what insults we had to bear! Those
who at that time caiied me a czar, a dictator,
a monopoiist and so an, are now ioudly
demanding price contrais. Another inconsistency!
In wartime everyone, like the soidier, must
serve and obey. During the war the prices
board rendered invaiuable services and, necessity being the iaw, drastic measures had ta be
taken ta insure the best possible distribution
of availabie goods, in necessarily reduced
quantities, in order that every one might get
at ieast the essential minimum. We fought
ta prevent dictatorship and ta preserve
liberty. Do people today demand such drastic
measures? Are they ready ta renounce their
liberty because they have neither the courage
nor the energy nar the will ta contrai
themselves?
During the war, despite the rigid contrais
set up by the prices board, how many people
broke the law, how many sought by ail means
ta evade contrais? Price contrai in peacetime? We wauid run the risk of seeing a
whoie army organized-the army of profiteers
and bandits-that tvould take contrai of the
black market. A handful of men would make
millions at the expense of the people of smail
means. That does not mean that there is
nothing we can do. As a'matter af fact, the
government, by means af temporary measures. are trying ta control inflation, and they
ask every one ta act more reasonably.
Credit restrictions, In my opinion, are one
a! the efficient measures adapted by the government. The 1929 depression was caused by

an inflation of credit. Although. people were
practicaUly penniless, everyone played the
stock market, as only 10 per cent of the
cost of the shares bought had to be paid in
cash. Every one knýows what a disastrous end

Hlm and turned to the golden caif, and met
with disaster.
Other measures wiii be applled which, I
hope, will bring some stability, and thus
check and even dispel inflation. I may be
told: l'According to your reasoning, to stop
our defence program would mean deflation,
unemployment, etc". There is na need to go
from one extremne to the other. One day,
after a conference, I heard someone ask his
federal representative whether people were
better off now in the midst of inflation than
in 1932 when there were pienty of unsold
goods. There again the answer is easy, but
1 repeat that it is not a matter of choosing
between two evils. It is quite possible ta keep
a happy medium and adapt a reasonable way
of living.
The worid would be in a much better shape
if ahl the energy devoted to the discovery of
new implements of war was diverted, instead,
to deveiap our world ecanomy. Why is It that
in 1932 or 1935 various countries were burning their f ood surpiuses, while in other lands
men were starving to death? Why? Because
of poorly organized distribution, lack of education, inadequate means for the transportation
of goods from their source of production to

everybody did his best to establish a sound

living that is often extravagant. My generation knows by experience that before the flrst

because a dollar was worth a dollar. Everyone lived according to fis means, without
cireaming of indlging in luxuries.
In conclusion, ail those alarming problemns
which threaten our economny and our future
could be settled if ail the nations of the world

of chari-ty: "Love thy neighbour". Instead of

OLD AGE SECURITY BILL
SECOND READING

DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Robertson for the second reading of Bill 13,
an Act to provide for Old Age Security.
Hon. Ray Petten: Honourable senators, it
is now twenty-five years since Canada's first
attempt to enact old age pensions legislation
was blocked in this very chamber. The
fact that the present measure is the direct
result of the unanimous recommendations
made last year by a committee in which
eleven senators participated is indicative of
the change of heart that has taken place
here.
I cannot refer to the joint parliamentary
committee on Old Age Security without paying special tribute to the work of one of its
joint chairmen, the honourable senator from
Kootenay East (Hon. Mr. King)Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Petten: -who a quarter of a
century ago introduced the original Old Age
Pensions Act in the other place. It must
be a great source of pride and satisfaction
to the honourable senator and his Senate
colleagues on that committee to see their
recommendations definitely crystallized in
the measure now before us. These recommendations were put forward after the most
careful deliberation.
It is sometimes thought in certain quarters
that the appointment of a parliamentary committee-and, more particularly, one representing both houses-indicates either that the

government has no intention of doing anything about a problem, or that it does not
know what to do. The Joint Committee on
Old Age Security is an outstanding example
of this misapprehension of the proper functions of a parliamentary committee.
That the government had no intention of
shelving the problem of providing a greater
measure of old age security is obvious from
the energetic way in which the committee
was encouraged to set to work, and also from
the promptness with which its recommendations were accepted and are now being
implemented. Less than three months after
the committee had been set up, a report, running to more than 100 pages, and based on
the committee's printed record of proceedings
and evidence amounting to more than 1,300
pages was submitted to the government with
a unanimous recommendation for a two-part
old age security program. As to the second
suggestion-that the government referred the
problem to a parliamentary committee because
it had nothing constructive to suggest itselfI need only remind members of this chamber
that the final recommendation of the committee coincided almost exactly with the proposals made by the federal government to the
provinces in 1945.
While the speed with which the committee
carried out its deliberations and arrived at
its conclusions is quite remarkable, subsequent action by the Government to implement
its findings is, I think, no less remarkable. We
must not forget that in order to carry out
these recommendations in full, it was necessary to obtain the agreement of eleven governments in Canada to a basic amendment to
the Canadian constitution. The consent of
His Majesty's Government in the United
Kingdom was also required in order to amend
the British North America Act to permit the
federal government to institute a contributory system of old age security. When it is
considered that in spite of all the involved
questions relating to the constitutional division of authority and responsibility, the Old
Age Assistance Act was actually on our
statute books within a year from the presentation of the committee's report; and now, a
short four months later, the Old Age Security
Act is before this chamber for ratification, I
think we have a striking example of how an
energetic government can get quick results
within the framework of our democratic
processes.
Old age security is a complex problem with
many social and economic implications. In
charging the committee with the serious
responsibility of considering this matter, the

SENATE

intention of the government was made abundantly clear. Let me recall the words of the
Minister of National Health and Welfare in
speaking on the resolution to establish this
committee, on Friday, March 10, 1950. He
said:
What we wish to do is to develop, within the
limits only of the financial capacity of our people
and with due regard to our over-all commitments in
all fields of social security and other governmental
responsibilities, the simplest, most effective and
most hurnane system of old age security that it is
possible for us to devise.

A government's intention could not be made
much clearer than that.
It is unnecessary at this stage to review
in detail the committee's recommendations.
On page 108 of its report the committee concluded that, al things considered, the most
suitable old age security plan for Canada
would consist of the two-part program which
is embodied in the legislation before us at
the present time and the Old Age Assistance
Act passed last June.
The timing of the committee's report was
most significant. Tabled three days after
the forces of North Korea crossed the 38th
parallel, and the very day that the members
of the United Nations were deliberating on
the resolution of the Security Council that
they "furnish such assistance to the Republic
of Korea as may be necessary to repel the
armed attack and to restore international
neace and security in the area", it might have
found its ways into the limbo of forgotten
things.
However,
notwithstanding
the
gravity of the international situation and
the extra demands thus imposed on the Canadian economy, the government determined to
go ahead with its plans to provide better for
nId age security. In doing so, it showed
commendable courage. It was evident that
the need for stepping up the defence program to hitherto unprecedented proportions
would place a difficult strain on the nation,
would add to inflationary pressures, and
would increase the burden of taxation. The
government decided, however-and I think
wisely-that the question of old age security
was a matter of the highest social priority
and could not be postponed until general
economic conditions became more favourable,
without placing undue hardship on a considerable group of Canadians.
In the months between Korea and the
passage of the Old Age Assistance Act, the
Prime Minister and members of his cabinet
repeatedly made the government's position
quite clear-that it was anxious to proceed
with the new program of old age security
with the greatest possible despatch. It has
also been emphasized by responsible Canadians, both within and without the government, that the strengthening of our social

measures is in the long run a part of our
defence effort against those systems that place
the welfare of the state above that of the
individual citizen.
The general outlines of the two-part program are by this time quite clear, but I
think something might usefully be said here
about the extent of coverage, the financial
implications and the division of government
responsibility in this program.
As every member of this chamber knows,
the means test pension for those aged 65 to
69 will be paid under the authority of the
Old Age Assistance Act, and will be administered by the provinces and financed jointly
by the federal and provincial governments.
It is expected that this part of the programif each province enacts parallel provincial
legislation-will benefit some 145,000 persons aged 65 to 69. The costs are likely to
run somewhere around $64 million, which
will be shared equally by the federal and
provincial governments.
The Old Age Security Act itself provides
for old age pensions to those of 70 and over
who are able to satisfy a very reasonable
residence requirement. It is estimated that
more than 700,000 Canadians will benefit
from this measure next year. This program,
of course, is entirely federal, and will cost
in the neighbourhood of $343 million a year.
With the increasing age of our population,
because of advances in medical science and
improvements in health services, it is altogether likely that the numbers 'of old age
pensioners and, consequently, the cost of
the program will increase progressively with
the years.
What this program will mean in my own
province of Newfoundland can best be seen
by an examination of the figures. It is estimated that some 5,400 in the 65 to 69 age
group will be eligible for old age assistance,
at a cost to the federal and provincial governments of $1,250,000 each. In the 70 and
over group about 14,000 will benefit, at a cost
to the federal government of $6,250,000. The
federal share for both programs will be in the
neighbourhood of $7,500,000.
The measure envisaged in the bill before
us and in the Old Age Assistance Act already
enacted is no casual program, irresponsibly
invented to provide a convenient outlet for
government surpluses.
It is, rather, the
tangible expression of a growing awareness
on the part of the government of its social
responsibilities. Fifty years ago, in a much
simpler society, there was little need for old
age pensions, but in today's urban and highlyindustrialized society there is an urgent need
for organized social action to correct the
imbalances and inequalities of our system.

person who put something aside for a rainy any social measure we must be realistie. As
day was inevitably discriminated against, the honourable the leader of the Senate (Hon.

SENATE
Mr. Robertson) has so well emphasized, there
is no magic formula for social security. Work
is the only source of social security. Those
who feel that the present measure is inadequate in terms of the amount of benefit paid
should stop and consider the cost. As I mentioned earlier, the total cost to the federal
government of the new age pension, along
with its share of old age assistance, will be
about $375 million to $377 million next year.
This is a great deal of money, and every
dollar of it must come out of the pockets of
individual Canadians. To finance the program
in its present form, Canadians will be asked
to pay 2 per cent more on their personal
income tax. A further tax of 2 per cent is
being added to the already heavy taxes on
corporation profits, which in the final analysis
must be paid by consumers. Finally, a portion amounting to 2 per cent of the present
10 per cent sales tax is to be ear-marked
for the Old Age Security Fund. If Canadians
want higher pensions, they will simply have
to pay higher taxes. With regard to the level
of benefits paid, I think it should also be
emphasized that, to my knowledge, it has
never been the intention of the federal government to take over complete responsibility
for the retirement security of Canadians. Any
government plan should be adequate to provide for minimum maintenance in old age,
but it should not and could not be designed
to replace or supplant individual personal
savings.
Let me now say a word about the second
criticism that bas been directed towards this
program-that the age of eligibility should
be lowered by five or ten years. It has been
suggested that if the principle of universality
is valid at age 70, it should be equally valid
at age 65. I believe this does not necessarily
follow, for the problem of those in the 65
to 69 group is essentially different from that
facing most people at the age of 70, the vast
majority of whom are retired and no longer
in the active labour market. A good many
people between 65 and 69 are still active and
self-supporting. With the progressive improvement of our health services, and as medical
research finds the solution to more and more
of the diseases of later life, the numbers who
will be able to make a useful contribution to
our national production will continue to
increase. At this time, when in the interests
of national security we are engaging in the
most ambitious peace-time defence program
in our history, I believe it would be most
unwise to give any inducement to premature
retirement. It should be remembered, too,
that anyone between 65 and 69 who is in
actual need will be eligible for old age
assistance.

The third criticism that has been levelled
at this bill by the opposition does not concern
the bill itself, but rather at its administration
by the Department of National Health and
Welfare. There has been much talk of lawyers
and family Bibles-the latter, at least, commendable; indeed, the erudition of legislators
on Biblical matters is most reassuring. It will
be recalled that last June authority was given
to the Minister of National Health and Welfare to proceed with the registration of pensioners in anticipation of the enactment of
this legislation. While some older members
of our population have undoubtedly experienced some difficulty in proving their age, I
think most reasonable Canadians would agree
with no hesitation that the department has
done a magnificent job in its advance
registration.
There will be something over 700,000 persons eligible for old age pensions. Of these,
more than 300,000 are already receiving
means test pensions under the present Old
Age Pensions Act. The department made
arrangements with provincial pension authorities so that these 300,000 persons might be
transferred automatically from provincial
pension rolls to the new old age pension
without requiring any further application.
For the remaining 400,000 or more persons 70 years of age and over, a very simple
application form has been made available
in every post office in Canada. I understand
that about 300,000 applications have already
been received in the ten regional offices, and
that further applications are coming in at
the rate of about 9,000 a week. Already more
than two-thirds of these applications have
been fully approved. Right now I believe
the department has completed all the necessary investigations to begin pension payments for about 500,000 of the 700,000 who
are expected to be eligible.
It would, of course, be unrealistic to say
that there have not been certain difficulties
in the proof of age. There have been. A
person who was born 70 years or so ago may
have been born in a province that had no
vital statistics, he may have been born in
another country, or his origins may be
shrouded in mystery. Surely the Department
of National Health and Welfare cannot be
blamed because a parish church has burned
down, because a Canadian province did not
exist in 1871, because some province or other
maintained no vital statistics at that time,
or because a family Bible has been lost.
From time to time, I have had occasion to
make inquiries on behalf of certain residents
in my own community, and I must say that I
have had nothing but the most courteous cooperation from officials of the Department

NOVEMBER 20, 1951
of National Health and Welfare, both in our
Newfoundland regional office and at headquarters in Ottawa.
Bearing in mind that the approval of one
pension application commits the Government
to an expenditure of perhaps $5,000 over a
period of years, the registration and proof
of age of nearly three-quarters of a million
old age pensioners is one of the toughest
administrative tasks ever undertaken b9 a
government department. That it has proceeded as smoothly as it has, and with only
a very small addition to the staff of the
department, is a splendid tribute to the Minister and Deputy Minister of the department,
and to every one of its officers and employees.
In speaking in support of the Old Age
Security Act, I do so because I believe that
it is one of the most comprehensive measures
ever taken by any government to provide
better security for its senior citizens. It is a
reflection of Canada's full acceptance of

a mark of our determination to provide for
hundreds of thousands of Canadians who
have made an honoured contribution to this
nation's development, a greater measure of
old age security than has ever before been
possible.
Hon. Mr. King: Honourable senators, I
move the adjournment of the debate.
The motion of honourable Mr. King was
agreed to, and the debate was adjourned.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the opening of the
session, and the motion of honourable Mr.
Vien for an address in reply thereto.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
my chief reason for taking part in this debate
is to bring the attention of this chamber to
the sorry plight of many of the farmers in
the three Prairie provinces. Before doing
that, however, I would offer my congratulations to the mover (Hon. Mr. Vien) and the
seconder (Hon. Mr. Wood) of the Address in
Reply to the Speech from the Throne and
compliment them on their able speeches.
I take this opportunity to associate myself
with what has been said about the recent
visit of Their Royal Highnesses, the Princess
Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh.
Yesterday, after listening to the fine address
made by Her Royal Highness before the
Lord Mayor's dinner in London, I felt
assured that at least so far as she and the
Prince were concerned, their visit to Canada

was an outstanding success. She praised the
people of this country for the reception they
had given her and her husband.
I understand that when a Newfoundlander
talks about things back home he is said to
be "talking cod." So today, for a while at
least, perhaps I will be permitted to "talk
cod." The honourable senator from Regina
(Hon. Mr. Wood), in his speech before the
recent recess, brought the attention of the
house to the problem of the Western farmers.
I knew at that time that the harvest was
delayed, but having my own wheat threshed,
I did not fully realize the seriousness of the
plight of others. On my way home during the
recess I made certain observations. I found
that even in the Province of Manitoba, with
its fine limateHon. Mr. Hayden: What about the city of
Winnipeg?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Our crop is threshed.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: -the farmers had not
completed threshing. I observed that along
the main line of the Canadian National
Railw.ays about 10 per cent of the crops were
unthreshed; and I was told that in the northwestern part of the province 40 to 50 per cent
of the grain was still in the fields. Notwithstanding the fact that some damp and tough
grain has since been threshed, I am advised
that at the present moment conditions in
Manitoba are much the same as they were
when I saw them.
I found even worse conditions in the
Province of Saskatchewan. During the three
weeks I was there I saw very little sunshine.
The sun would come up in the mornings for
about an hour, and then the sky would cloud
over and spit rain or snow for the rest of
the day. Little or no threshing was done in
that province during the period of my visit.
In the southern part of Saskatchewan where
I live we had one fair week early in the
season, and we were able to do a good deal
of our threshing; but there are many farmers
who today have a thousand acres of wheat
lying in the swath. The honourable senator
from Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte) tells me
that the crop on his farm in southwestern
Saskatchewan is still under snow, and I have
received letters from people in the northern
part of the province, in such places as Tisdale
and Melfort, where the crop yield is from
40 to 50 bushels an acre, informing me that
some 60 per .cent is under the snow and will
not be threshed until spring. Some of this
grain is in the swath-that is lying on the
ground; the remainder of it is standing.
As honourable senators know, we in the
West no longer thresh our grain in the old

SENATE
way. Today very little wheat is cut with the
binder. Binder twine is now 30 cents a
pound or moreHon. Mr. Horner: It is 39 or 40 cents a
pound.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: -whereas it used to be
14 cents. The cost of operating a farm is
greatly reduced by the use of the combination thresher. The procedure is either to
cut, thresh and elevate the grain in one
operation, or to use a swather to cut the
grain, leaving it on the stubble with the heads
up, to cure, to be picked up and threshed
about a week later. Grain in the swath,
except in very low areas where water may
lie, may be threshed in the spring, and in my
opinion such grain is in better shape today
than is standing grain, much of which will be
shelled out by the winter winds.
The cause of all this difficulty was the very
late spring. Just as we were getting ready
to sow our wheat a 15 inch snowfall caused
a delay of two weeks. In June the weather
was dry. In July the rains began. They did
not stop early in August, so that the grain
could ripen, but continued through that
month. Both rain and snow fell in September
and October, and it was snowing in the early
part of November when I left to return to
Ottawa.
Honourable senators will realize from what
I have said and the speech of the honourable
senator of Regina (Hon. Mr. Wood), that the
farmers of the three prairie provinces are in
a sorry plight, and are going to suffer terrific
losses. The latest government report is to the
effect that the crop will be 560 million
bushels, but I venture to say that when finally
harvested it will be less than 400 million
bushels, with a loss to the farmers of from
150 to 200 million bushels. If you remember
that this promised to be the only good crop
that many farmers have had since the year
1942, you will understand what conditions
this year mean ta them.
I would further point out that when the
first threshing was done the grade generally,
was No. 1. Then the weather changed, the
grain was bleached, and some of it sprouted
in the swaths, with the consequence that the
grade fell to No. 2. A little later no grain
above No. 3 was harvested; and when I
left, all was going No. 3 tough, No. 3 damp,
or worse. Honourable senators from other
parts of Canada may not realize what is
implied in these reductions of grade. For
example, if your grain is tough you lose 4
cents a bushel, but if it is damp you lose
an additional 14 cents, so that in the result
you receive about 18 cents less than you
would get for the straight grade.

Hon. Mr. Burchill: Is that the amount it
costs to dry it?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I am coming to that.
The trouble is that we have not sufficient
facilities for the drying of four or five
hundred million bushels of wheat. What are
known as internal or storage elevators are
located at Saskatoon, Moose Jaw, Edmonton,
Calgary, and, I believe, Prince Rupert.
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: There is one at Lethbridge.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The total drying capacity per day of all these internal storage
elevators, operating on a twenty-four hour
basis, is only 50,000 bushels.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Does the drying process
restore the grain to its original grade?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It might raise the grade
3 damp to grade 3, but it would not raise
it to a higher grade, even though the wheat
weighed over sixty pounds to the bushel
My point with regard to drying is that
greater drying facilities in our internal storage elevators are needed. It is true that the
facilities in the big elevators at the head of
the lakes are comparatively good, but our
elevators are full of last year's crop and the
early thresh of this year; box cars are
scarce, andi there is no way of getting to the
lake-head elevators for drying the wheat
which is being threshed tough and damp. It
must therefore be left on the farms all
winter, and although it will keep so long as
the frost is severe, we fear that it will spoil
before it can be transported to some place
where it can be dried. As the combined
drying facilities on the prairies and at Prince
Rupert cannot handle more than 50,000
bushels a day, it takes at least twenty days
to dry only a million bushels, so honourable
senators can estimate how long it would
take to dry a crop of 400 million bushels.
The question is, how are these farmers
going to finance over the winter? What are
we going to do? A great deal has been said
about this in the other place, but very little
in this chamber; and I have not been able
to find out what the government intends to
do. In my opinion the problem is the responsibility of not only municipal and provincial
authorities, but of the federal authorities as
well. I believe that the banks would be
willing to.lend money to the farmers if the
credit restrictions which were imposed last
spring by the Bank of Canada were removed
or modified. A man who has a good crop on
his farm, in swath or in the granary, should
be able to borrow from his bank a reasonable amount of money with which to carry
on. I understand, however, that the banks

NOVEMBER 20, 1951
are prohibited from taking security on grain
before it is warehoused, so that such loans
as they might make would be only on the
security of the farmer's note, and possibly on
nothing more. ,I hope that the problern will
be solved, and that something will be done
immediately. It is true that the 28 or 29
cents a bushel to be paid some time between
now and the end of the year on the 1950 crop,
will help our producers. But last year in
very many districts the crop was not good,
the farmers did not mnarket much wheat, and
the returns these people will receive on the
basis of 28 or 29 cents per bushel will not be
very great.
Then there is the seed problem. It has
been estimated, I believe, that of the entire
Western crop not more than a million bushels
of wheat will grade No. 1. This is a serious
matter, especially when it is remembered that
from forty to fifty million bushels of wheat
are needed to put in the crop next spring. I
believe that right now, not next spring a! ter
the grain has been shipped to the head of the
lakes, the government should make provision to hold in the three western provinces
enough grade 2 and grade 3 wheat to take
care of seeding requirements in 1952.
That is ail I have to say about the plight
o! the farmer.
There is another matter I should like to
bring to the attention of the house. It is
re!erred to in the Speech from the Throne, as
follows:
The commission to consider whether the economlc
and social returns to the Canadian people of the
investment in the proposed South Saskatchewan
river project would be commensurate with the cost
has been appointed and Is pursuing its studies.

Some of us thought ah that had been done
several years ago. The chief issue in the last
Saskatchewan provincial election was this
South Saskatchewan dam and irrigation
project and the hydro-electric power which
it would provide for the province. The South
Saskatchewan is a large river, rising away
up in the foothilis of the Rocky Mountains
and fiowing through Alberta and central
Saskatchewan before turning north and fiowing into the North Saskatchewan a short distance east of Prince Albert. Its banks are
very high, and in the opinion of the people
of Saskatchewan this whole project is quite
feasible. If and when the dam is constructed
it will provide a water supply for the cities
of Moose Jaw and Regina, and it wlll mean
that the great area in central Saskatchewan
which has been dry for so many years, but
where the soil is very good indeed, can be
irrigated. It also will be capable of developing a great deal of power. As I have said,
we thought this question had already been

decided, and that it was just a question of
where and how the dam should be bujit. But
the Speech fromn the Throne would indicate
that this is flot; the case, and that possibly
the whole project will not be proceeded with.
While it may flot have been necessary this
year because of an abundance of rainfaîl, I
arn entirely in favour of the project going
ahead, because it could have the resuit of
making the whole area one of the most productive in Canada.
Another matter that I wish to bring to the
attention of the house is this. In spite of
the poor season we have had in the three
prairie provinces, certain of our farmers have
been able to save enough good grain to compete in the Royal Winter Fair at Toronto.
In November, 1949, 1 brought to the attention
of this house the fact that Mr. Albert Kessel
of Rosetown had become known as the World
Rye King, having won the world's prize for
rye, not only at Toronto but also at Chicago.
Last year, 1950, Mr. Kessel was not; so successful with his rye, but he won the barley
and fiax championships at Toronto. Something happened to his exhibits, and they did
flot reach Chicago in time for competition,
so we do flot know whether they would have
been as successful there or not. However, this
year Albert Kessel has again been named the
Rye King, his exhibit being awarded first
prize in the Toronto show, where hie received
a trophy vaiued at $1,000. He cannot keep
this, of course, but he received $240 in cash
and a silver tray valued at $100. His exhibits of Prolific rye, Hannchen barley, Redwing
fiax and Apex wheat, have been sent to
Chicago to be judged. My efforts are directed
to the growing of wheat, but I want the
house to know that the grains to which I have
just referred can be grown on the Rosetown
plains, and that ours is not entirely a wheatgrowing district. I want to pay tribute at
this time to Albert Kessel for his energy,
ingenuity and the great interest hie takes in
the matter of growing good seed.
I turn nýow to taxation. I believe honourable senators have received this document
entitled Taxation Statistics of 1951. At pages
131, 132 and 133 wfll be fîound certain
interesting figures. I arn still 1talking cod".
These figures disclose that for the year 1949
the farmers of the three prairie provinces
paid in income tax more than, five times
the amount paid by ail the farmers of the
rest of Canada.
The western farmers
Hon. Mr. Euler:
could not have been so unfortunate then.
Hon. Mr. Assumie: That is for 1949. I
do not say that the farmers of Ontario,
Quebec and the Maritime Provinces are not

SENATE
filing proper returns or are failing to pay
their share, but it is hard to convince the
farmers of the Prairie Provinces that this
is not so. I shall place these figures 'on
record to indicate why the western farmers
feel as they do. These statistics, which apply
to the taxation year of 1949, are as follows:
Quebec, 200 farmers paid.............
$ 51,000
Newfoundland, 10 farmers paid ......
2,000
Prince Edward Island, 80 farmers paid
4,000
Nova Scotia, 160 farmers paid .......
33,000
New Brunswick, 120 farmers paid ...
11,000
Ontario, 8,010 farmers paid ...........
1,940,000
Manitoba, 6,590 farmers paid .........
1,585,000
Saskatchewan, 20,080 farmers paid ...
6,647,000
Alberta, 15,980 farmers paid..........
7,153,000
British Columbia, 1,650 farmers paid .
544,000

Hon. Mr. Euler: Could the honourable
senator make a comparison between the total
income tax paid by the people of the Province of Ontario and that paid by the people
of the Province of Saskatchewan?
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: I knew my honourable colleague from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) would bring that up. I am just referring to farmers. It is quite obvious from
this document that the people in Ontario
and Quebec, apart from the farmers, pay
the greater part of income tax of the
Dominion of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Do the statistics show
what part of that revenue is from cil
production?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I did not go into that.
The figures cover farmers, fishermen, doctors, dentists, lawyers, osteopaths and so on.
I do not think there is any oil involved here,
nor do I think the figures I have - given
include the income derived by merchants,
doctors, lawyers and others from farms
which they have rented out. I believe this
income is shown as investment income, and
that otherwise the figures I have given would
be higher.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: May I point out to
the honourable senator that the farms in
Western Canada are not the same size as
those in Ontario and Quebec.
Hon. Mr. Aselfine: I realize that some of
your farms are small, but you also have some
big ones.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: There is a lot of
mechanized farming in the West.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I want to show honourable senators how the income tax authorities
handle things out West. For example, when
a farmer takes a load of grain to the elevator
and gets a cash ticket for it, that «is not the
end of the matter. The Wheat Board, which
keeps a record of every bushel of grain that
a farmer markets, forwards a copy of that

ticket to the Income Tax Board, and the
farmer has no way under the sun of avoiding
the payment of income tax.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
An Hon. Senator: Should he have?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Does that kind of thing
take place in Ontario, Quebec and the Maritime Provinces?, I do not think so. The
figures I have quoted would indicate that
there is something wrong. Do you mean to
tell me that if all the farmers in the East
had filed proper income tax returns for 1949
the Ontario farmers would have paid only
$1,940,000 in taxes, or the farmers of Prince
Edward Island would have paid only $4,000?
Hon. Mr. Golding: They gave their potatoes
away, though.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I do not say they did
not. At all events, it looks suspicious.
Here is another thing. They even get our
farmers after death.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: Does the amount of tax paid
on wheat profits in the West reflect the bonus
received from the government?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Yes, we pay a tax on
that too. We pay on everything.
I was just going on to say that the income
tax people even get money from a western
farmer affter he is dead. To show what happens, let us take the case of a man who has
filed his income tax return f aithfully every
year and paid his tax. When he dies his executors file a return with the Succession Duties
Branch, and a copy of that document is
,turned over to the Income Tax Branch. The
income tax officials look over that, and they
say, "This man could not have paid all his
income tax or he would not have had so much
money now." So they write to the executors
and slay, "We want you to explain how it
comes about that the deceased left an estate
of $40,000"-or whatever the amount may
be-"and he paid only a certain amount of
income tax." Well, the poor executors go to
work and try to get an explanation; but of
course the farmer did not keep very good
books, and they are at a loss to show why he
did not pay more income tax.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Does this happen in
Manitoba?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: In the three Prairie
provinces.
Hon. Mr. Euler: It is net peculiar to any one
province.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I think that it probably
happens in every province, but I am simply
giving an example of how it affects farmers.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: It is not limited to farmers.

NOVEMBER 20, 1951
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Then the Income Tax
Branch requests the executors to file a net
worth statement for each of the last ten years.
The executors dig around and get ail the
information they can, and file the statements,
whereupon the Income Tax Branch makes an
arbitrary assessment against the executors,
in many cases muleting them in an additional

tax of $10,000 or $15,000.

And not only are -copies of the tickets sent
by the Wheat Board to the Income Tax
Branch, but inspectors galore come out from
the district offices and go around to the farms,
checking and re-checking. For a long time
now we have been of opinion that we could
very well do without a lot of those inspectors.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: They might find quite a
bit of work to do in Ontario, Quebec and the
Maritime Provinces.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: They gó there too.
Hon. Mr. Euler: And they do a good deal of
work there.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Now I wish to deal with
another matter, divorce. This is a matter
which most members of this chamber seem to
avoid as they would a contagious disease. I
do not pretend to be an expert on divorceHon. Mr. Golding: But you are.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: -but
I have had
eighteen year's experience as a member of
the Senate's Standing Committee on Divorce,
and I have had some experience as a practising barrister-at-law in Saskatchewan. I had
no intention of referring to this subject today,
and I am bringing it up only because I
recently read in the Winnipeg Free Pressthat great Manitoba newspaper-that a new
royal commission is being appointed in England to consider the whole question of divorce
and matrimonial causes. This indicates that
although the English Act was remodelled and
modernized in 1937, after two royal commissions had studied and reported on the subject, divorce must stil be a live problem in
that country.
Our divorce problem today is twofold, for
in Canada divorces are granted by parliament as well as by provincial courts. I
should like to deal briefly with parliamentary
divorce, and a little more fully with divorce
generally.
A person petitioning to parliament for a
divorce is in a better position than one who
applies to a provincial court, because parliament is supreme and can grant a divorce on
any ground or on no ground at all. It is true
that parliament generally sticks pretty closely
to the divorce law of England, as it stood in
1857, and usually does not grant divorces on

any other ground than that of adultery.
Nevertheless, parliament is supreme and, as I
say, could if it wished grant a divorce on any
ground or on none at all. To anyone who
wishes verification of that I would suggest a
reference to the chapter on parliamentary
divorce procedure in Power's excellent and
authoritative work on the subject of divorce.
The chief objection to parliamentary
divorce is that it costs too much. The average cost of an undefended divorce action in
our parliament is $600 or $700. And even when
the divorce is granted, parliament has no
jurisdictidn to deal with the custody of children, or with alimony or costs. Those are
matters of civil rights and, after the petitioner
has obtained a divorce, must be settled by a
provincial court in the province of his domicile. That means further cost to the litigants.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask my honourable
friend a question? Does he mean to say that
after the Parliament of Canada bas granted
a divorce the litigants may be subjected to
further costs in provincial courts?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Yes. Let us take the
case of a petition from a woman whose husband is domiciled in Quebec. As honourable
senators know, her domicile also would be
in Quebec, for a wife's domicile is the same
as her husband's. If her petition is granted,
and she has children, she will then make an
application in Quebec, at considerable cost
to herself, for the custody of the children.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Does the same thing happen in all provinces?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No. In the provinces
where the courts have divorce jurisdiction
these matters are dealt with by the courts.
Hon. Mr. Haig: In the one application.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Yes, in the one application. For instance, yesterday I drew a
defence in a divorce action. The plaintiff
asked not only for a divorce but for custody
of the children, maintenance of the children,
alimony for herself and the costs of the
action. All those points will be decided
when the matter comes up for trial in the
provincial court. But parliament has no
jurisdiction over these things, for parliament
is a federal body and these matters are
provincial in character.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Would the honourable
gentleman analyse his computation of $600
to $700 as the cost of parliamentary divorce?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Do you wish me to
itemize it, show how it is made up?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: That is not hard. In
the first place, a petition has to be drawn,

SENATE
and the tarift of costs in the Senate allows
so much for drawing it. The petition then
has to be served on the respondent, and
sometimes it costs a good deal of money to
find that party. Then the matter has to be
advertised for four weeks in a French newspaper and an English newspaper, both in
the province, and in the Canada Gazette
as well, and the cost of that advertising
frequently runs to $125. If an Ottawa agent
is hired, his fees must be paid. But that
is not all. When the case is set down for
hearing, counsel and witnesses must attend
in Ottawa, and their expenses have to be
paid. If detectives are hired, they may
charge $100 or more.
Hon. Mr. Haig: And the government gets
about $200.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The fee on a private bill
is $210. One can readily see how the applicant's costs on a parliamentary divorce may
amount to more than $600.
I was for some time in favour of turning
over to the Exchequer Court the divorce work
now handled by parliament. In this way the
Senate committee would be relieved of the
tiresome task of hearing the evidence, and
the costs to the applicants would not be high.
I now learn that the Exchequer Court, which
is a federal court, would have no jurisdiction
in the matter of the custody of children or
of alimony, and that these questions would
still have to be settled in the province of
Quebec or Newfoundland, as the case may
be. The only benefits to be gained by using
the Exchequer Court would be to relieve parliament of the work and to reduce the costs
In my opinion this would not offer a complete
solution to the present problem. I doubt very
much if a bill to transfer the divorce work to
the Exchequer Court would pass both bouses;
I conclude, therefore that we will be saddled
with this business for some time to corne.
I should like to direct some remarks to
divorce in general. Prince Edward Island,
I find, has had divorce jurisdiction since
1835; Nova Scotia since 1866; New Brunswick since 1791; Ontario since the Divorce
Act (Ontario) was passed in 1930; and Manitoba since 1870; British Columbia since 1858,
Saskatchewan and Alberta since 1905. As yet
there is no jurisdiction in Quebec or Newfoundland.
Hon. Mr. Doone: How long has Prince
Edward Island had divorce jurisdiction?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Since 1835, but that
province never set up a court until recently.
Since 1857 the law of England, as passed in
that year, has been the law in the provinces
with the exception of, I think, Nova Scotia
which has had the right to grant divorce on
the grounds of either desertion or cruelty.

Hon. Mr. Golding: Cruelty?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It is my opinion that
our laws in this respect are very much antiquated and should be brought into line with
modern times.
I would estimate that there are in Canada
today some 20,000 cases of deserted wives
and husbands. I frequently get letters from
such people. As an example, one came to
me the other day from a man who said he
was married at twenty years of age; he and
his wife lived together for a year or so, when
she left him and went to California. He told
me that he had not seen her since; but he
knew where she was living, but had no
grounds of unfaithfulness on which to seek
a divorce. He concluded his letter somewhat
as follows: I have waited twenty years, and
now I have met a woman I want to marry.
If I can't marry her I am going to live with
her anyway, and possibly illegitimate children
will be born. I hope you will be able to do
something for me. Unfortunately, I have to
write and tell him that nothing can be done.
That is just a sample of the letters that come
not only to me but ta the other members of
the Standing Committee on Divorce.
As a result of our antiquated law there are
many illicit unions and every year many
illegitimate children are born. Husbands
and wives resort to all sorts of expedients to
get themselves separated: Perjury, collusion
and connivance are common; even murder has
been resorted to. I cite the recent case in
Quebec where an airplane was blown up so
that one man could rid himself of his wife.
If a proper divorce court had been available
to him, that tragedy might not have occurred.
Hundreds of husbands and wives go to the
United States or to Mexico to secure divorces
which, of course, are not recognized by our
law because they are secured on grounds
other than the ground recognized in Canada.
Nevertheless, they go through the form of
getting a divorce and then re-marry. One can
readily see the general mix-up that results
from such unhappy conditions.
The Senate of Canada in 1938 tried to do
something to improve conditions by the
introduction of what is known as the
McMeans Bill. This measure, which was
introduced in this house on March 8, 1938,
would have modernized our divorce laws along
the lines laid down in the English Act of
1937. I have in my hand a copy of the bill
as passed by the Senate, paragraph 3 of which
reads:
This Act shall apply to and in those provinces of
Canada wherein there are now constituted and
maintained courts of divorce and matrimonial
causes having jurisdiction to decree dissolution of
marriage, and to and in such provinces only.

NOVEMBER 20, 1951

the celebration of the marriage, been guilty of rape,
sodomy or bestiality.
(3) For the purposes of this section a person of
unsound mind shall be deemed to be under care and

(a) detained in pursuance of an order or inquisition competently made or had under authority of a
statute in force in the province concerned or as a
criminal lunatic; or
(b) receiving treatment as a voluntary patient
pursuant to any statute in force in the province
concerned, being treatment which follows without
any interval a period of such detention as aforesaid.

The bill, as passed by this house, did not
affect the provinces of Quebec and Newfoundland.
I should perhaps say right now that my
remarks have no political or religious
significance. I want it fully understood that
the views I express are entirely my own.
Hon. Mr. Petten: Would the honourable

OLD AGE SECURITY BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Robertson for the second reading of Bill 13,
an Act to provide for Old Age Security.
Hon. J. H. King: Honourable senators, I
rise, not with the hope that I can add to
what has been said in explanation of this
very important bill, but because last year,
upon invitation of the government leader
(Hon. Mr. Robertson), I served on the joint
parliamentary committee which, with great
industry, made a survey not only of old age
pensions in Canada but of the field of old
age security in various other countries of
the world, and I want to be identified with
the passage of this bill by the Senate.
In this matter we have gone a long way
since 1926. I have been given some credit
for having moved the first Old Age Pension
Bill in Canada.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
94703-9j

Hon. Mr. King: I do not deserve any credit
at all. I was at that time Acting Minister
of Labour in Mr. MacKenzie King's government, and it was at his request that I undertook to introduce a bill designed to provide,
for a certain number of our people, security
in old age. I want to make that clear,
because I acted at that time in the line of
duty, though in my personal capacity I was
very sympathetic with the purposes of the
bill.
As I have observed, in the last twenty-five
years we have moved a long way in the
direction of old age and social security for
our people. I know that the bill now before
us will have a very different reception from
that accorded to the bill of 1926. This change
of attitude reflects in the thinking of our
people in the intervening period. The joint
parliamentary committee which was appointed
last year was not restricted to the old line
parties; every party which has a voice, in
our public affairs was represented in its
membership. We of the two parties in this
chamber have our own views with regard to
many public questions. Like the honourable
senator from Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis),
who spoke in support of this measure the
other day in her usual effective way, I
approached that committee with grave doubts
as to the adoption of a universal pension
scheme. I did not realize, as did the members of the elective chamber, that in the
public mind of Canada there was a desire
and an insistency that some provision be
made to set aside a portion of Canada's great
wealth for those who had laboured and had
been in this country for some seventy years.
As I say, I approached that question with
great diffidence. I could not see why an individual at any age should be entitled to ask
the government for a monthly pension of
$40 without explaining his or her need for
that money. The Old Age Pension Act of
1927 was, of course, based on the means test.
Our committee made an exhaustive study
of the effect of old age pension legislation, and
from our inquiry-after taking into account
the amendments that had been made to the
law and the liberization that had taken
place from time to time in the thirties and
forties-we concluded that Canada had done
very well. The means test was the bugbear.
Early in the meetings of the committee I
indicated that I did not see how a contributory
pension could be paid without some test
showing the need of the individual for assistance from the government. However, as
I have said, we have advanced far in social
security thinking. I want to compliment the
minister, the Honourable Mr. Martin, and
our leader, the honourable senator to my
right (Hon. Mr. Robertson), on the admirable

SENATE
exposition which they gave to parliament of
the portent of this measure. They showed us
the niecessity of the requirements which must
be complied with in order that the individual
may qualify to receive this pension at seventy
years of age without a means test. They also
indicated that the government have arrived
at conclusions as to how the money will be
secured from the people. I emphasize that
the monley to finance this scheme will come
from the people. As was said by my honourable friend the leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson),
the cost will be d.efrayed, not in any miraculous way but by individual taxpayers. Everyone, be he small or great, must contribute
something to the universal pension provided
for by this legislation. Both the ministers concerned gave a full explanation of the need for
the pensions and the way in which they
will be paid for.
I do not intend to go into figures at all. But
I do wish to say that, having served on quite
a number of parliamentary committees, I
know of no other whose members were so
eager to serve, and serve well, as were the
members of the committee that investigated
the old age security question last year. We
had numerous sittings, and we invited
representatives of all groups and classes in
the country to appear before us and make
their views known. Anyone who wished to
express an opinion and was unable to appear
in person was invited to send in a written
statement. Representatives of labour, railways, banks, industries, social welfare organizations and so on appeared before us, and
the whole field was fully covered. Every
witness was given a very attentive hearing,
and every written statement subnitted was
carefully considered.
I do not wish to pay too high a compliment
to the senators who were members of that
joint committee, but I say to this chamber
that I do not think there was ever another
joint committee whose Senate members
attended its meetings so regularly and participated so actively in its deliberations. We
perhaps did not ask as many questions as did
our colleagues from the House of Commons,
but we listened attentively and drew our own
conclusions, which finally found expression in
the committee's unanimous report to parliament endorsing a measure such as we have
before us today.
In its deliberations the committee considered not only the effect upon the community of the Old Age Pensions Act of 1927,
which requires a means test, but also surveyed very carefully the pension fields in
New Zealand, Australia, Great Britain,
France, Norway, Switzerland and United
States, and in possibly one or two other
countries as well.

Here I wish to pay tribute to the officers
of the Department of National Health and
Welfare who, before appearing as witnesses,
had equipped themselves with information
enabling them to answer all our questions as
to the experience in every country where
pensions legislation has been in effect.
Australia and New Zealand undertook the
operation of a universal pension scheme financed by an accumulated fund. But it was
the experience of those countries, as it was
also the experience of Great Britain, the
United States and Norway, that the fund
accumulated for the payment of pensions was
not adequate to meet the need, and that
supplementary pensions based on a means
test became necessary. I think the records
will bear me out in what I have said in this
regard.
In our studies we reviewed the pension
systems of various countries which had had
experience in such matters over long periods
of time. I think Denmark had the earliest
contributory pension system. The United
States, we learned, had inaugurated a contributory pension arrangement by means of
payroll deductions. Although huge sums of
money were deducted from the incomes of
people in employment and those generally in
the payroll class, it became apparent that
there was a large group of people, such as
those engaged in farming and in certain other
classes of industry and individiual labour, to
whom the arrangement did not apply. The
inability of the government to assess this class
of people is causing concern in that country
today. While the federal government continues to pay a pension to the aged, it is not
sufficient to meet requirements, and must be
supplemented by a state pension, for which
there is a means test.
With some knowledge of social security,
and after careful study of pensions, Canada
has advanced to the stage where the government is able to place before parliament-I
think with the concurrence of all members
of the elective chamber-a clean-cut pensions
bill which from January 1 onwards, will permit the payment of $40 a month to those who
have qualified as to age and residence.
The leader of the government has said that
the pension is universal, and that every individual who earns and buys will contribute
to it. One hears some criticism about the
sales tax of 10 per cent, levied at the
source, 2 per cent of which is earmarked
to assist the financing of the pension proposal. The complaint is made that because lb
is concealed it is an unf air method of taxation.
It should be said, however, that this is a dayby-day method of collecting revenue and is
generally accepted by the public. The Government of Canada, quite properly I think,

her children during their growth and adolescence. Many thought the effect of these laws
would be to handicap industry and impair
initiative, but, far from having done so, they
have served a very useful purpose.
I turn now to the federal field. During
the thirties the Canadian Government realized that state action was required to alleviate unemployment,
and, following
an
amendment of our constitution, with the consent of the provinces, the Unemployment
Insurance Act came into force. It created a
fund in which large sums of money have been
accumulated, which have been and will continue to be useful as a cushion to soften the
consequences of unemployment.
The Act
has now been in operation for some years.
Its administration has required a very large
staff, because there are some individualsand they are not confined to the employed
class-who are ready to edge in and try to
get something for nothing. I believe that
today the honest and industrious worker is
sufficiently imbued with the importance of
this fund to assist in protecting it against
those who, by "soldiering", would try to take
advantage of it. The Act has been under
review each year. I have not heard of any
serious complaints about it by the members
in the other chamber or from those who are
closely associated with the operation of the
Act; and I believe it is fulfilling a useful
purpose.
The Family Allowances Act, which has
been in operation for some years, covers a
broad field. It is the "baby" of the federal
government, and from my inquiries I believe
that the moneys which are being expended
in ýconnection with it are being spent for
the benefit of the children.
Indeed, our
inquiry in committee brought forth evidence
that fron 80 to 90 per cent of the money was
being directly used for the benefit of our
Canadian children. I have heard little complaint as to the administration of this Actand we know that our children today are
being better clothed and better prepared in
every way to receive the education that is
available to them than was the case before
the Family Allowance Act came into effect.
These are matters that we must take into
account when considering this further enactment, which is larger and more costly than
any heretofore passed.
The Veterans' Allowance Act was passed to
take care of those veterans of the two World
Wars who did not secure a disability pension for injury or disease, but who on their
return from overseas at the age of, say, thirty
to forty, were not capable of finding employment or of doing a day's work. I am thinking
more particularly of the men in the First

World War, who served in the trenches in
the front line. This Act has served a useful
purpose, and it is to the credit of Canada,
which I believe introduced this type of pension, that similar plans have been adopted
in many other countries.
I should like to sound a word of warning
about hospital and health insurance, which
are very much in the minds of our people. I
have no objection under present conditions to
the federal treasury assisting in the building
and equipping of hospitals throughout Canada,
but I think it wise that it should not enter
into the field of national health insurance.
That should remain a provincial responsibility,
and should be dealt with close to home by the
municipalities and provincial governments.
The cost, which will be great, should be paid
out of the revenues of the provinces.
Honourable senators, I am pleased to be
here today in support of the great measure
that is before us. In the minds of some there
is doubt as to whether we should saddle this
burden upon the taxpayers of Canada, but I
believe the results will be as beneficial as
those which have followed the adoption of
other social measures in this country and
proved to be to the advantage of our whole
national set-up.
We are passing through a period of inflation, but there is nothing startling or new
about that. There has never been even a
small war without some form of inflation
following it. We must rernember that we have
had two great world wars, and when we look
back over the years I think we in Canada
are to be congratulated that inflationary
tendencies today are not worse than they are.
As was so aptly said the other day by the
honourable senator from Kennebec (Hon. Mr.
Vaillancourt), our own activities and expenditures have probably made inflation greater.
In a recent speech in the other house the
situation was tersely and well summed up in
the statement that it was not the high cost
of living that caused inflation, but the desire
to live high. We in Canada are beginning to
realize what great resources we have, and if
our people will give to industry a fair days'
work for a fair day's pay, I have little fear
that we shall absorb this pension scheme into
our economy without any serious disturbance;
in fact, I believe that it will be to the advantage of our economy as well as to those who
secure the pension right.
Honourable senators, I do not think I should
delay the house any longer. We know what
is proposed in the bill and how it is going
to be accomplisbed. I think we can proceed
with confidence because of a unanimity that

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Vien for an
address in reply thereto.
Hon. Salier A. Hayden: Honourable senators, may I first offer congratulations to the
mover (Hon. Mr. Vien) and the seconder
(Hon. Mr. Wood) of the Address in Reply
to the Speech from the Throne. My congratulations go also to those senators who have
subsequently taken part in the debate, and
whose speeches I either heard or have since
read. Although I do not agree with the
views expressed on the various issues, I note
the high quality and serious nature of the
discussion.
It is not customary for me to take part in
the debate on the Address, and I do so now
only because the Speech from the Throne
makes reference to the subject of resale price
maintenance. It contains these words:
The government has received an interim report
from the committee studying the combines legislation recommending that suppliers of goods should
be prohibited from requiring or inducing distributors to resell such goods at fixed or minimum
resale prices. You will be asked to consider legislation arising out of the committee's interim
report.

Since the Speech was read, various events
have taken place as a result of which, I
understand, a joint committee of both houses
is -now studying the question of resale price
maintenance, and as there does not appear to
be any legislation in the offing at this moment
to which one might direct particular attention, I propose to say a few words about the
interim report of the MacQuarrie committee
on the subject of resale price maintenance.
There are two grounds upon which the conmittee based its recommendation that resale
price maintenance should be prohibited, which
would mean that a manufacturer would not
be allowed to enter into an agreement with
a retail outlet fixing the minimum price at
which the retailer might sell products of that
particular manufacturer. The two grounds
are these: The desirability of a free economy,
and the need for economic efficiency. That
is rather an idealistic approach. On the basis
to which I have just referred, the committee
goes on to conclude that resale price maintenance
. . . represents a real and undesirable restriction
on competition by private agreement or "law" and
its general tendency is to discourage economic
efficiency.

Let us pause for a moment to consider the
question of a free economy. If I could feel
94703-10

that price maintenance really was an unjustifiable interference with a free economy and
if I could find anywhere in Canada at the
present time what might be regarded as an
indication of a trek backward to a free
economy, I might be prepared to examine
and consider this proposition more seriously.
But when we look around today we see that,
for one reason or a.nother, restraint has been
imposed upon this so-called free economy.
Notwithstanding that, I must say without
hesitation that we have in Canada today a
freer economy than exists anywhere else in
the world.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Notwithstanding that,
by the Agricultural Prices Support Act we
have established floor prices on a vast number of products; we are carrying out a
national policy in respect of the marketing of
wheat which has the effect of interposing a
judgment and opinion in relation to markets
and prices beyond that which the individual
producer may exercise; by the Defence Production Act a formula is spelled out as to
what shall be the recognized costs in relation
to any contract made between the Government of Canada and any manufacturer; and
a formula is also provided which would restrict
and measure the profits to which a manufacturer is entitled, notwithstanding any
agreement or contract made with a department of the government. Despite all this
protection, provision is made-and I think
wisely-whereby the government reserves
the right to scrutinize any business operation
to determine the element of profit in relation
to the cost, and to demand repayment of
part of that profit. When I review ail these
encroachments upon the political doctrine of
a free economy, I am not too much disturbed
by an argument which forms a basis for this
interim report, particularly when the standard
taken was that of a free economy, which at
the present time in Canada, to my way of
thinking, has been circumscribed-and in
many respects wisely so.
Let us deal realistically with this question.
Why is ail this consideration addressed to a
subject-matter which does not enter very
materially into the economic life of the
country-enters it, indeed, to such a limited
extent that even representatives of labour,
when expressing themselves on the proposal,
say in effect: "It is not what we want; it
will not do much, if anything, to keep
down prices, which is what we are concerned
about; but since it is something, and we are
not offered anything better, let us take it
and say we are in favour of it." That, I
believe, is virtually the attitude of a large
body of consumers and producers regarding

SENATE

a matter whose importance has been so blown
up in the Speech from the Throne that it
follows a paragraph which deals with inflation in Canada, and is the subject of numerous
editorials and speeches condemning resale
price maintenance-as though this were the
first time anyone had heard of it-and
congratulaling the government upon the
effects which would follow a prohibition, of
this practice.
I say first of all that a continuance or
discontinuance of resale price maintenance
would have, for ill or good, little if any
relation to our present economy; that it does
not affect a sufficient segment of the population to have much significance, and that it
has been given an importance out of all
relation to reality.
Let us examine the first conclusion that
this committee makes in its report. It says
that price fixing restricts competition in
price at the retail level. Well now, resale
price maintenance simply amounts to this.
A manufacturer makes an agreement with
a group of retailers whereby he fixes a price
at which he will sell an article to them,
with certain marketing and servicing conditions, and the retailers on their part agree
that they will resell at that price, and no
other; and there are stipulations as to what
will happen to the retailers if they step out
of line by failing to observe this price
restriction.
I could understand the point of criticising
that policy were a manufacturer the sole
producer of a particular article and that
article loomed so large in the economic life
of the country that the people as a whole
had to buy it. But usually articles subject
to resale price maintenance provisions are
branded articles, or carry a trade name, or
are patented products. The manufacturer,
being concerned about his investment in that
trade name, or trade mark, or patent, and
with a view of maintaining the quality of his
product, makes his agreement in the light of
his marketing set-up and his knowledge,
within reasonable limits, of what that system
can produce. Let me ask: Even though in
a given situation there were only one
product available, and the public had to
have it, how long would it be before imitators
entered the field and produced a similar
article at a lower price? To say that fixing
prices shuts out competition at the retail level
sounds fine in theory, but does not bear the
test of practice.
In the first place, very few products are
made by only one manufacturer; as a rule a
number of manufacturers are making similar
articles at the same time. Take, for instance,
radios. Supposing a radio manufacturer

comes out with a mantel model and puts on
it a price of $29.75. Immediately other radio
manufacturers having a comparable article
within this price range scurry around as
quickly as they can, to design and put into
production a model which will share the
market for that particular price range, even
though the retailer handling the particular
model is governed by a resale price agreement
which fixes his selling price. In those circumstances competition exists, both at the
manufacturing and the retail price level, as
between various articles belonging to the
same ýclass. The same principle applies to
fountain pens and watches and any other
articles subject to price fixing vertically or
at the retail level.
One might think that this practice was
comparatively new. As a matter of fact it
has been going on for generations, not only in
Canada but in the United States and Great
Britain. The British courts have held that
it is perfectly proper for a manufacturer who
is proposing to market a preparation or
product of his own to make an agreement
with the individual retailer under which he
fixes the price and the basis on which the
product is to be re-sold. In the United States,
decisions of the highest court have led to the
same result, and statute law in that -country
legalizes resale price maintenance as between
manufacturer and retailer. Under these circumstances, why should it be regarded as a
new and horrible growth which is wrecking
the economy of the country? It is merely a
practice which has gone on for a long time;
but because, during the investigation of some
alleged combine in Canada, it was discovered
that that combine was not only horizontal as
between manufacturers, but also vertical as
between all the manufacturers and the
retailer, we are bidden by this interim
report to prohibit resale price maintenance or
the fixing of retail prices.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask a question at
this point? Apart from articles which are
manufactured in Canada, what about those
which are imported from across the line and
sold at a fixed price 100 per cent higher than
in the United States?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I expected my honourable
friend would raise that question, because be
mentioned it in his speech at an earlier date.
First of all, if an article imported from the
United States is sold in Canada at a pricewhatever that price may be-at which it
cannot maintain its position in the market,
it will not remain on the market very long.
Secondly, 'when articles are imported from
the United States, usually a rate of duty is
imposed, and a tax under the Excise Act as

NOVEMBER 21, 1951
well as under the Excise Tax Act, so all these
costs are added before it gets into the
Canadian market. Also, if the price at which
it is being shipped into Canada is lower than
the list price at which the same type of article
is sold under the same circumstances in the
United States, a special or dumping duty is
applied to increase the price to a relatively
competitive figure in Canada.
I suppose what my honourable friend is
thinking about is that some articles in the
United States that are covered by patents or
are sold under brand names, and that similar
articles in respect of which there are Canadian patents, are manufactured and sold in
Canada, and that the price of the patented
article in the United States is lower than it is
in this country. The answer is that so long
as Canadian patent laws exist in their present form, and a man who possesses some
ingenuity is able to devise something for
which he is entitled to a patent, and the Canadian public want that particular article, the
manufacturer is entitled to charge first,
within certain limits, what the public will
pay. If his price is too high they will not buy
the article. In any event, if there is a public
demand, a good market, and the price is high
and there is a large measure of profit, there
will be imitators entering the market.
The basic point raised by my honourable
friend does not go to the question of fixing a
retail price, but to the reasonableness of
such a price. These are two separate and
distinct questions. It does not necessarily
follow that because I fix a retail price at which
my product must be sold, that price is an
unreasonable one. If parliament thinks that
Canada should set up some sort of body to
determine what the mark-up should be, my
only reply would be to refer to the recommendation contained in this report against
taking any such action. Certainly it would
bring about a greater interference with the
economy of the country.
Honourable senators, I come back to the
point I was making before the honourable
gentleman from New Westminster asked his
question. It is concluded in the interim report
that resale price maintenance should be prohibited because it gives manufacturers bad
ideas. It is found that when a new manufacturer is able to make an agreement at a
fixed price with each retail outlet he has
for the sale of his product, it gives him bad
ideas, and he says to himself: This works out
Why shouldn't I get
wonderfully well.
together with the other manufacturers and
have a horizontal combination as well as a
vertical one?" I would point out, however,
that the Combines Investigation Act prohibits
94703-101

horizontal combination in Canada, and if persons are found indulging in that sort of thing
they can be prosecuted-and many of them
have been. If it is felt that there are insufficient prosecutions, we should step them up.
If, on the other hand, it is felt that the
penalties are not sufficiently great, we should
increase them. I have never heard a sound
argument based on the doctrine that I must
prohibit the use of something because it is
likely to be abused. I have always operated
on the principle that if the use of a thing
is sound it should not be prohibited because
it is capable of being abused.
The interim report admits the argument that
resale price maintenance is helpful to the
small retailer, but it states that this help has
been over-emphasized. I am not satisfied that
prohibiting resale price maintenance will not
hurt the small retailer, and I contend that
the small retailer is a necessary and essential
cog in the economic life of our country. The
small retailer goes into business in a community without seeking assistance from anyone. He must do his own buying, and do it
right; he must exercise good judgment on the
credit he gives, on what the market will
take, and on whether he will be able to
dispose of the goods he buys from the manufacturers. I say that the independent and
sturdy character of the small Canadian retailer
is something which we should not damage.
We should, in fact, encourage it. In saying
this I am not critical of the volume basis
of doing business on the retail level as conducted by our Canadian department stores;
but if a situation were created in which there
was volume buying with no retail price agreements in effect, volume buying could overpower the small retailer. I am convinced of
this, and I am satisfied that it would be a
natural and inevitable result. The larger
purchasing power and the larger concentrated
distribution enjoyed by the department stores
would mean that the small retailer would
at times find himself without a market unless
he was prepared to sell his goods at a much
lower price.
Honourable senators, you have all heard
about the price war last summer in New York
City. As an aftermath of that affair the
manufacturers of the Sunbeam Mixmasters
have instituted an action against Macy's in
New York. This is what happened. Macy's
enjoyed a 3-3 per cent of the sales in the
New York area of the Sunbeam Mixmasters.
When the price-cutting war started, Macy's
sold these Mixmasters for $3 apiece below the
wholesale price, and as a result did 56-2 per
cent of the volume of this business in the
New York area. Do honourable senators
know of any more vivid illustration of what
can happen when concentrated economie

SENATE
power can be wielded at any particular time
in relation to any particular commodity
against the small retailer, who cannot meet
that kind of competition?

Hon. Mr. MacLennan: What about those
who bought the Sunbeam Mixmasters?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The honourable senator
from Margaree Forks has raised the question
of the consumer. The difficulty is that each
individual is

what I

may call a multiple

economic personality. He is a producer, a
taxpayer and a consumer, the position he
is going to take depends upon which pair
of glasses he has on at the moment. When
certain groups of people in Canada are exercising a pressure and agitating for higher
prices, and prices are raised by putting a
floor price under agricultural products, for
instance, those people who are agitating are
thinking of their position as producers. Then
other people come along and, in their capacity
as consumers, clamour for price ceilings. Take
the producer of one particular article. He
will tell you that the policy of price raising
is generally bad, but that in relation to his
particular product it is a different matter.

Some Hon. Sena±ors: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: He names all the good
and justifiable reasons in the world w7hy his
price should bo raised. He claims his labour
costs are higher, that his raw materials are
more expensive and that his rent is greater. If

we could ever get ourselves into a position

where we could recognize that multiple
economic personality we might be able to
merge some of the conflicting interests which
exist, and thus move more quickly along the
road to solving some of our problems economically rather than having to deal with them
on a political-economical basis.

Getting along with this report, may I deal

with the second standard by which the com-

mittee studied the question of resale price
maintenance, namely, that it has a general
tendency to discourage economic efficiency. I
am certainly not prepared at this time to
subscribe to any such conclusion. I think that
you discourage economic efficiency only when
you tax to the point of no return.
I am satisfied that the manufacturer is
attempting to produce his goods as cheaply
as be can, and at a price that will enable
him to dispose of the largest possible quantity.
And I believe that the retailer tries, as a
matter of good business principle, to buy
quality goods as cheaply as possible and to
keep his costs down. His aim is to operate
economically and make a reasonable return;
and since during the year there is a much
less frequent turnover of some goods than
of others, it is only natural that on these

his percentage of profit bas to be proportionately higher. Also, of course, his profit on
some lines has to be large enough to take
care of possible losses on others. In general,
I am satisfied that manufacturers and retailers
in Canada today are endeavouring to carry on
with the utmost economic efficiency, in the
face of the difficult conditions that exist in
this country and throughout the world.
In my opinion resale price maintenance
does not lead to economic inefficiency. I
believe, on the contrary, that it leads to a
more orderly marketing at present and to a
more orderly planning for future marketing,
through advertising of branded products, than
would be possible if wholesalers and retailers
were subjected to the whims and fancies of
merchants who might care to indulge in price
cutting.
The MacQuarrie Committee condemned the
"loss leader" device. This refers to the practice of some merchants of offering certain
commodities below bare cost, on the gamble
that the people who may be thereby attracted
to their stores will purchase other goods on
which the profit will be sufficiently high to
provide an over-all profit on the day's business. It was this practice which resulted in
the price cutting on Mixmasters and other
articles by some New York stores not long
ago. Well, of course, we all know that no one
can stay in business very long and continue
to sell goods below their wholesale cost. But
even though the "oss leder" device is condemned in the report-it is described there
as a monopolistic practice and not compatible with the public interest-no recommendation is made for dealing with it. The
comnmittee say this:
However, we do net believe that it presents any
ininediate danger; e trene forrms of price-cutting
are not very likely in this period cf inflation and
relative scarcity.

Does that not seem to answer the committee's first recommendation, that resale price

maintenance be prohibited? The committee
say, in effect, that even if there were no
resale price maintenance policy today there
still would be no general use of "loss leaders",
because we are in a period of inflation and
relative scarcity, when prices are tending
upward.
It might be asked why there is all this
hurry to readjust the free economy of Canada
by prohibiting resale price maintenance at
this time when, as we are told, the tendency
of prices is to move up-and they certainly
cannot move down so long as there is relative scarcity of goods. My submission is that
we are attempting at this time to take a potshot at something that sounds awfully good

in theory, and that can be flailed publicly and
in general terms. The individual consumer

NOVEMBER 21, 1951
may be pleased to hear that the horrible
and terrible manufacturers are not going to
be allowed to get away with this nefarious
practice any longer, that prices are going to
be governed by the free flow of trade, by
the law of supply and demand. In the
present economic situation a statement of
that kind is a fairy tale, and the only comparable thing that w'ould be more interesting
to read would be the story of "Alice in
Wonderland".
I have too much confidence in the judgment and the intelligence of the people of
Canada and of their representatives in parliament to fear that they will be unduly
influenced by anything like that. Sooner
or later people brush the froth off of things

that look attractive on the surface, and see
the substance below. I am convinced that,
in this instance, when they see the substance they will wonder why we should be
wasting so much time and energy in delivering so terriffic a blow against such a small
thing, while there are so many other matters towards which our efforts might be more
usefully directed in the fight against inflation.

CANADIAN BROADCASTING
CORPORATION
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. Reid inquired of the government:
1. Has the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation
carried out the recommendations of the Royal
Commission as contained in their report to parliament, and as outlined under sections M-N and O
in page 297 of the report?
2. If so. which of these recommendations has
been carried out or put into effect?

Hon. Mr. Robertson:

The answer

is as

follows:
1 and 2. These recommendations are
receiving careful consideration.
Hon. Mr. Reid: A copy of this answer
was handed to me a short time ago. The
question contained in this inquiry calls for
a direct answer, yes or no. Instead of that,
we have the C.B.C. ducking the question by
saying that the matter is being considered.
The Hon. the Speaker: I would draw attention to the fact that this is not the time to ask
for a further explanation of an answer.
Hon. Mr. Reid: When is the proper time
under the rules?
The Hon. the Speaker: The honourable
senator can put a new question, in a different
form, or repeat the same question.

Hon. Mr. Reid: I do not know how I can
put a new question so as to get an answer
of yes or no.
Some Hon. Senalors: Order!
UNSATISFACTORY

ANSWER

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. Reid: I wish to draw the attention of the honourable leader (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) to the fact that I am not satisfied
with the answer given to my question.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I have no immediate personal knowledge of
the question. I shall look into the matter, and
if there is any suggestion I can make about it
I shall be glad to do so.
CANADIAN FORCES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishar McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill 21, an Act respecting
the Canadian Forces.

He said: Honourable senators will recall that
the National Defence Act was enacted at the
first session of parliament in 1950. That Act
contained a comprehensive revision of all
legislation related to defence, and also incorporated into one measure a single disciplinary
code for the navy, the army and the air force.
Subsequently the various sections of that Act
were brought into force by proclamation, and
the regulations of the three services were
brought into effect on September 1, 1951. Thus
all the defence legislation that was planned
four years ago has now been put into effect.
A number of amendments remain to be
made to other statutes to bring them into
line with the National Defence Act. For
example, a definition of the word "military"
was given in the National Defence Act, and
it is now considered desirable that the same
definition be used in all other legislation.
There are twenty-nine sections in the bill
before us, and of these some eighteen involve
purely textual changes. The remaining eleven
sections have to do with amendments of a
textual nature, but are also of some substance.
I will refer to each of these sections which
makes specific amendments, and briefly indicate the nature of these amendments.
Section 5, subsection 2, would enable persons who during the second world war served
overseas with the Royal Canadian Navy other
than at sea to count such service for the
purposes of the Civil Service Superannuation
Act. It would thus give personnel who saw
such service with the navy the same right as
has been given to personnel who served in
the army or in th- air force.
Section 6 would enable the Governor in
Council to provide that persons who have
accumulated pensionable service under the
Defence Services Pension Act may count that
service under the Civil Service Superannuation Act when they retire from the forces to
accept civil service appointments in the
Department of National Defence. A man who
retires from the services to take a civil service
position with the department may count his
period of service for pension purposes.
Section 8, subsection 2, would protect the
pension rights of men appointed to short
service commissions. This is now covered
by Order in Council P.C. 2932, dated June 7,
1951. It is estimated that this would relate
to three men in the navy, 171 in the army
and 201 in the air force, a total of 375. It is
only just that men who accept commissions
on a short term basis and are promoted from
the ranks should not lose their pensionable
rights.
Section 8, subsection 6, will enable the
Governor in Council to grant a pension to a
contributor who has been a member of the
military services for twenty years, who served

NOVEMBER 22, 1951
on active service during the second world
war and subsequently in the regular forces,
but who, at the date of his retirement, has
served for less than ten years in the regular
forces. In other words, from the point of
view of qualification for pension, service with
the active forces during -the war would be
taken together with service with the regular
forces since the war in order to make up
the minimum period of ten years. It is
estimated that 334 officers and men would be
covered by this at the present time, but that
number will be progressively reduced as
these men complete ten years' service.
Section 14, subsection 2, would change the
word "military" to "army" and would also
delete reference to Newfoundland and the
Irish Free State in a section of the Visiting
Forces (British Commonwealth) Aot. The
Irish Free State, formerly designated as the
Republic of Ireland, ceased to be a member
of the commonwealth in April, 1949, and
Newfoundland became incorporated with
Canada by the Act of that year approving
the terms of union. Similarly, subsections 4
and 5 of section 14 would delete reference
to Newfoundland and the Irish Free State.
Section 17, subsection 2, would amend the
Department of Veterans Affairs Act in order
to continue the authority of that department
to administer the service estate of former
members of the forces who die while in
D.V.A. hospitals. That was provided for in
the previous national defence legislation, but
it was not carried ýinto the National Defence
Act.
Section 22, subsection 2, would provide for
the attendance of civilian witnesses before
United States courts martial held in Canada.
That is a privilege which we enjoy now
with the United States, and we want to put
it on a reciprocal basis. Even in these cases
the attendance of witnesses would require an
order issued by a Canadian civilian magistrate.
Section 25 provides for the appointment by
the Governor in Council of an officer as
chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee.
This is now provided for by Order in Council. It also gives the Governor in Council
authority to make provision for compensation
to civilians employed in the public service
of Canada, or doing research or consultative
work in relation to the Canadian forces and
the Defence Research Board, when disability
or death results from their connection
with this service. In applying this section it is expected that the Governor in
Council will order that the Pension Act be
made applicable in these cases. Cases might
occur of a civilian worker engaged on research in connection with a dangerous

weapon being killed or injured along with
service personnel. At the present time a
pension would be paid to the member of the
service, but not to the civilian. We think it is
only just that the same provision snould
extend to the civilian.
Section 26 relates to offences committed or
not disposed of prior to the coming into force
of the disciplinary parts of the National
Defence Act on September 1, 1951. This
point is now covered by Order in Council,
P.C. 3417, dated July 4, 1951.
Section 28 would extend the operation of
section 4 of the Official Secrets Act to persons
who, by reason of service with but not in the
forces, may have obtained information that
should not be disclosed.
These changes, honourable senators, are,
as I pointed out before, almost entirely of a
technical nature or consequential upon the
enactment of the National Defence Act and
our experience of its operation during the
past year.
I am sure that some honourable senators
wish to raise certain questions as to this
measure. I would therefore suggest that,
when the house sees fit to give it second reading, it be referred to the appropriate standing
committee, where officials in possession of the
detailed information will be present to answer
questions.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,
my suggestion is that the bill be given second
reading today and be referred to the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce. In
that way the officials present at the committee
meeting could answer our questions; and if
some senators were still not entirely satisfied,
the measure could be debated in the house on
third reading. For my part, I do not feel
competent to judge the contents of this measure without some further information as to
how it will work out. I would appreciate it
being sent to the committee at as early a date
as possible.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I move that this bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
VISITING FORCES (NORTH ATLANTIC
TREATY) BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill 22, an Act to implement the agreement between the parties to the

SENATE
North Atlantic Treaty regarding the status
of their forces, signed on the nineteenth day
of June, 1951.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill, like
the one to which the house bas just given
second reading, has to do with our military
forces. It is distinguished from the other bill
in that it relates to the discharge of our commitments under the North Atlantic Treaty,
and it embraces certain provisions which are
perhaps new to this house. But as there is
some relationship between the two bills, I am
sure that many honourable senators would
like to have the two measures considered in
committee at the same time. Therefore, when
the house sees fit to give this bill second reading, I shall move that it be referred to the
Standing
Committee on Banking and
Commerce.
The purpose of this bill, honourable senators, is to implement the provisions of the
agreement entered into at London by the
twelve North Atlantic Treaty Organization
states on June 19, 1951. On that date the
agreement was tabled in both houses of
parliament, and, is itself a schedule to the
bill which is before us.
It is clear at once that without such
legislation as this the Canadian forces and
those of other North Atlantic Treaty countries, when present in the territory of one
another, would have the status of ordinary
tourists. That would affect their position
with regard to passports, immigration, health
services, taxation, customs and civil and criminal jurisdiction. In the past, we have had
the Visiting Forces (British Commonwealth)
Act, 1933, to take care of visiting forces from
commonwealth countries. Each of the commonwealth countries adopted similar legislation to give Canadian forces reciprocal rights
and immunities. We also adopted the Visiting Forces (United States of America) Act
in 1947, which dealt with United States forces
which happened to be in Canada. Canadian
forces having exactly the same rights in the
United States. The bill which is now before
us follows along the lines of this legislation.
It will approve the agreement and give effect
to its provisions. I might point out in passing that enactment of this legislation will be
very much to Canada's advantage, since, as
matters stand, it is practically certain that
Canadian troops abroad in other countries
will far outnumber foreign troops in Canada.
The bill defines the legal status of the
visiting forces present in Canada with the
consent of and under agreement with the
Government of Canada. It contains provisions respecting jurisdiction for members
of a visiting force, exemption from taxation,
settlement of claims, and possession and carriage of arms. In accordance with the terms

of the agreement, provision has been made
to ensure the security and protection of the
installations, equipment and records of a
visiting force. The bill covers only those
matters which require legislation to enable
Canada to carry out its undertakings under
the agreement. There are some matters contained in the agreement which do not require
legislation; for example, immigration and
local procurement of supplies.
The bill provides for its application to
signatory states as the need arises, and it
may be applied in whole or in part, depending upon the circumstances. It will also be
possible to apply the measure to visiting
forces of commonwealth countries, other
than the United Kingdom, who are not, of
course, signatories to the agreement. The
commonwealth agreement, as honourable
senators know, is as yet restricted as far as
the commonwealth is concerned to the United
Kingdom and Canada.
It is not proposed at this time to repeal
either the Visiting Forces (British Commonwealth) Act, 1933, or the Visiting Forces
(United States of America) Act; but to avoid
the uncertainty which would arise from
having those Acts and this legislation in
effect at the same time, it will be possible
to make parallel provisions of the visiting
forces Acts inapplicable from time to time
and for such length of time as may be
necessary.
Finally, hpnourable senators, the bill
includes explicit parliamentary approval of
the agreement, which, as I have said, is to be
found in the schedule of the bill. I would
repeat that Canada will find itself playing
the role of a sending, rather than a receiving,
state, and I point out that from a purely
selfish point of view we stand to gain more
from the adoption of this legislation than
the other countries concerned.
This legislation is one of the steps designed
to carry out our undertakings under the
North Atlantic Treaty. It will contribute
materially to building up that degree of
co-operation, understanding and partnership
which is essential if our North Atlantic community is going to fulfill its great obligation
of protecting our western traditions and way
of life.
Hon. John T. Haig: I do not intend to
say very much about this bill. The measure
which has just been passed related only to
our own troops. The bill now before us
involves a consideration which I think is
more important than would occur to one upon
a superficial reading. Many Canadians were
very much concerned over reports about
some happenings in Korea, which indicated
-and I say this in no spirit of criticism-

NOVEMBER 22, 1951
that our men had not been fully informed of
their importance, not merely as fighters but
as representatives or ambassadors of Canada.
I do not blame anyone for not having
explained this to them, because-to speak
candidly-I never thought about it. The
Canadian forces sent to Europe have received
a pamphlet issued by the Department of
National Defence. It is not very long-if it
were, I do not think they would read itbut I give the department full credit for
so concise and well-prepared an explanation
of their duties and obligations as Canadians
to all the countries, excepting the United
States, to which under this North Atlantic
Treaty they may be assigned.
I think this bill should be very carefully
considered in committee. As I have said
our Canadians who go overseas under the
Atlantic Charter should be enabled to realize that they are ambassadors of Canada.
They may never fight; our hope is that they
will never have to, that they will function
only as a demonstration of force over the
next three or four years, and we hope that
by that time the peoples behind the Iron
Curtain may have realized the importance
of peace and our desire for a peaceful solution of present problems. It is of the greatest
importance that we examine very carefully
the provisions of this bill to ensure our men
of all proper protection while overseas. I
believe that all possible safeguards will be
provided; it is our duty to see that they are.
Another consideration arises from the fact
that we live alongside the United States. It
is difficult for a small nation to restrain
feelings of resentment from time to time
when citizens of a bigger nation temporarily
in their midst seem forgetful of the fact that
they are visitors, and not in their own household. What I say applies to Canada as well
as to any other country. The people of a
large country upon entering a small one
sometimes do not appreciate the difficulties
faced by the smal country. According to
press reports a difficult situation was
threatening during the last war when
American troops were stationed in Newfoundland, and I should like to see our people
protected against anything that might cause
ill feeling between ourselves and the
Americans. We may talk about the Atlantic
Charter and so on, but we must remember
that because of its present status Canada
owes much to the world. I say advisedly that
we are the only people the United States will
listen to and believe that they are being told
the truth. That involves a tremendous
responsibility.
It used to be commonly said that we acted
as interpreters between the United States
and Great Britain. Well, we have far greater

responsibilities now. Things have gone far
beyond that. As you read the British and
continental papers you detect a certain feeling
in those countries against the United States.
I do not think for one moment that this
feeling is at all justified, but I do say that
when we think the Americans may do something that might disturb the people of Europe
it is our duty, as one good friend to another,
to call their attention to it. What little
experience I have had with the United States
has taught me that Americans are a freedomloving people who love their homeland as
much as we love ours; and they are just as
determined as we are that the rest of the
world shall have the same opportunities that
we have had. I think I speak for every
member of this house when I say that in
drafting legislation of this kind we must be
careful not to give cause for any difficulties
between ourselves and the United States.
There is no doubt, if conditions in Europe
become more critical, that large land and air
forces from the United States will be
stationed in Canada. If we get into war with
Russia, there is no question that the Russians
will come down from Alaska into our country.
The United States knows this as well or
better than we do. Therefore, as I say, large
American forces undoubtedly would be
stationed in this country. It is wise, therefore, to enact this legislation now, rather
than to wait until it may be difficult to do so.
Honourable senators, I have read this bill
carefully. Its provisions seem satisfactory
to me, but I think we ought to discuss every
section carefully in order to get the opinions
of all honourable senators on this legislation.
I may be criticized for saying so, but I think
that when the members of the other place
review legislation they look through political
glasses. I do not thihk we do that here. I
am delighted that the honourable leader
intends to refer this bill to committee, where
I hope it will receive careful study at the
earliest possible moment.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I should like to ask
the honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson)
for some information about the character of
this bill. As I understand it, this legislation
deals with immunities of our men when they
are stationed in countries abroad, particularly in Western Europe. I assume that
reciprocal legislation will be passed by other
signatory countries to the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization. If I followed our
leader correctly, I believe he said that the
countries of the commonwealth, including
Australia, New Zealand and ourselves, already
have signed conventions to this effect. I
would be interested in knowing if the countries in Europe-particularly France and

SENATE

Western Germany, where most of our armed
forces will be stationed-will adopt reciprocal
legislation, and if so, in what way it will be
adopted. The United States is a signatory
to the NATO, and they have provided reciprocal legislation of this kind.
In this connection I should like to refer to
the point raised by the honourable leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig), who expressed, as I
thought, some apprehension about the possibilities of contact between the United States
and Canada in relation to armed forces, in
the event of exchange of troops.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I did not say that.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I do not share that
apprehension in the slightest degree. I should
hate to think that any such impression
would leave this chamber; that after the
experience we had in the recent war we
have anything to fear from the United States.
The American forces stationed in Canada
during that time co-operated in every way
with our government. In view of what the
world owes the United States, and particularly in the light of what that country has
done to help Western Europe rehabilitate
itself, I think it would be most unfortunate
if any suggestion of apprehension concerning
our contact with the United States should
rise from this discussion. I do not think
any two countries in the world understand
each other better and are less likely to
encounter difficulties with each other than
Canada and the United States.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I never suggested that at
all. I said that we should adopt this legislation now so that we would not be faced with

difficulties should we try to enact similar
legislation at a later date. My point is that if
we do not have this legislation and the
Russians drive down through Alaska, we
might run into difficulty if at that time we
tried to improvise agreements with the
United States. Perhaps I did not express myself clearly. What I endeavoured to show was
that it would be better to adopt this legislation now.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Honourable senators, I
think that now is the proper time to direct
a question to the honourable leader of the
government (Honorable Mr. Robertson). We
read in the press that at the reception of the
Canadian Forces in Rotterdam the Canadian
Minister of National Defence made a statement to the effect that Canada was building
aerodromes in Western Europe, at a cost of
$100 million. A question was asked about this
in another branch of parliament yesterday,
and the Prime Minister replied that he did

not know anything about it. Has the leader
of the government here any information to
give in addition to the reply made by the
Prime Minister?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: No.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I move that this bill be referred to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
SPEECH FROM

THE THRONE

ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Vien for an
Address in reply thereto.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Honourable senators, the
order for resuming this debate stands in my
name, but I defer to my honourable friend
from Southern New Brunswick (Hon. Mr.
McLean).
Hon. A. Neil McLean: Honourable senators,
I should like first to congratulate the mover
and seconder of the Address, the honourable
senator from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien)
and the honourable senator from Regina (Hon.
Mr. Wood), who carried out their duties in
an excellent manner. I would also congratulate the senators on both sides of this
house who have contributed to the debate.
Their speeches have been informative and
on a high level.
At this time I wish to make a few remarks
on current problems which are before this
honourable house and the people of Canada.
We hear a great deal today about the high
cost of living, which is to a major extent an
international problem. Great pressure has
been put on the government to use its best
endeavours to curb the inflationary spiral.
Canada has an annual output from land, sea
and forest, and we call this the nation's
stockpile. The farmer adds his produce to
this stockpile and takes away from it the
things he needs. The same is true of the
fishermen, lumbermen, miners, etc., for
few of us indeed can go very far in serving
ourselves: we depend on others, and so have
to trade with one another and exchange
goods and services. The trouble today is
that the demand on the nation's stockpile is
out of proportion with the quantity of goods
delivered to the stockpile. Through our legislation we give many orders on the nation's

NOVEMBER 22, 1951
surplus without a corresponding return to
our stockpile. Our wealth, of course, is in
goods and services, money being the measuring stick. When there is not enough to go
around, inflation is stimulated. It would seem
that the government's job is to try to arrange
a fair distribution where goods are most
needed and at as moderate a price as possible.
And I think it is trying to do that.
Of course there is a cure for inflation, but
few would want to take the cure. We would
rather go on as we are. We have planned
our path in the democratic way. For instance,
if it was announced tomorrow morning that
the defence program would be cut in half,
I think everyone would see a very substantial drop in prices. The curtailment of the
defence program would mean that demand
for commodities would shrink, and many
thousands now engaged in defence industries
would go back 'to productive work that
would add to the nation's surplus As it is
we have voted millions, yes billions, for
defence of this country and our way of life,
and have diverted a great deal of our energy
and labour toward defence production, which
means preparing goods for enemy territory,
to take care of aggressors. 'None of these
goods go into the nation's stockpile of food,
clothing and shelter, but many thousands
who labour in connection with defence must
draw their daily needs from the nation's
stockpile. We have willed it that way, and
rightly so.
During the hungry 30's we had deflation
instead of inflation, and at that time goods
were mighty cheap. In fact, it was so hard
to find a market for goods that we were
plowing them under. I am sure no one would
want another depression as a cure for
inflation.
The defence bill must be paidý and sacrifices have to be made on the part of every
citizen. Taxation is bound to be heavy, and
the government, it seems to me, is endeavouring to spread the taxation burden in a fair
manner, giving careful consideration to the
taxpayers' ability to pay. As a general rule
we all are going to have smaller net earnings-taxation will see to that. Our corporations should expect smaller net earnings.
However, when some of our utilities and
transport companies look at their balance
sheets and find their net earnings not quite
as good as heretofore-which should be
expected-they seem to think they should
rush to the government or to government
bodies to have higher rates O.K.'dý so that
their balance sheets may return to what they
think is normal. I feel that public bodies
should be careful indeed in raising rates,
for the man on the street and the general

public are carrying a heavy burden of taxation now, and are in no position to share
burdens that may not be their due, burdens
that arise because some people may seem to
be unwilling to make as great a sacrifice as
-they should for the defence program.
Some cry out for all-out controls; but controis by themselves would not add a pound of
butter or a pound of steel to the nation's
stockpile. In fact, thousands of additional
people would have to be taken out of production to operate controls, and these thousands would again have to draw their food,
clothing, and so on from the nation's stockpile. In wartime people expect controls and
expect to be regulated, but they do not expect
to be subjected to nearly so much in peacetime. During the last war I helped administer controls, and we had 95 per cent of
public opinion with us; but even at that
we had a lot of policing to do. If all-out
controls were to be inaugurated now, it is
doubtful whether they would have 50 per
cent of public opinion behind them. In consequence, administration of controls would
be very difficult, for the policing would be
far greater than in wartime. Therefore I
think the government is pursuing the right
course in exploring for and trying out other
methods to curb undue inflation.
Some things that we at times encourage
are bound to have a serious effect on the
nation's stockpile. At present we are going
through quite a serious crisis, and it scems
to me that this is not the time to be continually cutting down our work hours. Our
enemies, we must remember, are working far
into the night, so a five-day week for us at
this time does not seem to be in order; that
is, it does not seem to be in order if we really
desire to curb living costs and combat
inflation.
I notice that our banks, for whom I have
a great deal of respect, have joined those
who favour the five-day week. My mind
goes back to thirty-five or forty years ago,
when I was a young bank manager. At that
time we managers were strong on giving
advice on the virtues of thrift and hard work.
Before we granted loans we made inquiries
to find out whether our prospective customers were thrifty, and good workers.
Farmers, fishermen and lumber operators
used to come to us for a few hundred dollars,
or a thousand or two thousand dollars, to
help them over a season until they could get
their produce, lumber, fish or livestock,
marketed. We often used to drive through
the country to check up on our customers, to
see that they were working steadily and
practicing economy in their operations.
Coming to town on Saturdays and spending

SENATE

one's time in idIleness did not add to one's
credit with the banks in those days. There
was no use asking Dun and Bradstreet for
the credit rating of a primary producer, for
they did not know it. On the other hand,
our customers did not have government
bonds-perhaps we were not far enough in
debt in those days-to put up as collateral
for loans. We had to depend for collateral
on the borrower's ability to work hard.
It seems to me that thrift and hard work
are now becoming old fashioned. Today
when a person wants a loan he puts up his
government bonds or some other marketable
security as collateral, and that is about all
there is to it. We must remember, however,
that along the line someone has to do some
real hard work to pay the interest on those
bonds. The time has come when those of
us who want to work six days a week find
difficulty in doing so, for we are all dependent on the other fellow's services. To cal]
an office, wholesale bouse or other place of
business on Saturday and find it closed,
hampers those of us who want to carry on
through a six-day week. A five-day week
would be ruinous to many seasonal industries
in which there is only a certain amount of
time to gather in the crop. Often it is a race
against time, and in general if we do not
work all hours at certain seasons of the year
when the harvest from land and sea is ripe,
the nation's stockpile is bound to suffer, and
this in turn stimulates inflation. Labour in
many of our seasonal industries does not, on
the average, work long hours, January to
December. The tendency of so many to
climb on the bandwagon for a five-day week,
regardless of our seasonal indus t ries and
of those who want to work on Saturdays,
is certainly not good for the country as a
whole. The timing is bad, and it is useless
to cry out against inflation when some are
deliberately doing the things that cause it.
In these times of crisis and emergency
we should pause, and proceed carefully in
matters of this kind. In this year, for
instance, had not long hours been worked
by those who gathered the tomato crop of
Ontario, who harvested the wheat crop of the
West and who packed fish on the Atlantic
coast, the country would have suffered a
greater loss, which would have been
reflected in our national stockpile.
Another movement in this country which,
in my opinion, is harmful to our economy and
has unnecessarily added to living costs is the
policy of increasing interest rates. There
are many more borrowers than there are
lenders, and any increase in the cost of
money simply means that business and the
public generally will have to pay more. Take
rentals, for instance. If mortgage money is

priced higher, tenants will be asked to pay
higher rents; and as food, clothing and shelter
are the three major items, the cost of living
will be proportionately greater by reason of
an increase in rents. Money, along with the
wheel and the ship, is part of our system of
distribution, and any increase in interest
rates or freight rates in connection with
these utilities is bound, as I have stated, to
have its effect on prices.
When there is too much money in circulation as compared with the quantity of
civilian goods on the market, the effect is,
of course, inflationary. There are two ways
of withdrawing surplus moneys: by taxation
and by inducing the people to save. When
people save they withhold their purchasing
power from the market for future use. The
banks, of course, pay a l'ow rate on savings,
but there one's money is always available.
Many people in times past have been induced
to invest their money in government bonds,
so that there would not be such a big demand
for civilian go-ods. However, by depressing
the price of bonds in existence by means
of raising current interest rates, the confidence of investors is shaken, and people are
discouraged from putting their savings into
the best investment in the world, Canadian
Government bonds. It is against human
nature to buy anything when it is going
down in price or "on the skids."
I repeat, there are many more borrowers
than lenders. Raising interest rates merely
takes the money from one person's pocket
and puts it into the pocket of another. The
mriddle classes, for instance, are quite large
borrowers, and with the rise in the interest
rate their living cost has increased correspondingly. The government itself is the
largest borrower in tihe country, and when
it puts up the interest rates on itself, and
thereby depresses the price of bonds so that
a discount has to be taken on them, all of
our citizens will share this extra cost in their
tax bills, which in turn adds to the cost of
living.
I turn now to the proposed combines investigation legislation-I think it is Bill No. 144in which some fundamental principles scem to
be involved. There is no question in my mind
that retail price maintenance often prohibits
free competition, and to a great extent eliminates unhampered private enterprise. Such
maintenance no doubt stabilizes prices, but
the cost of it may be too great. Price-fixing
systems of this nature have a tendency to grow
like weeds if unchallenged, and may permeate
a large percentage of our national business.
Now, if retail price fixing is good for some
commodities, why is it not good for all commodities? In its general application we would
have so-called private industry fixing all

NOVEMBER 22, 1951
prices in our democratic state, while in the
Iron Curtain countries dictators or their governments are doing the same thing in another
way. There they fix all prices in government
stores, and the consumer has no right of
choice. If he complains because the price of
a shirt is $10, for instance, he may be sent
to Siberia or elsewhere. Experience has shown
that freedom-loving people have no use for
this system. This part of the problem is
worthy of an explanation.
Another question worthy of research is this.
Would those who desire to fix the prices of
their own products like to buy their .raw
material in a rigid market instead of in a free
and competitive market? In other words,
would they want the materials they require
in their manufacturing to be controlled by
cartels, combines and other means-a system
which, as has been shown time and again
in the United States and in Canada, is a tollgate scheme, leading to enhanced prices. I
feel sure that those who want to fix retail
prices do not want prices of raw materials
fixed for them.
I look back to a time more than twenty
years ago when, as a large user of tin-plate
in the manufacture of tin cans, I came to
Ottawa with my case against the world cartel
in tin-plate prices. There was no Combines
Commission here then, and my case was heard
before the Tariff Board, when William Moore
was chairman. My complaint at that time was
that although the British Empire produced the
tin in the Malayas, our competitors in Germany, Norway, and other countries were buying their requirements at 10 per cent below
the price which the cartel was quoting in
Canada. As this country manufactured no
tin-plate at that time, a great deal of our
supply was imported from England, under
British preference. Representatives came here
from England and appeared before the Tariff
Board in opposition to the representations
I made, but I was able, I think, to prove
that a cartel existed which was enhancing
prices hundreds of thousands of dollars
annually to the consumers of this country.
I remember Mr. Moore making the statement
that he did not think it was the intention
that this country should grant preference
to those who wiped out the benefit of such
preference by entering cartels and overcharging the Canadian people, and that if something
was not done about it he would recommend
that such preferences be immediately investigated with a view, if necessary, of wiping
them out. I am glad to say that from that
time we have been able to buy tin-plate as
cheaply as the people of continental Europe.
I have been interested for thirty years in
labelled goods, and through advertising and

putting quality goods behind our brands these
labels have become very valuable to us not
only in this country but in many countries
throughout the world. Occasionally over the
years some of our goods may have been sold
at less or more than we think they should
have been, but very seldom has this condition
given us trouble. In any event I cannot see
how anything but moral influence could have
been used, for we had in fact parted with
ownership of the goods. The people to whom
we sell know that the money received for
our goods can be used by us to pay our taxes,
expand our plants or in any way we see fit.
It is pretty hard for us to use any undue
influence in respect of the goods we sell.
However, I am glad to hear the representations of all those in business who support
retail price maintenance. My mind is open to
hear their arguments, or their side of the
case.
The continued raising of freight rates, until
this condition has become chronic, is of great
concern to the Maritime Provinces because
of their geographic position. A great part of
our railway system was built for strategic
and defence purposes rather than for strictly
commercial purposes, so the freight haul to
other parts of Canada is a long one. Increased
freight charges are, of course, inflationary:
they add to the costs of industry as well as
to the cost of goods going into the nation's
stockpile. After raw materials are derived
from land and sea and turned into commodities, they have to be distributed. Of course
freight rates are a big factor in distribution
costs, and each time they are raised it simply
means that consumers at a distance must
pay that much more for the commodities
they need. In continually granting raises in
freight rates we have, it seems to me, put
the cart before the horse. Before the railways
come to the public for increases, they should
be required to do their utmost to put their
own house in order.
To the credit of the Canadian National,
Donald Gordon, the President, has asked for
authority to put the balance sheet of this
great railway in order. Although, I believe,
nearly a year has passed since he asked for
this authority, to date nothing has been done.
Everybody knows it is very difficult to arrive
at the true earnings of the Canadian National
Railways. I have reorganized and put in order
the balance sheets of a good many companies,
yet I cannot make out whether the Canadian
National Railway is or is not naking a profit.
The return on the actual money invested in
a great enterprise is the only method of
judging whether it is or is not making money.
Over the years the Canadian National had
unloaded on it many useless properties and
incurred deficits which added to the overhead
and did not contribute to the earnings. These

SENATE
obligations should have been written off long
ago, so that the balance sheet would reflect
the real working assets of the road. Some
action should be taken promptly to carry out
Mr. Gordon's wishes.
As far as the Canadian Pacific Railway is
concerned, I am sure that during the days of
low interest rates it could have done what
many other railways did: that is, by refunding, it could have secured reduced rates on
its bonds or debentures and thus made a substantial saving. Why this action, which would
have been in the interests of the Canadian
public who use the road, was not taken is
hard to understand. It seems to me an indication of serious short-sightedness, and one of
the consequences is that shippers are being
asked for more and more money. That is a
very grave matter for the shippers in the
Maritime Provinces, who ship over the long
haul.
Furthermore, I think the government or
the Board of Transport Commissioners should
employ the best experts available to untangle
the investments of this railway which appear
in "other accounts". Any investments that
have been made over the years which
originally consisted of moneys withdrawn
from the railway treasury should be accounted
for to the railroad treasury and not, as we
now often find, turned over to so-called "other
accounts".
Also, I believe it has been the desire of
parliament, including our honourable body,
that the railways should co-operate in cutting
out duplication and waste. It should be the
duty of someone in authority to see that this
is done, but at the present time there are no
teeth in the law or regulations suggesting cooperation in the interests of economy. An
independent, competent co-ordinator should be
appointed by the government, with authority
to bring the heads of the railways around the
table and see to it that in the interests of the
nation's economy, all duplication and waste is
eliminated. Certainly that end has -not been
achieved by the railways.
Anyone who has read the history of railway building in Canada knows full well that
back in the seventies and eighties the federal
government had very little money, but controlled the real wealth, consisting of great
natural resources; and the grants made in
those early days, consisting of land and
physical assets, were given as part of the
capital the railway needed to operate over a
sparsely settled country. It was never
intended that these gifts were to end up in
"other accounts".
With the large investment in the Canadian
National Railways-upwards of $2 billions
of the people of Canada-that enterprise
should be the yardstick by which rates are
set. If the balance sheet of the Canadian

National is set up properly, in the manner
desired by the management, this railway will
be qualified to represent the measuring stick
for freight rates. It is not good business to
have our rates set, directly or indirectly, by
London or London management when it can
be done in a more capable manner at home
by our government railway, which is 100 per
cent the property of the people of Canada,
and in which they have so great a stake. I
believe that our investment in the institution
which is in fact setting the rates for the
Canadian people is barely 10 per cent.
I am glad that Canada is going ahead with
the St. Lawrence waterway project. I sincerely believe it will be of great benefit to
this country as a whole. The returns to some
parts of the country will be far greater than
to others, but the enterprise is in the line of
progress and will build up our nation, and
that is what counts.
However, I think the Maritime Provinces
are deserving of the Chignecto Canal.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: Oh, that thing!
Hon. Mr. McLean: It is sorely needed, and
would be of immeasurable help to shipping
on our Atlantic coast. I also think that more
defence work should be allocated to our
Eastern Provinces. We are expected to pay
our share of the taxes, and additional contracts for defence will put more money into
circulation and give the people of these provinces the wherewithal to meet their increasing tax burdens. If work is not obtainable
at home, our young people are forced to leave
the Atlantic provinces to seek employment in
the defence plants of Central Canada, and
once they go they seldom come back.
I am glad to see our new province, Newfoundland, going ahead industrially under the
guidance of its energetic premier, Mr. Smallwood. Certainly there bas been a big change
over there, and Newfoundlanders are to be
congratulated.
I have covered quite a few subjects, and I
feel that I have taken up enough time of this
honourable body.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The honourable senator
has not dealt with the dam on the South
Saskatchewan River.
Hon. Mr. McLean: If the people who live in
that area think it would be a good thing to
have the dam, I will use what influence I
have in the Maritimes.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Honourable senators, I

The motion was agreed to and the debate
was adjourned.

INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. Reid inquired of the government:
During the past twelve months what sum or sums
of money have been allowed by the Foreign Exchange Control Board to those of the Chinese race
or nationality, living in Canada, for the purpose
of forwarding to their relatives in China?

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
the answer to my honourable friend's inquiry
is as follows:
Remittances from Canada of up to $100 per
remitter per month may be made through any
bank or post office without reference to the
Foreign Exchange Control Board, and the
board does not obtain information as to the
destination of such remittances.
Applications for benevolent and support
remittances in excess of $100 per remitter per
month are referred to the board for approval.
A few such applications have been received
and approved for remittances to China, but
the board's records are not maintained in such
a way as to enable it to furnish information
as to the number and amount of remittances
which have been made to particular countries.

OLD AGE SECURITY BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from Wednesday,
November 21, the adjourned debate on the
motion of Hon. Mr. Robertson for the second
reading of Bill 13, an Act to provide for Old
Age Security.

SENATE
Hon. J. J. Kinley: Honourable senators, we
are told in the Speech from the Throne that
the primary reason for summoning this second
session of parliament in the present year is
the consideration of providing for our elder
citizens a degree of old age security without
a means test and as a matter of right. It is
therefore of prime importance.
The honourable senator from De Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Vien) who moved the Address in
Reply to the Speech from the Throne, traced
the history of our social legislation from the
first Old Age Pensions Act of 1927. For those
of us who have had long experience in public
life, it is most interesting to look back at
the changes concerning social security which
have taken place through the years.
I recall that in 1927 the federal government
legislation spurred on the provinces to pass
legislation providing for old age pensions.
Canada at that time--some years after the
First World War-was entering a period of
depression, and our economy in many parts of
the country was not buoyant, and taxation
was greatly feared. The first complaint we
heard about the pension was that it would be
too costly. There was also the criticism that
it rew'arded the shiftless and penalized the
hard-working ancd frugal, who were disqualified from receiving it. Further, there was
criticism of the fact that a recipient could earn
only a small sun of money apart fron his pension; and there was fear on the part of those
who had real estate, that if they took the pension the govern.ent would realize on their
property. The limitations were such that only
the very poor could enjoy the pension. Many
people who were in receipt of small incomes
found themselves in a difficult position. These
problems had the result of making the
administration of the legislation costly, and
when election time came around there was
always a good deal of criticism on the hustings
about the payments that were being made,
and the whote scheme for the payment of old
age pensions was carefully overhauled. We
are glad to sec that these problems have now
been removed, and that all those persons
over seventy years of age who have been
citizens of Canada for a certain period of time
are oualified. without a means test, te receive
$40 a month.
This is a beneficial and salutary measure.
In normal times it would have been widely
hailed as a great advance in social legislation.
Probably the fact that it received
unanimous support in the House of Commons, and has not been criticised in this
chamber, has deprived it of that degree of
public notice
which would have been
attracted to it had there been a certain
amount of opposition. A contest in parliament would, I am sure, have caused a great

deal of criticism and discussion in the country. In any event, while the world is in such
a disturbed state, it is not to be expected that
matters of this kind will obtain front page
headlines. But I think that in time, as the
benefits come along, our people will realize
more generally that November 5, 1951, when
the Old Age Security bill passed the House
of Commons, is of historie significance for
Canada. Naturally, as the bill was sponsored
by the government and called for the expenditure of public money, it was introduced in
the other place. The fact that the membership of that house passed it without a dissenting vote indicates a great advance in
public opinion, and shows the extent to
which we are prepared to go to provide
security for people of seventy or over.
Coming, as I do, froin a rural part of
Canada, this legislation appeais especially to
me as a splendid thing for our fishermen.
The fisherman leads a hazardous life. His
capital is continually in peril. Today he may
be comparatively rich; in a few hours a
storm may leave him very poor indeed.
Because of the risks of his calling he cannot
attain the security which belongs to some
other occupations; insurance is costly and
hard to obtain. As I have said, he is in constant danger of losing what it bas taken him
some years to build up. Under this Old Age
Security bill a man, who upon reaching the
age of seventy has little of this world's goods,
will receive $40 a month, and if he is married,
husband and wife together will get $30. That
is going to mean a lot to the fishermen on the
Atlantic coast.
In the many years I have been engaged
in public life, travelling up and down that
coast, I have become familiar with the problems of our fishermen; and speaking from
that background I have no hesitation in saying that the old age pension will be a boon
to the fishermen of Nova Scotia and the
Maritime Provinces generally, and to many
others in our rural communities who live
simply and strive to keep at work as long
as they can. The pension alone will not be
enough to maintain them, and there is no
intention that it should be; but it will both
stimulate and aid them in the later years
of their lives. I have in mind also the position of the old farmer who, having passed
the age of hard work, may be found sitting
in the home, probably looking on at what
others are doing, and being in some degree
dependent upon them. That was never a
satisfactory condition. A cash pension will
mean a lot to many an old farmer in
straitened circumstances, for it will provide
him with a degree of independence, and

NOVEMBER 26, 1951
make things run much more smoothly and
happily in the home where he will end his
days.
There are also a good many men and
women working in small industries which
cannot afford a pension system, and who,
in their later years, find themselves out of
Perhaps they have saved
employment.
enough to build a home, and have a little
laid by.
This pension, provided by a beneficent
government, will supplement their incomes
and make it possible for them to live on in
security.
Old age security has a special significance
for married women. When a woman gets
married she usually ceases to work for
money. She is supposed to work for love.
That is all very well; but in other days the
wife of a man who had an income which
would adequa-tely maintain his -family could
not get an old age pension. She could not
qualify for the pension because of that
income. Today that sort of thing has gone.
Can honourable senators imagine what this
pension is going to mean to the older women
of this country who have no income? They
will get $40 a month. I think it is right that
the women of our country should share in
this worth-while pension as a matter of right,
and without a means test or the earnings of
her husband.
Some people maintain that this pension
will cause inflation, and is inflationary to
the degree that it provides money without
production. Our modern economy is supposed to stand this kind of inflation. But is
it really inflation, or is it just a delayed
payment to our people who are over seventy
for what they did for our country during
their lifetime? The money that goes into
the payment of this old age pension will not
be lost, but will be paid to those who need
it most. They in turn will spend it, and so
it will go back into the pool. This will mean
that more money will be put into circulation, and this will provide an opportunity for
others to earn more. I cannot see that there
is any danger of an inflationary nature from
this old age pension plan. It could be said,
I suppose, that entertainment in this country
involves the spending of money without
production. We all realize, however, that
entertainment is essential, that for the
health
of our people and the good
of the community there must be recreation.
The idea behind the spending of
money for recreation and entertainment is
endorsed by everybody. We do not worry
about the inflation it may cause, and I do not
think we need worry about any inflation that
may be caused by this old age pension. After

all, we are getting to a stage where there is
a better distribution of wealth; where money,
instead of getting into the hands of a few,
is getting into the hands of many. It is a
splendid thing to know that the smaller wage
earners of Canada will benefit from this
pension to the extent that they can enjoy a
better life. This legislation is a sign of
progress, and it is only natural that everybody should be in favour of it.
Honourable senators, this pension is
necessary for the comfort and security of our
older citizens. It is sound business. In the
generosity of its provisions and the breadth
of its coverage, this new program for old age
security is most comprehensive; and Canada
is the first country to pay a universal pension
wi.thout a means test.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
I must inform the house that when the mover
of a bill speaks to it for the second time he
closes the debate. Therefore, if any honourable senator who bas not yet taken part in
this debate wishes to do so, he should proceed
before the leader of the government (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) does so.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I
notice by the Order Paper that the adjournment of this debate stands in the name of
the honourable senator from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar). May I suggest that, because
of his illness, his right to speak on the third
reading of this legislation be reserved. I have
not been asked by the honourable senator
from Churchill to make this request, but I
do so because I am aware of his present
illness. I would suggest that any right he
may have to speak on the third reading of
the bill be reserved.
Hon. Mr. King:

The Hon. the Speaker: Any honourable senator may speak on the third reading of a

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
since this debate has stood in the name of
the honourable senator from Churchill for
several days, I was on the point of explaining
that our colleague had informed me that it
was highly unlikely he would be able to
speak to the bill until it was before the house
for third reading. With all deference to the
honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig),
I do not believe that any reservation of rights
is required to enable the honourable senator

SE1nATE
from Churchill to speak on the third reading.
Anyone has the right to speak on the third
reading of a bill.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
this measure has met with such a high degree
of approval by this house that I would not
undertake at the present time to make further
comment about it were it not for one or two
observations that have been made by those
who have taken part in the debate. I felt
that one of these observations was of more
than passing significance.
First, I should like to refer to the pertinent
remarks made by the honourable senator
from Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis) when
she expressed regret that the method of
financing this pension plan could not in its
totality have the effect of bringing home to
every individual the fact that the fund will
be secured only by taxation. I think this is
true, particularly of that portion of the fund
which will be secured through the 2 per cent
sales tax. As the honourable senator pointed
out, the 2 per cent sales tax is incorporated
in the structure of this scheme in such a
way that the average Canadian will find it
difficult to appreciate the connection between
the two. I am sure, however, that the plan,
so far as the income tax is concerned, will
have substantially the effect desired by the
honourable senator. I notice that there were
some 2,231,970 taxpayers in Canada in 1949.
Now, if one tax return represents two people,
as is in the case in my household, approximately four million Canadians will be
directly affected by the system by which the
pension fund is to be collected. Although it
is true that many wage earners will not have
to contribute through income tax, because
they are in a too low income bracket, many
of these people are in the rural parts of
the country, and have an appreciation of
public business far beyond the amount of
their income. In the few weeks I spent in
the rural parts of Nova Scotia during the
past summer I saw much evidence that the
size of income is by no means a measure of
ones appreciation of public business. I am
quite confident that there is a very keen
realization that these moneys cannot be
secured except through some form of
taxation.
The senator from New Westminster rather
took me to task for having echoed a remark
made in the other house by the Minister of
National Health and Welfare, to the effect
that this measure and others of the same
kind are part of our answer in Canada to
the challenge of other economic systems, such
as communism. Just in passing I may say

that I think my honourable friend was unduly
exercised.
The decision to bring in this
legislation was not hastily arrived at. It
was originally proposed by the federal government to the provinces in 1945, when
Soviet Russia was our ally in the fight against
Nazism; so by no stretch of the imagination
could it be said that this legislation was a
challenge to any particular economic system.
However, in my opinion it was quite proper
for the Minister of National Health and
Welfare to point out, incidentally, that the
measure would have a very definite influence
in convincing the people of Canada that our
own economic system presents to everyone
in the country far greater benefits than could
be obtained under communism or any other
ism that has yet been known.
My honourable friend from New Westminster made some other comments with
which I personally do not agree. I wish to
apologize to him again for referring to his
speech in this way. It is not my intention
to be critical of his remarks, for I always
appreciate his views on legislative matters.
But as I listened to him the other day it
occurred to me that perhaps one or two
statements ie made did not express precisely
what he had in mind. I will quote the
statements to which I have reference, and
if my honourable friend feels that they do not
fairly convey his opinion he can correct me.
At one place in his very excellent speech
he said:
I am gradually coming to the view that thrift as
we knew it is outmoded, out of date.

A little further along he said:
I think most senators were born and brought up
in the "root hog or die" age, when every boy and
man was taught to work hard and save, and put
away something for his old age. That custom is
gradually passing away, if it has not already passed.
and today our people are looking to the state, to
the government, to take care of almost every phase
of our life.

And a little later:
Now I wish to take a moment or two to outline
vhy I believe that the monthly pension of $40 proposed in the present bill is not enough.

Honourable senators, I do not propose to
argue that every person in this country is
as thrifty as be or she ought to be, or saves
the utmost amount possible; on the other
hand, I do not believe that thrift is outmoded or out of date. Neither am I prepared to argue that $40 a month will provide
a desirable standard of living for a person at
the age of 70; but, as I said when moving
second reading of the bill, the payment of
this amount without a means test will provide an excellent foundation upon which
everyone can to a greater or lesser degree
build his or ber own old age security plans.

NOVEMBER 26, 1951
I do not find fault with any senator for
expressing his own views on this question,
for it is only by discussion that the majority
opinion can be arrived at. But there is a
point which I wish to suggest to the house;
the members of the Senate are men and
women of wide experien ce, and no one can
tell how much influence the opinions that
we voice here may have on people generally.
Now I should like to outline, for what it is
worth, a different approach to this question.
If I may, I will use the approach that I should
take if at the end of the session I had the
opportunity of explaining this bill to my own
boys-or to my girls, if I had any; or, if I
had neither, to any young people who might
have more than a passing interest in what I
had to say. My boys are in their twenties,
and I should put it to them something like
this:
We passed this session-for, honourable
senators, I assume the bill will be passed in
the Senate and become law-we passed legislation that will have a most profound effect
upon your future. You no doubt feel, as we
who are now older felt when we were in our
twenties, that the age of 70 is a long way off,
and that before it is reached fortune will have
smiled upon you so kindly that you will not
need outside financial assistance of any form
during the remainder of your life. I think
most young people have felt that way. Nevertheless, statistics show that of the men and
women who reach 70 years of age 80 per
cent are not then able to engage in any
very remunerative work, and approximately
50 per cent of these have not sufficient means
laid by to provide a reasonably decent living
for themselves. Now, for my part I do not
think, nor do most people, I imagine that $40
a month is sufficient to provide a desirable
standard of living for a Canadian at the age
of 70, but bearing in mind that the payment
is made without a means test, it is really
larger than is generally reahized.
Just by way of illustrating how much a
couple would have had to save in order to
bring them in $40 each at the age of 70, let
us suppose that tomorrow a man and his wife,
both of this age, went to purchase a Canadian Government annuity, which I understand is made available to our people on more
reasonable terms than any other annuity. A
life annuity of $480 a year for the man would
cost him a cash payment of $4,689; and one
of the same amount for his wife-whose life
expectancy is of course longer-would cost
$5,500; so that the total amount of cash needed
to buy the annuities for both of them would
be $10,189.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: At what age?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Seventy.

Hon. Mr. Duff: Why should such people
want a pension when they have $10,000?
An Hon. Senator: They did not have it.
Hon. Mr. Duff: I understood my friend to
say they did.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I say that despite the
insufficiency, if you like, of this pension to
provide people with a desirable standard of
living, it is at least a foundation, something
which they can supplement as far as their
good fortune, judgment and thrift will permit, in order to attain security in their old
age.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: May I make an
observation? I have never understood that
either this old age security legislation, or the
previous measure, was intended to provide
enough for any person to live on. My understanding has always been that it was simply
assistance to old people.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Quite. I am making a
distinction as to the present legislation,
because it does not require a means test. This
income will go to persons of seventy years
and more, and will be over and above whatever they have been able to save during their
lifetime. I want to emphasize that, bearing
in mind the cost of an annuity, the pension
represents a substantial amount.
If I were counselling people on questions
of personal income, I would point out that
they could expect to receive not less-and perhaps more-than the present pension legislation provides; but, that they should commence at the very first opportunity to lay
aside something by way of savings to supplement the pension. I would endeavour to
convey to them certain programs of thrift,
notwithstanding what my friend has perhaps
unwittingly said about thrift being outmoded.
My first suggestion to these people would
be that they purchase life insurance; that
not only would it create an immediate estate,
but by the payment of a small additional
premium it could be turned into an annuity
to mature at some predetermined age, say
65 or 70 years, and in the meantime it would
give protection. I would point out, honourable
senators, that there is nothing new in this
form of savings, and that increasing numbers
of people are buying life insurance; that in
1939 Canadians held 6,419,704 policies, with
a face value of $7,088,000,000, and that by
1950 the number of policies had increased
to 9,010,976, with a total face value of
$16,730,000,000.
Hon. Mr. Howden: Were those policies taken
out on seventy-year old people?

SENATE

Hon. Mr. Robertson: No; they were taken
out on persons of all ages. I am merely
making the point that saving in this fashion
is certainly not outmoded.
I turn to another acceptable method of
saving, namely through the savings account,
which earns some interest. The figures show
that an ever-increasing number of persons
are depositing their savings in banks. As of
October 31, 1939, there were in ten chartered
banks 4,161,000 savings accounts, totalling
$1,709,000,000; by September 30, 1951 the
number of accounts had increased to 7,380,000,
with a total value of $4,594,000,000. These
figures indicate, honourable senators, that the
savings account is not out of date.
I have in mind a further method of savingthough it is somewhat more difficult to secure
statistical information as to its popularity.
I recall that during the war years the Victory
Loan campaigns in the city of Halifax, where
I was then working, showed an ever-increasing number of subscribers. In the first
campaign, there were I think, some 9,000
buyers of bonds; that number increased
throughout the various campaigns, and in the
last one that I had anything to do with-I
think it was the seventh loan-that number of
subscribers had reached 55,000. What has happened in the intervening years with respect
to bonds I do not know, but a statement
reached me the other day which indicated
that in the last year a considerable quantity
of bonds held by individuals had been disposed of. Whether they have gone to the life
insurance companies, or where, I do not know;
my impression is that there are in this
country, millions of individuals who purchased
bonds during the war years and who still hold
them.
Hon. Mr. Baird: Would the honourable senator permit a question?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Baird: At what price were these
victory bonds sold?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: They were sold at par,
$100.
Hon. Mr. Baird: And has the honourable
senator any idea what they are worth today?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Yes, I know, because
I own some.
Hon. Mr. Baird: Then may I ask what they
are worth?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The bonds I bought at
par went at one time to $105. Unfortunately
I was not wise enough to take advantage of
their appreciated value. At the present time
the 1966 bonds are quoted at 941 bid and
951 asked.

Hon. Mr. Baird: I know persons who bought
bonds last year at 99 -75 which today are not
redeemable at 92. To me that is saving in
another direction.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I am sure my honour,
able friend knows a great deal more about
financing and bonds than I do, and I shall
not undertake to inform him on the question.
I think, however, that he should make a distinction between the Canadian savings bonds,
issued on the basis of 2, per cent interest,
and guaranteed as to principal, and other
bonds that are guaranteed as to principal only
at maturity. It must be remembered that the
Victory Loans were all made on a long-term
basis, and that to realize the full returns they
had to be held until maturity. My honourable
friend knows that shortly after the sale of
certain government bonds the interest rates of
the world dropped to less than 3 per cent.
With the lowered interest rate, bonds which
were bought at 100 were being sold as high
as 105. Obviously, as interest rates go up, the
price of long-term bonds is likely to drop,
temporarily, until they approach maturity. It
may be assumed that if interest rates increase
there will be some further slackening of the
price; if interest rates fall, the reverse will
occur. Generally speaking the market reflects
varying conditions in the period between the
date of issue and the date of maturity. But
let it not be overlooked that these bonds are
payable at par when they mature. What I
have stated is of course elementary and
familiar ta honourable senators, many of
whon, no doubt, bought and sold bonds before
I knew the value of a ten-cent piece. But
despite fluctuations, I affirm that there is not
in this world today a better investment than
these bonds.
Hon. Mr. Baird: I do not agree. To buy
at 99 and sell at 91 does not represent my
idea of a good investment.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Consider the situation with regard to Canada Savings bonds.
Last year $285,558,400 worth of bonds were
disposed of, and of these $156,199,400 worth
were purchased through payroll plans. Certainly that indicates widespread participation and considerable saving.
Another way in which the $40 per month
grant can be supplemented is through commercial annuities. Various annuity and pension plans have become part and parcel of
governmental and business activities. As
honourable senators know, all permanent
employees of the federal government are
pensionable.
Provincial governments and
many municipal governments and business

NOVEMBER 26, 1951
organizations have pension or annuity plans;
and these, of course, will be supplemental
to the benefits under this legislation.
I might illustrate the possibilities in this
direction by what can be done when certain
amendments, now under consideration, in
respect of government annuities become law.
I recently noticed in a United States magazine an attractive advertisement by an insurance company depicting a man and his wife,
aged sixty-five, enjoying their retirement on
annuities of $2,400 paid by the company.
Let me show you how the provisions of this
bill may be incorporated into a retirement
plan of this kind. Suppose that a man and
his wife, having arrived at the age of sixtyfive, decided to purchase two annuities of
$1,200 a year for the period of their lives.
According to present rates, an annuity for
the male would cost $13,980, and for the
female, $16,248; a total of $30,228. Now consider this provision in the light of the Old
Age Security Bill. It will be possible under
this legislation for a couple to purchase at
the age of sixty-five annuities of $1,200 a year
each, payable from sixty-five to seventy.
At the age of seventy they can avail themselves of the federal pension of $40 per
month and reduce their purchased annuities
to $60 per month each. I would not care
to commit myself to exact figures, because
questions of compound interest are involved;
but whereas, on the basis of government life
annuities of $1,200 each, valid at the age of
sixty-five, this couple would need to invest
$30,228, they will now be in a position to
take advantage of the "matter of right" pension at seventy, and thereby reduce the cost
of annuities of $2,400 a year by between nine
and ten thousand dollars, to slightly over
$20,000. The same principle holds good in
respect of smaller amounts. The purchase
at sixty-five of two $900 life annuities for a
male and a female requires slightly over
$23,000. But if the purchase is reduced by
the "matter of right" pension granted at
seventy, the purchase-price for the couple
would be something over $13,000. Whether
or not married people decide to provide for
themselves by
progressively purchasing
annuities over the years, or by accumulating
their money in the fori of bonds or any
other medium they see fit to use, the likelihood is that in future they will be able

to build up whatever they deem to be an
adequate retiring allowance with much less
difficulty than hitherto.
I believe, honourable senators, that this is
a piece of legislation which we can support
with the greatest confidence. I shall be
astonished if life insurance companies do not
incorporate in their annuity systems features
which, on account of the federal annuity,
will lessen the amount to be provided for by
their clients.
I agree with the honourable senator from
Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis) that the bill
should be regarded-and its very name
implies this-as no more than a foundation
upon which, in various ways, young and
middle-aged people may proceed to build a
substantial provision for their later years,
feeling that what they receive is theirs as a
matter of right, and that for the thrift they
practise or the savings they achieve in the
intervening period they will not be penalized
in any way, shape or form,
Hon. Mr. Duff: Will the honourable leader
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) tell us how these pensions are to be paid for? He has not said a
word about that.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I may tell my honourable friend that the point he mentions has
already been dealt with, but I shall be quite
willing to answer his question either in committee, or when the bill comes before us for
third reading.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
the motion is for the second reading of this
bill. Is it your pleasure to adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr. Duff:,On division!
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time, on division.

aflowed to be materially decreased because of
a change in the method of transportation of
these products.
Thirdly, it is proposed by subsection 4 of
section 3 of the bill to increase the maximum
penalty permissible for infringement of the
act, or the by-laws of the corporation, from
$50 to $1,000. It may be recalled that several
years ago the waters of the harbour were
fouled for an entire summer by the action
of one of the oil companies in dumping a
great quantity of oil into Toronto Bay, resulting in the denial of bathing facilities to many
Toronto inhabitants. It is felt that a fine
of $50 is totally inadequate for such an
offence.
At the present moment, there are in Ottawa
four members of the Toronto Harbour Commission, and also representatives of the oil
companies, and as these gentlemen desire to
be heard, by the committee, I would ask that
this bill be given second reading now so that
it may be referred at once to the Standing
Committee on Transport and Communications.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Will the companies bring
the oil to the harbour by pipe lines?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I assume they can'bring
it anywhere they like. In order to reach their
present facilities they have to cross the
harbour commission's property, and when
they do so, the commission, if we give them
the required permission, will be in a position
to levy fees and tolls on the oil that comes
in that way, and thus replace the revenue
which formerly was derived from oil which
arrived by tankers. As I read the bill, it
contains no power whereunder the Harbour
Commission can charge tolls on oil which
passes over the lands of other people.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Certain amendments of the
bill were made in the other place. Do the
printed copies now before us and on file
contain those amendments? If not, I shall
rise on a point of order.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I think it is the invariable practice, when a bill is passed with
amendments by the Commons, to send it to
us in the amended form. I am told that this
is the bill as amended.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It looks to me like the
original bill. If I am assured that it includes
the amendments, I shall have no objection.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I was not in the Commons at the time, but my information is that
this is the bill as passedi by the other house.
Hon. Mr. Haig: What service will the harbour commission give to companies which
bring in their oil by pipe line?

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: As appears from the
notes which I read, that the harbour commissioners have added to the area of Toronto
about a thousand acres, and have supplied
the oil companies-no doubt at a pricewith facilities convenient to the harbour
where large quantities of oil have been transported and delivered to them. Certain fees
were charged to the companies when the oil
came in by boat. It is proposed that in the
future, though not in the early future, oil
will be conveyed to these same facilities over
harbour commission property, but by pipe line
instead of by ship. So, if the revenues of
the harbour commission are to be maintained, we must invest it with the little extra
authority necessary to collect on oil which
comes in by pipe line rather than by boat.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Are there refinery facilities
on the waterfront?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There is storage.
Hon. Mr. Wood: Refineries?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There are no refineries,
but there are storage facilities.
Hon. Mr. Wood: And they may be some
place else.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Well, if they are, the
harbour commission will not be troubled with
them, and the companies will not pay the
commission any fees if the oil is stored elsewhere. But while the companies use the
harbour commissioners' facilities and cross
their lands with pipe lines or otherwise, the
commission should, I think, be given the
power to collect sufficient fees to carry on its
activities.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Will the honourable senator
from Toronto-Trinity explain why the commissioners are not at present in a position to
charge for services such as storage? Are they
not empowered to do so by their act of
incorporation?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Not as I understand it.
That is the reason for this bill. Under the
present Act they have the right to charge for
ships docking and that sort of thing. When
the Harbour Commissioners Act of 1911 was
passed nobody thought of pipe-lines; consequently this power is necessary if they are
to sustain their revenues.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Is the pipe-line to be the
property of the Harbour Commissioners?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Not the pipe line itself,
no.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Is the charge contemplated
to be for piping the oil or is it to be for
storing the oil in storage facilities provided
by the Harbour Commissioners?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It is a charge upon the
oil as it passes through the pipes across the
property of the harbour board. It will, of
course, involve storage service; but it will
not, as I understand it, be a storage charge.
Honourable senators should bear in mind
that this bill will be sent to committee, where
it will be dealt with tomorrow, and where
questions will be capably answered by persons more familiar with the bill than I am
at the moment. I only arrived back in
Ottawa this morning. The bill is an important one and one, emanating from my city
of Toronto. I therefore take pleasure in
sponsoring it.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Honourable senatorsHon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I do
not intend to delay the house in discussing
this legislationThe Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, the honourable gentleman from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden) has the floor.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Honourable senators, I
am sorry to interrupt my friend from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig), but I have been
struggling for some tirne to say a few words
about this bill, because it affects the Toronto
Harbour Commissioners. I think an additional word of explanation may be this. Some
of the harbour board property where the oil
companies have their installations-particularly the docks, wharves and other facilities bordering on the waterfront-is held by
way of leasehold. Therefore the harbour
board still holds control over these facilities;
and all the board is seeking is the authority
to maintain its revenues. The board feels,
that if oil is to be moved by some means
other than water transport into the storage
facilities which are located on the leasehold
property-the docks, and so on of these
various companies-it should receive some
revenue from this operation.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Is the board not already
getting paid for this?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The board is getting
revenue now from oil brought in by tankers
and moved over its property. If oil, instead
of coming in by water, is to be brought in
by pipe-line over freehold lands already
owned by the board and deposited in storage
facilities on leasehold property maintained
by the oil companies, the board feels that
it should be able to draw revenue from this
operation. The board takes the position that
this property should not be bottled up or
shut off without any ability to earn. If the
oil companies do not want to use their facilities while getting oil by pipe-line rather
than by tankers, they should move them so

that the property can be put into the hands
of some other person who will make it revenue producing. That is the essence of the
important part of this bill. It is to maintain
the revenues of the harbour board. The oil
is moving on to leasehold properties of the
harbour board from the land instead of from
the water. As long as it is moving via water
the board has authority under the present
Act to collect tolls, and it says that so long
as the facilities are used it wants to collect
revenues, and that if they are not going to be
used it should be advised accordingly, so that
it can get some person else who will make
use of thern and provide revenue.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Where is the oil coming
from? Is it coming from the West by pipeline?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: From Sarnia.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It comes from Alberta,
really.
May I ask my honourable friend a question? Do the oil companies pay any taxes on
that property to the city of Toronto?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I should expect so.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Then what this bill proposes
is the adoption of an altogether new principle
of taxation. If the oil companies built tanks
on their own property this bill would not
empower the harbour board to tax them, I
take it.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is quite true.
not know how it could.

I do

Hon. Mr. Haig: It could, if the bill contained provisions to that effect and we
passed it.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: How could the harbour
board tax the companies if they owned the
land?
Hon. Mr. Farris: This is more like a service
fee, is it?
Hon. Mr. Haig: The companies must have
entered into a contract with the harbour
board when they built their plants there. I
am not a citizen of Toronto and not familiar
with the harbour board there, but it seems to
me that what this bill proposes is an additional tax on gasoline, which the consumer
will have to pay.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No, that is not it at all.
Hon. Mr. Haig: When you get down to it,
that will be the result.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No, that will not be the
result. When the bill is in committee you
will find out that it will not affect the cost of
gasoline.

NOVEMBER 27, 1951
Hon. Mr. Haig: Oh, yes, it will. Otherwise,
the companies could reduce the price. In my
city of Winnipeg the bringing in of gasoline
by pipe line will result in a reduction in cost.
The gasoline used to be brought in by railway, but it will now come in by a pipe line,
which we are not attempting to tax, and as
soon as our plant opens we shall be able to
buy gasoline cheaper than before, and the
price will continue to be cheaper than it was
before. Similarly, the cost of the gasoline in
Toronto should be cheaper when brought in
by pipe line, unless the companies have to
pay this tariff to the harbour board. Unless
the companies have a terrific investment in
plant where they are, I cannot see why they
should not move the terminus of their pipe
line on to land which they themselves own.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is the obvious
alternative.
Hon. Mr. Haig: In Manitoba we have been
advised-I do not know whether the advice
is correct or not-that delivery by pipe line
is much cheaper than delivery by the old
system. Now, why should the consumer not
get the benefit of that reduction in cost? Why
should any harbour board set itself to tax the
companies out of any savings which otherwise would accrue from delivery by pipe line?
I am not interested at all in the city of Toronto, and I have no stock or other interest
in any oil company anywhere, but I am a
consumer of gasoline, and if the companies
can save a cent or two per gallon through the
shipment of oil by pipe line, I do not see why
some harbour board or anybody else should
step in and tax the companies to such a
degree that the saving in delivery costs will
not be passed on to me. I think that this bill
should be sent to committee, for a good deal
of further explanation is required.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I have the
indulgence of the house to clear up this
point? If honourable members will look at
the bill itself, which, after all, is the criterion,
they will seeThe Hon. the Speaker: I would remind the
house that unless the honourable gentleman
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) has
leave to make a further explanation, if he
speaks now he will close the debate.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I ask for leave.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: I should like the sponsor
of the bill to state if the Toronto Harbour
Commission intends to impose a tax on oil
companies just because their pipe lines happen to pass underneath harbour commission
property? If that is so, I cannot understand
it. Why should the Toronto Harbour Commissioners or any harbour commissioners in
the country be entitled to tax an oil company
94703-11

because its pipe line passes underneath harbour commission property, when owners of
other lands through which pipe lines pass
have no right to impose a tax? I do not see
the logic of that.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Question!
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: If no one else wishes
to speakHon. Mr. Vien: I think the honourable
gentleman from Toronto-Trinity should have
leave to give an additional explanation before
the debate is closed. There is a principle in
the bill, and passing of the motion for second
reading is supposed to be acceptance of the
principle. On the basis of the information
that I have at this juncture I am unable to
accept the principle of this bill, and I hope
the honourable member will be permitted to
give us further information before closing the
debate.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: I should Uke to have an
answer to my question.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: May I ask the sponsor
of the bill one question? Is it the intention
to maintain revenue or to increase revenue?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: To maintain revenue.
Perhaps I may be allowed to answer the
question of my honourable friend from Rigaud
(Hon. Mr. Dupuis) without running into too
much trouble with the rules. The distinction
between an ordinary owner of land and the
harbour commission in this instance is that
the commission has to maintain a harbour
and provide all the services that are required
for the reception, delivery and out-shipping of
oil. I am not in a position to enumerate these
services in detail.
As I was about to say a little earlier, the
bill itself, as will be seen at line 10 and the
following lines on page 2, provides for the
imposition and collection of rates and toUs
on goods, materials or commodities-these
terms would include oil and such thingswhen transported into, from or within the
harbour of Toronto. That is all the authority
that is given. If oil companies bring oil into
the harbour, which is under the jurisdiction
of the Toronto Harbour Commissioners, toUs
similar to those formerly collected may be
collected again. There is no intention of
increasing the amount or, as suggested by the
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), of
taking away from the companies the savings
that they make through pipe Une deliveries.
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: Who fixes the rates?
Hon. Mr. Quinn: The net revenue of the
oil companies would increase with the volume
of ail?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes. The oil companies
made tremendous profits in the past when
they brought oil into the harbour by ships
and paid harbour tolls. Now that they
intend to make delivery by pipe line there
is no reason why the facilities of the harbour should be extended to them without
charge. In view of the . new method of
transportation,
unless
some
additional
authority is given to the commission, the oil
companies will retain their advantages and
pay nothing for them. It seems to me that
if they are to get benefits for which they
have been willing to pay in the past, they
should continue to pay for them in the
future.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: If companies bringing
oil to the city of Toronto build storage
facilities outside of the property of the
Toronto Harbour Commission, will the companies be in need of services from the
commission?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: If they do not need
the services, the passage of the bill will not
affect them; that is, if the oil companies
store their oil elsewhere, this measure will
have no application. They are free to do
that. On the other hand, if they continue
to use the facilities of the harbour then they
must be subject to some tolls, which would
be used to maintain the harbour.
Hon. Mr. Euler: But the oil companies
are now paying something-call it rental
or something else-for the use of facilities
which belong to the harbour commission.
Hon. Mr, Roebuck: Yes. They pay taxes
to the city.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Then what services will
the oil companies get, if they use pipe lines
instead of ships?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The same services.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I fancy that is so. The
companies will, for instance, be shipping oil
out.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I understood my friend to
say that no compensation is being received
for the services. The city of Toronto is
now receiving something for the use of
these facilities.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The city is in the
ordinary way receiving taxes which amount
to about $2 million. But the city is not
interested in this argument at all. It will
continue to collect taxes, as in the past.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the sponsor
of the bill how oil is now being handled?
If it is being brought in by ships, they
would certainly have to pay compensation
to the harbour commission.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. Reid: And if oil is brought in
by tank cars, payment is made to the railway,
and not to the harbour commission.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Reid: But if oil is brought in
by pipe line instead of by tank cars, is it
intended that the companies should still be
charged?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is right. If the
oil companies bring in nil by tank car, and
use harbour facilities, they will be subject
to an impost by the harbour commissioners.
It is only when they come into the harbour
and use its lands and facilities of the commission that there is any opportunity or
authority to levy tolls, and they are very
small.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Do I understand that oil
which is stored in reservoirs or tanks on
oil company property is shipped to some other
part of the country through the harbour
commission?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No. The supply is
largely distributed in the city of Toronto, I
think, and the harbour board property is used
for that purpose.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Will the senator from
Toronto-Trinity please explain the first
objective of the bill, namely, the extension
of the north boundary line.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I am sorry, I cannot
explain that. I understand that that is the
boundary line set out in the original legislation as "water's edge". This measure would
define the boundary in metes and bounds
rather than in the broad term "water's edge".
The water's edge means the lake shore. but
that has long since changed. As I understand
the measure, it does not extend the boundary
it merely states in metes and bounds what is
now the boundary.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the Speaker: When shall the bill
be read the third time?
Hon Mr. Vien: Honourable senators, I
understood that the bill was to be referred
to a committee.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I
move that this bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications.
The motion was agreed to.

NOVEMBER 27. 1951
CANADA-UNITED KINGDOM FINANCIAL
AGREEMENT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Salier A. Hayden moved the second
reading of Bill 10, an Act to approve the
Financial Agreement between Canada and
the United Kingdom, signed on the twentyninth day of June, 1951.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
deals with a financial agreement made
between Canada and the United Kingdom,
which came into effect in January, 1942, ran
until 1946, when it was extended until
January 1, 1951. This measure would continue the agreement until January 1, 1954.
It will be recalled that at the beginning of
1942 Canada had accumulated about $1
billion worth of sterling, and so far as
England was concerned the situation was
considered serious. Canada at that time made
an agreement with the United Kingdom
under which we set aside $300 million of the
$1 billion for the purpose of repatriating
Canadian government bonds, and other
securities guaranteed by the government,
which were held by residents of the United
Kingdom. Canada funded the remaining $700
million without interest for a certain period,
to be payable on demand at a time declared
by the Governor in Council to be the officiai
termination of the war. In 1946 Canada made
an agreement with the United Kingdom
covering advances to that country of $1,250
million and parliament agreed that the
earlier agreement would be extended ta
January 1, 1951.
In the interval, United Kingdom residents
have sold Canadian securities and the dollars
received therefrom have been applied by the
Bank of England in reduction of the balance
of the funded debt. Where there has been
redemption of Canadian securities held by
United Kingdom residents, the funds received
by the Bank of England have been applied
in reduction of the balance of the indebtedness in the amount of $700 million. The
balance owing today by way of funded debt
is $229 million. The only departure from
the rule laid down is that the Bank of
England or the people of the United Kingdom
may use Canadian funds received from the
sale of Canadian securities and the redemption of securities. That is to say, in a
bona ide case of a British manufacturer who
possesses a special technique or "know-how,"
and intends to set up his industry in Canadaassuming it would be good for this countrythe Bank of England is permitted under the
existing arrangement to use Canadian funds
for the purpose of financing the development
94703-11j

of that industry in Canada, rather than applying the moneys to reduce the balance of the
indebtedness.
But the indebtedness has gone away down.
In 1942, when it was funded, it amounted to
$700 million; today it is only $229.8 million;
and it is hoped and expected, unless there are
entirely unforeseen circumstances, that by
January 1, 1954, the next due date, the major
portion or the whole of this balance will
have been repaid.
Hon. Mr. Haig: What happens in the case
of a man who, having lived in Canada, goes
to Great Britain, remains there for a while,
and dies, and by whose will property in
Canada owned by him is bequeathed to

Canadian beneficiaries?
it, the money realized by the sale of the
property must be sent to Great Britain. Will
it be returned, or what will become of it?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I can only answer my
honourable friend in general ternms. Any person who is a resident of the United Kingdom
is, of course, subject to the foreign exchange
control laws of that country. The honourable
senator has made the supposition that this
person, though he has assets in Canada, has
become a resident of the United Kingdom.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I did not make a supposition.
I know of such a case.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I assumed that my honourable friend was dealing with a hypothetical
case.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Also, knowing him as
well as I do, I surmised that back of the
hypothetical case was an actual experience.
However, for purposes of the record I am
treating it as hypothetical.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I did not mention any names.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I have said the general
rule is that a resident of the United Kingdom
is subject to the foreign exchange control
laws in effect there. If, as a result of the
liquidation or sale of Canadian securities
owned by him, he receives Canadian funds,
the money must be applied by the Bank of
England in reduction of the balance of the
Canadian funded debt. The only exception
to that rule is the one I mentioned: in a
proper case, in lieu of dollar funds being
paid to Canada, the money may be applied
to the location and development of an industry in this country.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But the man is dead.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: He may be dead, but so
long as his assets linger on, and the United

SENATE
Kingdom has control of them, they are going
to be dealt with in this way, and they must
be dealt with in this way.
Hon. Mr. Reid: With reference to the $300
million of securities which have been repatriated, it wou'ld be interesting to know what
type they are. Has the honourable senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) any data
concerning them? I have in mind some large
organizations whose headquarters are in the
United States but whose Canadian securities
are held in Great Britain. I am thinking also
of certain railway securities.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Well, in the $300 million
repatriation are included Canadian Government bonds and securities guaranteed by our
government. These types of securities were
acquired from United Kingdom residents
through the Bank of England. Voluntary
repatriations would include any type of
security ;held by residents of the United Kingdom. I understand that over the years a great
part of the Canadian Pacific Railway securities
have been repatriated in this way. For example, a United Kingdom resident wishes to sell
his C.P.R. holdings. He disposes of them for
Canadian dollars, which go to the Bank of
England. That procedure is obligatory under
British law. Having received Canadian dollars
and surrendered them to the Bank, the British
resident has ta make his own deal with the
authorities in terms of the currency of Great
Britain. But the Canadian dollars are applied
in reduction of the funded indebtedness of
$700 million.
Hon. Mr. McLean: There are one or two
questions I would like to ask the sponsor of
the bill. What is the value of Canadian
securities still owned in the United Kingdom?
Is the Bank of England the sole judge of
whether the proceeds of sale of these securities shall be paid to Canada or be given to
people who may want to invest them here
in this so-called "know-how"?
My third
question is, have not a great many C.P.R.
securities been sold in the United States? It
does not appear to me that the number of
Canadian shareholders is increasing very
much. Finally, if C.P.R. securities are sold
in the United States, are the proceeds applied
in reduction of this loan?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I cannot answer all the
questions of my honourable friend; if he
wants details I shall have to deal with them
in committee.
As regards "offset"-the type of transaction in which the Bank of England may
advance Canadian funds to a British manufacturer to establish a "brick and mortar"
industry, involving industrial construction
and the bringing in from the United Kingdom

of "know-how" which would be advantageous to Canada-it is conditional upon Canadian authorities being satisfied that the
proposed diversion of dollars from their
prime purpose, namely the retirement of
funded indebtedness, will be to the advantage of Canada. Remember that the repatriation which goes on is what is called
voluntary. The Bank of England is obligated
to use the Canadian funds it receives in a
certain fashion; but so far as Canada is concerned, liquidation is voluntary. A Canadian
company may redeem an issue of preferred
shares and distribute the money in the usual
way to its shareholders. To the extent that
United Kingdom residents are entitled to a
share of this money, the Bank of England
comes into possession of Canadian dollars,
and it is under compulsion to apply them
in a certain way. The only exception is the
one I have mentioned.
Up to the present time that offset has been
utilized in the amount of $60 million, and
has been invested, as I have indicated, in
what may be called brick and mortar industry, meaning the construction of plant and
equipment and the bringing in of "knowhow" to the advantage of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Who is to be the judge
as to whether that offset is legitimate?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: As I understand it, the
judges have been the Department of Finance
and those in other departments whom they
consult and who are presumed to know the
nature of the industry and how essential it
is to Canada. As regards certain types of
industry, I strongly suspect that the Department of Defence Production have had a good
deal to say.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I was wondering whether
the judgment would be that of the Bank of
England or the Canadian Government.
Hon.

Mr.

Hayden:

Certainly

it

is

not

exclusively that of the Bank of England, but
the Bank of England may make an offset if
that offset is satisfactory to the Canadian
Government.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That is the point.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Is it the intention to send
this bill to committee?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: As to that, I am in the

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Haig: On the south side, yes.
Where is it on the east?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: There is a meridian
along thereHon. Mr. Haig: I can tell you what it is.
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: All right.
Hon. Mr. Haig: When you have finished I
shall tell you.
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: Part IV of the bill deals
with offences, penalties, and things of that
kind, it makes provision for the surveying
of any lands of which the government of
Canada has the disposal. It will be found
that it is an offence to interrupt molest or
hinder surveyors in their work. They are
protected by the laws of the land. It is also
an offence to alter, remove or pull down any
of the monuments or posts which surveyors
have placed on the land. Along the international boundary there is an iron post every
mile. Those posts have sometimes been
abused, crow bars and instruments of that
nature having been used on them. In recent
years these posts have been replaced by
hollow cylinders rounded at each end, but
it has been discovered that cattle have rubbed
up against these posts on the range lands
and have broken them down. The Department of National Research has been asked
to supply more standard markers for surveying purposes.
Honourable senators, I think I have outlined
the substance of the bill and, if it is thought
desirable, it can be sent to committee.
Hon. Mr. Reid: There are two questions
which I should like to ask the sponsor of
the bill. My first question has to do with
the changing of name from "Dominion Lands
Surveys Act" to "Canada Lands Surveys Act."
When the bill becomes law will there be
a change in the name of the present Dominion
Lands Act? Shall we have to change that
too? At the present time there are provincial
lands and, to use the old name, dominion
lands. I am not raising any objection to
the changing of the name, but I should like
to know whether this bill will change the
name of dominion or federal lands? Secondly,
what about the dominion land surveyors?
Will they still be so designated under the
bill?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: The Dominion Lands
Surveyors Association is a separate organization, and this bill does not touch the name.
It is merely a question of organization. So
far as the Dominion Lands Act is concerned,
it has already been repealed and is called the
Territorial Lands Act. The Dominion Land
Surveyors Association will continue to be so
called.

Hon. Mr. Reid: In my province we have
lands which are still known as dominion

Lands Act, which was replaced last year by
the Territorial Lands Act. The name of this
legislation is now being changed to "The
Canada Lands Surveys Act," and future
surveys made on Indian reserves, on dominion lands, will be done under this Act.
Naturally the question arises how these lands
will be designated in future. Unless the point
is cleared up there may be a lot of confusion.
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: The bill does not say
anything about this.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: In Part II they are
described as "public lands."
Hon. Mr. Reid: But provincial lands are
public lands too, and it seems to me that we
need to have some term for distinguishing
between them and dominion lands. Who is
objecting to the word "dominion"? Buildings
which are now known as dominion buildings
can be called federal buildings without any
difficulty, and we see from the telephone
directory that government offices are no
longer listed under the heading of "Dominion
Government" but are under "Government of
Canada." I am not objecting to that. My
point is simply this, that unless we decide
upon some term for describing what have
hitherto been known as dominion lands there
will be confusion when we want to distinguish
between them and provincial lands. Is it
intended to use the term "Canada lands"? If
so, it will be a long time before that term
comes into common use in our province,
although we are proud of Canada out there.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Will the honourable
senator who sponsored the bill (Hon. Mr.
Gershaw) elaborate a bit on the qualifications
of dominion land surveyors? I see that there
are provisions for examinations, fees, articled
pupils, the granting of commissions, and so
on. Do I understand that this bill sets up a
new system for the commissioning of qualified
persons as dominion land surveyors? How
many dominion land surveyors are there? Is
there any method whereby a qualified provincial surveyor may secure a commission as
a dominion land surveyor, or does the bill
establish an exclusive group known as
dominion land surveyors? What I should like
to know is whether we are in danger of creating a closed corporation of surveyors.
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: The first part of the
bill lays down the procedure that a student
must go through before he -can become a
dominion land surveyor. The number of
persons who qualify will, of course, depend
upon the amount of work available. The

NOVEMBER 27, 1951
department has a number of qualified dominion land surveyors on its payroll, and uses
themn whienever necessary; but when the work
becomes too great for themn to attend to it
engages additional men. The bill does flot
set up a new organization at ail; it simply
makes clear just what must be done by pupils
who desire to, qualify for commissions as
dominion land surveyors.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Can a pupil become
qualified as a dominion land surveyor simply
by taking a course for two or three years?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: He inust also be articled
for three years to a dominion land surveyor.
Some men are qualified both under the
dominion Act and under a provincial Act.
In each province there is certain work that
can be done only by provincîally qualified
men, and other work is reserved for men with
dominion qualifications.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Is there any method
whereby a provincially qualified man, who is
presumed to be familiar with his profession
of surveying, can become a dominion land
surveyor without going through the course
laid down in this bill?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: I do not find anything
on that point in the bill. I assume that, as
in every other profession, hie would furnish
the examining board with a statement of his
qualifications, and the board would decide
whether or not to grant him a commission.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: From what we have heard
so far, 1 take it that the dominion l.and
surveyors are an independent body. Is there
any regulation of or control over the fees
that they may charge? If so, by whom?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: When they are working
for the government they are paid as other
government employees are.
Han. Mr. Quinn: Are they a government
body?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: No. Lîke the members
of every other profession, they have a
schedule -of fees that they can charge.
Hon. Mr. Hramer: In other words, their
organization sets a price that they may
charge?
Han. Mr. Haig: Like my honourable
friend from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck>, I arn afraid of any new provisions
that may create any exclusive group with
special privileges. When the Manitoba boundary was extended northward there were one
or two men in the northern territory who,
though not members of the Manitoba Bar
or perhaps of any law society, had been
practising law up there; and similarly, there
were one or two men who certainly were not

members of the College of Physicians and
Surgeons of Manitoba, who nevertheless had
been practising as doctors. But when the
boundjary was ýextended these men were
inciuded as members of their respective professional bodies. Now, is there any danger
that if this bill passes some surveyor who is
now elderly and probably not able to pass
the prescribed examination will be deprived
of bis professional standing?
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: None whatever. Anyone
who is already a dominion land surveyor will
not have to pass a further examination. The
provisions in the first part of the bill apply
only to ýstudents.
Han. Mr. Haig: I asked my honourable
friend where the Manitoba base was from
which the first line of survey was taken.
The 49th parallel is not the base. A former
senator, who used to sit where my honourable
friend from Kootenay East (Hon. Mr. King)
now sits, went in there on the first survey
party. It is situated about fourteen miles
west of the ýcity of Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. Howden: Sixteen.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The land west of that is
called Range 1 west, and east of that is
known as Range 1 east. That is where the
first line was made. If you drive out from
Winnipeg along the very fine Highway No.
1-Portage avenue west-you will, if you
dodge the bumps, corne to one of those little
monuments erected to designate historic sites.
It is on land where the first survey was
struck, and the land for the site was given by
a former senator and by a man who is at
present a senator.
Han. Mr. Aseltine: Who were they?
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was rend the second time.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Is the bill going to
committee?
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I move that this bill be referred to the
Standing Committee on Natural Resources.
The motion was agreed to.
BILLS 0F EXCHANGE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Salter A. Hayden moved the second
reading of Bill 19, an Act to amend the Buis
of Exchange Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
very simple in form. Its real purpose is to
make it possible for the banks of Canada, to
the extent; that they see fit, to keep their

SENATE
offices open to the public for five days of the
week only. In other words, it will enable
them to allow their employees, or the greater
portion of them, to have all Saturday off. The
method being taken to give the banks this
permission is by amending the Bills of
Exchange Act so as to provide that if a
negotiable instrument, whether payable on
demand or otherwise, falls due on Saturday,
it will be deemed to fall due on the next
business day. The effect of the provision is
that if a person has a note which falls due
on Saturday, and the bank is not open on
that day, he does not suffer any damage in
law if it is presented on the next business
day.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: And is no additional interest charged for the two days?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That would be a matter
to be determined between the parties. I
should think.
I should point out that while the amendment is requested by the banks for the purpose of relieving more of their employees on
Saturday mornings, subsection 3 of section
1 provides that the banks may cash cheques
on a Saturday morning. There are various
parts of the country where, on Saturdays,
people desire to deposit moneys in and make
withdrawals from their accounts, and within
limits the banks will provide the facilities
for doing so. In this way the bank staffs
Saturday morning can be considerably
reduced.
My understanding is that the banks intend
to go into this Saturday morning shut-down
gradually, so as not to interfere with the
present practice of accepting deposits and
allowing people to make withdrawals on
Saturday morning. It was decided that the
best approach to the problem was to deal with
the due dates of negotiable instruments, and
the amendment is suggested for that purpose.
Hon. Mr. Farris: If the bank is open on
Saturday morning, must an instrument that
is due on that date be presented?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: When the amendment
becomes law, a note that falls due on Saturday may be presented on the next business
day. If it were presented on Saturday morning the bank could refuse to do anything
about it, and under the law the validity of
the instrument would not be affected. The
note could be presented on the next business
day, and all the legal implications provided
in the Bills of Exchange Act would apply.

Hon. Mr. Vien: I would like to ask the
senator a question with respect to subsection
3 of the bill. It reads in part as follows:
. . . the non-acceptance or non-payment on a
Saturday of a cheque so presented does not entitle
the person presenting it to treat the cheque as dishonoured by non-acceptance or non-payment.

There is nothing there as to the obligation of
a person to present the instrument on the next
business day.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: May I point out to my
friend that if he reads paragraph (a) of subsection 2 he will see there the general provision as to all matters relating to bills or notes.
The paragraph reads:
(a) if the time for doing any act or thing expires
(r falls on a Saturday, that time is deemed to expire
or faIl, as the case may be, on the next following
business day.

Hon. Mr. Vien: I think that covers my
question.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: In order to be doubly
sure, I suggest that my friend refer to paragraph (c) of subsection 2, which reads:
(c) failure to do any act or thing on a Saturday
does not give rise to any rights.

I understand that some cheques-such as pension cheques-are issued with a limitation of
time for presentation stamped on them. If
such

a cheque

expires on a Saturday, the

passage of this bill will permit its presentation
on the next business day.
Hon. Mr. Reid: There are many workmen
who receive their cheques on Saturday and
have them cashed by merchants. Has any
consideration been given to the effect upon
merchants who cash such cheques?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: This bill deals only with
the relationship between the person presenting the cheque and the bank. If a merchant
cashes a workman's cheque, no problem
would arise unless the merchant wanted to
rush to the bank to cash it. But any cheque
may be presented within a reasonable time.
I do not see how the situation my honourable
friend mentions would
interfere with
ordinary business practice. The banks will
provide services for accepting deposits and
making withdrawals on Saturday morning,
but they will be under no obligation in law
to do other business. The holder of a cheque
suffers no damage, because he can present
it on the next business day following the
Saturday.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Will this measure apply
to other financial institutions than chartered
banks?

NOVEMBER 27, 1951
mornings. The problem behind this measure could have been remedied easily by
adding Saturday to the list of holidays in the
Bank Act, but the government did not want
to take the responsibility for creating any
more holidays. It was feit that the better
way of doing it was to postpone the due
dates of instruments falling due on Saturday.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from Thursday,
November 22, consideration of His Excellency the Governor General's speech at the
opening of the session, and the motion of
Hon. Mr. Vien for an address in reply
thereto.
Hon. Donald MacLennan: Honourable
senators, I think I shall put myself in your
good graces by saying that I am not going to
use the word "democracy" very often. I
believe it was the great Dr. Johnson who once
said that patriotism is the last refuge of a
scoundrel, and I am afraid that many a
scoundrel has taken refuge in the phrase
"freedom and democracy".
Although at this late date it seems unnecessary, I wish to congratulate the mover and
the seconder of the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne.
After reading
their speeches I came to the conclusion that

NOVEMBER 28, 1951
I must be memtally lazy, because I neyer
could have gathered together s0 many facts
and figures.
I suppose it is a littie late ta refer ta the
visit to Canada of Princess Elizabeth and the
Duke of Edinburgh, but ta me it was amazing that a young waman and a young man
could evoke such enthusiasm across a whole
continent. The Princess is a direct descendant of the great Queen Victoria, wha s0 raised
the moral atmosphere of the English court
that a great Emglish poet was incited ta say
that her court was pure. Her son, Edward
the Peacemaker, was a most human monI
arch, as was his son, George V.
believe that if people in ordinary walks of
lif e were asked ta suggest an epitaph for the
tombstone of George V they would propose
that it read: "He was a good neighbour". It
seems ta me that no higher honour could be
paid to any individual. And lastiy we came
ta aur present much respected King, George
VI, wha, is ruling canstitutionally; and ta hià
Queen, who in canduct and in appearance
seems ta cambine the virtues and the
attributes of the great race ta which she
beiongs.
Hon. Senatars: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: The Speech from the
Throne, whiie not very long, deals with very
important matters. The Oid Age Security
Bill, which has been fully discussed and
expiained, is an important measure; and I
came ta the conclusion that it must be a step
in the right direction, because ail parties here
and in another place agreed ta its passage
without any amendments. As for mysefbecause, I suppose, of my incapacity te understand it-I arn unabie te see why $40 a month
shouid be paid ta a millionaire.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Han. Mr. MacLennan: Nor arn I able ta
understand why I amn going ta have ta pay a
tax of $60 a year towards the Old Age
Security Fund, when my honourable friend
ta my right here (Hon. Mr. Paterson) will have

Somne Hon. genalors: Oh, oh.
Han. Mr. MacLennan: I think that that
animated interrogation point ini the other
house, the honaurable member for Winnipeg
North Centre, abjected stromgiy ta that feature
of the bill. Possibiy he beiomgs ta that class
who believe mn-to use the vulgar expression
-"soaking the rich". I arn not one of that
ciass. Sa far as Canada is concerned, the rich
are good, honest men, wha had vision; they
were pioneers. I only regret that our
ancestors, good, honest aid people, have
94703-12ý

passed to the Great Beyond without having
received any of the aid that oid people wiii
receive from now on; but I arn aid fashioned
enough ta think that their reward has been
given ta them at the Throne of Grace.
In the New York Times of August 6 last I
read an article in which a professer' of history
in California said that the history of the
United States, in sa far as the Morgans, the
Vanderbilts, the His, the Gouids and other
eminent pioneers were concerned, would have
ta be rewritten, because that history has
referred ta them as rabber barons, whereas
they were nothing of the kind. He maintained
that the First Worid War might not have been
won by the Allied Powers had it nat been
for these United States pianeers.
We must not forget that Canada aiso has
had its pianeers. To my m.tnd, there has
neyer been a greater accompllshment than
the building of the Canadian Pacifie Railway,
for when that lime was put through there
were no bulldozers, no steamshovels or cranes
ta lift boulders and other obstacles out of the
way. One may truly say that the Rocky
Mountains were penetrated by pick and
shovel. I think we of this generatian should
be proud af the pioneers who accomplished
sa much.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: I arn pleased ta see
legisiation proposed ta amend the Railway
Act, and in this connection I shouid like ta
address a few remarks particularly ta the
western members of this chamber. On many
occasions, when reference has been made ta
the benefits extended ta the farmers of the
West by way of freight concessions, I have
had cast Up ta me the question: What about
the Maritime Freight Rates Act? Honourable
senators, are you aware that under that Act
the Maritimes received no great advantage?
Between the years 1912 and 1923 freight
rates in the Maritime provinces went Up te
92 per cent, while in the rest of Canada they
advanced by anly 54 per cent. The Maritime
Freight Rates Act, granting a reduction of
20 per cent to the Maritimes, was brought in
for the purpose of correctîng the disparity.
Therefore, it does not lie ia the mouths of
any people ta say that the Maritime Provinces
were greatly benefited by that Act, or that
they were favoured in amy way as distinguîshed from the rest of Canada.
I am pieased, as I have said, ta note that
this railway legisiation is ta came before us.'
I wouid certainly dislike ta have the measure,
as drafted, referred ta the tender mercies of
the Board of Transport Commissiomers. It is
apparent ta me that in mine out of ten
cases applications for increased compensation
referred ta boards, of whatsoever kind,

SENATE
throughout Canada, are invariably granted.
We have only to look at the rate increases
that have recently gone into effect on freight,
telegraphs, telephones, milk, and perhaps
other necessities. I cannot think that the
success of these applications has been due
entirely to the merits of the case. I am bound
to conclude that the heads of boards and of
large industrial enterprises all of whom are
able men, or they would not have attained
the heights they have-foregather where men
do congregate, in clubs and such places, and
become acquainted with the result that, when
an application for increased compensation by
the head of a large industrial enterprise comes
before the chief of the board, the chief corrugates his massive brow and says, "I think
we will grant the application".
Some Hon. Senalors: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: I may point out that
the bill to amend the Railway Act was intended not to benefit the railway operators, but
to give some advantage to the consumers or
to the people who use the railway facilities.
But what do we find has happened? No
sooner is the bill brought down than the
railways bring up their legal howitzers and
array them against the measure. Of course,
no one has anything to say on behalf of the
patrons, for whose benefit the measure was
introduced.
I turn next to the measure having to do
with resale price maintenance, which has
not yet beer considered by this house. That
measure also was not proposed for the benefit
of the manufacturer, the wholesaler or the
retailer, but of the consumer. Now we find the
manufacturers and other business interests
have their champions appearing on their
behalf. We have even had the "twins from
Toronto" (Hon. Mr. Hayden and Hon. Mr.
Campbell) speaking in this house on that
very measure. Of course they were against
it, and they gave their reasons for their stand.
Although they are a pretty able pair, after
reading their speeches one can punch a few
holes in them. One of the "twins" said this
measure was getting too much publicity in
the press, and that there was really nothing
to what it proposed. Well, if it is such an
insignificant measure, why are the manufacturers and wholesalers against it? Why do
they send us briefs? And let me tell you that
these briefs were not gotten up for a piece
of bread: no doubt about that.
One of the "twins" in the course of his
remarks on this bill goes on to say:
But usually articles subject to resale price maintenance provisions are branded articles, or carry a
trade naine, or are patented products.

He continues:
Let me ask: Even though in a given situation
there were only one product available, and the
public had to have it, how long would it be before

imitators entered the field and produced a similar
article at a lower price?

I think that if anybody began to imitate an
article on which someone else held a patent
he would soon find himself in difficulties with
the holder of the patent. Really the argument
answers itself. He says there would be an
imitator who would produce a similar article
which, not being subject to an agreed resale
price, could be sold at a lower rate. That
is what we want.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Surely.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: The honourable
gentleman stated that the courts of Great
Britain and the United States have ruled that
a manufacturer may legally fix the price at

which his product shall be resold. That
practice is legal in Canada, now. But if this
measure passes it will not continue to be
legal. So there is no point to the statement
that the courts have pronounced in favour of
resale price maintenance. My honourable
friend number one from Toronto said that
a person is not compelled to buy from a
retailer who has a fixed price; he can get a
similar article from another company. For
instance, his argument ran, if the General
Electric has a fixed price for an article I want
to buy, I am not compelled to purchase it
there; I can go to Westinghouse. But when
I go there I may find that they also have a
price maintenance system. I then go to a
third company who manufacture a similar
article, only to find that they too have a
maintenance resale price. What am I to do?
Either I shall have to buy from one of these
companies. or go without the article.
If I do not choose to buy from a retailer
who has a maintenance resale price, I must
not, it seems-for example-buy from Macy's,
who advertise an article called a "loss leader".
This device of loss leaders is, according to my
honourable friend, a horrible thing. People
who go in to buy the advertised article are
induced to buy other things for which they
pay an enhanced price. But I am not
compelled to buy from Macy's, either.
Then my honourable friend from Toronto
gave utterance to a phrase that raised the
hair of my head: he spoke of "that multiple
economic personality".

It reminded me of a

doctor down in Nova Scotia who was attending a patient. The next-door neighbour was
very curious to find out what was wrong
with her neighbour, so she met the doctor
and urged him to tell her. At last the doctor
said, "Dear madam, she has inflammation of

NOVEMBER 28. 1951
a sebaceous follicle of the perîcranium."l It
sounded very formidable, but ail it meant
was a simple inflammation of the root of one
hair. So my honourable friend's multiple
economie personality is really innocuous;
oertainly it is by no, means as formidable as
one might suppose it to be.
We heard a very good address from the
honourable senator f romn Bla-ck River, Southern New Brunswick (Hon. Mr. McLean). I
think there is very little that can be added
to what hie said about inflation.
An article which appeared in the Reader's
Digest for October is very weil worth reading.
It points out that, as of December 1939, the
people of the United States had $6 .4 billions
of "pocketbook money"; in 1951, 24.6 billions; in 1939, $29.8 billions, in 1951, $89-4
billions. The total money supply as of the
earlier period was $36- 2 billions; in Apnil this
year it was $114 billions. The writer remarks
that the production of goods and services has
not kept Up with the enormous increase of
money.
He continues:
Ini these ten years, U.S. industrial production of
goods. measured by actual tons, bushels, barrelsnot by price tags in dollars--increased only 99 per
cent.

Against this increase, the amount of money
possessed by the people had risen by 169
per cent.
I am thinking that after ail the Canadian
Minister of Finance was right when he made
the statement that there were too many
dollars floating around for the amount of
goods to be purchased. Some people said
that he had made an unfortunate mistake,
that there were some parts of the country
that would need a little more money than
they had. But 1 think hie was right according to this article and every article I have
had the pleasure of reading in connection
with inflation.
The writer of this article speaks about
controls. I myself was i favour of controls,
and I thought they were taken off too soon.
I heard an honourable gentleman from the
other side of the bouse, the late Senator
Ballantyne, make a speech in which he
advocated the removal of controls. 1I spoke
to, him in the hailway later, and I said: "Do
you really believe that removing controls
would be wise?" He replied, "Oh, yes, it
would be". He said: "The manufacturers
could produce more goods, and more goods
would be floating around". That argument
sounded good, but it did not work out. What
I thought would happen did happen. As
soon as controls were removed everybody
tried to reach as far as their arms would
stretch for ail the dollars they could get.

This writer in the Readers Digest says:
To think that price controls stop i.nflation is to
believe that you can cool a roomn or cure a lever
by puttlng ice next to the thermometer. There is
no case in history where prîce and wage controls
have stopped inflation for any length of time.

I arn becomiAng a littie reconciled now to
the removal of price controls. My honourable
friend-and I use the word 11friend" advisedly
-the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr.
Haig), said the following when taking part
in this debate:
Let us take the construction of a causeway to
bridge the straits of Canso. for rail and road traf1ic.
I do not thlnk the province of Manitoba is particularly interested in whether or flot those straits
are bridged; but I feel that in a country as large as
ours one section cannot say, because a certain
development will not help it. that it should not be
carried out."

This was very well said, but let me tel
honourable senators that there is a vast
difference between a project such as the St.
Lawrence Seaway Plan, which is certainly
calculated to injure the economy of a great
portion of this country, and a project such
as the construction of a causeway to bridge
the straits of Canso, which benefits a certain
region of the country and injures no other
part. In my opinion that is a perfect answer
to the remarks of my honourable friend on
that point.
The honourable senator frorn Kennebec
(Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt) once said in this
chamber that the brain is a wonderful mechanism, that it works from the time you are
born until the time you die, except when
you get up to make a speech.
Same Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: It is amazing how
a person may have a speech prepared in his
mind and what a mess he wiil make of it
when he is on his feet. I remember hearlng
a story one time about Lincoln, who on
coming home from a political meeting told
his wif e that he had made the best speech
in his if e. "Weil," she said, "Ithat's nice.
I{ow did the people like it?"1 He replied,
"They didn't hear a word of it. I made it
in the carniage on the way home".
Same Hon. Senalors: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: I should like to
,cail the attention of honourable senators to
another point, and I have some fatherlY
advice to give to the government about it.
During the forties speakers ail uver this
country used to talk about unity. I got sick
and tired of hearing the word unity, and I
always f elt that the subi ect of conscription
was being alluded to whenever the worci
unity was used. Recently I have corne tO.
the conclusion that people ought to preach
unity ail the time, because there is another

SENATE
potential question which to my mind could
create grave disunity in this country. Honourable senators may have observed in the
press lately that certain church organizations have been passing resolutions in anticipation of a certain event coming to pass. I
say that even should this event occur it
would neither add nor subtract one iota to
or from the status of any church. I say to
the government that it should not make the
appointment, because the disunity it would
cause would be more harmful to the state
than any advantage that would result. There
is one conclusion we can come to, and that
is that if we do not appoint an ambassador to
a certain state we are in this respect at
least equal to Moscow.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: Let me quote from
what was said right here on Parliament Hill
by that great Irish statesman, D'Arcy MacGee,
more than eighty years ago, while the Fenian
raids were going on. I believe it was on the
very night on which he afterwards was assassinated that, speaking on unity in Canada,
he uttered these words:

Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MacLennan: Now, honourable
senators, notwithstanding the luxuries that
we in Canada enjoy, it seems that we are
prone to grumble if things are not just to
our taste. Yet, we are living in the best
country in the world today. There is no doubt
at all in my mind about that. And this position has been achieved despite the heavy
drain on our national resources during the
biggest war in world history. Canada came
out of that war stronger and with more
prestige than when she went in. I do not wish
to imply that this was due to the policy of any
particular political party-to Liberal policy,
for instance, as distinguished from Conservative policy-but we do know that it was due
to the policy of able and honest men.
Let me now conclude by saying that we
ought to thank our Lord for the privilege of
living in this country, and at the same time
let us continue to "pass the ammunition."

Many of the young men here today will live to
see the proof of my words, that all other politics
that have been preached in British America will
grow old and lose their lustre, but the conciliation
of class and class-the policy of linking together
ail our peoples, the policy of linking order to order,
of smoothing down the sharp and wound-ing edges
of hostile prejudices-this policy will never grow
old, never will lose its lustre.

Hon. Mr. Paterson: Honourable members,
I move the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

CANADA-UNITED KINGDOM FINANCIAL
AGREEMENT BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Kinley presented the report of the

Standing Çommittee on Banking and Commerce on Bill 10, an Act to approve the
Financial Agreement between Canada and
the United Kingdom, signed on the twentyninth day of June, 1951.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant
as follows:
The Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, to whom was referred Bill 10, an Act to
approve the Financial Agreement between Canada
and the United Kingdom. signed on the twentyninth day of June, 1951, have in obedience to the
order of reference of November 27, 1951, examined
the said bill, and now beg leave to report the same
without any amendment.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: With leave, I move that
the bill be read the third time now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
OLD AGE SECURITY BILL
MOTION FOR THIRD READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved the third reading of Bill 13, an Act to provide for Old Age
Security.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators
the question is on the motion of the Honourable Senator RobertsonHon. Mr. Haig: Before the motion is put,
I want to ask the leader of the government
a question. The bill provides that a person
must be a resident of Canada for twenty
years. Are we sure that the Interpretation
Act provides that the people of Newfoundland can qualify under this old age security
measure?
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators, it
was not my-

Hon. Mr. Haig: Before the honourable
senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) proceeds, I should like an answer to
my question.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I would assume that
the residents of Newfoundland can qualify;
but as a layman I am not really in a position
to answer. This may be a pertinent question,
and I am quite willing to delay the third
reading of the bill until I can answer my
honourable friend opposite.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Perhaps my honourable
friend from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) could proceed, and when he has
finished I could move the adjournment of
the debate, not with the intention of speaking
to the bill, but for the purpose of giving the
honourable leader of the government (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) an opportunity to furnish the
information I want.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, it was
not my intention to address the house on the
third reading of this bill, but after listening
to certain remarks made by the honourable
leader of the government, which I thought
were a little severe, I felt I must do so.
The honourable leader said that I had
rather taken him to task for his having
echoed a remark made in the other house
by the Minister of National Health and Welfare. I want the honourable leader to accept
my word that I had no intention of taking
anyone to task. I did comment on the
statement he made, and I stand by it, for
he did repeat a remark of the honourable
Minister of National Health and Welfare-for
whom I have great regard-when he pointed
out in his speech that this legislation was
part of the answer to communism. May I
point out to the honourable leader that he
rather corrected himself when he reminded
us that in 1945 the dominion government proposed this type of legislation to the various
provinces; and honourable senators must
remember that this was before we thought
of the menace of communism emanating from
the Soviet Union. This showed that the
dominion government felt in 1945 that this
great country of ours should keep on the
onward path of social welfare legislation by
increasing the amount of old age pensions.
The thought I had in mind when I said I did
not like the statement in question was that
many Canadians would say the government
was being prodded on by fear of Soviet Russia, and I would not like that idea to go
out to any great portion of our people.
I want to see this measure placed before
the people of Canada in line with events
of today, and in line with the national income
and the resourcefulness of the people of this

SENATE
country, and as an indication of the desire
that exists in this country to help those
who are unable to help
unfortunates
themselves.
On the point of whether or not this
measure will be an answer to communism, I
know there are people who will differ with
me in what I am going to say. I believe
that it will not be a complete answer to cornmunism, and I am going to try to show why
I hold that view. There is no better country
on earth than Canada, there is no other country that has done as much for its people or
that offers them greater opportunities for
getting ahead and living a good and free
life. But does that prevent many here from
being favourably inclined towards communism and the Soviet Union? I am unable
to give the house exact figures of the number
of Canadians who are favourable to the Soviet
Union, for it is difficult indeed to get those
figures, but I do know that when a meeting
is addressed by any member of the group
sympathetic with Russia, the hall is usually
packed, and that is true all the way from
Montreal to British Columbia. I know certain professors who, with all that life in
Canada or the good Lord could give them
and who hold good positions in our colleges
and universities, do not mind adrnitting, if
you get talking to them quietly, that they
admire the Soviets and think they have a
splendid system. I am perturbed at that,
because to me it is unthinkable that anyone
in this country, with its freedom and all the
other advantages it offers, would take that
point of view. Yet, there it is, and there is
no use our denying it. So I deprecate the
position taken by some people that this old
age security measure will be an answer to
Sovietism or communism so-called.
As we know, honourable senators, human
nature is a strange thing. People do not
always act in the way that we think they
should, and especially people to whom we
have handed out or given something. I do
not know of any nation other than Russia, that
at the present time is more ýdisliked than the
United States. Yet will anyone say that the
people of that great country have not been
very generous in giving of their wealth and
substance to aid almost every other country?
That of course cannot be denied, but it is a
well-known characteristic of human nature
that many people do not like to be given
what might be called charity. I for one, do
not believe that the people of Colombo, India
and other countries will envy Canada, which
has given them wheat and other goods, and
think that Canada must be a wonderful land,
or that they will adopt our way of life.

If our social legislation is regarded as
something that will stem the flow of communism, and, as some believe, people abroad
consider that the citizens of Canada have
great oportunities and are being well taken
care of, why is it that immigrants, especially
from Great Britain, are largely at present
passing up this country? I know the statement has been made that it is because of
the lack of dollars in Britain, or the restrictions imposed by the British government on
sterling, that we are not attracting more
British citizens. I hold in my hand the
latest figures on immigration, and they are
startling to me because they show that we
are not attracting from Britain in any great
numbers the labour, the skilled labour, which
we need. According to recent figures, of a
total of 130,238 emigrants from Great
Britain during the past year, only 13,434
came to Canada. Before those figures came
to my attention I thought that perhaps lack
of ships, or money regulations in Great
Britain, interfered with emigration to Canada.
But I have now learned that of the total
number of British emigrants, to which I
have just referred, 47,019 went to Australia
and 7,472 to New Zealand. In other words,
while 112,934 went to the commonwealth
countries, as I have said, Canada's share
was only 13,434. I went a step further in
my research and I learned that Canada lost
6,970 persons to the United States. Taking
into account the 13,000 odd that came from
Great Britain, Canada's net gain was 6,464
persons.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Does my friend mean that
of the total of 13,000 immigrants who came
to Canada 6,000 odd went to the United States,
or that Canada lost that many Canadians to
the United States?
Hon. Mr. Reid: It would be difficult to say
where that group of 6,970 originally came
from, but that number of persons left Canada
for the United States.
Hon. Mr. Euler: But they were not necessarily members of the group of 13,000 who
came from Great Britain.
Hon. Mr. Reid: No, not necessarily part of
the 13,000. I am merely pointing out that
Canada's share of the emigration from Great
Britain to commonwealth countries should
give us cause for thought.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: Can the honourable
senator give us the number of immigrants
who came to Canada from the United States
during the same period?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I have not that information
before me, but I shall get it and give it to

NOVEMBER 29, 1951
my friend. It would be interesting to know
how many citizens of the United States came
here, and what the true net picture is.
I have placed these figures before the
Senate in an endeavour to show that, although
we think we are doing many things-particularly in social welfare-which should attract
immigrants to this country, the results are
not very encouraging.
When one looks behind the scenes in Canada, one finds that in spite of ail the splendid
conditions and advantages of freedom there
are still people here, and in numbers who
favour Soviet Russia. I repeat, I cannot understand why anyone who enjoys all the freedom
that this country offers should support a
political regime such as Russia has today.
It is not so long since personnel of the National
Film Board were subjected to criticisn and
men in -the services and in various departments of government were accused of favouring Soviet Russia, and the latest investigations
show that some of these men have been under
suspicion for a considerable time.
The government leader rather took issue
with my statement that thrift is outmoded.
Well, I am not apologizing for that statement,
nor am I going to withdraw it. My opinion
can be taken, of course, as my own, but the
figures on annuities quoted by the leader and
placed on Hansard have not in any way
changed my belief that the old concept of
thrift is out of date. The statistics presented
by the leader do not reveal or give the
entire picture. Back in 1908, when the
federal annuity system was introduced,
nobody thought in terms of old age pensions
to be provided by the government. Such
an idea in those days would have been
regarded as rank heresy. I should like to
remind honourable senators that the first
province to take advantage of the Old Age
Pension Act was British Columbia. Let me
recall, for the information of the honourable
leader, a conversation in which I took part
in the year 1943-and he will have to take
my word for its accuracy.
I remember,
at an advisory meeting of the National Liberal
party in the Chateau Laurier, that we were
surrounded by three premiers of the Maritime
Provinces, nanely Premiers MacMillan, MacNair and Jones, and our group from British
Columbia was reproached by them for our
stand on this matter. They said: "Why are
you fellows advocating the giving of more
money to needy people? Do you want to
It took a
make the wealthy less rich?"
tremendous amount of argument on the part
of our delegation to pacify those three gentlemen. Since then they have corne along, and
I am glad to know that now they are in step
with us. But some provinces and some persons

have to take the lead; and I am now predicting that ultimately, as far as universal pensions are concerned, we shall do away with
the means test for applicants between the ages
of sixty-five and seventy. I hope the change
will not be delayed too long, and that when
it comes the pension will be on a contributory
basis, so that each and every one will pay
his share and retain some of his independence.
Before turning to another phase of this
subject, let me point out to honourable senators, and for the special benefit of our leader,
that 50 per cent of al government annuities
today are associated with companies who have
placed their employees under group pension
plans. Looking back over the reports one
may see the rapid increase of annuities due
to this since statutory provision was made
for then in 1908. At that time it did not
cost much to live, and the wages of many
a man were no more than twenty cents an
hour. The purpose of the Act was to encourage
the small earner to lay something by for
his old age.
Latterly the number of contracts has very
greatly increased. From 1908 to 1933 only
about 16,000 were taken out. In the five
years next following the number increased
to 26,000; five years later, to 47,000. At this
point a great advance was made: in five years
the numbers had jumped to 145,000. But let me
repeat that the cause is not to be found so
much in individual purchases as in the activities of companies who approached their men
and placed before them group pension plans.
In 1949 the number of annuities purchased
was 36,000; in 1950, 21,000; in 1951, 22,000.
A short time ago I put questions on the Order
Paper with regard to annuities; I asked for
information covering particular months. I
had an object in doing so. The return confirmed the thought I had had in my mind,
namely that as soon as the government's
decision to enact a universal pension for all
over seventy was announced, the number of
applications for annuities would drop. It is
all very well for the leader of the opposition
to talk about what a man of sixty-five has to
pay for an annuity.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I did not speak at all.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I meant the leader of the
government (Hon. Mr. Robertson). But if anyone had the amount of money which the
leader of the government tells us is required
for this purpose, he perhaps would not buy
an annuity at all. At any rate, I am sure that
most men would hesitate to pay out $30,000
in cash at the age of sixty-five to provide an
additional annuity for himself and his wife
at seventy. There was a time when people
with some means were investing in annuities,
but to me it is significant that in every office,
as soon as it was announced that a universal

SENATE

old age pension system would be instituted
on December 1, the number of applications
dropped. The announcement was made in
June last; and comparing the months of July,
August and September 1951 with the equivalent period of last year, applications have
fallen from 1,118 to 883. What I wish to
emphasize is that statisties as to the purchase
of annuities are today no evidence of voluntary thrift, because to the extent of at least
50 per cent the annuities purchased are the
outcome of schemes organized and promoted
by companies for their employees.
The honourable government leader also
mentioned the number of income tax payers.
I should like to present a few more figures
which I obtained the other day, as to the
number of persons in this country who are
earning less than $1,500 per annum, and the
number whose earnings are below $1,000 a
year. Most of these people are in their full
strength, and must be giving some thought to
what will become of them in their old age.
Last year there were 1,933,700 persons earning less than $1,500, and 1,110,150 with
incomes of less than $1,000. Will any honourable senator venture to tell us that a person
who is earning only $990 or less, or even one
whose earnings are $1,490 or less, can make
any provision for his old age? I do not think
he can; and so I make no apology for having
risen the other day to speak on behalf of
the very needy, because nearly two million
of our fellow citizens will need help when
they reach the age of sixty-five.
I would have liked to see us copy from
the British system a provision affecting retirement at sixty-five. The British government
has provided that if a person continues to
work until he is seventy his pension then will
be greater than if he had retired at sixtyfive. It was realized, no doubt, that if everyone retired at sixty-five the state would soon
be burdened with the maintenance of great
masses of ageing people who for the most
part would have no employment at all. I
should not like to see the waste of good
labour that would result from millions cf
our people being retired at the age of sixtyfive, with nothing to do. I am one of those
who have stated publicly, privately and boldly
at meetings that the unions themselves have
led the working people of this country up a
wrong channel by advocating retirement at
sixty-five, and there are very few who ever
make provision for another source of
endeavour or even for participation in a
hobby when they retire. Generally speakingand the doctors can correct me if I am wrong
-the death sentence is pronounced on people
when they retire at the age of sixty-five and
have nothing to do. The insurance companies
claim that three and a half years is about

the average length of life left for those who
retire with no purpose in mind or nothing
to do.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Quite right.
Hon. Mr. Reid: This honourable body itself
presents one of the finest illustrations of what
security and an interest in life can do to
produce greater longevity. The Senate presents an opportunity for each and every one of
us to take an active part in the welfare and
affairs of our people. But things are different
for those in the very ordinary walks of life
when they are suddenly retired at the age of
sixty-five with nothing to do. When men
and women are retired at the age of sixtyfive much valuable experience is thrown in
the discard. It is for this reason that I have
long advocated, and will continue to advocate
that the British system has some merit. It
encourages men and women, if able, to carry
on past the age of sixty-five, and as a result
of a longer work period their pensions become
greater and they feel happier.
Honourable senators, I shall not delay you
much longer. I just wanted to explain what
I had in mind when I said I would rather not
have heard the statement that this legislation
was being introduced to try to offset communism. I am all in favour of universal pensions,
on a contributory basis, of course, and I am in
favour of the bill now before us. Canada is
a rich country. There are poorer countries
with greater social welfare plans than we
have, but that is their business.
The honourable leader of the government
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) made no mention of the
$600 million surplus or of the fact that the
dollar is worth only 40 cents. I know plenty
of people who are finding it extremely difficult to make ends meet. Let us take as a
base the year 1928, when the old age pension
legislation was first put on the statute books,
and when it was suggested that the pension
be $20 a month. If you take $1 as the average
hourly wage paid in Canada to our workers
in 1928, you will find that in 1941 the average
wage was $1.16, by 1950 to $2.21, and by 1951,
to $2.31.
These rates apply clear across
Canada to those employed as artisans and
labourers.
I think I know one of the questions troubling the government. They foresee an age
increase among our people in the years to
come, and they are perhaps thinking of the
national income. They are wondering whether
it will always remain as high as it is now.
Once you set a sum like $40 for pensions and
provide for family allowances and pensions
for war veterans, there is no going back; and
all these moneys must be secured by taxation.
I would point out, however, that there are
many places where the government could

NOVEMBER 29, 1951
cut down in its spending, and I hope I shall
have an opportunity to say something about
this before the end of this session of parliament. I realize that what we are doing for
our aged, our children and our veterans is
something of which each and every one of us
can feel justly proud; but in my opinion the
government is on a spending spree the like of
which has never been known.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Some of us are becoming
alarmed at the way some government departments are spending money. Legislation is to
come before us which, if passed, would
authorize the spending of an additional $6
millions by the C.B.C. I shall wait until that
bill comes before us, however, before I make
my remarks about the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. I merely rose this afternoon
to assure the leader of the government (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) that in what I said on the
second reading of this bill I had no intention
of taking anybody to task. My thought was
that the government should come boldly forward and declare that in Canada, one of the
richest countries in the world, we would take
care of our needy citizens by distributing
part at least of our wealth rather than that
this legislation was being introduced because
of any fear of Sçviet communism.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. J. J. Kinley: Honourable senators, I
was rather interested in the thought
expressed by my honourable friend from
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) that the
old virtue of saving was outmoded in this
country. It is my opinion that this is not the
case. Statisties show that Canada's industries are producing more than ever before,
and that Canadians are saving more than
they ever did. Our people have responded
beyond all expectations to the call for the
universal purchase of Victory bonds; savings
in the commercial and savings banks are
increasing; many Canadian industries have
a savings or pension plan to provide old age
security for their workers, and life insurance
-a splendid way to save-is piling up. In
the light of all these facts it can hardly be
said that Canadians have forgotten the virtue
of saving. Judging by achievement and
results, I am not so sure that the people of
Canada are not working harder than they
ever did before. It may be that as we grow
older we get away a little from what is really
going on, but as I travel through the country
it is my privilege at times to visit highly
organized industrial plants; and when one
sees the modern machinery and equipment
in the production lines of these plants turning out goods at a phenomenal rate it is not

difficult for one to appreciate that Canada's
production is greater than ever before. In
the last few years some men employed in
the industrial concern in which I am
interested have not only worked eight hours
a day in the factory but afterwards have
worked far into the night building homes
for themselves. In that way they have
acquired properties of a value beyond what
they otherwise could have afforded. And
I think the same kind of thing has been going
on all over the country.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: May I ask the honourable
gentleman a question on the subject of production? What about the production of wool,
of butter and of milk in this .ountry? I
suggest that it is less than it was when the
population was only half of what it is today.
Hon. Mr. Kinley:. I do not agree with
that. While production for consumption is
perhaps below what we need today, largely
because of our high purchasing power, I
believe figures will show that it is not less
than it was years ago. What has happened,
it seems to me, is that men, by taking advantage of modern machinery and other scientific developments, have been able to produce
more while working fewer hours. The day
of main strength and stupidity has gone, and
labour today is more skilled and intelligent.
I am amazed, as I think many of us are,
when I look around and see what is going
on in our ordinary every day life. Airplanes,
for example, are travelling at 500 miles an
hour. I can board a plane early in the day
in Canada and have dinner the same night
in Europe. This kind of thing has not come
about by accident. The employment of men
and women in the air forces of all modern
countries is hazardous. It used to be considered quite a thing for a man to parachute
from a plane, but today women in the nursing
services are doing it.
Our fishermen and farmers are producing
more. The intelligent use of machinery has
brought about a big advance. It is a good
thing for us to give a little thought to these
matters when we are inclined to feel that
people do not work so hard today as our
forefathers did.
And sometimes it is good for us to examine
ourselves. I recall that in the course of a
lawsuit in Nova Scotia counsel was having
trouble with a witness, and finally the situation became so difficult that the judge said
to the lawyer, "Do you insinuate that the
witness is drunk?" The lawyer replied: "No,
my Lord. He might retaliate."
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, I rise
to a point of order. The honourable gentleman is saying or implying that I said our
people are not working as hard today as

SENATE
they used to. I said no such thing, and I do
not want my remarks to be construed in that
way. The record of what I said stands.
The Hon. the Speaker: On the point of
order that has been raised by the honourable
gentleman from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid), I presume that in making his statement
he has satisfied his purpose.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I am sorry that I cannot
hear His Honour the Speaker. All that I
wished to say as to my honourable friend
from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) was,
that I do not agree with his view that the
cardinal virtue of saving is outmoded. And
I was going on to point out that the oldfashioned virtue of work has not been destroyed, that our people are still accomplishing great things.
Those of us who have had experience
realize that a great deal depends on good
leadership and intelligent effort. For instance,
in a plant, production will be much more
efficient if you have intelligent foremen who
lay out the work properly and capably superintends the men under them. Similarly, in
a school, if you have a good teacher who
keeps the pupils working and incites them
to do their best, the general work of the
scholars will be high. Anyone who teaches
the young people of this country how to
work most effectively is performing a really
great service. And a man whose boss instils
into him the habit of hard work is lucky.
I discovered that in my own younger days,
and since then I have observed that employees who have been trained by good teachers
and bosses have learned lessons that stand
them well.
We hear a lot of talk today about the fiveday week. Many people are in favour of it,
and some are opposed. To my mind, the fiveday week is another sign that people are
working more effectively; able to do more in
less time than formerly. If the great banking
institutions of this country can carry on their
enormous business in a five-day week, is
that not a splendid thing? And if the bank
employees are able to accomplish in five days
what it used to take them six days to do,
is that not evidence that they are working
harder, or at least more effectively?
Hon. Mr. Duff: What does the Bible say?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: "Six days shalt thou
labour, and do all thy work."

can interest himself in the cultivation of
those things that are artistic and beautiful,
and in this way help to adorn life.
And what about our women? The average housewife's duties are never done. Her
husband may get a five-day week, but she
has to keep going every day. It might be
a good thing if, for at least one day a week,
a husband went home and did some housework, so that his wife coud have a little free
time in which to relax.
The point that has occurred to me is that
after all the improved methods of production
that have been developed in Canada and other
countries, it should be possible now to carry
on business in a five-day week.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Why not make it four days?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Well, some people still
think everybody should work six days.
Hon. Mr. Duff: The Bible says we should
work six days.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Why not quit work
altogether?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Some people, as we know,
are obliged by their occupations to work
every day of the week, but it seems to me
that it would be well for the country if everyone could have at least one day out of every
seven free for recreation and other purposes;
and it would be an especially good thing if
more people were free to observe the sabbath
properly.
My main purpose in rising was to express
the belief that people in general still possess
the virtues of knowing how to work and save,
and that so long as this remains true, and
merit is rewarded by advancement, we shall
have a healthy economy in this country. We
could not have that under socialization, for
that is an enervating system which represses
incentive and stifles ambition.
I was much interested in the opinion
expressed by at least one senator that millionaires should not be paid the pension of $40
a month. There are two reasons why, it
seems to me, it is a good thing that the pension is payable to everyone over 70. In the
first place, it is payable as a matter of right,
not as charity, and therefore it should go to
all. Furthermore, I believe that the organization and administration of the scheme will
be greatly simplified by the fact that all
people over 70 are beneficiaries. As we know,
Hon. Mr. Duff: Yes, that is it.
a person's economic status might change
Hon. Mr. Kinley: It does not say though, quickly. That kind of thing does happen, in
that you must work for wages six days a this country and elsewhere; a man who earns
week. A man can work at other things a lot this year may not do so well next year,
besides earning a living. For instance, he and vice versa.

NOVEMBER 29, 1951
Another senator said that the rich man will
not get much out of the pension, in any event.
With that I agree. If he is in the so-called 50
per cent class, half of his income goes to pay
his tax; and he must also pay up to $60 under
the 2 per cent feature. His contribution under
the sales tax, if he is a high salaried man,
would be high, for he would spend a large
amount on consumable goods. Such a person
gets nothing out of the pension. The argument that the pension is for the rich demonstrates, to my way of thinking, a lack of
appreciation of conditions and how our institutions are maintained. The payment of the
pensions to everyone at a certain age removes
any element of charity or privilege. Certainly
it will go to those who need it most.
I do not like to appear to lecture on this
subject, but I think we should from time to
time look closely at ourselves and what we
are doing. The honourable senator from
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) dealt with
saving, not with work; but in the old axiom
"Work and save", the two are closely related.
It is a well-known fact that in spite of their
shorter hours and higher wages the people
of this country are today working as they
never worked before.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: God bless them.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: It is a perfectly legitimate
ambition for a man to want to improve his
position and try to have as much leisure as
is good for himself, his family and the
community.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

that could be milked, fed and watered on a
five-day-week basis, then he might have
something. Certainly there is no incentive
today for our young people to be thrifty,
endure hardship and remain on the farm to
work seven days a week. We frequently read
of fatal accidents on our highways being
caused by young people who have not the
sense to drive carefully. They would be
much wiser if they saved the money they
now spend on cars and used it for their own
security in old age. If the many unhappy
situations in which young people find themselves today are evidence of advancement in
this country, then I say we are in for a sorry
time.
If one goes to any pleasure resort today, a
dog race or a horse race, he finds large
crowds of people. I do not begrudge them
their pleasure, but there is another side of
the picture. Today we are raising fewer
sheep in this country than were raised when
Canada's population was only 7 million. What
is the result? We are obliged to import wool
to manufacture our own clothing. At least
we can say for our grandmother that she
raised the sheep, spun the wool and made
the clothing her family required. Further,
we are told that Canada is today producing
about half the quantity of milk she produced
when her population was half of what it is
now. Many parts of the world, we are told,
are today short of fats, and we have been
warned that our share must be small; yet
we import 100 million pounds of margarine,
a mixture which, contains only a small
amount of milk for flavouring. In spite of
all evidence to the contrary, my friend has
the audacity to say that today, in a five-day
week and an eight-hour day, the young
people in this country are working harder
I am
than they ever worked before.
absolutely incapable of understanding his
theory in that respect.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I move that the debate be
adjourned.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.

Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
I did not intend to say anything in this
debate, but I just cannot let the remarks of
the senator from Lunenburg (Hon. Mr.
Kinley) go unchallenged.
As a family man, I have been concerned
with teaching my children how to work, and
I certainly agree with the senator from New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) that we have
lost a good deal of the incentive for thrift.
If the argument of the senator from Lunenburg is sound, that we are doing more work
on an eight-hour-day and a five-day-week
basis, then why not reduce the working day

flying over them.
Hon. Norman McL. Paterson: Honourable
There is a further complication in this senators, I wish to associate myself with those
matter of shorter working hours. If my speakers who have expressed congratulations
friend from Lunenburg could develop a cow to the mover (Hon. Mr. Vien) and the

SENATE
seconder (Hon. Mr. Wood) of the Address in
Reply to the Speech from the Throne. I wish
particularly to express my feelings of pleasure
at the recovery of His Majesty, and the successful and happy trip of Her Royal Highness
Princess Elizabeth and her consort. I had no
idea that the visit of the princess would be
of so much interest to the people of Canada,
or to the people of the United States. I
received a letter from a doctor in Baltimore,
with whom I was corresponding on medical
matters, to which was added this post-script:
"I hope you are enjoying the visit of the
princess". I did not know the doctor was
aware that the princess was visiting Canada.
I should like to put on the record a little
sentiment expressed in a country newspaper,
as to the value of the Royal Family to
Canada. This is the article:
The contribution of the Throne of Great Britain
as a living symbol of the best in the traditions and
life of the peoples of the Commonwealth is incalculable.
United States visitors, who do not understand
that the Royal Family of Great Britain' is also the
Royal Family of Canada, often question Canadiens
regarding the cost to Canada of the Throne of
Great Britain.
They cannot understand that the priceless contribution of the King of Canada to the maintenance
of the standards of parliamentary and public life
of the countries of the commonwealth is borne by
the people of Great Britain; that the only cost in
money to us is that of the office of GovernorGeneral of Canada.
The money cost of the
monarchy is insignificant in relation to the constructive contribution of the institution to the
standards of law and justice.

I think that is a very apt tribute.
I should like to take the liberty at this
time of following up the very able address by
the senator from the garden of Canada, Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine). I feel that it would
be of interest to members of this Upper
Chamber if I went into a few details regarding the grain problem.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: From the grain handlers'
viewpoint, each crop is different. Weather
conditions affecting moisture, smut, rust, sawfly, grasshoppers, etc., as well as the time of
planting and harvesting and the condition of
weather in harvesting, all have their effect.
As the owner of a terminal elevator in Fort
William in 1911, it became necessary for me
to get feeders to gather grain in the west, to
ship to the terminal and keep it busy. The
first elevators were bought at a cost of
approximately $5,000 each and held about
25,000 bushels.
Grain came in drawn by horses, and was in
bags. These the farmer untied, emptied
through a grating in the floor of the drive-shed
at the side of the elevator away from the railway tracks. The belt and buckets, driven
first by a horse; then as advances were made

by a gasoline engine, elevated the grain to a
hopper about fifty bushels at a time, which in
1911 was a wagon-load. In those days the
farmer with a helper would cut his grain with
a binder, pile the sheaves into stooks, pile the
stooks into stacks and, while waiting for the
custom threshing outfits, would get his fall
plowing done. Meantime, his grain sweated
and matured.
The contrast with today is very marked.
Today, the farmer's wife does not have to
slave over a stove, cooking for a threshing
crew, sometimes for days while waiting for
better weather. Today almost every farmer
bas a combine. Five years ago, the combine
cut and threshed the grain into a box carried
on the machine, which stopped and dumped
it into a wagon or truck. While it was being
driven to the elevator at the nearest station
or siding, he went on till his box filled again;
but the trouble there was that the low spots
in the field were green and the green kernels
lowered the grade of the ripe grain. So the
method was changed to what is called swathing: a ten or twelve foot swath is cut, laying
the grain in one direction on the stubble,
where it ripens and matures. It is ripe to
start with, but it really matures in the swath.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: It is quite frequently cut
on the green side.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: Then the self-driven or
tractor-driven combine picks it up, threshes
it, throws the straw back, to be plowed under
or burned later, and the grain goes into a box
on the combine, where it is dumped into a
truck driven by a contractor farmer or one of
the farmer's family.
As speed is very essential, in order to
keep the combine clear, the elevator must
be fast at unloading. All this cutting and
combining is done by the farmer, often with
only the help of a teen-age daughter. The
speed in harvesting and the few hands
required has altered the whole method, so
that instead of elevators and railways having
a whole fall and winter to market the
crop, the bulk of the grain is delivered in a
few short weeks, putting a tremendous burden on the grain handling facilities and
personnel. That is, of course, when the
weather is fair. But for two years now the
weather has not been favourable for
harvesting.
A word now about the change in method.
In 1911 railway cars held approximately
60,000 pounds: the bulk of them were 56,000pound cars. Today, all new cars are built
to carry 120,000 pounds, and rails are heavier,
engines are bigger and trains are longer. It
bas been necessary to rebuild the older elevators, putting in 16-foot dump scales, which
tilt up the trucks, handling up to 500 bushels

NOVEMBER 29, 1951
per load. This grain is weighed first in the
truck; then the truck is weighed light. A
ticket or receipt is given to the driver, and
away he goes for another load. The grain,
meantime, is going up in buckets to a head
pulley, where it fails clear and is directed
by a spout to the desîred bin, the spout
being moved by the buyer or operator to the
bin from the drive-shed,.
The up-to-date elevators hold 60,000 bushels, contain fifteen to twenty bins, and if the
variety of grain is great the operator puts
each variety in a separate bin so that the
elevator is plugged up before it is filled
because there is no empty bin for a different
grade from that already taken in. The elevators are operated by electric motors wherever
current is available, and otherwise by semidiesel engines. Ail elevators are equipped
with air pumps to provide the air required
to dump the trucks, and air hose to give tireair, as a convenience to the customners. The
cost of a 60,000-bushel elevator, equipped
with up-to-date scales, cleaner, etce., runs
about $42,000, and to pay expenses each should
handie over a hundred thousand bushels.
The government fixed price to the farmer
has taken away a lot of the element of risk,
but operators still run the risk of giving
a farmer a receipt for 1, 2 or 3 Northern as
the case may be, and having the grain turn
out to be of a poorer grade. A loss also
frequently occurs when the buyer misjudges
the amount of weed seeda and takes off say
2 per cent, when actually the grain contains
3 or 4 per cent.
The crop of 1950-51 was a disastrous one
for most of us, as -the moisture content was
something new to most buyers. It was fifteen
years since we had had to contend with excess
moisture to any extent, and in that time,
we did not use our driers at -the terminal,
but today they are running night and day.
The crop came in, as I pointed out, so fast
that the buyer had no time to test by the
old-fashioned method, and before we knew
it our elevators were filled with grain containing -excess moisture, and for which a
straight grade receipt had been given.
This year a new tester with a storage
battery is available, and it gives the moisture content instantaneously. Straight grade
wheat will take 14J per cent moisture; over
that it grades tough up Vo 17 per cent and
is discounted 4 cents per bushel; over 17
per cent it is graded damp and is dîscounted
16 cents. On oats, tough may have up to
17 per cent moisture, and is discounted 4
cents; damp is over 17 per cent moisture,
and is discounted 9 cents per bushel. I have
not burdened you wîth the figures for barley,
flax and rye.

Today's methods of drying grain are scientifie and are closely supervised by the
Dominion Govermnent Inspection Department of the Board of Grain Commissioners
and by the board's chief chemist in his
laborabory at Winnipeg. To start with, the
maximum heat for each kind of grain has
a set limit. For wheat, oats, barley, rye,
corn and flax it is 180 degrees Fahrenheit;
for malting barley, 110 degree Fahrenheit.
Any higher temperature would spoil the
germinating qualities. The heat at the drier
is thermostatically controlled and automatically recorded on an electric recording
thermometer. The baking tests before and
after drying, of course, are the tests that
keep milling wheat up to the Board of Grain
Commissioner's standards of quality grade for
grade, and this in turn protects the certificate
finaliy in the markets of the world.
It will be appreciated what this supervision means to our world reputation for
high grade when I tell you that 85 per cent
of the grain now coming in is tough or damp.
The laboratory, in its final inspection after
drying, does not make a dried grade as
formnerly. If wheat has suffered injury or
lost some of its baking quality in the drying,
it is diropped down to the rnilling standard
*of a lower grade. Our people refer to this
crop as a "heartbreak crop".
There are 719 elevators in Manitoba with
a capacity of 43,987,000 bushels if ail grades

elevators and a capacity of 161,146,000
bushels. Alberta has 1,539 elevators with a
capacty of 110,240,000 bushels if ail grades
were the sanie.
The total amount of grain dried-wheat,
oats, barley, fiax and rye-in the last crop,
1950-51, was 46,584,000 bushels. The total
drying capacity, as given out by statistics
from and including Fort William/Port
Arthur to Vancouver and Victoria is 967,000
bushels in twenty hours. But a word of
explanation. Heat controls are government
supervised, and resuits after drying are
closely scrutinized. In other words, wheat
containing 151 per cent moisture upon being
dried down to 14 per cent will run through
a drier at or near full capacity, but the
higher the moisture content of the grain
the sluower the rate becomes, so that the
figures I have given of capacity are purely
figures.
Milling grades of wheat are 1 Hard, One
Northern, Two Northern, Three Northern
and Four Northern. No. 5, No. 6 and Feed
Wheat are used as feed.
An encouraging feature may be mentioned
here. There is a saying, "What is one man's
meat is another man's poison." So we find

SENATE
that the great republic to the south of us has
had a decrease of 43 million bushels in its
corn crop from that of 1950, and what it
does have is of somewhat inferior feeding
quality because of moisture and frost in
September. Then, again, the United States
finds a 5 per cent increase in its hog population, while its poultry supply is 16 per cent
greater, and its cattle stock is on a par with
what it was in 1950. We have been advised
that the United States will be in the market
a little later on for 100 million bushels of our
low-grade wheat. The intimation of this market is welcome news, inasmuch as we have
a carry-over of 100 million bushels from our
last crop, and a similar carry-over from this
crop.
As the season of navigation is almost closed,
a few figures on the amount of grain that has
been shipped out of the head of the lakes is
interesting. Lake shipments of Canadian
grain from the opening of navigation to
November 15 of this year amounted to 260
million bushels, compared with 163 million
bushels for approximately the same period
last year. In other words, we have actually
shipped 100 million more bushels of grain
this year than we did last year.
With the new speedy methods of harvesting
and hauling grain to the local elevator, and
because of the prospects of increased production, I suggest that the capacity of railroads
and elevators will never again be adequate
to take deliveries as offered. The only solution is for the farmer to go back to his old

method of storing his grain on the farm
until facilities catch up and his grain can be
taken in without delay.
In conclusion I wish to make a brief reference to the St. Lawrence Seaway. I should
like honourable senators to listen to these
figures very carefully. In 1950, 9,679,000
tons, or 97 -1 per cent of the freight transported through the St. Lawrence canals, was
carried in Canadian vessels.
To the best of my knowledge not a single
vessel owner has been given a hearing or
consideration regarding the proposed expenditure on this huge project, and I want to
warn this bouse that if it is to be paid for
out of tolls, the farmers of Western Canada
will pay the bulk of it because a toll must be
added to the freight charges, and grain passing down the St. Lawrence for export must
pay the toll.

BUSINESS 0F THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I wouhd ask the bouse to -consider adopting
the following procedure for this evening's
sitting. In a moment or two His Honour
the Speaker will present six new bis that
have corne to us for consideration from the
House of Comrnons. Three of these bis
arise out of the report -of the Royal Commission on Transportation, and if it is agreeable to bonourable senators these bills,
togetber with one relating to the CanadaUnited States tax convention, will be read
a second time tomorrow. I would ask that
two other bis, one dealing witb an amendment to the Judges Act, and one dealing
with an amendment to the Pensions Act, be
piaced at the foot -of today's Order Paper,
for second reading when the order for the
third reading of the Old Age Security bill
bas been disposed of.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourabie senators, I can
see no objection to what has been suggested
by the leader of the governrnent. I sbouhd
like to add to it a further suggestion, that
when we corne to the motions for second
readings of the railway bis, we do not go
into the merits or dernerits of those bills at
that time. I say that because in the Transport and Commrunications Comrnittee there
bas been a violent difference of opinion as
to what should or should not be done with
certain parts of the proposed bis. As
bonourable members know, tbe bis whicb
the comrnittee bas been considering are in
the forra in wbicb they were introduced in
the other bouse, but I understand tbat a
number of amendments bave since been
made.
At tbis time I shouhd like to ask bonourable senators from Ontario and Quebec wbo
are members of the Transport and Communications Comrnittee if tbey would kjndly
attend its meetings.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Those of us wbo corne f rom
the western and eastern parts of tbe country
bave been very faitbfui in attendance at tbe
committee. Representations have been made

on behaif of western provinces and of eastern provinces by able counsel, but notbing
bas been said on behaif of either Ontario or
Quebec. In fact, for ail that we have beard
to the contrary before the committee, there
would hardly seem to be any such provinces
as Ontario and Quebec. I arn not saying that
by way of criticism, but simply to emphasize
my invitation to seniators from those provinces to attend future meetings of the committee. We young f ellows from the west and
the east are not very well trained, and we
sbould like the leading ligbts of central
Canada to corne and give us a hand in carrying on the committee's work.

PEST CONTROL PRODUCTS
ORDER FOR RETURN

Hon. Mr. McDonald inquired of the government:
What were the quantities and values of the most
effective insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, and
other pest control products most generally used in
Canada that were:
(a) manufactured in Canada
(b) imported into Canada
for the years 1939, 1949 and 1950?

Hon. Mr. Robertson: With my honourable

friend's consent, I would ask that this inquiry
be changed to an Order for Return.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: That will be satisfactory to me.
The inquiry was passed as an Order for
Return.

OLD AGE SECURITY BILL
REFERRED BACK TO COMMITTEE
On the Order:
Resuming the adjourned debate on the
motion of Hon. Mr. Robertson for the third
reading of Bill 13, an Act to provide for Old
Age Security.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I am not going to discuss the bill. At the last
sitting of the house I asked the leader of the
government how the people of Newfoundland,
who have been Canadians for only ýtwo and
a half years, could qualify for pension under
the provisions of this bill.
I believe my
friend is prepared to answer that question.
Hon. Wishari McL. Roberison: Honourable
senators, the leader opposite asked whether
the people of Newfoundland, despite the
the twenty-year residence requirement, could
qualify for the pension under this bill. I shall
now proceed to answer that question.
Residence in Canada is not defined in the
bill, but under clause 6 the Governor in
Council is authorized to make regulations for
carrying the purposes and provisions of the
measure into effect.
Paragraph (d) of this
clause authorizes the Governor in Council to
make regulations ...
. . . defining residence in, Canada and defining
intervals of absence from Canada preceding an
application that shall be deemed not to have interrupted residence in Canada.

What constitutes residence in Canada for the
purposes of the Old Age Security Act is
a matter which will be dealt with by
regulation.
I am advised that the Department of Justice holds the view that it is quite within the
competence of the Governor in Council, under
the circumstances of confederation to decree
that residents of Newfoundland be considered
residents of Canad-a for the purposes of this
legislation.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,

The purpose of these provisions is to ensure
that the fund, at least after the first few
months, will be self-sustaining, and that the
revenue sources are sufficient to ensure an
adequate flow of income to meet the pension
payments and the repayment of loans.
Honourable senators, these are the basic
principles on which it is proposed to operate
the fund.
Hon. Mr. Horner: The question raised by
the leader on this side (Hon. Mr. Haig) about
the eligibility of Newfoundlanders to receive
this pension, prompts me to ask the honourable leader of the government about the
status of people who have been living in
Canada for a number of years but whose
countries of origin no longer have any
national identity. I am thinking of such
countries as Latvia and Estonia, which have
disappeared behind the Iron Curtain.
I
wonder if the leader of the government can
say whether there is any hope of these people
coming within the twenty-year requirement
in this old age security measure.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The test is the length
of residence in Canada, and I do not think
the question of nationality has anything to do
with it. With relation to Newfoundland, I
understand it is intended to treat the people
of that province as though they had, been
citizens of Canada for the past twenty years.
Some Hon. Senators: Question.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
the question is on the motion for third
reading.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
before the question is put, I should like to
say a word about the proposal to interpret the
Act in such a way that Newfoundland may
be considered a part of Canada. I think the
Department of Justice is drawing a very long
bow here. When an Act is in plain language
it always takes precedence over an interpretation, and this bill provides that the pension
may be paid in respect of every person who:

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Section 6 says that the
Governor in Council may make regulations
for, among other things:
(d) defining residence in Canada and defining
intervals of absence from Canada preceding an
application that shall be deemed not to have interrupted residence in Canada;

Surely it is not meant that an executive,
acting under the Act, can change the wording
of the Act. Canada is Canada. Surely to
allow the executive to say that living somewhere else is living in Canada is a far stretch
of the imagination and an assumption of
power by the executive that is not given by
this bill. I make this comment for the reason
that my honourable friend from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner) bas just asked about
people who have come to this country from
Latvia. Well, if the executive can define
living in Newfoundland as living in Canada,
they may also define living in Latvia as
living in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Quite right.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: In this case we would
be enacting legislation which would allow
the executive to read in the whole world
by regulation. If you can play with words
in that way, you can go as far as you like.
It is all right to pass this bill, but I call
attention to the fact that we could run into
trouble if its interpretation were attacked.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Honourable senators, I
think there is a good deal of merit in the
remarks of the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck). This is
an exceedingly doubtful provision, and
though in my opinion it does not justify
delaying the passage of this bill, I would
most respectfully submit to the Department
of Justice that it might well redraft this
section-

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.

DECEMBER 3. 1951
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Honourable senators,
why should we pass an imperfect measure?
If this section is not broad enough to include
people of Newfoundland unless an Order
in Council or something of that nature is
passed, I think it is our duty to make it broad
enough. I imagine there is no great hurry
to have the measure put through. As payments
under it do not commence until January 1
next, and parliament will be in session for
a week or two longer at any rate, why not
refer the bill back to the Banking and Commerce Committee for consideration of what
has been said here, with a view to having the
section broadened and put in proper language?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I should judge that, as
pointed out by the senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris), the difference
between Newfoundland and the other countries mentioned is that Newfoundland is now
part of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I do not think that is
the answer.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I do not know that
that justifies the phraseology used.
As to the suggestion made by the senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), if
the bouse is agreeable to having the bill
referred back to the Banking and Commerce
Committee I cannot see that this would cause
the public interest to suffer. A meeting of
that committee is called for tomorrow morning, and the measure could' be considered
there without delay.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators, I
move that the bill be not now read the third
time, but that it be referred back to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce for further consideration.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
referred back to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce.
PENSION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved the second
reading of Bill 27, an Act to amend the
Pension Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill seeks
to increase the pension under the Pension
Act, for disability or death. It is consequent
upon the government's consideration of the
representations made by the Canaduan Legion
and the National Council of Veterans Associations in Canada. I will now give an outline
of what the legislation is designed to
accomplish.
Honourable senators are aware that a
pensioner who is totally disabled as a result

of war service receives a 100 per cent pension. For all ranks and ratings up to Lieutenant Commander in the Navy, Major in the
Army and Squadron Leader in the Air Force
the present pension is $94 a month, and this
is being raised to $125, an increase of 33à
per cent. If the pensioner is married he now
receives $31 monthly additional for his wife,
and this is being raised to $45, an increase
of 45 per cent. Thus the total monthly pension for the family unit will be $170 instead
of the present $125. The additional pension
for the first child is to be increased from $19
to $20 monthly, but the rates for other
children remain unchanged.
The pensioned widow who now receives $75
monthly will, under this legislation, have
her pension increased by 33à per cent; that is,
to $100. Honourable senators will recall that
by the amendments of June 1951 the pensions for the children of such widows were
increased to orphan rates. They will now be
$40 monthly for the first child instead of
$38, and remain at $30 for the second and
$24 for each subsequent child, respectively.
The unemployability supplement, provision
for which was made by Order in Council
P. C. 3510, dated July 4 last, will cease as
soon as the new scale of pensions comes into
effect, on January 1, 1952. This measure,
which was designed to give immediate relief
to pensioners unable to work and whose
disability pensions were their sole or principle source of income, has, however, served
a most useful purpose and afforded very
valuable information regarding the needs of
the group who were most seriously disabled
in their country's service. Under the present rates a 100 per cent pensioner, married,
gets $125, and if unemployable, $40 additional,
or a total of $165. Under the proposed new
rates he will receive $170. That is, he will
get $5 more than he bas been getting under
the statute and the Order in Council. A
100 per cent pensioner, single, now receives
$94, plus $20 unemployability supplement if
be is unemployable, a total of $114, and
under the proposed scale he will receive $125.
The records show that up to date 6,246
pensioners have received the supplement at
married rates and 2,991 at single rates, a
total of 9,237 in all. That is, about 27 per
cent of the total number of pensioners receive
the unemployability supplement. This supplement has been of great assistance to the
group of pensioners who were hardest hit by
the rising cost of living, and it is felt that
the measure has fulfilled the desire for which
it was intended.
I feel, honourable senators, that no one will
dissent from the argument that the state has
a special responsibility to those who have

SENATE
been maimed in its defence, and 1 arn certain
that the principle expressed by this legisiation will be received by ail honourable members with great satisfaction.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the honourable leader a question? I see from the newspapers that the burned-out class of veterans
have protested that they are flot included in
the provisions of this bill. Can the leader
tell us what classes are încluded? For instance,
are the non-pensioned widows included? And
just what categories of veterans or veterans'
dependents who have been drawing some
sort of pension from the department are
excluded?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: As I understand it,
this bil ýapplies specifically and exclusively
to the totally disabled veterans.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: And the partially disabled.

Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, I
have nothing to say about the appointment
of an additional judge, but I take this opportunity of drawing the attention of the government to the problem created by certain
groups of youths, commonly known as "zootsuiters", in my province and in other parts
of Canada as well. I amn wondering whether

type of youth who, if there was ever an
invasion of this country from the Soviet
Union, might be the first to join the subversive elements. They seem to me to be
a lawless crowd who fear neither God nor
man, and have no regard for authority.
When it' was proposed that the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police take over the
policing of British Columbia, I was opposed
to the move; but in the light of recent events
I think it has been to our advantage. These
characters are less apt to tangle with the
R.C.M.P. than with the city or provincial
police, who at times hesitate to walk in and
interfere with riots or disturbances.
Regarding the appointment of another
judge, perhaps the honourable senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris), who is
an eminent counsel in my province, would
enlighten us as to whether any consideration
has been given to using judges who are not
very busy with their duties in the interior of
British Columbia, and of having them serve
in the courts in the busier centres. True,
more help is required in the County Court
work in New Westminster, but if judges
moved on a circuit, the problem of overwork
might be lessened somewhat.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Take one from my
province.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I cannot let the remarks of the senator from
New Westminster go without comment. I
think I should point out to him that his
observations about the maintenance of law
and order are not properly directed to the
judges of the province. At the present time
there is in Canada a committee composed of
distinguished judges and lawyers engaged in
the preparation of amendments to the
Criminal Code. If action is to be taken, it
can only come by putting teeth in certain
sections of the Code.
I think the honourable senator from
Edmonton ('Hon. Mr. MacKinnon) could tell
us something very interesting about the contest in his city between "zoot-suiters" and
soldiers.
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: It has been greatly
exaggerated.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It was so serious that action
had to be taken to confine the soldiers to
barracks; otherwise there would have been
rows on the streets. The point is that this
kind of thing has become active in my province, and I assume in other parts of the
country, since the establishment of the juvenile courts. I believe that the root of the
trouble lies here. Up to a certain age boys and
girls who get into trouble are sent to the
juvenile courts, and I have never heard of a

juvenile court giving a judgment that was
any good at all to the boy or girl involved. I
make that statement without reservation. The
result of the treatment of young offenders in
these courts is that they go away with a
wrong slant on life. In contrast, let me say
that, so far as our province is concerned, I
have never heard one syllable of complaint
as to the manner in which delinquent youths
are dealt with by our county court judges.
The cases that come before them are handled
properly. If they are guilty they are suitably
punished, if they are not guilty they are
released. The consequence is that, although
these young offenders are not afraid to go
before the juvenile courts they dread to
appear before judges of either the county
courts or the superior courts. What, after ail,
are these juvenile court officials? They are
magistrates, and nothing more; but they are
accorded the title of judge, and in Manitoba
they are by law entitled to be known as judges
of the juvenile courts.
Hon. Mr. Aseline: They are not county
court judges.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, they are only magistrates, having the rank and powers of a
magistrate.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Are they lawyers?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Not necessarily, though I
believe most of them are. Not all the juvenile court judges in Manitoba are lawyers.
From what I know of conditions in my own
province-and one can only judge from personal experience-I believe that the establishment of these juvenile courts was a very
great mistake. I admit that they may not
be ineffective in some cases where younger
children, say from eight to ten years of age,
are involved; and the parents may prefer to
have them dealt with in these courts, because
it is argued that if these young children are
sent to a higher court they may associate
with criminals and thereby become criminals.
That statement may be true, but it does not
accord with my experience.
As to the "zoot-suiters," I can tell my honourable friend from New Westminster (Hon.
Mr. Reid) that we have them in Winnipeg,
as well. But one achievement upon which
we can pride ourselves is that "zoot-suiters"
have learned to respect the police. Never
once in the last five years has our police
force failed to take care of disorders caused
by these groups. I am utterly opposed to the
namby-pamby idea that a boy fifteen, sixteen
or seventeen years of age can be impressed
by a sort of Sunday-afternoon lecture, admonishing him to go out and be a goody-goody

174

SENATE

boy. Once free of the court, lie just laughs
at it. He is impressed very much more if he
is properly and adequately punished.
I am glad to see that the Province of
British Columbia, and the district of New
Westminster, from which our distinguished
senator (Hon. Mr. Reid) comes, is to have
another judge, although I hope the need did
not arise through his appointment to the
Senate.
In every province, I believe, there is a
situation not unlike that to which the senator
from New Westminster has referred. In the
cities the country court judges are busy.
Those in Winnipeg, I know, are overworked.
In the rural districts the reverse is true. I
hope the rural judges still remember their
1aw: certainly they do not get much opportunity to use it. I have particularly in mind
conditions in Manitoba, but I believe they
are the same in Saskatchewan, and
apparently, from what the honourable senator has said, in British Columbia-and probably in every other part of Canada. In
Winnipeg our four county court judges are
worked to the limit; the county court judge
at Brandon is pretty fully employed; but as
regards Morden, Minnedosa and some other
country points, I find it difficult to understand how the judges keep themselves
occupied.
I am wholly in favour of the bill bef ore us.
At the same time I would express the hope

from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) that it is a
mistake to call these men "judges"; they
should be known as "magistrates" or perhaps
even "masters", but not judges, because the
use of that term creates confusion in the
minds of the young people with regard to
the men who preside over the juvenile courts.
At the sane time I believe that juvenile
courts have done a great work. I am sure
that is true so far as Toronto is concerned. It
may be that some presiding officers have not
been sufficiently severe with the juvenile

OLD AGE SECURITY BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Hayden presented the report of
the Standing Committee of Banking and Commerce on Bill 13, an Act to provide for Old
Age Security.

The report was read by the Clerk Assistant
as follows:
The Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce to whom was referred back Bill 13, an Act
to provide for Old Age Security, have in obedience
to the order of reference of December 3, 1951,
further examined the said bill, and now beg leave
to report the same without any amendment.

He said: Honourable senators, some questions were raised in the house yesterday
about this measure, and as a result the bill
was referred back to the committee. The
committee discussed the matter this morning,
and on the basis of an opinion expressed
by the Law Clerk, which I have here, the
committee saw fit to report the bill back without any amendment. If it is the pleasure of
the house, I shall now read the opinion of
the Law Clerk. It is as follows:
Section 9, subsection (1) of the Interpretation
Act states that every Act of the Parliament of
Canada shall, unless a contrary intention appears,
apply to the whole of Canada. Where the word
"Canada" is used in the bill it means Canada as
presently constituted. Canada as presently constituted includes the province of Newfoundland.
Furthermore, by the Terms of Union of Newfoundland with Canada it is provided that subject to
the Terms of Union, the province of Newfoundland must be treated, in so far as welfare and public
services are concerned, on the same basis and subject to the same terms and conditions as the other
provinces of Canada. The Terms of Union were
approved by this parliament and by the Parliament
of the United Kingdom and by the Government
of Newfoundland, and are part of the Constitution

of Canada. "Residence in Canada," under the terms
of this Bill and under the terms of other statutes
of Canada, means residence in the territory now
known as Canada.
The provisions of the bill
authorizing the Governor in Council to define
"residence in Canada" are the same as similar
provisions of the Old Age Assistance Act, chapter
55 of the statutes of 1951, and the Allowance for
Blind Persons Act, chapter 38 of 1951. The power
to define "residence in Canada" in each case is
delegated to the Governor in Council.
It is submitted that it is preferable to delegate
to the, Governor in Council the authority to define
"residence in Canada" and "intervals of absence
from Canada preceding an application that shall be
deemed not to have interrupted residence in
Canada," so that groups of people who serve Canada
in civil and military employment, and possibly
commercial employment, may be permitted, under
appropriate regulations, to count periods of service
for Canada in foreign countries as "residence in
Canada."
So far as Newfoundland is concerned, it is now
legally a part of Canada and, in my opinion, it is
unnecessary to deal with it any diiferently from
any other province in this type of legislation.

CANADIAN NATIONAL-CANADIAN
PACIFIC BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishari McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill 6, an Act to amend
The Canadian National-Canadian Pacifie Act,
1933.

DECEMBER 4, 1951
He said: I need hardly remind honourable
senators that this bill and the two bills which
follow it on the order paper represent legislation by which it is proposed to implement
the report of the Royal Commission on Transportation. It will be recalled that early in
the session the Senate referred the report
of the commission to the Standing Committee
on Transport and Communications, who since
that time have given very careful consideration to the subject matter of this legislation.
I have thought that under these circumstances
it might have been preferable, in connection
with submitting these bills for your consideration, to have availed myself of the services of
some honourable senators who had acquired
in the committee a detailed knowledge of
these matters. On the other hand, members
of the committee may have differences et
opinion on details; and, this being government
legislation, I felt that, while claiming no
intimate knowledge, I should personally present these respective bills.
The first two bills, as honourable senators
who have familiarized themselves with them
are aware, are of a relatively minor nature.
The principal one is the third on the order
paper, namely, the bill to amend the Railway
Act. However, if and when the house sees
fit to give the three bills second reading, it
might be the part of wisdom to have them
referred to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications in case questions
affecting one or other of them might arise.
The purpose of Bill 6 is to implement
certain recommendations contained in chapter 8, section F of the report of the Royal

Commission
recommendations are to the effect that the
annual reports submitted to parliament by
the directors of the Canadian National Railways shall contain a separate section giving
in summary form information concerning the
co-operation between the two railways. The
proposals which were put forward by the
royal commission are contained in new
section 14 A, subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), (e),
and (f) of the bill.
The Canadian National-Canadian Pacific
Act, 1933, was passed to effect economies in
railway operations during the depression and
to improve railway revenues. The result of
the Act was to deter the railways from wasteful -competition, and during the 1930s it
permitted economies which exceeded a
million dollars a year-at that time a much
more significant sum than it is now. Thus the
Act has served a useful purpose. In presenting this amendment the government has in
view is improvement in the character of the
annual report submitted to parliament. I

have no hestitation, therefore, in commending this legislation to the favourable consideration of this house.

have no objection to it.

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read a third time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I move that this bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications.
The motion was agreed to.
MARITIME FREIGHT RATES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill 7, an Act to amend
the Maritime Freight Rates Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
consists of two simple amendments recommended by the Royal Commission on Transportation at page 237 of their report.
The first of these amendments provides
that the practice of the railways and of the
Board of Transport Commissioners for
Canada, which allows the 20 per cent preference on westbound traffic moving by railand-lake, and also by rail-lake-and-rail from
the maritime area to points west in Canada,
be confirmed and put into legislative form.
In other words, it confirms the practice which
has been in effect for many years, but which
has not been written into the statute books.
The second amendment asked for by the
Canadian National Railways, and recommended by the Royal Commission on Transportation, would delete section 6 of the
Maritime Freight Rates Act. This section
concerns the keeping of accounts for eastern
lines, provision as to which serves no useful
purpose, because the C.N.R. claims that it
does not keep separate accounts for its
eastern lines, but collects its share of the
subsidies payable under the Act in the same
manner as other railways operating in the
select territory.
Honourable senators, as I have said, these
two minor amendments are recommended in
the report of the Royal Commission on
Transportation.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am not too clear as to the
purpose of the first amendment, but I can
find out in committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

SENATE
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved that the bill be
referred to the Standing Corhmittee on Transport and Communications.
The motion was agreed to.
RAILWAY BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wisharl McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill 12, an Act to amend
the Railway Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
is introduced for the purpose of implementing the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Transportation with respect to
equalization of freight rates, and in regard to
other amendments to the Railway Act suggested by the royal commission.
In its report the commission states that
Canada has reached a stage in its development when former methods of making regional rates must give way to a uniform rate
structure which, so far as may be possible,
will treat all citizens, localities, districts and
regions alike. This is the objective; but it
must be realized that the intricate pattern of
rates cannot be changed overnight without
dislocation of trade and industry, and that
it will take some time and much study to
bring about the equalization which the commission had in view. The report of the commission states that the objective of equalization
is something which can only be attained
after considerable study by the Board of
Transport Commissioners and the railways.
Undoubtedly, many serious problems are involved. For example, there is the question
of what effect the proposals may have on
railway revenues, on established industries
and on trade and market patterns.
The part of the bill that empowers the
board to effect and maintain the uniformity
in freight rates throughout Canada as recommended by the royal commission, is found in
new section 332A. Subsection 1 of this section
declares the national freight rates policy, and
says that every railway company shall, so
far as is reasonably possible, in respect of
all freight traffic of the same description,
and carried on the same kind of cars, passing
over all ines and routes of the company in
Canada, charge the same rates to all persons.
Subsection 2 provides for a uniform scale
of mileage class rates and mileage commodity
rates, and for revision of any other rates
with a view to implementing the national
freight rates policy. Subsection 4 contains
the exceptions to equalization, which include
the Crowsnest Pass rates and traffic moving
over the eastern lines of the Canadian

National Railways, as defined in the Maritime
Freight Rates Act. The other exceptions are
joint international rates, rates on export and
import traffic, competitive rates, agreed
charges, rates on the White Pass and Yukon
route, and other cases where the board
considers an exception should be made.
As honourable senators are aware, inequalities in freight rates have been a subject of
contention for many years. The purpose of
the new section 332A is to provide for a
more equitable freight rates structure.
Another important amendment is to be
found in new section 332B, which provides
for what is now known as the one-and-onethird rule in respect of competitive transcontinental rates.
Over the years complaints have been made
respecting competitive transcontinental rates.
These rates apply on traffic hauled by the
railways across the continent in competition
with water transport via the Panama Canal
or direct to Pacific coast ports. There is also
competition from the American railroads.
Unlike most competitive rates, they apply
generally to or from a large area in Eastern
Canada is included in the territory covered
by transcontinental rates, because ocean
steamships, with connecting lake, river and
truck services, can carry traffic into or out of
all the area served by the Great Lakes and St.
Lawrence river as well as the East coast.
On the other side of the continent the transcontinental rates apply only to Pacific coast
ports and the trucking area surrounding those
ports.
As a result of the many complaints made
by distributors and consumers in the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, the commission recommended that the benefit of any
transcontinental rate from the east to the
British Columbia coast should be carried into
the rate to intermediate territory, so that
that rate would be not more than one-third
higher than the transcontinental rate; and
that the same principle should apply to eastbound transcontinental rates. Section 332B
of the bill gives effect to this recommendation.
There are other provisions of the bill
respecting the constitution of the Board of
Transport Commissioners and the office of
Chief Commissioner, the new division of
freight tariffs, amendments relative to interline rates, and accounting and statistics.
In the last section, number 18, provision is
made for a subsidy not exceeding $7 million
to be paid to the Canadian Pacific and
Canadian National railways in respect of
the maintenance of the "bridge" which constitutes a rail link between east and west.

DECEMBER 4, 1951
The bill provides that this subsidy is to be
reflected in the level of the freight rates on
traffic passing over this "bridge."
As honourable members from the Maritimes will perhaps remember, the bill as
originally introduced was amended in the
committee of the other house by the addition
of the new paragraph (f) of subsection (4) of
section 332A. This paragraph is indicated
by a marginal black line at the bottom of
page 6 and the top of page 7 of the bill. The
purpose and effect of this amendment is to
make it clear that the preference granted to
the Maritime Provinces under the Maritime
Freight Rates Act will be preserved.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
do not think that we should debate the
merits of the bill at this stage. I will give
my reasons for saying this. The bill is the
most important piece of legislation that has
come before the Senate this session, and I
think that its effect on the future of this
country will extend over very many years.
A bill dealing with railroads is always a
very complicated affair.
The principle underlining this bill is equalization of rates across Canada. I wholeheartedly support that principle, and I do not
see how anybody could have serious objection
to it. I am also in favour of the principle in
the bill recognizing the merits and the
authority of the legislation which gives effect
to the Maritimes Freight Rates Agreement.
That agreement was entered into after long
discussion, and I need not go into the history
of it. There is no doubt that one of the
conditions insisted upon by the Maritime
Provinces before entering confederation was
that there should be some rail link between
them and what is now called central Canada.
This was agreed upon, and the Maritime
Freight Rates Act simply continues the agreement. With that I have no quarrel.
Then coming to Western Canada, we have
what is known as the Crowsnest Pass Agreement, which also was arrived at after long
negotiations and-thanks to the vote of this
house-incorporated into legislation. Today
we would not have that law, which is beneficial to Western Canada, if it had not been
for the vote of the Senate which preserved
the agreement for the Crowsnest Pass rates.
With that also I have no quarrel.
The bill, however, contains certain sections
which, in my judgment, are opposed to the
underlying principle of equalization of rates.
I do not want to discuss those now. I have
attended our Transport Committee's sittings
and heard all the representations made there
and the questioning of witnesses. As the

honourable member who is chairman of the
committee (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) knows, I was
quite active in cross-examination of witnesses, whether they were favourable or
unfavourable to the position that I take. Now,
it seems to me that we would have a better
understanding of the bill if the committee's
meetings were attended by not only members
of the committee, but by all senators. I
have no authority to invite honourable senators to the committee, but I point out that
they are entitled to come, and to examine
the records and listen to the proceedings. As
a member of this house I sincerely hope that
honourable senators will attend this committee. The decision which the committee makes
is most important to a vital industry in
Canada.
A question was raised in the other place
a few dýays lago concerning the importance
of our transportation system to the people of
Canada in time of war. I was old enough
at the time to be familiar with the events
of the First World War, and I was not too
old to know about the Second World War.
The part played in those struggles by our
transportation system help Canada to make
a much greater contribution towards their
sulocessful outcome than would otherwise
have been possible. For that reason I want
to be sure that the passage of this legislation
will do nothing to destroy or weaken railway operations in Canada. The railways
must handle the goods economically, so that
the people of the East and the West can
compete in the markets of the world. I
want to be fair about the whole question,
and I would emphasize that no part of parliament has a greater obligation and responsibility than the Senate has to examine this
bill in every detail and be certain that when
it is passed it is the best piece of legisla
tion that can be devised.
I am sure that the chairman of the committee will concur in my request that as
many as possible of the members of the
bouse attend the meetings of the committee.
It may be a little dull to sit in at a meeting
of a committee of which one is not a member when phraseology and draftsmanship are
being discussed; but we are dealing with a
fundamental issue. Indeed, the government
felt that it was so important that a Royal
Commission was appointed to conduct an
investigation into the transportation system
of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I gather that my friend
has some objection to the measure. Would
he please state it?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I can state my two main
objections briefly. The first is that the section dealing with competitive rates should

SENATE

give the Board of Transport Commissioners
power to pass regulations dealing with certain
problems. There may be some people who
think the board has not done a good job in
the past, but I, for my part, have every confidence in it. If it is shown its members
are not competent, then let us get men who
are.
My second objection has to do with the
question of equalization of freight rtes
across Canada. If, for instance, goods can
be sent from Central Canada to Edmonton
at a cost which is the same as or less than
the cost of delivering them in Winnipeg, that
is not equalization of rates. There are no
mountains or geographical obstructions in the
area between Central Canada and those two
cities. I can understand the Maritime provinces having a special dispensation, for that
was part of the scheme of confederation. The
same is true of British Columbia. I agree
that that province would never have become
part of Canada had not the government of the
day promised to build the Canadian Pacific
Railway to connect it with the rest of
Canada. Had the government not carried out
that promise, British Columbia would now
be either an independent state or part of the
United States of America. I am willing to
go along with the concessions to the Maritime provinces and with what is known as
the Crownest Pass Rates, but the matter of
competitive rates presents a problem.
I cannot imagine any railway managed
by capable businessmen putting into effect
a lower rate than it is forced to give; yet,
when one reads the bill, there seems to be
a suggestion that the railways are anxious to
give low rates to meet competition. I know
members of the board of directors of both
major railways, and I do not believe that to
meet competition they would give a rate
lower than is absolutely necessary. The rail
rate 'on steel to the Pacific Coast is, I think,
about $1.50 per hundred pounds, but the
ocean rate is about $1 per hundred. Some
may say that those are not competitive rates,
but they are, because shipment by way of
the Panama Canal results in considerable
delay, and businessmen at the coast who are
anxious to receive goods are prepared to
pay the higher rate.

The rate to Vancouver

are fair to all concerned. The bill as now
drawn would seem to compel a railway company to show that a truck line from Winnipeg to Dauphin, for instance, threatened to
take away its business; and this would have
to be proved by figures. I do not know how
the railway could be expected to supply that
information. I think the bill should merely
give to the board the power to demand
particulars. My objection in that respect is
not very serious, however, because I do not
believe that any board, before granting a
competitive rate, would demand information which the railways might find it impossible to supply.
Hon.

Mr. Vien:

Would

the honourable

senator permit a question? Did I understand
my friend to say that there is a section in
the bill which would curtail the jurisdiction
of the board with respect to competitive
rates?
Hon. Mr. Haig: The bill provides that the
board may require a company to supply
certain information before a competitive
rate is granted.
Hon.

Mr. Vien:

To

what

section

does

the honourable gentleman refer?
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is section 331. I shall
read some of the subparagraphs which detail
the information required:
(i) the name of the competing carrier or carriers.

The railway company might not know that.
(ii) the

route

over

It might know that.
(iii) the rates charged by the competing carriers,
with proof of such rates as far as ascertainable.

There is no way to tell that because these

conditions have not arisen; and, as the railroad
representatives pointed out to us, after
arrangements have been made and competition has begun it will be too late to act. If
the bill should pass in its present form,
however, I have confidence that the Board of
Transport Commissioners will put aside purely
technical considerations. When I asked counsel
who represented Alberta and Saskatchewan
why they wanted these provisions put into the
Act instead of them being made the subject
of regulations, they said quite candidly, "So
that we can say to the commission, 'They are
here, and parliament must have wanted them
here or they would not have put them in;

on automobiles from Windsor, Toronto,
Oshawa or Montreal, is about $8.70 per
hundred pounds.
Because of their bulk,
automobiles cannot be shipped by water,
and so the railways charge not $1.50, as they
do for steel, but $8.70. The carriers charge so you must have that information' ". That
what the market will stand, and I do not may be good logic but I do not think it is
criticize them for it.
common sense.
I am quite willing that the Board of TransThe representatives of both Manitoba and
port Commissioners should have power to British Columbia objected to section 332B. I
regulate competitive rates and see that they may say that I had not intended to discuss

DECEMBER 4, 1951
this matter at length in this chamber. Perhaps it would have been better if the honourable member from Vancouver (Hon. Mr.
Farris) had not asked me the question but
as he has done so he is entitled to an answer.
The effect of the section may be illustrated
in this way. If the rate on steel from the East
to Vancouver is $1.50 per hundred pounds,
under this section the rate from Vancouver
as far east as it is desired to go will be $1.50the rate to the coast-plus one-third. In other
words, it will be $2. In practice that means
that a shipper of steel from within the
triangle embracing, let us say, Montreal,
Hamilton and Toronto, will be able to deliver
it five hundred miles west of Winnipeg at
the same price as he can deliver it at
Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: As the honourable senator from Winnipeg reads the bill, is the additional one-third rate of which he speaks
applicable only to towns on the direct route,
or does it apply also upon branch lines?
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is not stated. I think the
Alberta representatives overlooked the fact
that there is no compulsion upon the railroads to put in force the transcontinental
rate; as long as their charges are below the
standard rate they can put in what rate they
like. The representatives of the Canadian
Pacific Railway told the committee, "If we
are compelled to set a rate, say to Saskatoon,
which because of the Pacific Coast rate will
represent a loss to us, we shall have to
increase the Pacific Coast rate in order to
-nake the cut-back pay, and the charge will
have to be so high that, by reason of the
Panama Canal competition, we shall lose on
trade to Pacific". I do not think any director
in his senses would consent to such a low
transcontinental rate. Why should the charge
be $8.75 per hundred pounds of steel in a
motor car, and only $1.50 per hundred on
steel in the raw state? The answer, of
course, is the existence of the Panama rates.
If my memory serves me, the rate per hundred pounds of steel in a motor car consigned
to Edmonton is about $7.20; from the eastern
triangle to Winnipeg the amount is somewhere between $4.50 and $5.
This state of things, I think, is in flat contradiction of the original provision for equalUnder the Crowsnest
ization of rates.
agreement, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba have rates much lower than they would
get through equalization. This agreement
was given the force of law; industry was
built upon it; the Commission recommended
that it be left undisturbed; and unless there is
clear evidence that it is unfair to Canada as
a whole, we have not the right to change it.

il or the reasons I have given I would urge
that the bill as a whole should be seriously
studied in committee. The unfortunate feature of legislation of this character is that,
based on certain rail rates to various parts
of our transcontinental system, industrial
developments have taken place in certain
areas of the country, and it is now very difficult to make changes. For example, about
one hundred and seventy articles-some very
important, others of less consequence-are
affected by the rate to the coast.
It is my suggestion that section 332B should
be withdrawn. What is proposed amounts
to a revolutionary change in railway law.
If it should be found after a sufficient period
of trial that there is still a drawback which
cannot be met, the matter can then be remedied.
As to arbitraries, an example is the similarity of rate to Winnipeg from any part of
the Sudbury-Montreal-Windsor area. The
original rate was an arbitrary rate. Another
example is the rate from Fort William to
Winnipeg. Under this legislation it will disappear. The distance from Fort William to
Winnipeg is about 410 miles, but under the
old law it was reckoned as though it were
only 260 miles. That situation, of course,
no longer obtains under the proposed legislation.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Was not the reason for
assuming that distance to be 260 miles, instead
of 410 miles, to suggest an even division of
the existing so-called "bridge" between east
and west?
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is correct. As regards
the provision, involving an expenditure of
about $7,000,000, for getting goods forward
or back over the so-called "hump", that is
clearly dealt with in the bill, and I do not
think there will be much difficulty about it.
Each railway has about the same mileage
west of the hump; though the C.N.R. has
the greater mileage in Eastern Canada, it is
not affected on that account. The idea is
that the people of Western Canada, especially of the three prairie provinces, who
depend so much upon the railroads for transportation in both directions, shall be given
some chance to benefit by a reduction of
freight on the articles in which they are
particularly interested. I think the idea is
a good one, and that it will work out well.
The cost is not likely to be large enough to
be startling.
In conclusion, I hope that every member
of the committee and every member of this
house will attend the meeting of the committee and listen to the discussion and take

SENATE
part in it. We have already heard the legal
representatives from the Maritime Provinces.
I want to say, not to be complimentary to
the Maritimes, but as a fact, that I am not
surprised that quite a few of our Western
judges derive from that part of Canada. Certainly the lawyers from the Maritime Provinces who appeared before our committee
reflected credit on the legal profession by
their fine presentation of the case. I think
the representatives from the eastern provinces
were the most able; and though there were
capable representatives from both Alberta
and Saskatchewan; perhaps I was a little
prejudiced in favour of the chap from Saskatchewan. The gentlemen from Manitoba and
British Columbia were rather young, but they
appeared to fully realize their responsibilities. They impressed me as thinking a good
deal of Canada as a whole, and as being
particularly hopeful that this legislation would
bring tremendous relief to the people of
Western Canada. Like myself, the representatives from Manitoba and British Columbia were opposed to this section. The Alberta
representative was violently in favour of it.
The Saskatchewan representative spoke in
favour of it, but he admitted that the eastern part of his province would receive little
benefit from it.
Honourable senators, again I say that this
bill is worthy of your full consideration. I
hope that, like the members of the royal
commission, we shall meet this question on
the basis of what is in the best interest of
the railways and the railway users. I trust
that the leader of the government will send
this bill to committee, and that all honourable senators will take part in the deliberations of that committee.
Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators, I
entirely agree with much of what the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) has
said. This bill is important, and it affects our
vital interests in times of war and in times
of peace. The honourable gentleman has
aptly stated that the Maritime rights will not
be injuriously affected or jeopardized as a
result of this legislation. He also could have
said that the privileges of the grain growers
with respect to rates on grain and grain
products, frozen by law as a result of the
Crowsnest Agreement remain unchanged. This
agreement, as amended in 1922, will continue to have full force and effect. I do
not believe, however, that this bill introduces
compulsorily any principle binding the hands
of the Board of Transport Commissioners.
Section 331, which is permissive, appears at'
page 5 of the bill, and reads as follows:
(1) The Board may provide that any competitive
rate may be acted upon and put into operation immediately upon the issue thereof before it is filed

with the Board, or allow any such rate to go into
effect as the Board shall appoint.
(2) The Board may require a company issuing a
competitive rate tariff to furnish at the time of
filing the tariff, or at any time. any information
required by the Board . . .

There are and always will be anomalies in
our freight rate structure. Competitive rates
themselves are anomalies. They were introduced in our railway rate system to enable
railway companies to meet water and American rail competition to which they would
otherwise lose their traffic; and also to allow
Canadian railways to assist certain industries
to survive. It stands to reason that competitive rates are lower than normal rates.
When a railway company publishes a competitive rate, it is logical and reasonable that
the Board of Transport Commissioners should
have the right to ask it to justify such rate,
so as to make sure that it does not constitute
unjust discrimination. This is a well recognized underlying principle in rate making.
A competitive rate being discriminatory
because it is lower than the normal rate, the
members of the Board should have the right
to satisfy themselves that such a rate is
necessary and is not unjustly discriminatory.
The honourable leader of the opposition
referred to transcontinental rates and their
relation to rates to intermediate points.
Transcontinental rates are also competitive.

They enable railway companies to transport
materials, similarly packed in the same type
of cars, to more distant points at a cheaper
rate than to intermediate points. Shippers
or consignees living at intermediate points
have often complained that they have to
pay more for a shorter haul than is being
charged on traffic moving under transcontinental or international rates to more distant points. Railway companies invariably
will reply that such transcontinental rates
are competitive; that they are published to
enable Canadian producers to ship their
products to world competitive markets. The
complainants allege that if the company can
carry such traffic to seaboard at the published rate, it should also be able to carry it
to an intermediate point at the same rate.
The purpose of the appropriate section in this
bill is to provide that the transcontinental
rate shall not exceed by more than one-third
the rate to intermediate points. In other
words, it simply establishes a yardstick with
which to measure the reasonableness of the
international rate, in order to prevent it
from becoming excessive.
The honourable leader also referred to constructive mileage, as compared with actual
mileage, and gave as an instance the assumed
or constructive mileage on which rates are
based with respect to traffic moving between

DECEMBER 4, 1951
Fort William and Winnipeg. Well, there are
a number of other points where constructive
mileage is used and is almost necessary. Of
course, it is anomalous, but this method is
adopted to prevent or cure greater anomalies.
It has been closely scrutinized and found to
be fair and equitable. For instance, the actual
distance by Canadian Pacific Railway from
Calgary to Vancouver is 644 miles, and by
Canadian National from Edmonton to Vancouver, 768 miles, a difference of 124 miles.
It has been deemed necessary to allow the
Canadian Pacific to adopt from Calgary to
Vancouver the Canadian National's actual
mileage from Edmonton to Vancouver. The
reason is that from Calgary to Vancouver the
grade through the Ki.cking Horse Pass is 2-2
per cent-formerly it was 4-4 per cent, but
the spiral tunnel reduced it to 2-2. The ruling grade from Edmonton to Vancouver does
not exceed 1 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Reid: One half of 1 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I am not speaking of a
constant grade, but of a ruling grade, a maximum grade, and it is 1 per cent. Then,
although the Canadian Pacific Railway has
to travel an actual distance of only 644 miles
from Calgary to Vancouver, it is allowed to
assume the Canadian National's actual distance of 768 miles to compensate itself for its
higher grade and its pusher mileage. It was
often suggested to the board that the Canadian Pacific Railway should be held down
strictly to its actual mileage of 644.
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: The road was built
in the wrong place.
Hon. Mr. Vien: The honourable gentleman
is quite right if he means to refer to the fact
that the Canadian Pacific Railway was originally intended to go through the Yellowhead
Pass, from Edmonton to Vancouver. Later,
for reasons of its own, the company decided
to run through the Kicking Horse Pass, from
Calgary to Vancouver. It was also urged on
many occasions that the line from Calgary to
Vancouver has other compensations; that, in
any event, the company, having chosen it of
its own free will, should not be accorded the
privilege of a constructive mileage greater
than its actual mileage. If that argument
had prevailed, what would have been the
result? There is a criss-crossing of railway
lines in the Prairies, east of the Rockies. If
the Canadian Pacific had adopted its actual
mileage of 644 miles, competitive conditions
would have forced the Canadian National to
reduce its own actual mileage of 768 miles
to that of the Canadian Pacific Railway, i.e.,
644 miles.

Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask the honourable
senator a question? Does he understand that
the one and one-third rule applies only to
transcontinental rates?
Hon. Mr. Vien: That may be, but I am not
sure of it at the moment.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The rule applies only to
In Ontario, for
transcontinental rates.
instance, the distance over the C.P.R. from
Toronto to Sault Ste. Marie is about 540
miles, but over the Canadian National it is
about 720, and the rates over both roads are
the same. I think that if the honourable
gentleman will refer to page 7 of the bill,
line 30, he will see that I am right.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Yes, my honourable friend
is correct. May I say that I agree with my
honourable friend's suggestion that the bill
should go to committee. The changes proposed are certainly important, but this bill
will not eliminate all the anomalies to be
found in railway freight tariffs. Competitive
rates should at all times be scrutinized. This
bill gives the board discretionary powers; it
does not tie its hands.
The honourable leader opposite is quite
right when he says that railways are not
anxious to put in competitive rates, for they
lose money by doing so. This measure may
have the effect of protecting them against
pressure which might sometimes be brought
to bear on them by the big users of their
facilities. One must however remember that
discrimination, as such, is not prohibited by
the Railway Act. What is prohibited is only
unjust and unfair discrimination. The Board
of Transport Commissioners exercises its
discretion, uses its best judgment to weigh
all the facts. It seems that the bill, as
drawn, gives it discretionary power and
leaves it completely untrammelled; but it
defines principles of national policy in which
I concur.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: I should like to ask
the leader opposite a question. Did he suggest in his remarks that the railways could
haul automobiles at the same rate as they
haul steel?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, I did not suggest that.
I said, in effect, that automobiles were
hauled at a standard rate of, I think, $8.70
per hundred pounds from Toronto or
Montreal to Vancouver. The rate to Edmonton or Calgary is, I think, $7.40 per hundred
pounds; to Saskatoon and Regina it is $5.50;
and to Winnipeg, $4.40. This commodity
cannot be shipped by water because of its
bulk, but I am not suggesting that the rate
on cars should be cut down or increased.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: Why did you mention
it then?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Cars are not affected at all.
Hon. Mr. S±ambaugh: That is what I
thought.
Hon. G. H. Ross: Honourable senators, some
time ago I asked a number of questions with
regard to the Canadian Pacifie Railway. I
had hoped to have the answers before proceeding with this debate; however, as I have
not yet received them, I presume I will have
to proceed without them. I hope they will
corne down before the session closes.
The Turgeon Commission made an excellent diagnosis of the railway situation in
Canada, but the remedy, in my opinion, does
not go far enough. It is quite apparent that
on a basis that is fair to all parts of Canada
neither one of the great railway systems is
able to earn a profit sufficient to enable it
to pay operating expenses, maintenance,
upkeep and repairs, and a reasonable return
on capital to the shareholders. The remedy
prescribed by the commission and embodied
in the bill now before us is, in my opinion,
wholly inadequate.
In March of last year I spoke in the debate
on the Address in reply to the Speech from
the Throne. At that time I advocated the
nationalization of the Canadian Pacifie Railway system, the consolidation of it with the
Canadian National Railways, and the operation of the two as a unified system. I also
urged the writing down of the capital
charges against both of these railways to a
basis that would enable them to reduce their
rates and compete with water transportation,
buses, trucks and air competition. I am still
of the opinion that this is the best solution
of our railway problem.
Is this socialistic? I hear someone say, "Oh,
that is socialism and we want none of it."
It is true that socialists advocate government
ownership and operation of the Canadian
Pacifie; but because socialists favour a desirable reform is no good reason why we should
shy away from it. I am not a socialist; I
believe in the government staying out of any
enterprise where there is real competition.
It is argued that so long as the C.P.R. is
privately owned, competition between it and
the C.N.R. would keep both railway systems
on their toes and working in the interest of
efficiency and economy. But there is no
beneficial competition between the two railway systems at the present time.
As to competition: In the early history
of railways, laissez-faire was very popular
in so far as their operation was concerned.
Regulation was not deemed necesary. It

was thought that competition between lines
would be a sufficient regulator. The first
regulation in Canada was to limit by charter
the profits to 15 per cent. Rates were later
fixed subject to the approval of the Governor in Council. Controls increased in number
and were exercised by a committee of the
cabinet until 1904, when the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, known
since 1938 as the Board of Transport Commissioners, was set up. It has since been
given very wide powers. Maximum rates
on both railways are now fixed by the Board.
Controls now entirely displace competition
as a regulator in all cases in which competition formerly existed.
So long as we fix maximum freight and
passenger rates for the railways, those rates
should make it possible for the Canadian
Pacifie Railway Company to make money
enough to pay operating costs, maintenance,
and reasonable dividends to shareholders
on the amount invested by the railway in
railway property, less the aid given by
federal, provincial and municipal bodies.
Apparently there is no hope of the Canadian Pacifie being able to do this in the
future.
The Turgeon Commission recommended
the payment of annual subsidies. The bill
now before us provides for the payment of
an annual subsidy of $7 million to the railways to bridge the non-profitable gap
between the eastern and western lines. This
will not go very far. And as competition
from other forms of transportation diverts
traffie from the railways, the subsidy will
have to be increased. I do not like the idea
of paying subsidies to privately-owned corporations to operate public utilities. Government ownership and operation of the railways is the rule rather than the exception
in continental Europe. The nationalization
of British railways was recommended by
a select committee of the House of Commons,
set up in 1918. A royal commission in 1931
recommended unification, "however accomplished".
Nationalization of the railways
was advocated in an election speech in 1918
by Mr. Winston Churchill.
He favoured
low freight rates, even if it meant operating
at a loss, as he expressed the fear that as
long as the railways were in private hands
"they might be used for immediate profit,
while if they were in the hands of the State
it might be wise to run thern at a loss if
they developed industry, placed the trader
in close contact with the market and stimulated development."
As there will be no worthwhile conpetition between the two railways there will
not be the incentive on the part of the

DECEMBER 4, 1951
Canadian Pacific Railway to better its lot
that there is under competition; tliere will not
be the incentive to gain a profit or avoid
a loss that is the mainspring of our competitive system. If we pay subsidies to the
Canadian Pacific Railway Company to meet
losses, those subsidies will no doubt vary
with the losses. They will have the effect of
destroying that initiative, imagination and
resoursefulness that we need most if we are
to have a resilient andi rapidly expanding
economy.
As to monopoly: Some people will object
to the nationalization of the C.P.R. system
and the amalgamation of the two railways
on the ground that such an action would
create a monopoly. There is a prejudice in
the public mind against monopolies. Many
fail to appreciate the difference in principle
between a privately-owned and a publiclyowned monopoly. The object of a private
monopoly is often to set artificially high prices
with a view to making unduly high profits;
the object of a public monopoly is to give
service at the lowest cost possible.
In this case it would be a monopoly ownéd
by Canada and controlled by a non-political
board, free from political interference with
all its costly implications. It should not be
objectionable. It would not be a monopoly
of transportation. The railways would still
have to compete with water transportation,
buses, trucks and aeroplanes. There can be
no danger in a public monopoly such as this.
Public utilities are nearly always monopolistic in character. They should, be owned
and controlled by the State. The people of
Ontario have saved tens of millions of dollars
by the publicly-owned Ontario Hydro. In the
case of not only a railway but of any other
public utility, when competition fails to
work as a regulator and serve the public
fairly, public ownership and management
must succeed private enterpise. This is net
socialism; it is sound Liberal policy. Our
public utilities can be more efficiently operated under public than under private ownership. The day will come when the Canadian
Pacific Railway system will have to be
nationalized. We should do it now.
The present system is wasteful. The losses
from waste and, overlapping in the field of
transportation are enormous. In an address
delivered to the Canadian Club at Chatham
in 1934, the honourable senator from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) pointed out that competition

having spoken in part as follows:Competition may be the life of trade, but it is
death to our railways . . .

The National a few

years ago had a business-getting force of 3,500 men,
the C.P.R. a corresponding number; all engaged in

getting business from each other.
94703--144

The elimination

of this competitive force, of duplicate telegraph,
ticket, express offices, stations, trains and lines
must run into millions. In my mind there is little
doubt that a sum of from $50 million to $75 million
could be saved and better service given than the
half-starved service we have now in some instances.

Mr. E. W. Beatty, former president of the
Canadian Pacifie Railway Company, in an
address delivered before the Canadian Political Science Association in Montreal on May
22, 1934, advocated that, in order to put an
end to the waste of competition, the two
railway systems-the Canadian National and
the Canadian Pacific-should be unified under
the control of the C.P.R. for the purposes of
administration only. He said:
As the result of an exhaustive anaylsis of the
accounts by our officers, I have stated that under
the form of unification proposed there would be a
saving of seventy-five million dollars in a year of
normal traffic, which amount would be increased
as the trade of the country expanded in future
years.
Later in the same address Mr. Beatty, in
referring to the estimated saving of $75 million a year, said:
Estimates of those savings were made at various
times by the late Lord Shaughnessy, by the late
Sir Henry Thornton, by Mr. Fairweather, economist
of the Canadian National Railway, and by the
present officers of the Canadian Pacific. These
submissions can be regarded with respect as the
fruits of deep study, conducted by men of experience. All of their estimates, though made at different times, are very similar in result. The estimate
presented by the Canadian Pacific to the royal commission was examined and analysed by independent
railway economists of standing and repute in the
United States, and was pronounced unas-ailable.
Sir Henry Thornton was brought into
Canada to amalgamate and organize the different railways taken over and operated by

nationalizing the C.P.R. system and amalgamating it with the C.N.R. he could operate the
combined system at a saving of from $75 million to $100 million a year.
Consequently, in the opinion of those who
should know best, very substantial econonies
could be worked out under a unified system.
These estimates were made seventeen years
ago. If economies to the extent of $75 million
a year had been made for each of the last
seventeen years, probably we would have had
no railway problem on our hands today.
I should point out here that since these
opinions were expressed, minor co-operative
measures have been put into effect under
the Canadian National-Canadian Pacific Act
of 1933, but the economies effected were comparatively small.
With regard to national policies: The development of Canada took place within the

SENATE
framework of two national policies which
have been pursued since confederation,
namely, an all-Canada transportation system
and a protective tariff. Both policies have
had the effect of building up and enriching
Central Canada-consisting of the peninsula
of Ontario formed by the Great Lakes and certain areas in the vicinity thereof-at the
expense of the rest of Canada, to the extent of
hundreds of millions of dollars.
As to all-Canada transportation: If we had
followed the laws of nature and geography
between Canada and the United States, trade
would flow from north to south and from
south to north. Different railway companies
were anxious to serve the prairies through
the United States, where every mile of their
railways would pass through fertile productive territory and be revenue-producing.
But Canadian national policy would not
allow this.
For fifty years following confederation,
the policy of building transcontinental railways to channel trade east and west through
Canada was considered of paramount importance. The public assistance given for the
construction of railways, the building of
canals, the deepening of waterways and the
improvement of harbours was provided by
Canada wholly with a view to promoting
east-west traffic and preventing trade to the
south. This long haul policy bas forced us,
in exporting primary products, to sell our
products for much less than we would otherwise receive, and to pay more for what we
buy than we would otherwise have to pay.
As to unfair rates: Another advantage that
Central Canada has over the rest of Canada is
in respect of water competition. It arises in
this way. The Transport Board fixes maximum freight rates for the railways. The railways are free to reduce these rates to meet
competition, and they do so in Central Canada
to meet competition, particularly from water.
Since the spring of 1948, to meet higher costs
of labour and materiais, the railways were
allowed to raise the general ceiling of rates
by 62.67 per cent on the traffic to which
increased rates were applicable. Th sy took
full advantage of this raise where there was
no water competition. Where there was
competition they depressed their rates to
meet it. As a result, it has been estimated
that the freight rates on the prairies, without
taking into consideration the raise of 12 per
cent allowed on July 4, 1951, are approximately 25 per cent higher than in Central
Canada, where they get the full benefit of
water competition.
This, notwithstanding
that the cost of building railways on the
prairies, was much less than in any other

part of Canada; and that the cost of operating
on the prairies is much less than in any
other part of Canada.
We are told that the objective of the
present bill is to bring about equalization of
freight rates throughout Canada. I think that
would be a very difficult thing to accomplish.
If it were practical, the Board of Railway
Commissioners would have done it long ago.
But it is impractical for this reason: If you
raise the rates in Ontario to meet the rates
in the Prairie Provinces and the East, you
price the railways out of the market. On the
other hand, if you lower the price on the
Prairie Provinces, the revenue will be much
less. In other words, the railways could
not stand to raise the rates in the East,
because they might price themselves out of
the market; and they could not stand to lower
the rates in the West because they would
lose too much revenue.
It is to be noted, too, that the C.P.R. makes
more than $2 of net earnings or profits in the
West for every $1 of net earnings or profits
made in the East. This is true although more
than twice as much freight traffic is carried
in the East than in the West. If honourable
senators would care to see the figures in this
connection, I would refer them to an editorial
in the Winnipeg Free Press, dated October
3, 1951.
Freight rates per 100 pounds on canned goods
moving from Toronto west under the transcontinental scale is $1.57 to the West Coast,
and $2.97 to Calgary. These higher rates are
imposed on canned goods shipped to Calgary,
notwithstanding the fact that to get to the
West Coast they have to pass through Calgary
and then go over some 700 miles of mountainous terrain. Similarly the charge on all
through shipments is higher than on shipments to intermediate points.
The present bill does not provide for freight
rates across Canada that will bring to an
end the discrimination that now exists against
the West and the East. It does provide that
rates from the East to intermediate points
in the West should not be more than onethird over the rate to the Pacific Coast. This
will be helpful, but it does not go far
enough.
In a case which arose in the United States,
and which is known as the "Spokane decision", the Interstate Commerce Commission
decided that intermediate points-Spokane,
for example, in relation to Seattle-were not,
without the permission of the commission, to
be charged rates higher than the fair proportion of through rates. The cost of shipping
for a greater distance should in no case
be less than the cost of shipping for a
shorter distance over the same route.

DECEMBER 4, 1951
The railways are now seeking higher
freight rates to enable them to make a reasonable income on capital invested. The
reduction of intermediate rates will reduce
their present income and lead to a request for
still higher freight rates. If increases are
granted as in the past, on a horizontal basis,
there are many commodities on which the
railways cannot raise the rates in Central
Canada without diverting the business to
water, highway, or air carriers; and Eastern
and Western Canada will have to bear much
more than their fair share of the added
burden. Competition is bound to be much
greater in the future than in the past. This
will have the effect of diverting traffic from
the railways and will lead to demands for
still higher freight rates. The railways, in
order to meet this competition, will have to
decrease rates on many articles of trade in
Central Canada, and further increase rates in
non-competitive areas in the rest of Canada.
As east-west traffic is an instrument of
national policy, the added burden it creates
should be spread over the whole of Canada
and not be left to be borne by the East and
West as at present.
The Prairie Provinces have no protection
whatsoever from the general principle of railway rates made in accordance with "what the
traffic will bear". Higher rates are deducted
from the price the farmer would otherwise
receive for his produce. The manufacturer
can and does add the higher freight rates to
the price of manufactured goods, and the
farmers must pay. The producer of wheat
and other natural products, produced for sale,
pays freight rates on what he sells. He also
pays on what he buys. He is bled both going
and coming.
As to protective tariff s: At the time of confederation the Maritime Provinces were fairly
prosperous. A number of small industries
were being built up; there was shipbuilding
activity and tariffs were low so that there
was considerable coastal trade between the
Maritimes and the New England States.
Shortly after confederation, the national
policy of high tariffs was introduced in
Canada. The high protective tariff destroyed
the coastal trade between the Maritimes and
the New England States. Industrialists, in
seeking desirable locations, looked upon
Canada as a market exclusively for Canadian
products; they crowded into Central Canada
so as to be in the centre of the Canadian
market; there they produced and sold their
goods at excessive prices which the Canadian consumers were obliged to pay by reason
of the high tariffs and high freight rates.
Neither the Maritimes nor Western Canada
could compete with them by reason of the

tariff burdens and the long distances that they
would have to ship their goods to serve different markets throughout Canada.
Prices of primary commodities in the
domestic market are fixed by the price the
seller receives for surplus exports in the
foreign market. As the seller must meet
world competition, the tariff collected by
the country importing Canadian primary
products is deducted from the price the
Canadian seller receives.
On the other hand if the producer of
primary products imports goods from abroad,
he must pay for them at a reasonable price
a reasonable profit-plus the
-including
tariff on the goods he imports. If he buys
Canadian manufactured goods he must pay
the Canadian manufacturer a reasonable
price for them, including a reasonable profit,
plus a sum equivalent to the Canadian tariff.
Consequently, the producer of primary
products is out of pocket a sum equal to the
tariff imposed on what he sels as well as a
sum equal to the tariff on what he buys. This
particularly bits lumbering and fishing in
the eastern provinces -and British Columbia,
and wheat growing and stock raising on the
prairies. Thus the manufacturer collects for
the goods he sells a price that is excessive by
an amount equal to the tariff on similiar
imported goods.
As the tariff is imposed not for the benefit
of producers of raw materials, but as a policy
to build up the nation, the nation as a whole
should bear the cost of it.
The manufacturer must get for his goods
a fair price plus a reasonable profit. If the
demand falls off, he can close down his plant
until the market comes back. It is not so
with the farmer. He must cultivate his land
and grow crops, otherwise his land will
become so weedy that it will be almost valueless. He must move his products to export
points regardless of cost of production. Farmers on the prairies must produce for export.
Export must go on whether the returns to the
farmer are high or low. He must sell his
products so long as the price at the point of
export provides him a margin, however
small, over the cost of getting it there.
Now I come to the subsidy on feed grains.
The subsidy on feed grains grown on the
prairies and freighted to the eastern provinces and British Columbia, also discriminates against the farmers in the Prairie Provinces. The six eastern provinces and
British Columbia obtain feed grains from
the Prairie Provinces. To aid farmers
in Eastern Canada and British Columbia, Canada embarked on a policy of

SENATE
subsidizing them by paying freight charges
on feed grains from Port Arthur to
all parts of Eastern Canada, and from Calgary and Edmonton to all parts of British
Columbia. If it is well to subsidize farmers
and feeders of livestock in the East and in
British Columbia, is it not well to subsidize
farmers and feeders of livestock in the
Prairie Provinces?
Not only are we discriminated against by
being denied a subsidy that is paid to farmers and feeders of livestock in the other provinces, but we are taxed to subsidize farmers
and feeders in those provinces. The subsidy
is paid out of the general revenue of Canada.
I wonder if there is any other instance in
Canada in which one province is taxed to
assist its competitors in another? I doubt it.
Clearly the prairie farmer is taxed to subsidize farmers in all other parts of Canada
who are their competitors in grain-feeding
livestock.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Would the honourable
gentleman permit a question?
Hon. Mr. Ross: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Does the subsidy on
feed grains not provide an extra market
that you would not have for your feed grains
in the West?
Hon. Mr. Ross: No, I do not think so. We
get the price at Fort William, which is the
world price, and eastern buyers do not pay us
any extra price. If you want to encourage the
growing of feed grains, give us the same subsidy that is given to the farmers in the other
provinces and you will get results.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: May I ask my honourable friend what would be done with the
surplus feed grains that are now being used
in the East and in British Columbia? If we
were not subsidized in the way mentioned by
my honourable friend, I am quite sure we
could not buy the large quantities of feed
grains that we do.

Hon. Mr. Ross: It is our export sales, not the
small quantities that we sell to other provinces of Canada, that fix the price.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: It is not small quantities, but very large quantities that you ship
to us in the eastern provinces. What would
you do with them if you were not marketing
them there?
Hon. Mr. Ross: We could market them in
Europe. The export market is as large as it
was before this subsidy was granted.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: But the export market
is not sufficient?

Hon. Mr. Ross: Oh, I think it is.
In the past ten years Canada has paid
$161,740,000 in this subsidy. The unfair
treatment should be discontinued. The only
sound argument in favour of the subsidy is
that it creates traffic for the railways.
I now wish to make a few remarks on
railway operating costs. It is contended by
advocates of private ownership that the
Canadian Pacifie Railway makes a better
showing under private control than the
Canadian National Railway does under public operation. I do not believe this.
The Canadian Pacifie Railway was built
from the Atlantic to the Pacifie with the
object of making dividends for its shareholders. It was allowed to build through
the State of Maine and through the rich
Eastern Townships of Quebec. It had the
first choice of route through the prairies,
and the orchard lands of British Columbia
to the Pacifie coast. Its many branches tap
rich areas to the north and south to feed
its main line.
On the other hand the Canadian National
Railways absorbed the railways taken over
by Canada and have operated them as a
unified system since January 1, 1923. The
railways taken over were formerly disconnected systems of insolvent railways, or railways on the eve of insolvency, all of them
run-down and out of repair, all of them
unprofitable, many of them built, not for
profit, but to open unexplored country for
settlement or for military purposes, under
the ownership and control of Canada. These
development lines were not expected to be
profitable, particularly from the start. Furthermore, all the shares in the capital of the
insolvent companies and all other obligations of the insolvent privately owned roads
were taken over as liabilities of the new
company instead of the roads being allowed
to go through bankruptcy. To illustrate, $265
million in capital stock of the Grand Trunk
Railway was included at par value in a
liability of the National system. Yet its real
value as set by an arbitration board was only
$18 million.
Development lines have since been taken
over and are being operated by the Canadian
National Railways.
Further development
lines will no doubt be built in the future
Such lines are often unprofitable, particularly
in their initial stages. They may be bUilt to
link up existing facilities and provide railway connection with mining areas.
The
development of proven areas should not be
retarded by lack of transportation facilities.

DECEMBER 4, 1951
Under the circumstances, the Canadian
National is very much handicapped, yet fair
minded citizens must concede that it is being
operated as economically and wisely as is
the Canadian Pacific Railway.

carry on unless freight rates are raised-and
increased rates in the past have helped Central Canada much more than the rest of
Canada-or unless further subsidies are paid
out of the general revenue of Canada. To
subsidize the railways in order to enable
them to equalize rates or even to maintain
the existing rate structure would impose a
heavy burden on the taxpayer. Taxpayers
will be reluctant to assume the enormous
burden which would be involved in subsidies
to meet railway deficits.
In the depression days of 1913 and 1914 the
people were fearful of the influence wielded
by the railway companies throughout Canada,
and denounced them as an octopus of farShould the

people be taxed to subsidize the Canadian
Pacific Railway company, or any privately
owned railway, the whole country would
raise an uproar, whereas they would not
nearly so strenuously object of being taxed if
the railway were nationalized and operated
by a government board.
As to competition: The competitive position
of the railways vis-à-vis truck and water
competition must always be kept in mind by
railway union leaders as well as by railway
executives, with a view to ensuring that rail
transportation does not price itself out of the
market. Our railway system was built up
on the assumption that railways would have
a monopoly of land transportation. But now
we have competition from motor trucks, buses
and from air as well as water transport. That
competition is gradually growing more damaging to the railways and it will continue to
be more damaging.
The Turgeon Report of the Royal Commission on Transportation at page 265 says:
Conditions seem to indicate that these losses to
the railways by reason of truck traffic can be expected to increase as time goes on. The effect of
these losses in railway revenues is to throw a
heavier rate burden upon the traffic which is noncompetitive, that is long-haul and low-valued traffic.
This burden is borne especially by those sections of
the country, such as the Prairie Provinces, where
truck competition is very much weaker than in
Central Canada.

On the prairies distances are great. Il
the C.P.R. were nationalized, and the twc
systems amalgamated, a unified system ci
control of transportation could be brought

about by parliament declaring the TransCanada Highway as being for the general
advantage of Canada under the British
North America Act.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Quite right.
Hon. Mr. Ross: Water and air transportation are already under federal jurisdiction.
The Board of Transport Commissioners could
then develop into a body which would
co-ordinate on a competitive basis the future
railway, highway, waterway and air programs in Canada. Each form of transportation has its inherent advantages; and if we
are to have an efficient transportation system, each should perform the functions for
which it is best adapted.
Competition among different kinds of carriers is not on a fair basis. The railways,
at an enormous cost, have had to secure
rights-of-way and build roadbeds on which
to run their trains. In the case of the C.P.R.
this enormous cost was paid for largely by
the C.P.R. itself; in the case of the C.N.R.
the -cost was charged up against the railway.
For shippers by water, canals have been
built, waterways have been deepened and
harbours have been improved. All this at
an enormous cost, borne by the state-by

carriers of passengers and goods is not being
conducted on a fair basis.
The solution: Let us nationalize the Canadian Pacific Railway; amalganate it with
the Canadian National Railways, and operate
the two as a unified system; let us reduce the
capitalization of the C.P.R. by the amount of
the cost of that railway's right-of-way and
roadbed, and reduce the capital of the C.N.R.
accordingly; then by writing down the capital
charges of both railways, under a unified system railway economies to the extent of approximately $75 million a year could be
effected, freight rates could be fixed so that
railways could compete on a fair basis with
highway, water and air traffic, and we would
discontinue paying an annual subsidy to a
privately-owned public utility.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. G. P. Campbell: Honourable senators,
I do not wish to get into discussion about
the desirability of amalgamating the railways
of this country, but before speaking to the
bill before us I may say that I think we
should bear in mind the conditions that exist
in this country today as compared with those

SENATE
of the thirties, to which the honourable senator from Calgary (Hon. Mr. Ross) referred.
Canada today has a growing population which
is throwing quite a burden on the services
of the railways, and I do not think there is
much duplication or wastage in their operation. I for one feel that the competition
between the Canadian National Railways and
the Canadian Pacifie Railway, as it now exists,
is a very hèalthy and most desirable condition.
The bill before us provides for certain
amendments to the Railway Act. With regard
to the proposed method of determining
freight rates, the measure is somewhat revolutionary. I agree with the honourable leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) that the bill should
receive most careful scrutiny. When it has
been considered in committee, and the evidence taken there is before us, I would suggest that it be considered in Committee of the
Whole before receiving third reading.
I have stated that the bill, in one respect,
is revolutionary. It is an attempt to equalize
rates across Canada by establishing a uniform class rate from one end of the country
to the other. That is a method of ratemaking which I do not think exists in the
United States, and certainly it has never been
carried out in Canada. It means that 'all the
jurisprudence, and the rate cases that have
been decided in the past, will be of no value
in determining the questions which may arise
under this new principle. For that reason
we should carefully consider the legislation
to see that we, as members of this house,
do not decide technical matters and put them
in statute form in such a definite way that
they will be an obstacle in the way of the
Board of Transport Commissioners when they
come te rule upon the various applications
by the railways.
I stated that one of the purposes of the bill
is to equalize rates across Canada. That was
the principle announced when the legislation
was first introduced, but in the bill that
comes before us it has been pretty well
destroyed. In the first instance, the Maritimes are excluded from the principle of
equalization, by section 332A (4) (f), which
reads:
. . . rates applicable to movements of freight traffic
upon or over all or any of the lines of railway
collectively designated as the "Eastern lines" in the
Maritime Freight Rates Act . . .

I assume the wording of this paragraph is
intended to mean that the Maritimes are left
on the old basis, by which an arbitrary was
used to determine their rates. I would suggest that they might argue that the wording
of the section is broad enough to entitle them
to have a single freight rate from one end of
Canada to the other. I do not think that is

the intention of the section, but knowing the
able manner in which counsel for the Maritimes present their caseHon. Mr. Isnor: Order!
Hon. Mr. Campbell: -before the Board of
Transport Commissioners, I can see that in the
future that argument may well be advanced.
The Maritimes may say that they are not
affected by this equalization policy, but are
entitled to have rates fixed on all freight
originating on their lines and going to any
point across Canada. That, as I see it,
would be a ridiculous situation, and would
not help any part of Canada.
Let us now look at the western case. We
find there substantial exemptions from the
equalization provisions, in the form of transcontinental rates. In other words, the new
transcontinental rate basis will start just west
of Winnipeg, and extend to the Pacifie coast.
That simply means that a shipper in the East
may send his goods to Edmonton, for instance,
for a little more than he pays to ship to
Winnipeg; whereas the Winnipeg manufacturer, in order to ship to Edmonton, may
have to pay a substantially higher rate. Certainly there is a discrimination there.
The leader of the opposition raised what
I think is a very important point in connection with transcontinental rates. If the
railroads are forced to put in a rate not
greater than one and one-third times the
transcontinental rate to, say, Vancouver on
shipments of steel rails from Montreal, it
will mean that they will have to consider
whether the competitive rate which they
would ordinarily put in, enabling them to
compete with steamships operating fromfor instance, Montreal or Saint John to
Vancouver-is so low that they will be
penalized and suffer heavy loss if they have
to carry rails to Edmonton at the one and
one-third rate. The situation presents problems which I do not thing we can decide
here; but I think we should be aware of
them, and see whether there is not some
way of vesting in the Board of Transport
Commissioners a little wider discretion in
some of these matters.
The particular section which controls
the policy is definite in its character.
Section 332A declares that there shall be
equalization of rates. The language used in
subsection (2) is as follows:
The Board may, with a view to implementing the
national freight rates policy, require any railway
company
(a) to establish a uniform scale of mileage class
rates . . .

DECEMBER 4, 1951

That is to be read
section 329:

in conjunction

with

(a) shall specify class rates on a mileage basis
for all distances covered by the company's railway,
and such distances shall be expressed in blocks or
groups and the blocks or groups shall include relatively greater distances for the longer than for the
shorter hauls ...

In other words, there is a definite obligation
on the board to require the railways to file
these mileage class rates.
Again, if I interpret the legislation
entirely
and
correctly, that definitely
eliminates all arbitraries, and the effect will
be that the Maritime arbitraries that have
heretofore existed, and the basing arbitraries
in the central section, will disappear, and we
shall have a uniform class rate established
on a mileage basis.
I submit, honourable senators, that when
legislation so revolutionary in character is
defined in the directive manner that is
adopted in the bill now before us, it would
be much better to state that the board may
make regulations requiring this new basis to
be set up over a period of time. I do not
think that there is anyone today who is
qualified to say how this new basis of ratemaking will work in this country; and I am
sure that representations will be made
before the board by shippers from the central
provinces, by receivers of goods from the
western provinces, and by the provinces
themselves, to show it is not workable.
Probably I am one of those who are
cautious about making changes too rapidly.
But I believe this question bas been under
consideration in the United States for a very
long time, and that in fixing rates the
authorities still stick to the system of
arbitraries.
I do not think it is proper here and now
to take the time necessary to discuss all
these matters in detail. I merely wish to
repeat that in its present form the legislation is so definite in character that the Board
of Transport Commissioners will be greatly
handicapped in dealing with the many applications which will come before it in fixing
the new rates under this bill.
Another matter which occurs to me as a
cause for some concern, particularly with
respect to transcontinental rates, is the tariff
of rail and lake rates which has been in
existence for some length of time. I do not
know how it will be affected by the establishment of these new transcontinental rates; but
it seems to me that the basis here laid down
for fixing these rates at intermediate points
on a basis of one and one-third is a very
arbitrary one. It would have been better to

have left some discretion in the Board of
Transport Commissioners, rather than to tie
their hands and the hands of the railways
in dealing with this problem.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Did the commission recommend that?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: I cannot say. The only
other point I would like to mention, because
it does affect to some extent the central
provinces, is the basis of establishing competitive rates. That phase of the bill bas
been dealt with by the honourable senator
from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien) and the
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig). It
is true that the words in the bill seem to be
permissive, but those of us who have appeared
before the Board of Transport Commissioners
can readily see what will happen when
counsel for competitors engaged in transportation try to prevent the railways from
filing a competitive rate under this bill.
Section 331 states:
(2) The Board may require a company issuing a
competitive rate tariff to furnish at the time of
filing the tariff, or at any time, any information
required by the Board to establish that ...

Then follow a great number of items. When
parliament passes legislation in that form
there is, it seems to me, an obligation on the
board to require this information, because
that is the only basis on which the board is
now empowered to allow the filing of a
competitive tarifT. Parliament lays down what
information the board is required to get
before permitting these tariffs to be continued
in effect. It seems to me that this may work
great hardship on the railways, particularly
in the central provinces, where competition
from other forms of transportation is growing daily. I recognize that the railways
have established many competitive rates in
the central provinces to meet this competition. In each case they have had to file tariffs
and go before the Board of Transport Commissioners in order to put these rates into
effect or to continue them in effect; and it
seems to me that they should be left free
to file competitive tariffs and to meet this
competition, and not be handicapped by the
conditions which are laid down in the bill
before us. If parliament says "the board
may require", that provision will certainly
be taken advantage of when counsel appear
before the board to oppose some of the competitive rates which the railways will file.
I am pleased that we are going to have an
opportunity of hearing witnesses before the
committee tomorrow. I have been ýconsiderably impressed by some of the remarks made
by the provincial representatives who have
already appeared before us, but it seems to
me that representatives from the technical

SENATE

branch of the Board of Transport Commissioners could provide us with our most valuable evidence. They have been dealing with
these aroblems all along, and I am sure they
could throw some light on many of the questions which have been raised during this
debate.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
I want to refer briefly to one point which has
not been touched upon today. We in Alberta
look upon this legislation as a notable victory,
because we feel that for the past thirty or
forty years we have been working under
a distinct disadvantage in so far as freight
rates are concerned.
Let us take, for example, the important
ierm of canned goods. The rate on 100
pounds of canned goods from, say, Aylmer to
Vancouver, is $1.57, and from Aylmer to Calgary or Edmonton it is $3.23. There is a
great difference in these rates. Under this
present freight rate structure a person can
ship a 70,000 carload of canned goods from
from Aylmer to Vancouver for $1.57
per 100 pounds, and then ship them back to
Calgary or Edmonton for $1.40 per 100
pounids. This creates a rate of $2.97, which
is less than the $3.23 rate from Aylmer to
Calgary or Edmonton. The one and one-third
provision in the bill before us removes this
discrimination, and for this reason we feel
that this legislation is of great importance.
The Turgeon Commission, in which we have
a great deal of confidence, spent a lot of time
workin' this matter out. Representatives
fron Alberta
and Saskatchewan have
endorsed this legislation pretty much as it
now stands, and I am hopeful that it will
pass in its present form, because it will be
of the utmost benefit to the people of Alberta,
in that it will relieve them of the discrimination under which they have suffered for
so long.
Sonie Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Quinn: Honourable senators, I
I just want to say a few words with reference to the observation about the Maritime
Freight Rates Act, which was made by the
honourable gentleman from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Campbell).
I would judge from his
remarks that he is not quite familiar with
the reasons for the enactment of that legislation. The purposes of the Maritime freight
rates were thoroughly outlined in this house
the other day, and in this connection I would
refer my honourable friend from Toronto to
the recent speech of our honourable colleague
from Margaree Forks (Hon. Mr. MacLennan).

Hon. Mr. Campbell: My observation was
that the amendment to this bill which
excludes the Maritimes so far as the new
rate basis is concerned, is capable of a
broader interpretation than I think was
intended. I am quite aware of the purpose
of the Maritime freight rate legislation.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I do not intend to delay the house for long,
but as Chairman of the Committee on
Transport and Communications I think perhaps I should say a word or two about this
legislation. As has been said several times
this afternoon, this legislation is of vital
importance to every section of the country,
and so I should like to reiterate the invitation extended by the honourable leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) to all non-members
of the Transport Committee to attend the
meetings of that committee when it is dealing with Bill 12. If I may be permitted to
say so, the next meeting of that committee
will commence at 10.30 tomorrow morning.
Honourable senators will recall that at the
opening of this session a rather unusual
course was adopted in setting up the Committee on Transport and Communications
for the purpose of giving preliminary consideration to the Turgeon Commission report
and to certain bills which at that time were
before the other place but not officially before
us. The Committee on Transport has held
a number of meetings, and I think the wisdom of the course taken at the commencement of ihis session has become most apparent. I think all members of the committee
will agree that as a result of the meetings
we have held during the past two or three
weeks we have already obtained a large
background of useful information, and on
the basis of this information we shall have
a clearer understanding of the bill. May I
say that the general impression created by
the meetings is that this is a subject of tremendous complexity.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: As a civilian in matters of freight rate structure, so to speak, I
for one had no idea of what an extraordinary
number of different kinds of rates existed
in this country, or of the reasons for which
these rates exist.
Perhaps honourable senators will be interested in knowing who has appeared before
and have been heard by the committee. In
the first instance we heard the counsel for
the Maritime Provinces, and I am second to
no one in my admiration for the manner in
which he presented his case. As has already
been said today, it was as a result of his

DECEMBER 4, 1951
capable representation that an amendment
exempting the Maritimes from the operation
of the proposed legislation, was introduced
into the origiñlal bill. The committee then
heard counsel for Manitoba, Saskatchewan,
Alberta and British Columbia, and counsel
for the city of Winnipeg. It also heard
counsel for the C.P.R., who gave an exceedingly lucid exposition of the viewpoint of
his company. But the evidence we have
had so far is incomplete; for instance we have
not had any evidence from the Department
of Transport. I completely agree with the
honourable senator from Toronto that we
should have evidence from the experts of
that department, and I shall undertake to
see that it is provided for us. Nevertheless,
even from the incomplete evidence so far
produced before the committee, I think it is
clear that there are a number of points of
considerable difficulty and, indeed, in certain
cases, of really acrimonious dispute, which
have not been settled and remain for consideration.
Now, it is not my intention at this stageand, indeed, perhaps it would be inappropriate for me, as chairman of the committee
-to enter into any of the reasons which
have been advanced in opposition te certain
sections of the bill as it now stands. But
as an indication of the difficulty and the
complexity and of the very divergent views
which exist, may I refer to the section which
has been discussed to some extent here this
afternoon, namely, section 332B, which provides for the one-and-one-third rule in transcontinental competitive rates. That section
was strenuously endorsed by counsel for the
province of Alberta, which province, I think
it is only fair to say, would stand to gain
the lions share of any benefit that may come
from the passing of the section. It was
endorsed in a somewhat more moderate
degree by counsel for the province of Saskatchewan, part of which, as was pointed
out this afternoon, would stand to gain from
the section, and part of which would not.
On the other hand, it was most strenuously
opposed by counsel for the Province of British
Columbia, by counsel for the Province of
Manitoba, by counsel for the City of Winnipeg and by counsel for the Canadian Pacific
Railway.
Now, as I say, I do not want to go into the
merits of that dispute in any way, but I do
suggest to the Senate that in the consideration which we give to these proposals in
committee, and particularly to the proposals

which have roused such vigorous controversy, the Senate should feel itself absolutely
free to decide one way or the other as to
what it thinks would be the best solution.
And I am quite sure that the members of
the committee, after taking into consideration all the representations that are made
on all sides, will reach a conclusion that
ultimately will be brought back to this house
for its approval.
Hon. Mr. Farris: May I ask my hunourable
friend a question? Was that one-and-onethird rate recommended by the Turgeon
Commission?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes, it was. I am
unable to refer my honourable friend to
the pertinent pages in the report, but it was
recommended by the commission.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I interrupt for a
moment? I think that, in fairness to the
honourable senator from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris), it should be said that the
proposal was introduced by the commission
itself, and was never urged by anybody in
argument before the commission.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I think that is substantially so.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I asked about that from
both sides, and that is the answer I got.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I would suggest that
when the committee reports the bill back to
the house it would perhaps be advantageous
for us to consider the bill section by section
in Committee of the Whole. Every member
of the house would then have a chance to
express his view clearly on each of the sections, some of which, as has been said, are
of the very greatest importance.
I am sorry to have detained the house for
so long.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, in
view of the importance of many of the statements which have been made this afternoon,
I move adjournment of the debate.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: We are getting near
the end of the session, and I fear that we shall
have to spend quite a number of days in
committee on this bill. In these circumstances
would my honourable friend not see fit to continue the debate now?
Hon. Mr. Reid: It is not our responsibility
that this important measure has come to us
in the closing days of the session. I wish to
get some information to challenge certain
important statements that have been made

194

CANADA-UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
TAX CONVENTION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Salter A. Hayden moved the second
reading of Bill 28, an Act to amend an Act
to amend the Canada-United States of
America Tax Convention Act, 1944.
He said: Honourable senators, in June of
last year parliament passed an Act amending an original tax convention which had

SENATE
been made between the United States and
Canada and modifying and supplementing
certain provisions of that convention. Subsequently the convention came before the
United States Senate for ratification, and in
the protocol of exchange for the ratification
of the modifying and additional provisions,
the Senate made one reservation.
The
Canadian authorities accepted that reservation, and that is the reason why this bill is
before us.
This reservation has to do with Article
VII which, as contained in the bill passed
last year to ratify the amending convention,
dealt with the matter of a Canadian residen
performing personal services in the United
States. According to the convention that
was ratified, if this person in his capacity as
an employee or officer of a limited company
or some other Canadian entity, or as an
employee of a resident of Canada, performed

period of not more than 183 days, his salary
for such services would not be subject to
income tax in the United States. Another
provision in the convention was to the effect
that other personal services rendered by a
Canadian within the same time limit would
not subject him to income tax in the United
States if his salary in respect to those services
did not exceed $5,000. The convention which
was ratified in June of last year carried the
following exception:

Hon. Saller A. Hayden moved concurrence
in the amendments made by the committee.
He said: Honourable senators, the amendments proposed in the committee's report
look very formidable; they certainly are
bulky; but there is a principle behind them
all. The bill in the form in which it came
before us proposed that various sections of
va rious statutes of Canada be amended by
the deletion or the addition of certain words.
Now, the practice which prevails when legis-

personal services in the United States for a

The provisions of paragraph 1 (a) of this Article
shall have no application to the professional earnings of such individuals as actors, artists, nusicians,
and professional athletes.

The United States Senate took the position that this was discriminatory-that there
was no reason why these people should be
singled out and put in a separate categoryand therefore made a reservation in the protocol of exchange which would eliminate
this exception. As a result, actors, artists,
musicians, and professional athletes are now
included among those persons rendering
personal services in the United States whoif they do not spend more than 183 days in
one year in the United States, and their
individual incomes from these services do not
exceed $5,000-are not subject to income tax
in that country. This provision operates in
reverse, so that a United States resident
performing such services in Canada would
not in those circumstances be subject to
Canadian income tax. In each case, however,
the person performing these services would
be subject to income tax according to the law
of his own country.

Hon. Mr. Farris: If the income is more than
$5,000, is the person taxed on the whole
income or just on the amount in excess of
$5,000?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: If the income is more
than $5,000 he is taxed on the full amount.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill xas
read the second time.

Hon. Mr. Hayden: With leave of the Senate,

FORCES BILL

lation is being amended, and the preferred

practice, is first to repeal the section that
is being amended and then re-enact it in its
amended form. So when we were considering this bill and found that the amendments
were made in the way I have described, we
simply struck them out and substituted sections which conform to the preferred practice. As a result, anyone referring to the
legislation later on will not need to juggle
half a dozen books on his knees while he tries
to find out what the final form of the legislation is, but will have this information right
before him in the one statute.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, may
I add just a word? It is my hope that in
future when the Law Officers of the Crown
are drafting bills for amendment of statutes
they will profit from what the Senate has
done in this case. Our comnittee's amendments to this bill will, as my honourable
friend has just said, enable anyone-the layman as well as the practising barrister--to
find out from one statute just what amendments have been made to all the other
statutes concerned.
The motion was agreed to.

THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
with leave of the Senate, I move that the
bill be read the third time now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
RAILWAY BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. Robertson for the second reading of
Bill 12, an Act to amend the Railway Act.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
my chief reason for adjourning the debate
yesterday afternoon was that I felt that certain remarks made by the senator from Calgary (Hon. Mr. Ross) should not go long
unchallenged.
I agree with previous speakers who have
said that the freight rates question is one of
the most complicated ever to come before
parliament. No one, I imagine, is more
aware of its complexity than the senator from
De Loriinier (Hon. Mr. Vien), who for five
years was Deputy Chief Commissioner of
the Board of Railway Commissioners, as the
Board of Transport Commissioners was then
known. After having given some study to
Bill 12 and listened to evidence given us
before the Transport and Communications
Committee, I seriously doubt if any member
of the Senate or of the other house realizes
all the implications and intricacies of the
present freight rates structure. If you look
at the bill you will note that it mentions,
for instance, class rates, commodity rates
and competitive rates, and that on top of
those there are first class double rates,
second class double rates, first class treble
rates and so on. We in British Columbia
have not been able to understand why, for
instance, cast iron pipe coming from the
East is shipped at the fifth class rate, while
lumber is shipped tenth class.
Ever since I have been in parliament I
have realized that parliament is not the
place to argue the complicated question of
freight rates. Al one can do is is mention
a few cases. I an one however who is not
enamoured of royal commissions. It is my
opinion that since confederation governments
have used this device, and that whenever
criticism has become so severe that the government of the day has felt that something
had to be done it has generally speaking set
up a royal commission. I challenge any honourable senator to tell me of any great

changes or benefits that have accrued from
any royal commission which has sat in
Canada since confederation. There may have
been some, but I doubt it.
I would emphasize the fact that this bil.
with all its complicated and far-reaching
effects, comes to us in the dying days of the
session, and may be passed without any member knowing its full impact on railway law
or freight rates. Whilst we are in favour of
equalization of freight rates, I think it must
be frankly admitted that this bill will not
bring about that result. Indeed, by reason of
a directive contained in section 332B-and
which might very well work to the disadvantage of some provinces-it is only going to
tie the hands of the Board of Transport
Commissioners, and discriminate against
British Columbia.
The Senate was set up to perform certain
duties, among them being the duty of protecting the rights of the provinces. With this
bill before us the situation is somewhat
unusual, as only eight of the ten provinces
are vitally interested in the freight rate
structure. Ontario and Quebec have had low
rates that have been the envy of the other
provinces, who naturally have asked for like
treatment.
It should be pointed out here, that it is
not the practice to bring in amendments to
I fear,
the Railway Act every session.
therefore, that if any injustice or hardship
should result from the passage of this
measure, it might be a long time before
amendments would be brought in to correct
them. So I say most emphatically again
honourable senators, that this bill will not
provide freight rate equalization.
While I do not wish to labour the question
this afternoon, I would point out that British
Columbia bas spent huge sums of money in
appearing before the Board of Transport
Commissioners-previously the Board of Railway Commissioners-seeking equalization, but
without success. This bill certainly does not
equalize grain rates. One or two pertinent
facts should, I think, be placed before this
honourable chamber to support the contention
of the people of British Columbia that they
have received unjust treatment. We in that
province have never complained about the
help given by way of subsidy to the Maritime
Provinces when we were carrying a much
heavier freight rate burden, and that without
any subsidy. I have noted that many members of parliament-I hope there are no
senators among them-have the idea that
the railway has to climb up over the mountain
to reach the west coast of British Columbia,
and that this is the cause of the high freight
rate. That is far from the truth. The facts
are that the Canadian Pacific has, over the

SENATE
mountains, a grade of 2-2 per cent; formerly
it was more than four per cent. The C.P.R.,
being the first railway to cross British Columbia, did so with, it is true, some difficulties.
But in the light of evidence which I have
before me as to the construction and operation costs in other parts of Canada, those
difficulties have been greatly magnified. It
may surprise some honourable senators to
know that the costs of construction, and later
:he costs of maintenance, of the C.P.R.
:hrough British Columbia, have been less than
:n some other parts of Canada. This evidence
has been given before the Board of Transport
Commissioners many times and on numerous
occasions. We in British Columbia have not
had full advantage of the Canadian National
facilities, a road which has as low a grade as
one-half of one per cent from Edmonton to
New Westminster and Vancouver. I should
like to know of any other part of Canada
that has a comparable low grade. But the
C.P.R. has been the yardstick in rate-making.
It is a well-known fact that the C.N.R. can
haul three times as many cars as can the
C.P.R. with a comparable type of locomotive.
We accept the fact that the C.P.R. must
use what is known as "pusher" engines on
certain grades going into and out of British
Columbia.
At a hearing before the board in 1949, one
of the commissioners gave some figures by
way of comparing costs throughout Canada
generally. From British Columbia's point of
view they are most interesting. I quote:
In this respect Exhibit 96 shows that district costs
per thousand gross ton-miles, five-year average
1943-47, were: British Columbia, $4.02, Alberta,
S3.28, Saskatchewan, $3.34, Manitoba, $2.48, Algoma,
53.03, Ontario, $3.76, Quebec, $5.27, New Brunswick,
$4.95, Quebec Central Railway, $8.14, and Dominion
Atlantic Railway, $8.08. If it be accepted that such
data are a reasonably accurate measuring of costs
m the various districts, then, from a cost standpoint only, rates should be highest in Quebec
Central Railway district and lowest in Manitoba
district.

A little later the commissioner said this:
It will be readily apparent that costs by themselves do not determine the profitableness or unprofitableness of a transportation service. Costs
must be considered in relation to revenues. Exhibit
94 indicates that average revenues per thousand
gross ton-miles by regions, for the twelve months
ending October 31, 1948, were: Pacific, $5.54; Prairie,
$4.16; Eastern, $5.58 and All Lines, $4.94.
The average earnings per thousand gross tons
w ere therefore $1.38 higher in the British Columbia
region than in the prairie region; only four cents
less than in the Eastern region, and sixty cents
rreater than the average of AIl Lines.

One could extend remarks along this line

over the whole afternoon, but I am not going

o do so. I merely bring these few figures
oefore the Senate to show that we in British
Columbia have been, shall I say, misrepresented, even in parliament, by briefs purport:ng to show that maintenance and other

costs are great-er in British Columbia than
in other parts of Canada. I do not suppose
that we shall ever get equalization.
One of the bones of contention has to do
with rates on the carriage of grain, and
I want to reply to what the honourable senator from Calgary (Hon. Mr. Ross) said as
regards grain and grain subsidies. I know
he will find these remarks interesting, and
I believe he will get some surprises, because
I have had time to dig up some very fascinating figures. For example, a train carrying
grain leaves Calgary or Edmonton for British
Columbia. The grain in one car is charged
at the rate of 20 cents per hundred pounds;
the grain in the car behind, until a few years
ago, was charged 414 cents per hundred
pounds. This charge has been reduced to
36 cents, but there is now before the board
an application by the railways to restore the
rate to 411 cents. We in British Columbia
could never understand why grain transported
in two cars pulled by the same engine over
the same track and handled by the same number of crew or crews, should be subjected
to a charge of twice as much in the car
consigned to British Columbia as in the car
going to our competitors or to other people
abroad. I might point out to the honourable
senator from Calgary that we were for many
years at a disadvantage, particularly in the
British market, because certain of our
products were undersold by foreign exporters,
particularly Swedes and Norwegians, by
reason of the fact that they could obtain
Canadian grain more cheaply than we in
British Columbia could get it. It is evident
also that our idea of equality of freight rates
is different from that of the Board of Transport Commissioners, whose rulings have
proved very prejudicial to us over the years.
I could quote extensively from various findings, but I will read only one small paragraph
to demonstrate the confiict of views between
the board and the ordinary citizen of British
Columbia. It is stated in the Grain Rates
case, at page 109:
Discrimination may or may not fail within the
provisions of the Act. The Act as it has always
been interpreted by the board only forbids discrimination when it is undue and unreasonable.
Mere mileage comparisons do not afford criteria of
discrimination. All facts material must be given
weight.

The Board of Transport Commissioners in
its findings bas always maintained that,
under the Railway Act, discrimination is
allowable; and when complaint is made of
"unjust" discrimination, of course the board
disagrees with the representatives of the
general public who appear before them. They
are told "What you are complaining of is
not unjust discrimination. It may be discrimination, but it is not unjust."

DECEMBER 5, 1951
My own idea, which I think I share with
the general public, is that freight rates
should be equal across Canada. It costs no
more to haul goods one hundred or five
hundred miles in British Columbia than to
move them the same distance in the Maritimes, the prairies or the eastern provinces.
It is my opinion that in this matter the hands
of the railways will yet be forced by trucking competition. The trucker knows nothing
of different classes of rates; all he asks you
is what amount you have to haul, and the
mileage, and he hauls it at a set price.
As regards the present bill, it is my considered opinion that it will not bring about
equality of freight rates, and that equality
will never be achieved so long as continental
rates afid competitive rates to the coast,
that are higher than they are to the East
or to the prairies, or in Ontario or Quebec.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Do I understand the
honourable senator to urge that all transcontinental competitive rates should be completely eliminated?
Hon. Mr. Reid: No. I am not going into
that kind of an argument just now,Hon. Mr. Vien: Well, I do not understand
him.
Hon. Mr. Reid: -because that matter is
rather involved. Al we are asking is that
the same rates be put into effect in our
province as apply elsewhere. One of the
difficulties we have had with the railwaysas perhaps the honourable senator from De
Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien) knows better than
anyone here-relates to this matter of costs.
I recall that Mr. Flintoft, at one time chief
counsel for the C.P.R., stated under oath that
it was not possible for his company to tel
the board what it cost to haul any article;
and that, specifically, they did not know the
cost of hauling grain. We contended, and
the statement was not disputed by the railway interests, that the company made money
on the rates charged on grain for export, and
we wanted to know why grain for domestie
use was not entitled to the same low scale
of charges as grain for export.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Does the honourable senator agree with the statement that it is impossible accurately to determine the exact cost
of moving one ton of any particular commodity one mile?
Hon. Mr. Reid: To speak frankly, I was
always very sceptical about the answers we
got on that point. One reason for suspicion is the reluctance of the railway companies to be pinned down to a statement on
whether the hauling of grain, or any other
article, is or is not profitable. It was stated

openly at the time, before the board and
elsewhere, that it was impossible for anyone
to speak with accuracy on this matter of
costs.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I prefer not to interfere
with my honourable friend's submission, but
the reason given for that statement was that
there are so many items which can be distributed only arbitrarily: for instance, overhead fixed charges, and general expenses,
which cannot be accurately determined and
pinned down to one particular unit of trade.
Hon. Mr. Reid: If I may give the honourable senator one illustration, I think it will
show very clearly why we feel that we are
unjustly dealt with. Grain moving west to
Vancouver for domestic use, and travelling
765 miles over Canadian National Railway
lines, cost us for freight 411 cents per
hundred pounds. Yet that same grain, or
similar grain, can be moved three thousand
miles, from Calgary to Halifax, for 43 cents
per hundred pounds. Is there any reason
why so high a charge should be made on so
much shorter a distance? The train crew
changes, I believe, every hundred miles.
Hon. Mr. Horner: One hundred and fifty.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It is one hundred and fifty
miles? Consider the number of changes of
crew over the longer haul and the expense
of running that carload of grain from Calgary
to Halifax; compare that with the cost of
transportation to the B.C. coast over the haltof-one-per-cent grade to New Westminster
or Vancouver; then contrast the rate of 43
cents per hundred to Halifax with the price
of 41j cents to the west coast. Will any
honourable senator attempt to defend such a
disparity? Al we are asking for is equality
in the matter of costs. I challenge the railroads to deny that on the 20 cents export
rate they are, and were, making money. They
did not deny it. I told them that if it paid
them to haul grain for export at 20 cents per
hundred pounds, we in British Columbia
should get the same rate, and that we objected
to having to pay as much for freight to
Vancouver or New Westminster as is paid for
the much longer haul-1,180 miles, I thinkto Fort William.
Hon. Mr. Howden: Does the honourable
senator really believe that the railways
could give an equal rate all across Canada?
I understand that in the central provinces
the railway rate is non-remunerative. Well,
if they are going to apply non-remunerative
rates all across the country they might as
well discontinue the railways.
Hon. Mr. Reid: You heard the honourable
senator from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien)

SENATE
ask me a few moments ago if I agreed that
it was impossible for the railway companies
to tell whether a rate paid or not. Well,
if they cannot tell whether a rate pays or
not, how can it be said that any rate is
non-remunerative?

make sure that they are going to receive the
benefits they anticipate under this legislation. We believe, rightly or wrongly, that
if section 332B goes through, the transcontinental rates to the coast will disappear and the
rates in Alberta will increase. We could
argue pro and con on this all day, of course,
but I am only giving my opinion after listening carefully to what was said in committee.
Naturally the representatives from British
Columbia hold no brief for Alberta, but they
point out that if the present rate on canned
goods to the coast is done away with, the rate
to Alberta also will be increased.
I should like to take a few minutes to deal
with some statements made by the honourable
senator from Calgary (Hon. Mr. Ross). May
I say to him in all kindliness that I really was
surprised to hear him, having been brought
up a Liberal, talk about socialization or nationalization of our railways? Those of us
who know a little about the Old Country are
well aware that the railways in Great Britain deteriorated when they were taken over
by the government of that country. During the last war I had the honour of being
appointed to what was known as the War
Expenditures Committee, whose duty it was
to inspect both privately-owned and government-owned armament plants and shipbuilding yards. It is on record that the privatelyowned plants turned out products far cheaper
and far quicker than any state-owned or
state-managed plant. In my opinion, nationalization or socialization of railways will not
begin to solve our railway problems. I do
not know what position the CCF now takes
in this matter, but I well remember the present leader of that party advocating the
nationalization of both railways, and so I
was really surprised to read that counsel
from Saskatchewan opposed such action. I
am just wondering why the change in policy.
I am glad if that province has seen the light;
it was certainly interesting to hear counsel
for Saskatchewan come out openly in opposition to the unification or nationalization of
the two railways. Then, too, I maintain that
even though this should come about it would
not solve the railway problerns. To my mind
one of the factors that bas kept the government-owned railway up to its high level of
service has been the competition of the
C.P.R.; and the C.N.R. has had a like influence on the C.P.R. That is the way I see it.
But just arnalgamate those railways under
state ownership, and I say "God help us."
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Hayden: We are told that investigations show that the rate in the central
provinces is non-remunerative because of
truck competition. The railways have to
meet that competition and from the railway
standpoint this is non-remunerative.
Hon. Mr. Reid: One must admit that volume
of traffic and other factors enter into the
price the railway .companies charge for
hauling goods, but I refer again to the question asked a little while ago about the railways not being able to tell whether a rate
is paying or not.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I do not believe that is what
I said. I did not say that the railway companies could not determine whether a movement of traffic under a certain rate was paying or losing. They can do this, but they
cannot accurately give the exact cost of
moving one ton of any particular commodity
one mile. To determine whether a railway
carries traffic at a loss or at a profit, and to
give accurate figures for moving one ton of
a particular commodity one mile iare two
entirely different matters. There are too
many factors that have to be arbitrarily
adjusted and determined.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I can well understand that
on many small articles it might be extremely
difficult, if not impossible, for a railway company to determine whether a rate is paying
or not, but I do not think it should be so
difficult for them to determine this in relation to a product such as grain, where millions of bushels are shipped both east and
west.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: While figures of that
kind cannot be obtained with absolute
accuracy, can they not be obtained with
sufficient accuracy for practical purposes?
Hon. Mr. Reid: We believe they can be,
and that is why we argued that if the rate
of 20 cents on export grain shipped to British
Columbia was profitable, there was no reason
why they should charge us twice as much for
hauling domestic grain te British Columbia.
We got no answer te that.
I turn now to section 332B. After listening to the representations made by the legal
counsel for the province of British Columbia,
as one who comes from that province, I feel
that I must oppose this section. I should like
Hon. Mr. Reid: I wish to refer now to some
to point out to those who have spoken on other statements made by the honourable
behalf of the province of Alberta that they senator from Calgary. He dealt with the

DECEMBER 5, 1951
subsidies paid on the eastward and westward
movement of feed grains from the Prairie
Provinces for consumption in other provinces.
In a moment or so I intend to place some
interesting figures on this before the Senate,
but first let me say that I disagree entirely
with his statement that the subsidies on feed
grain have not helped the Prairie farmers.
The elevators are bursting with grain today.
As I pointed out in an earlier speech, it cost
me almost $4 for a 100-pound sack of wheat
of a grade which before the war would have
been burned by the farmers. Now, where
would they find a market for that inferior
wheat if it were not shipped for feed purposes to the other provinces? I can readily
understand that there is a very large market
for milling wheat of good quality, but these
feed grains are not suitable for direct
human consumption.
Hon. Mr. Ross: Why not subsidize us, as
the West and East are subsidized?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Would my honourable
friend wait till he hears the figures that I
have here showing what has been paid to
the Prairie Provinces in subsidies? After
that, if he wishes to make any comment I
shall be glad to listen to it. From his
remarks of yesterday some people might
infer that all subsidies were being paid for
the benefit of British Columbia and the eastern provinces, and that the poor prairies
were being, I will not say victimized, but
hard done by, because not only are the
farmers on the prairies taxed to maintain
these subsidies, but grain produced in British
Columbia and the eastern provinces competes
with products of the prairies.
Let us see what the subsidies to the Prairie
Provinces have amounted to. One of my
reasons for adjourning the debate yesterday
afternoon was that I thought we might as
well have this information on the record
the day after my honourable friend's speech.
The total amount of the subsidies paid out
by the federal government from October 1941
to October 1951 on feed grains shipped from
the Prairie Provinces to British Columbia,
Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova
Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland, was $161,740,000. That is a lot of
money.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Was that only on feed
grains?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Only on feed grains. They
would include wheat, oats, barley and rye.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I thought perhaps the subsidies paid on shipments of Alberta coal to
Ontario might be included.

Hon. Mr. Reid: No. That is another matter.
Hon. Mr. Ross: How much of that was paid
to the Prairie Provinces by way of subsidy?
Hon. Mr. Reid: All that assistance was
given for the hauling of grains. None of it
was paid to the Prairie Provinces, but-and
this is the important point-those provinces
found a market for 54,087,172 bushels which
otherwise they might not have been able to
sell, and therefore the price of grains in the
three Prairie Provinces thernselves was
raised.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Now may I ask my
honourable friend a question?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Is he really serious in
suggesting that the Prairie Provinces could
not have found a market for those feed
grains without these enormous subsidies?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I wish I had the time to
go into this question of assistance to the
Prairies, because-if I may digress for a
moment-one of the things that have surprised me this session is the attitude of
prairie senators and members of the other
house towards price control. They are al
against it, yet in the Prairie Provinces there
is a really strong price fixing system. At
present I, as an individual, cannot purchase
feed grain, for instance, from an individual
farmer in Alberta or Saskatchewan, and for
any grains that I do obtain the price is fixed
as it never was before. I am wondering
how Liberals who express themselves as
opposed to price controls can say that a
system like that is all right for the prairies.
Now I will get back to the assistance that
the prairies have received. That assistance
has been paid under the following heads:
Prairie Farm Income, Prairie Farm Assistance Payments-and, to prevent anyone
from jumping to a wrong conclusion, I will
point out here that I have been careful in
my figures, and so have deducted the one per
cent refund made by the farmers on Prairie
Farm Assistance. I will not go into all the
other subsidies, or the subvention on coal
which the senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) mentioned a few moments ago.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I dislike interrupting a
speaker, but may I ask my honourable friend
another question, so that I may be clear on
the point? Does he contend that these freight
subsidies were paid to the coarse grain
farmers of Western Canada?
Hon. Mr. Reid: No. The subsidies were
paid to encourage farmers in British Columbia, Ontario and the provinces to the east,
including Newfoundland, who use these feed
grains.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. Crerar: In fact, the subsidies were
for the benefit of the feeders, the users of
the coarse grains in British Columbia and
the eastern provinces?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I have just said that.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Through lower freight
rates.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes. But the subsidies are
twofold. On the one hand, they help the
poultry farmers and the dairy farmers in
British Columbia and the central and eastern
provinces, and make it easier for them to stay
on the farm; on the other hand, they help
the Prairie Provinces by providing a market
for grains, particularly wheat, of a poor
grade, which grains are used to good advantage in British Columbia, Ontario and the
other provinces. The advantage is not all
one-sided, by any means.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: May I ask my honourable friend a question? Perhaps he has
already answered it, in effect. Does he
assume that through the subsidy to the railways there was provided in British Columbia,
Ontario, Quebec, and the eastern provinces
a market for feed grains that would not have
been secured elsewhere?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes, that is right.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I think, if I may say so,
that he is fundamentally incorrect in his
assumption.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Then we can agree to
differ.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I do not wish to interrupt unnecessarily, but I believe that if the
honourable gentleman would analyse the
situation a little more fully be would find
that every one of the bushels sent from the
prairies to the other provinces under subsidy
represented a sacrifice in price to the prairie
farmers.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Whether or not they made
a sacrifice is again a matter of opinion.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: It has been proved
--

-~----

----

Hon. Mr. Reid: I hope that someone will
deal with that problem this afternoon.
Hon. Mr. Cîeîaî: I promise my friend that
this will be the last interruption I will make.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That is all right with me.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Does my friend not recall
that for several years prairie farmers who
grew feed grains were denied an outlet in the
American market in order that British Columbia and Ontario might be supplied, and that
that denial resulted in a severe loss to the
producers?

Hon. Mr. McDonald: And during the war
years.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That does not seem to
detract from or contradict anything t have
said.
Hon. Mr. Ross: I would also like to uggest to the honourable gentleman that in
circurmstances where we have a surplus
of an export product, such as grain, the
foreign market fixes the price of the product,
and that a portion of it which is sold for
feed purposes in Canada does not increase

Fur:hermore, I want to say to my fried tha:
his province is not only importing grain; the
castern farmers are importing cattle to which
the grain will be fed. Give us on the prairie
a subsidy and we will feed the cattle, ship
them direct to the market, and avoid the double
shipping costs on grain and cattle.
Hon. Mr. Reid: We will do the same, if ou
will be liberal and give us a free market.
Hon. Mr. Duff: Atta boy!
Hon. Mr. Reid: But do not prohibit us
tram buying by reason of the high price.
Hon. Mr. Duff: There must be a lot of Tories
here.
Hon. Mr. Reid: In the same years, 1941-50,
the
wheat
acreage
reduction
subsidy
amounted to $86,388,000. There was no neglect
there.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: Was that to all the
provinces in Canada?
Hon. Mr. Reid: That was to three provinces,
Manitoba,
Saskatchewan
and
Alberta.
Through Prairie Farm Assistance the farmers
received $111,453,000, and as Prairie Farm
Rehabilitation they got $19,928,000.
Those
three items total $217,769.000.
From that
amount I deduct the one per cent paid back
by the farmers, estimated to be close to $25
million. It is interesting to note, in fairness
to the provinces, that the payments made by
Manitoba far exceed those paid by the other
two provinces.
Hon. Mr. Howden: Does my trient: mêan
tie amount paid ta Manitoba?
Hon. Mr. Reid: No; the payments maie
by the farmers in Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. Horner: To what year does my

friend refer when he speaks of the payment
of one per cent by the farmers?
Hon. Mr. Reid: I have before me all thi
years from 1940 to 1950, but I am not surf
exactly what year the one per cent payments
under the Prairie Farm Assistance Act started.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Many years ago.

DECEMBER 5, 1951
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes, they started many
years ago; and Manitoba stands high in payments to the government.
Hon. Mr. Horner: There must be some mistake in your figures, because Saskatchewan
has always produced more wheat and other
grain than Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. Reid: There are the official figures,
and I assure you there is no mistake in my
quoting of them.
I now corne back to the bill. For my part
I should like to see the measure set over
for a tine, though I have little hope that
that will be done. But for the record I
should like to say something about the biggest
problem the railways face today, that of loss
of passenger traffic. I cannot understand why
the royal commission had little, if anything,
to say about that question. True, sorne
mention was made of passenger fares, but
anyone who studies railway problems today
knows that the real problern Ls the loss of
traffic. Large and expensive trains are carrying too few passengers. In the year 1940 the
railways carried a total of 31,139,092 passengers; in 1950 the total passenger carriage
was 21,969,87. The first nine months of 1951
shows 21,917,511 passengers. Over the tenyear period, 1940-1950, there was a drop of
10 million passengers.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: May I be allowed to
interrupt my friend for a moment? I think it
only fair to the Turgeon Commisi'on to say
that the reason they did not deal particularly
with passenger traffic was that under the
order in council by which they were set up
their attention was particularly directed to
matters of freight traffic.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I am glad my friend mentioned that point, because I have a question
to ask about it. I notice that the order in
council, P.C. 6033, differs from the order
It will be

observed that the order in council commences
with clauses 1 and 2, followed by paragraphs
(a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f); then there are
three more clauses, 3, 4 and 5. If that order
is compared with the order setting up the
commission it will be observed that clauses
3, 4 and 5 are left out. Clause 4, which
I consider an important one, reads:

Hon. Mr. Reid: I suppose one should ask
this question of the government.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The only reason I
interrupted was that I did not want the
honourable senator's remarks to be takenand I am sure that he did not intend that
they should-as criticism of the commission.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I corne back to what I
regard as the biggest problern of the railways, the loss of passenger traffic. I noticed
in the press the other evening that Donald
Gordon, head of the Canadian National, intimated that his organization might go into
the trucking business. There is nothing to
indicate whether he had in mind a supplementary trucking enterprise or a complementary undertaking. If he is thinking of a
supplementary trucking operation, to enable
the railways to compete with the trucking
companies, then he should also consider
going into the bus business.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The railway is in the bus
business in some provinces.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Not generally.
Hon. Mr. Euler:. The Canadian Pacifie runs
buses.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It is a weIl-known fact that
the Canadian Pacifie Railway can abandon
mileage of tracks much more easily than can
the Canadian National. I will tell you why.
Immediately it is known that the Canadian
National proposes to abandon part of its
tracks, representations are made to the government questions are raised in the house,
and the matter becomes political; government members will think seriously before
they allow the proposal to go through. That,
I say, applies particularly to the Canadian
National Railways, not to the Canadian Pacifie
Railway.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Is it not a fact that railways cannot abandon any portion of their
tracks without the consent of the Board of
Transport Commissioners?

Hon. Mr. Reid: That is true, but when the
matter goes before the board it has by then
taken on a highly political aspect. I have
seen that happen time and time again. I
remember a case in point. In or around

thern had travelled by motor-car. He saidand rightly-"You have given me the answer
as to why the line should be abandoned."
I have not a great deal more to say. I
wanted to raise my voice in protest on behalf
of British Columbia, and to warn the Senate
that on such a complicated question as freight
rates, which is a matter that nobody understands thoroughly, we would do well to hesitate and to give the bill a second thought, and
perhaps a third one. It was also in my mind
that I should not let the honourable senator
from Calgary (Hon. Mr. Ross) get away
unchallenged with his statements on subsidies and on the socialization of the railways.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
I would like to make a few remarks. The
honourable senator from New Westminster
complained that the lower overseas. rates
on grain enabled livestock breeders in Denmark and Sweden to undersell the British
Columbia producers on the British market.
We who live in the Prairie Provinces had
a grievance of somewhat the same kind. We
felt that farmers in other parts of Canada,
enjoying a milder climate, getting our feedstuffs at very low rates, and less hampered
than ourselves by high living costs, were at
an undue advantage in the British market.
However, I admit that the honourable senator has a just claim for consideration; and
I, too, am fearful of any so-called equalization which does not include both Ontario
and Quebec. The farmers of British Columbia have at least the advantage of being
near the coast. We in Saskatchewan live
in the centre of Canada, and what happens to
the railways is of greater concern to us than,
possibly, any other part of the country.
Some British Columbia produce-fruit, for
example-can be trucked; but, for the movement of our main crop, namely wheat, we
are wholly dependent upon the railroads,
and for this reason also our mileage of railroad track is very great.
As regards the honourable senator's reference to the 1 per cent payment, it is likely
that the production of grain in Saskatchewan
this year will exceed 300 million bushels,
as -compared with a production for Manitoba
of about 50,000,000 bushels. The area of
cropped land in Saskatchewan is very large:
as a matter of fact our province grows more
grain than all the other provinces combined.
The statement that Manitoba leads in the
aggregate of 1 per cent payments must be
wrong, because no farmer in Saskatchewan
escapes the charge. I make no complaint
about this levy; but in years when our province has a bountiful crop we take care of
subsidy payments on behalf of those whose
yield is below a certain bushelage.

Hon. Mr. Reid: May I give the honourable senator the official figures used by the
Minister of Agriculture, from whose department I obtained them? From Manitoba the
total levy collected was $7,282,000, and the
total payments amounted to $2,598,000. The
percentage paid by the farmers was 280-2.
For Saskatchewan the total levy collected
was $24,607,000 and the total payments
arounted to $94,947,000, the percentage paid
by the farmers being 25.9.
Hon. Mr. Horner: You are speaking of
percentages?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes, percentages.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Now I understand your
figures. Manitoba, of course, has a much
smaller acreage. We were more fortunate
than they were. They did not claim so much
because only a few areas of Manitoba produced less than the six to eight bushels
which placed them in the position of not
being eligible for a subsidy. But the total
payments by Saskatchewan are many times
greater than those of Manitoba.
Reference has been made to the nationalization of railroads. If this country should
become a purely socialistic state, I believe
that if there remained any place where a
free economy continued to be practised, I
would want to move there. In England the

like to criticize their institutions; it is not
nice for a visitor to be critical; but I think
it is correct to say that probably the socialization of the British railroads had as much
to do with the recent return of a non-socialist government as any other factor. Imagine
the conductor of a train, all dressed up in
a braided uniform, asking tips from passengers. As for their method of handling
luggage, it is a wonder to me that anybody
ever receives what belongs to him. I made
this remark to a man I met, and he told me
that his wife's trunk, containing a fur coat
and ber clothes had been stolen, and it was
a tremendous job to get compensation for
even a small percentage of the value. The
baggage cars are open; there is no one there
to receive what you put in them; no one is
in authority; there is no checking.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That was always the case.
long before nationalization.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, it was the same
under private ownership.
Hon. Mr. Horner: As regards the general
management of the railways, it seems to me
that, for a country as old as England, there
are far too many wrecks.
As far as the Maritime Rates amendments
are concerned, all that they mean is that the

DECEMBER 5. 1951
rest of Canada will pay the Maritimes a subsidy without knowing exactly what it is for.
As regards our railroad policy, if we should
be faced with the danger of nationalization,
my advice would be to turn the roads over
to the employees, on condition that they pay
a small rate of interest on the capital investment: we might then have greater courtesy
and greater efficiency. It has always seemed
to me that for a country like Canada there
is far too much centralization of authority.
There is no doubt that both our railways
employ capable men, and I think that some
of these men should be given greater leeway
in the administration of the affairs of the
railways. Let me cite an incident in connection with the Canadian National Railways.
It will serve to illustrate that as a result of
increased freight rates the railways may find
a decrease in their revenue. A brewery company at Prince Albert made use of the services of the Canadian National Railways to
supply hotels in towns all along the line.
When the freight rates were increased the
brewery refused to pay them, and went out
and bought expensive trucks. Subsequently
the railway appealed to the brewery company
to use the railway services at the old rate,
but the breweries continued to use the
vehicles they had bought.
The honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) complained about
royal commissions. To my mind the Board of
Transport Commissioners is a glorified perpetual royal commission which any government in power uses in order to pass the buck
on any question containing political dynamite.
There are
There is no justification for this.
efficient men in the railways and in parliament, so the maintenance of this board is
just an added expense.
It has been said that the C.N.R. cannot
provide necessary statistics. Well, I had a
close association with that railway for some
two years, and its officials furnished me with
more data than I could use. How did the
C.N.R. have such figures available in those
days? I know of one case involving a change
in a railway crossing that was supposed to go
before the board, and to this day the board
does not know that this change was made.
Honourable senators, as I said before, I
certainly do not believe that the nationalization of our railways is the solution to the railway problems of this country.
Hon. J. P. Howden: Honourable senators,
I should hate to think that the honourable
gentleman from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) advocates that the C.N.R. should be
turned over to its employees and be operated
by them. I grew up in Manitoba, and I can

vividly remember the old railway monopoly
in the West. When the Northern Pacific and
other roads came in, feeble demands were
made to minimize that monopoly, but the
monopoly was never shorn of its importance
until the National Railways took over. Coinpetition has brought about the excellent
service now rendered by our Canadian
railways.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Howden: If by any chance the
Canadian National Railways fell into the
hands of their employees, they would be
promptly bought by the C.P.R. and then there
would no longer be any railway competition
in this country.
Hon. J. W. Siambaugh: Honourable senators,
I am at a loss to know why British Columbia
should be opposed to Alberta getting a little
break from these freight rates.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Let us keep the record
straight. I never opposed Alberta getting this.
Hon. Mr. S±ambaugh: You are opposed to
section 332B, which would give us a break.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That is a different matter.
You only think you are going to get it.
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: Oh, no, the bill provides for that. I do not know any reason
why you should set yourself up as a prophet
to tell us what is going to happen ten years
from now should this legislation go through.
You are speaking about paying excessive rates
on your domestic grain, and I cannot see why
you should have to pay those rates. We in
Alberta have endeavoured just as strongly
as you have to have those rates removed.
We do not want to see you pay that extra
rate. A few years ago we joined with British
Columbia in trying to get the mountain differential eliminated. We thought you were
paying too much, and we were glad to help
you out. Last night the honourable senator
from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw)
quoted the rate on one hundred pound of
canned goods from Aylmer to Vancouver at
$1.57, and from Aylmer to Calgary or Edmonton at $3.23. Why should the railways carry
that car on through Calgary and over the
mountains for less than half the money they
would get to take the car off at Calgary, where
they could re-load it with grain for Fort
William? I am not saying that these rates are
going to be just what they should be. They
are not equalized, but surely this legislation
is going to help equalize them. For instance,
on the very point raised by the honourable
senator from Medicine Hat, the Vancouver
people will still get 'canned goods at $1.57
per hundred pounds. This legislation will not
increase the rate to British Columbia, but it
will reduce the rate to Alberta to $2.10. It

SENATE
gives us a little break, and I do not know
why the honourable senator from New Westminster should, oppose it. The honourable
senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) is
opposing it too.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Let me ask you a question. If you are correct in what you say,
will the railways at that rate make a profit
operating in the interior of Canada?
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: I do not know.
Hon. Mr. Haig: They told us in committee that they would not.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: I have heard it
said that no profit was made on hauling grain
under the Crowsnest rate, and yet every year
when there is a light crop in the West you
will see that their profits go down. I would
doubt very much that the railways do not
make a profit; but whether they do or not,
we have had to pay through the nose to get
that Crowsnest rate. The city of Winnipeg
profits by water competition, but we in
Alberta are not kicking about that.
Hon. Mr. Haig: How do we profit there?
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: You get your coal
from Lake Erie ports via water at 70 cents
a ton to Fort William, and you would have
to pay much more by rail. We are glad that
Winnipeg has that water rate, but what
we would like is to have you get your coal
from Alberta at the same rate. We do not
ask that you should have your rate increased.
Hon. Mr. Haig: We do not use Pennsylvania coal now because it is too expensive.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: Coal from Pennsylvania is still in competition with Alberta
coal. All you have to do is take a look at
one of the Winnipeg newspapers to find that
out. As to what the honourable senator
from Calgary (Hon. Mr. Ross) said yesterday about amalgamation, he is one of the
few Albertans I have met in many years who
is in favour of the government taking over
the C.P.R. I just cannot figure that out.
He also said that the farmers of Alberta have
a grievance because of the subvention paid
by the government on the shipment of feed

grains to farmers in British Columbia,
Ontario and provinces to the east. Well, I
have attended many of the farmers' conventions that have been held in Alberta during
the last five years, and I have never known
them to pass a resolution opposing that
subvention. We realize that the subsidy,
although not large, does provide us with a
good market for our coarse grains, and we
hope that the government will continue to
pay the subvention, so that we may continue
shipping our feed grains to British Columbia
and Ontario and Quebec.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: And to the Maritimes?
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: Yes, and to the
Maritimes. We are always glad to help the
Maritimes, and we are a little surprised
that occasionally they do not help us out
when we in the west are trying to get something for ourselves. For instance, last summer or fall, when we were getting back a
little bit of the money that we had lost on
supplying cheap wheat to the Maritimes and
Quebec and Ontario, some of our Ontario
friends-not many-and a few of our Maritime friends complained about this. We
have always tried to help the Maritimes with
their freight rate problems, and in turn we
should like the Maritimes to give us a little
support now and then.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

EXTERNAL RELATIONS
ANNOUNCEMENT

Hon. Mr. Gouin: Honourable senators, with,
leave of the house, I should like to make
an announcement which I think is of special
interest to the members of our Committee
on External Relations.
Over the' past two years I have discussed
with several members of our committee-the
honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert), the honourable senator from Cariboo (Hon. Mr. Turgeon) and others-the possibility of holding joint meetings with
members af the External Affairs Committee
of the other house. We have always feit convinced that the Senate is in a position to play
a more active and useful part in relation to
foreign affairs, and we have been anxious ta
have the opportunity of hearing the Secretary
of State for External Affairs when he presents
his annual report, so to speak, to the members
of the External Aiffairs Committee of the
other house. For one reason or another such
meetings have neyer been arranged, and
during the present session it has been
impossible to hear the Secretary of State for
External Aiffairs because of his absence in
Europe. However, this morning I received a

Affairs, Mr. Jean Lesage, who, speaking for

PUBLIC PRINTING AND STATIONEET
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the
second reading af Bul 24, an Act ta amend
the Public Printing and Stationery Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
af this bill is ta increase fram $2 million ta

under the Public Printing and Stationery
Act, and ta increase from $500 ta $1,000 the
amount ai any purchase that may be made
Honourable
withaut calling for tenders.
senatars are no doubt aware that, within the
limits Of the public service, the Public Printing and Statianery Bureau operates ta a large
extent as a production and sales organization.
Its grants from parliament do nat include
anything for the purposes of its operation,
but are conflned in the main to administrative expenditures. Obviausly some working
capital is essential for the purchase ai stock
-and raw materials and payment of the necessary labour for production work. The f unds
f or these requirements are provided by a
credit authorized by the Minister of Finance,
out -of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The
amount, of course, varies with the needs of
the departmnent which have been growing
year by year. It is naw felt that the credit
af $2 million which has existed since 1946
is insufficient, and this measure would, as I
have said, increase the amount to $4 million.

SENATE
As honourable senators know, this credit
is not a grant. It has been increased down
through the years in accordance with the
increase in the price of materials and labour
and expanding activities resulting from the
continuous growth of the nation. Some years
ago the limit of the credit was $700,000.
Later on it was increased to $1,300,000, then
to $2 million, and in 1946, as I have indicated, to $4 million. Since then the governconsequent upon the
ment's activities,
country's rapid growth, have expanded tremendously. These have been reflected in the
continual growing activities of the King's
Printer, who has also to contend with rising
costs of materials and of labour.
It is found today that the credit of $2
million is approximately $2 million short of
the bureau's requirements.
For example, I am informed that as of
November 22, the bureau owed its suppliers
for materials, paper, and so forth, $2,265,643.
To meet salaries, wages and the like $160,000
was required. Therefore, the bureau was
in debt for a total of $2,425,643. The overdraft in the Receiver General's account at
that date was $5,590,137. Various government departments owed the Printing Bureau
sums totalling $3,786,943, which it is entitled
to deduct. Had the bureau received payment
from the various departments, the overdraft
at that time would have been only $1,803,193.
The overdraft authorized by the Act is $2
million. As of November 22 there was available a cash balance of $196,807 to meet
liabilities which, as stated before, amounted
Therefore, the bureau was
to $2,265,643.
$2,068,836 short of the amount it needed to
meet its obligations to outside firms for supplies and materials of various kinds. For
this reason a further credit to the bureau is
required.
The sum of $3,786,943 previously mentioned as owing te the King's Printer's
advance account by the various departments,
is made up of printing and stationery items.
This being so, a large amount of printing
could be charged against departments during
a stated period, because work in process
accumulates from month to month and
departments are invoiced only when the job
is complete and the work delivered. On the
other hand, at other periods work in process
shows a large balance, and accounts owing
to the King's Printer are rather small; nevertheless, the advance account has to finance
the costs of work in process until such time
as departments are charged and payment is
made to the Department of Public Printing
and Stationery.

The bill also proposes to repeal subsection
2 of section 26 of the Public Printing and
Stationery Act, 1927, and to substitute therefor the following:
Al purchases made by the Controller of Purchases shall be so made upon requisition approved
by the minister or as he directs and all purchases
involving an amount of one thousand dollars or
upwards shall be made in accordance with contracts
entered into with the like approval after tenders
have been called for.

As I mentioned at the outset, under present
procedure purchases of $500 or less require
only the approval of the minister. The bill
would authorize purchases up to $1,000 to
be made without contract or tender.
Because of the increase in prices over the
level which existed when the provision for
$500 and under was established, orders of
$1,000 or less are very numerous and pretty
much standardized, with little possibility of
competition.
It is thought, therefore, that there is
nothing to be gained by calling for tenders
on purchases involving lesser amounts.
Besides, requests for tenders involve very
considerable clerical work, with added costs,
and often considerable delays.
The necessary procedure in calling for
tenders for purchases as small as $500 militates against the utilization of the services of
manufacturers or suppliers, particularly in
the case of printing establishments located
at points distant from Ottawa, and in the
case of orders of an urgent nature the time
factor practically precludes the requesting of
tenders from firms so situated.
Hon. John T. Haig: I do not intend to
discuss the merits of the bill. I do not see
that we can do anything but pass it. But
I am going to make a suggestion. I have
felt--and I have voiced my feelings on several
occasions-that parliament, or the government of Canada, through the various departments, spends a tremendous amount of money
on printed material, much of which is sent
to members of parliament, most of it to be
dropped as quickly as possible in to the wastepaper basket.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I have a suggestion to make
whereby we can do what I think should be
done. Normally, the Senate-and I do not
want anybody to heave a brick at me for
saying this-is less busy than the House of
Commons, because we do not have to discuss
politics and they do, and they take a lot
of time doing it. Why could not we at the
next session designate one of our standing
committees, or, if they have too much to do,
a special committee, to whom shall be presented a copy of every document printed by

DECEMBER 6. 1951
each branch of every department of government. Having gone through this material,
they could then call on the officials to explain
why this or that publication was printed.
Hon. Mr. Reid: We have not a room big
enough to hold them all.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I admit it. We may have
to rent the Auditorium.
To indicate what I have in mind, take The
Canada Gazette. I should like te know how
how many members of the Senate read that
publication, which over the years forms of
a big volume, comes to hand every week,
with special issues containing copies of orders
in council. We receive forms and reports
without number; and I would say, with all
respect te my fellow senators, that very few
if any of them are read. These publications
may be useful in newspaper offices, in the
libraries of provincial governments, and in
the public libraries of cities and towns, to
which people resort to get information. But
the circulation goes much beyond that, and
unless we as senators do something about the
matter there can be little hope that anything
will be done.
The circulation of publications has got
entirely out of hand. I am net blaming
officials. Many of them are ambitious to
produce reports publicizing what they are
doing. I do not say that if I were in their
place I would do otherwise. But I suggest
te the leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) that at the opening of the next
session he designate a committee, or ask the
house te designate a committee, te go into
the whole subject. The Senate is in a good
position te do this, because it is close te the
centre of things. We shall be here until the
night before Chirstmas, and after a very short
Christmas vacation we shall come back about
the middle or the end of January, se there
is every opportunity te swing quickly into
line.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: What about that electien next year?
Hon. Mr. Haig: That election will be in
June. There will be lots of time after the
24th of December for the committee te do its
work.
Maybe al these publications are necessary;
I do net believe they are; and I am sure we
could make a real saving for the people of
Canada if we investigated this whole subject
and indicated what we thought should be
printed and what should net. Further, I am
persuaded that any government, whatever its
political complexion, would think twice before
continuing the printing and circulating of
publications contrary te an express recommendation from this bouse.
94703-151

Hon. Mr. Lamberi: I would point out to
the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
that two years ago the Finance Committee,
of which he was a member, dealt in a very
definite way with this item of public printing.
He will recall that there were two matters
before the committee, one being public printing, the other travelling expenses.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: In the report of the
last sitting of that committee, which was
printed and circulated, these details were net
mentioned because it was agreed, as my
honourable friend knows, that the efforts of
the committee in its investigation would be
directed towards the effect of public spending
on inflation; and it was decided-I think at my
honourable friend's suggestion-that we
would net have "witch-hunts" of any kind
into details of departmental expenditures.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Correct.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I submit that the inquiry
he is now suggesting would probably be made
by the Finance Conmittee, which is already
set up, and of which the honourable senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) is chairman.
I think it would be quite appropriate to refer
the suggestion to that committee for consideratien. It would, of course, change a little the
orientation of their work from what my
friend wanted them te do last year.
Hon. Mr. Haig: While I am now out of order
I may be permitted to say that I thought of
the Finance Committee as the right body te
do this work; but as I am on that committee,
and I did not want it to be supposed that I
was anxious for the job, although I am willing
to do it. There has been a feeling that one or
two committees have too much te do while
others have hardly anything to deal with. I
believe this subject should be referred to the
Finance Committee, but I do not care by
wrhom it is done.
The motion was agreed te, and the bill was
read the second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: When shall this bill
be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Is it the wish of any
honourable senators that the bill be sent te
the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce?
Some Hon. Senators: No.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Then, with leave, I
propose that it be read the third time at the
next sitting.

SENATE
SUPREME COURT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck moved the second
reading of Bill 31, an Act to amend the
Supreme Court Act.
He said: The purpose of the bill, as will be
observed from the note at the side, is to
increase the maximum salary of the Registrar
of the Supreme Court of Canada from $8,000
to $8,500 per annum. Of course an explanation is in order as to why we should pass an
Act of Parliament to increase the salary of a
civil servant. The reason is that the Act which
appoints this particular official places an
absolute maximum of $8,000 on the amount to
which his salary can be increased by order in
council. In the first instance, as long ago as
1913, when the Act was passed, the Registrar's salary was fixed at $5,000. In 1927, at
the time of the consolidation and revision of
the statutes, his stipend was increased to
$8,000.
Perhaps it will be of help to show what
the duties of this official are. They are set
forth in section 12 and following sections of
the Supreme Court Act, chapter 35 of the
Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, as follows:
12. The Governor in Council may, by an instrument under the Great Seal, appoint a fit and proper
person, being a barrister of at least five years'
standing, to be Registrar of the Supreme Court.
13. The Registrar shall hold office during pleasure
and shall reside and keep an office at the city of
Ottawa.
14. The Registrar shall have the rank of a deputy
head of a department, and shall be paid a salary of
not less than four thousand two hundred dollars and
not more than eight thousand dollars, to be determined by the Governor in Council.
15. The Registrar shall, subject to the direction
of the Minister of Justice, oversee and direct the
officers, clerks and employees appointed to the
Court.
16. The Registrar shall give his full time to the
public service, and shall not receive any pay, fee
or allowance in any form in excess of the amount
hereinbefore provided.
17. The Registrar shall, under the supervision of
the Minister of Justice, have the management and
control of the Library of the Court and the purchase of all books therefor.

Honourable senators will notice that the
Registrar of the Supreme Court is indeed a
most important official in the judicial system
of Canada. In addition to being the chief
administrative officer of the court, he is the
taxing officer, and rules upon the charges that
lawyers are permitted to make against
opposing parties in actions. This responsible
and somewhat difficult function is highly
necessary. In addition, as I have read, the
registrar has jurisdiction of a judge in
chambers, and rules upon interlocutory
motions. These are motions within an action
which do not determine the final decision
of the action itself. They include motions

with regard to pleadings, the time limit
allowed for the performance of certain
functions, and many other multifarious
details that precede the actual hearing of an
action. Motions are made before the Registrar in much the same manner as they are
made before the Masters in Chambers, now
called Masters of the Supreme Court in the
various provinces.
The present Registrar of the Supreme
Court of Canada is Mr. Paul Leduc, who was
appointed in 1940.
He practised law in
Ontario, in Ottawa, from 1915 to 1934, being
a member of the well-known Belcourt firm,
the head of which was a member of this
house for some years. The present Registrar,
who is completely bilingual, is a barrister of
both Ontario and Quebec, and has a wide
knowledge of the laws of both provinces. As
a matter of fact, during the course of his
practice in Ottawa he acted as agent for lawyers in all parts of Canada. In 1934 he
became the Minister of Mines for Ontario,
and was a colleague of mine in the provincial
legislature until I retired from the government in 1937.
Honourable senators, I am sure I do not
know just why a statutory limitation should
be imposed on the salary of this particular
official. It is out of line with the usual practice of salaries being left to the Civil Service
Commission, the Treasury Board, and the
Executive. These salaries all hold together,
the salary of one official being deteremined to
some extent by the amount paid to another.
But here we are putting in an Act a provision
as to what the limitation may be. The limitation on the salary of the Registrar imposes,
in effect, a limitation on salaries all down
the line, because a proper relationship should
be maintained. There is no thought of changing this provision, however, and I am only
expressing my personal wonderment at such
a limitation as this being written into an Act
of parliament.
What brings this matter to our attention
at the present moment is a recommendation
from the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court
of Canada. He rather protests this limitation
as applied to the salary of this official, and
is now asking that we raise the limitation by
$500 per year.
Some comparisons may be made. One may
compare the salary paid to the Registrar of
the Supreme Court of Canada with the
$7,500 salary paid to the Registrar of the
Supreme Court of the Province of Ontario.
Should this legislation become law, the difference between a provincial registrar and
the dominion registrar will amount to only
$1,000. In my judgment this difference in

DECEMBER 6, 1951
saiary is certainiy justified because of the
greater responsibility carried by the Registrar of the Supreme Court of Canada. As
honourabie gentlemen are aware, the Supreme Court of Canada exercises a much
greater authority than arw other court in the
land, and is now our court of iast rcsort.
Han. Mr. Dupuis: As I understand it, the
Registrar of the Supreme Court of Canada
holds the rank of a deputy minister. Does
the honourable senator from. Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) know if there is any
statutory limitation on the salaries of deputy
ministers?
Han. Mr. Roebuck: There may be, but I
know of none.
Hon. Mr. Reid: The salaries of deputy
ministers are set.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Perhaps I should be
better informed. It is rather unusual ta set
salaries. We set the salaries of ministers, of
course, but that is quite another matter.
However, there is no thought of changing the
rule with regard to this officiai. I was simply
expressing my own view, and perhaps I
should flot have done that. The bill will
increase the Registrar's salary from the
present lixnit of $8,000 to $8,500.
Han. Mr. Reid: Would my honourable
friend permit a question? It is flot being
asked with any view o! opposing the increase.
I reaily have two questions. First: Has the
present incumbent reached the maximum of
$8,000? Second: The honourable gentleman
has told us how the salaries o! provincial
court registrars compare with the salary of
the Supreme Court Registrar, but can he tel
us the reason for the disparity between the
salary o! the Supreme Court Registrar and
that of the Exchequer Court Registrar? Both
officiais are required to have similar qualifications, yet the salary o! the Supreme Court
Registrar will be hlgher by at least $1,000 a
year.
Han. Mr. Ro.buck: The question is wy
should there be this disparity between the
salaries of the two officials?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Yes.

flot necessary, sureiy. In my judgment the
Registrar o! the Exchequer Court does flot;
hoid as important or as responsibie an office
or exercise as difficuit, important and responsibie judicial functions as does the Registrar
of the Supreme Court of Canada.
Han. Mr. Lambert: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question? la it not s0 that
the Registrar of the Exchequer Court has
much more onerous responsibilities ta perform? He has a larger staff under him. It
seems to me that the Exchequer Court
Registrar's work and responsibilities for bis
staff are so much heavier than the corresponding work and responsibilities o! the Supreme
Court Registrar that there is fia comparisan
at ail between them. Therefore it seemns to me
there is some justification for ellminating the
disparity between the salaries o! the two
officiais.
Hon. Mr. Raebuck: Weil, I wouid have no
objection to elimxinating the dlsparity, if it
meant that the saiary of the Exchequer Court
Registrar would go upHan. Mr. Lambert: I would agree with that.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: -and if it did not
involve pushing the Supreme Court Registrar's salary down. I might point out that
the Supreme Court Registrar is responsible
for the management o! the Supreme Court
Library and the purchase of books for that
iibrary. The Registrar of the Exchequer
Court has none of that responsibility, and it
is not a smnall one. I do not know which
Registrar has the larger staff. I do know
that more cases are passed upon by the
Exchequer Court, which as I have said is a
court of first instance, than by the Supreme
Court of Canada, our final court of appeai.
But the work that is done by these tribunals
is flot; to be compared entireiy on a basis of
quantity; it must aiso be compared on the
basis of responsibiiity, quaiity and that sort
of thing, and on that basis I am quite satisfied that the Supreme Court is more important than the Exchequer Court.

SENATE
EXCHEQUER COURT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. R. W. Roebuck moved the second
reading of Bill 31, an Act to amend the
Exchequer Court Act.
Some Hon. Senators: Carried.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I think, honourable
members that I should make at least a brief
explanation, for the record.
The bill is similar to the one we have just
passed, its purpose being to increase the
maximum salary of the Registrar of the
Exchequer Court of Canada from $6,500 to
$7,500 a year, and the remarks that I made
with regard to fixing the amount of the
salary by statute apply here also.
Section 12 of the Exchequer Court Act,
Chapter 34, Revised Statutes of Canada,
1927, reads as follows:
The Governor in Council may by an instrument
under the Great Seal appoint a fit and proper
person, being a barrister of at least five years'
standing, to be the Registrar of the Exchequer
Court, who shall hold office during pleasure, reside
and have his office at the city of Ottawa, and be
paid a salary of five thousand dollars per annum.

By Chapter 63 of the Statutes of 1947 the
salary was increased to the present maximum
of $6,500.
May I say here that I think we are fortunate in having men like the present registrars of the Supreme Court and Exchequer
Court holding these responsible positions. The
Registrar of the Exchequer Court is Mr. H.
R. L. Henry, K.C., a barrister of forty years'
standing. In 1908 he was a Rhodes Scholar
from Manitoba.

Exchequer Court. As to the present incumbent in office, I know him to be a highly
efficient, industrious and very pleasant person.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Moreover, he is a real
diplomat.
Hon. Mr. Roebuclc: He is a diplomat, and
that is a good quality for a person who exercises authority.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: He was trained for it.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes. He is thoroughly
competent and, in my judgment, a valued
official of the court.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall the bill be read the third

REVISED STATUTES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. W. deB. Farris moved the second
reading of Bill 32, an Act to amend an Act
respecting the Revised Statutes of Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is

DECEMBER 6, 1951
The bill before us provides that the commission now in existence shall have authority
and power to take any statutes passed between
December 31 and the time of printing the
new consolidation, and put them into a supplementary volume. Parliament will, as I
say, make reference to the old consolidation,
but the commission will put the new statutes
into the new consolidation.
Although to the uninitiated, the language
of the bill is not very lucid, I have read it
and studied it as best I could, and it seems
to do what is intended.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask whether the
commissioners will be authorized to change
the form of the statutes? I am wondering
why a supplementary volume is required.
When parliament amends a statute it will
alter a section in this new revision. Why not
put the new Acts into their proper place in
the new consolidation, without using a supplementary volume?
Hon. Mr. Farris: A supplementary volume
is needed for the reason that from December
31 next the King's Printer will be in the process of printing the revised statutes. Parliament will probably commence a new session
in February, and legislation will likely be
passed altering statutes which may have been
passed ten years ago, but we will have before
us only the 1927 edition. We will have to
do the best we can with the material that
is before us. When the commissioners have
the new legislation before them, they will
make such changes as to dates and references as are necessary in relation to the new
statutes. It may be that the 1951 revision
will be different from that of 1927. But the
commission will have the same power to
make new statutes fit into the consolidation
to language and dates-as they have
-as
now. That is the type of work they are now
doing, by way of general revision. This bill
covers a hiatus in the powers of the commission.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Can the honourable
gentleman give us any information about the
members of the commission?
Hon. Mr. Farris: The Chief Justice of
Canada is the chairman, Mr. Varcoe is the
second in command, and there are three
lawyers whose names I have not before me.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Are they civil servants?
Hon. Mr. Farris: I know that one or two
of them are civil servants.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask if it is intended
to have the new revised statutes issued during 1952?

Hon. Mr. Farris: Yes. It will take about
eight months to print the consolidation.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I may say that as a member of the Manitoba Legislature I had some
experience in the revision of the statutes of
that province. A supplementary issue was
prepared, although it was not provided for
in advance as is now being done here-we
did not think that fast in those days. But
the supplementary volume served a useful
purpose. It set out the Acts which were
amended after the revision was made. Fromn
the viewpoint of a practising lawyer, the
scheme of a supplementary volume worked
very well in Manitoba, and I am in favour
of this bill.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: While I was Attorney
General of the Province of Ontario, I had the
rather delightful experience of having the tenyear period for the revision of the statutes
in that province expire. Previously a board,
consisting of several judges, a number of
barristers and others, was appointed; the
revision usually took a long time and was
very costly; there were all sorts of incidental expenses in connection with it which
I considered open to criticism. On that
occasion I put the revision in the hands of
the law officers of the Crown in that
province. The result was an efficiency, a
speed of action and a finally satisfactory
result in which I took a good deal of satisfaction. I have no doubt that it bas been
done here in the same efficient way it was
done under my jurisdiction, about the year
1935.
The last revision of federal statutes took
place in 1927: we are now in the year 1951.
These consolidations should be not delayed
so long. Revision should be going on continuously by the law officers of the Crown,
and when, say, ten years have gone by, the
material should be pretty well ready for the
printers. In their revised fori the statutes
should be published periodically, say every
ten years or so, because if consolidation is
unduly delayed it means that law officers and
laymen who want to know the law must
look through volume after volume of the
annual statutes and endeavour to piece
together the original Act and its various
amendments-a laborious and inconvenient
business. On the other hand revisions such
as that of 1927 and the one which is to come
out in 1952 are of the very greatest value to
those who want to know the la-w.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. A. K. Hugessen moved the second
reading of Bill C, an Act respecting the
General Synod of the Church of England in
Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
submitted on behalf of the General Synod of
the Church of England in Canada. It and
the bill immediately succeeding it have both
been unanimously approved by the Executive
Council of the .General Synod of the Church
of England in Canada, after consultation with
and receiving the approval of the twentyeight chancellors of the various Anglican
dioceses. It so happens that I am the Chancellor of the Diocese of Montreal.
The purpose of this bill is to amend the
Act incorporating the General Synod, passed
by this parliament in the year 1921, so as to
widen and make clear its power of investing and dealing with its corporate funds.
Briefly, the bill purports to repeal sections
3 and 6 of the Act of 1921, and to substitute
therefor the provisions which are found in
this bill. The purpose of the new sections
is to bring up to date and confer on the
General Synod powers to hold real estate,
borrow money, mortgage property, issue
bonds and debentures, and make investments
of the same nature as the Canadian insurance
companies are authorized to make under the
Insurance Act. In this respect the measure
follows very closely the legislative powers
which this parliament last year conferred on
a number of other religious organizations,
such as the United Church of Canada, the
Evangelical Lutheran Church of Canada, the
Ruthenian Greek Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Canada and the Ukrainian
Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Western
Canada. Authority is also granted by the
bill to set up and maintain a retirement fund
for the benefit of lay employees of the synod,
and to maintain the present pension fund.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Are the chancellors
covered by the retirement plan?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I am afraid the chancellors do not participate in any pecuniary
benefits.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That is a sad state of
affairs.

Hon. Mr. Reid: They are usually retiring
gentlemen.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Indeed, chancellors do
not even get the very small stipend which
the great majority of clergymen throughout
this country receive.
When the bill has received second reading
-after I have moved to suspend Rule 119I shall suggest that it be referred to the
Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private
Bills for further consideration.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I move, with leave of the Senate, that Rule
119 be suspended insofar as it relates to
Bill C, an Act respecting the General Synod
of the Church of England in Canada.
The purpose of this motion is to suspend
the application Rule 119, which requires a
delay of one week between the second
reading of a bill and its consideration by the
committee to which it is referred.
The motion was agreed to.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Hugessen moved that the bill be

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. A. K. Hugessen moved the second
reading of Bill D, an Act respecting the
General Synod of the Church of England in
Canada and the Missionary Society of the
Church of England in Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, this is the
second of the two bills to which I referred a
few minutes ago. It also has received the
unanimous approval of the Executive Council
of the General Synod of the Church of
England, and of the twenty-eight chancellors
of the respective dioceses.
The measure deals with a rather peculiar
situation in relation to the joint funds of the
General Synod and the missionary society.
As I said a moment ago, the Synod was incorporated by this parliament in 1921, and the
Missionary Society was incorporated by this
parliament in 1903. In the year 1927 these
two organizations obtained an Act of the
Legislature of the Province of Ontario authorizing them to amalgamate their funds and to
deal with them in certain ways. As both

DECEMBER 11, 1951
organizations were incorporated through federal jurisdiction, it is considered that the
authorization to deal with their joint funds
should come fromn the parliament which incorporated -the organizations. The sole object of
this bul is to authorize the consolidation of
the trust funds of the two organizations in
the same way as, by Ontario legislation, permission to consolidate has already been gîven,
but to give that consolidation the sanction
of this parliament, which is really the right
body to do it.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Does the Ontario
organization, or entity, consent?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: There is no Ontario
organization. Both these organizations were
incorporated-one in 1903, the other in 1921by this parliament; but for some reason,
unknown to me, they went before the Ontario legisiature in 1927 to get this power,
which should have been sought from, the
Parliament of Canada.
The motion was agreed to, and the bll
was read the second time.

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. W. M. Aseltine moved the second
reading of Bill E, an Act to incorporate the
Evangelicai Mennonite Brethren of Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill has
no controversial features. The Evangelical
Mennonite Brethren is an organization' of al
Mennonite Brethren churches on the North
American continent, and it proposes to obtain
a Dominion charter in Canada and a similar
charter in the United States. Application
has been made in the United States; and this
bill is the application which is being made
here. As first drawn, the bill did not contain
certain provisions contained in ýother'bilîs of
94703-16J

a similar nature passed by this house, but it
has now been re-drafted by the Law Clerk of
the Senate. I have carefully inspected th-e
bill as re-drawn, and believe that it now
complies in every respect with the requirement of parliament.
The bill incorporates the Mennonite
Brethren of Canada, and deals with the
appointment of directors, the establishmnent
of a head office, and the power to acquire
property and to hold mortgages. It also outlines the powers of the society to invest
funds.
Han. Mr. Euler: Did I understand the honourable senator to say that this bill combines
ail the Mennonite bodies in North America?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No. There now is an
organization called the Evangelical Mennonite Brethren. It is my information that
the Mennonites are divided, and that the
Mennonite Brethren churches i the United
States are being incorporated by an Act of
Congress. This bill is to incorporate Mennonite Brethren churches in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I should be rather surprised to know that they are ail under the
samie organization. A great many Mennonites live in the riding I formerly represented
in the House of Commons. We used to have
what we called the "Old Mennonites", who
were a very fine people. There are also the
"New Mennonites", and I am pretty sure
they do not belong to this organization.
Han. Mr. Aselline: This is to incorporate
the Evangelical Mennonite Brethren of
Canada.
Hon. Mr. Euler: WeUl, it is not important.
Han. Mr. Aseltine: I might say that we
have many Mennonites in the Rosetown district of Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. Euler: 1 think they came from
Waterloo county.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: They came to the Rosetown district about 1925, and purchased some
of our most valuable land. A large number
of them graduated from, European universities as doctors and lawyers.
Han. Mr. Euler: Many of them came from
Russia.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: They have made quite
a success of their farming operations. Many
of them consuit me about legal matters, and
1 have found them to be very reliable and
honest people. I am sure that what they are
asking for in this bill is quite in order.
Hon Mr. Euler: I amn sure of that.
Hon. Mr. Raebuck: It would be rather serious if this incorporation were to include al

CANADIAN FORCES BILL
COMMONS AMENDMENT CONCURRED IN

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
a message bas been received from the House
of Commons to return Bill 21, an Act respecting the Canadian Forces, and to acquaint the
Senate that they have concurred in the
amendments made by the Senate to the bill.
with the exception of the sixteenth amendment, to which they propose the following
amendment:
The amendment was read by the Clerk
Assistant as follows:
That subparagraph (iii) of paragraph (d) of
section two of The Veterans Land Act, 1942, as proposed by the Senate, be deleted and that the
following be substituted therefor:
(iii) who, wherever he may have served, is by
reason of disability attributable to or incurred during such service in receipt of a pension.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall the amendment be taken into
consideration?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: With leave of the Senate,
now.
The amendment now offered by the other
bouse is to correct an error which occurredmore in the copying than in any other way
-in one of the numerous amendments sent
to that house from the Senate. This amendment bas to do with the definition of
"veteran". The statute, as it stood prior to
1949-it was amended in that year-contains
language which was copied in error and sent
to the other place. I shall read to the house
the definition of "veteran" as it appeared
prior to 1949.
(iii) who, wherever he may have served, is by
reason of disability incurred: as a result of such
service in receipt of a pension.
That was the earlier definition, which
appeared prior to 1949. The change made in
the other place, and in which we are now
asked to concur, is this. After the words
"who, wherever he may have served, is by
reason of disability" are inserted the words
"attributable to"; then follows the remainder
of the definition, "or incurred during such
service, is in receipt of a pension." So the
change is a perfectly proper one to bring the
amendments with which we are dealing this
year into line with the law as it stood, so

far as it concerns a veteran entitled to pension, and makes for a much broader definition than if the earlier wording were
retained.
Having given that explanation, I would
like to make use of this opportunity to say
a word or two in connection with some
criticism which emanated from another
place in connection with the amendments
which the Senate made to this bill, and which
I regard, as being utterly stupid. The rules
and the practice in both our houses are perfectly clear, and we followed the correct
practice in amending the bill as we did, that
is, by striking out the sections which were
being dealt with and re-enacting them with
the amending words incorporated in them.
That is the common, the usual and the customary procedure, and how any person,
even though suffering from temporary
amnesia, could so far lose his sense of
familiarity with the rules of practice as to
suggest that we were doing something which
was entirely unnecessary, is beyond my
comprehension. The author of that criticism
must be either stupid or ignorant. Either
he has heard the rules and does not understand them, or he is ignorant of the rules.
When the suggestion is made that the course
we adopted, and which is entirely in accord
with the rules, is a reason for abolishing the
Senate, I suggest with much assurance of
support that so stupid and ignorant a criticism furnishes very strong evidence that the
voters in whatever area he represents should
themselves do a little "abolishing" and,
maybe, "abolish" the author of these remarks.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It is not my intention to
say anything on the amendment, butThe Hon. the Speaker: I must remind
the honourable member that there is nothing
before the Senate on which he can speak.
But there will be later on.
The motion was agreed to, and the amendment was concurred in.
Hon. Mr. Reid:

QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE

Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
I rise to a question of privilege which affects
all honourable senators, and which has to
do with a statement made in another place.
I repeat that it is a question of privilege

The Hon. the Speaker: I must point out

Hon. Mr. Reid: Am I not permitted to speak

members of the Senate? Is that not in order?
I should like a ruling.

The Hon. The Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall the report be taken into

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I move that the report
be taken into consideration tomorrow.
Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, I of course do not wish to comment
on the request that this report be set down for
consideration tomorrow, for that is in accordance with our customary procedure. I merely
want to take advantage of the opportunity
which presentation of the report gives me
to express on my own behalf, and I am sure
on behalf of the Senate as a whole, appreciation of the very excellent work that the Committee on Transport and Communications has
done in considering this highly complex and
Important matter. I am not sure whether the
house is aware that up to this day the committee bas had fifteen meetings, most of
which were devoted to the subject-matter of
the Railway Bill and the Report of the Royal
Commission on Transportation. I appreciate
very much the work that has been done by
this committee. I feel that those who were
fortunate enough to attend the meetings regularly gained a wide and comprehensive
knowledge. of this complicated subject.
I am not unaware of the fact that there has
been criticism, and perhaps fair criticism, of
my suggestion as to the setting up of committees and the reduction of their membership.
Before making the suggestion I consulted
many honourable senators, and decided that
as an experiment the scheme could be adopted,
and that if, later, it seemed desirable to
increase the membership, I would have no
objection to such action. My concern was
to insure that the committees would operate
as efficiently as possible, with a maximum
attendance of the members. In suggesting
the reduced membership I had in mind the
set-up of the Senate of the United States. As
honourable senators know up to the time
when Newfoundland entered the confederation the Senate of Canada had the same
number of members as the Senate of the
United States, namely, ninety-six. Now, in
the United States Senate the committee comparable to our Transport Committee has only
thirteen members, and because of its small

membership each member has become a specialist and enjoys an enviable reputation for
his wide knowledge of the subject that comes
within its purview.
In setting up committees of this house, my
paramount interest bas been to see that
each area into which Canada traditionally
is divided is equally represented. With a
seventeen-member committee, four members
are appointed from each of the four main
geographical divisions and one member from
Newfoundland. If the total membership
were to be thirty-four, the representation
from each division would be doubled. AIthough heretofore the total membership of
the Banking and Commerce Committee bas
been about 51, and the distribution of representation has been fair enough, I have always
felt that perhaps the ideal committee would
be one so constituted as to assure the maximum attendance of its members, for a large
committee is of little value if attendance is
relatively small. I emphasize that my only
concern is to improve if possible, on the excellent work done by the Senate committees.
May I say a few words on behalf of the
Committee on Finance and the Committee on
External Affairs. Honourable senators will
recall that the matter of the public accounts
was referred to the Finance Committee.
Unfortunately, that move was a little premature, as the public accounts have only now
become available, and the committee bas been
unable to do anything with respect to them.
The chairman of the External Affairs Committee has been anxious to proceed, but
because of the unavoidable absence from
Canada of some of the senior officials of the
department in question, it was not considered
practical for the committee to function.
I take this opportunity of expressing my
appreciation for the good work that has been
done by the committee on Transport and
Communications.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I do not intend to deal with the subject
presently before the house, but I should like
to pay my respects to the chairman and the
deputy-chairman of the Transport Committee. Both these honourable gentlemen gave
exceedingly fine service in arranging for
witnesses to appear before us in the time
available, and each presided with marked
impartiality.
I think I attended every meeting of the
committee, and I can truthfully say that
through this medium I have learned more
about transportation problems in Canada
than I ever knew before. I am sure that

SENATE

every member of the committee feels as I do.
When differences of opinion occurred there
was a fine spirit, each of us endeavouring
to understand the problems of the others.
Whether the membership of the committee
should be increased to more than seventeen,
is a matter to be considered later. For my
part, I am in favour of increasing the number to perhaps thirty-four. I do not think,
however, that this is the time to discuss that
question.
I am about to bring up a matter which,
perhaps, I should not mention at this time.
I think it most unfair to the people of Canada
that much of the important legislation of
parliament should come to the Senate within
the last two weeks of the session. Really,
the Government of Canada, which controls
the House of Commons, has got to work out
some better program for presenting legislation. The men and women who are in this
house are, without exception, desirous of
giving Canada the best service they can; but
here we are in the last week or ten days of
the session, and the major legislation is just
now coming before us. Thanks to the foresight of the leader of the government in this
house, we have been able to consider the
railway legislation in committee before the
bill reaches us, for there is absolutely no
opportunity now for us to consider that complicated measure.
There is no use saying that protests against
this practice have been made in the past.
I would strongly urge upon the government
that at the next session it should see that
important legislation comes forward at an
early date, so that this house can give it
proper consideration. I do not know whether
the rules are to blame, or where the criticism
should lie, but I know that the other house
is still-or was up until this morning-discussing the Speech from the Throne. Perhaps it is not my job to criticize the other
house; but what we should do is adjourn
this house on Friday until January 3, and
say that we will complete our work then.
The members of the House of Commons
would of course have to come back then too.
If we did that once, it might cure the
trouble.
Why should the people of Canada pay me,
or anybody else in this house, to crowd into
the last week of each session consideration
of important measures which affect so many
thousands of our citizens?
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators, as chairman of the committee on transport, I hope the honourable senator from
Queen's-Lumenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley), as
deputy chairman, will allow me to associate
him with me in expressing our thanks to

the leader opposite and to the leader of the
government for their very kind words about
the work of the committee. All I can say
is-and I am sure the honourable senator
from Queen's-Lunenburg will agree with me
-that the work we have been engaged in
has been most instructive and that the committee has been most active and energetic
in taking a diligent and intelligent interest
in the very difficult subject submitted to us.
Arising out of what both leaders have said,
I think perhaps this is an indication that in
future it may be a wise policy to follow the
practice adopted this session with respect to
legislation which we know is going to come
to us. In that way, before the measure
actually reaches us, we will be able to deal
with it-as we have dealt with the Railway
Bill-in such a way that the members of the
committee can familiarize themselves with
the problems behind the legislation.
CANADIAN
QUESTION

FORCES BILL
OF PRIVILEGE

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Thos. Reid: Honourable senators, I
trust that I am now in order in making the
remarks which I intended ta make at the
opening of today's sitting, and which have to
do with the honour and privileges of the
Senate. I realize that what I am about to say
may give undue prominence to the individual
to whose strictures I shall refer. Nevertheless,
while we are accustomed to a certain amount
of criticism from members of the public, I feel
that the practice in the other place of sniping
at this body is becoming a little too frequent.
It ill becomes anyone in the other house to
charge us, on the one hand, with making
work by proposing what have been called
"unnecessary amendments," and in the same
breath, accuse us of doing little or nothing
or of having little or nothing to do. One can
realize the possible effect of such charges on
people outside of parliament, who do not
know the facts. Therefore, as one who has
been a member of the House of Commons for
over twenty years, and has held a place in this
honourable body for two and a half years, I
think it is appropriate for me to tell the
people of this country, from my experience
and observation, that there is just as much
diligence in public affairs shown in this
chamber as in the House of Commons; indeed,
I believe there is more. Every member
of the other place is not constantly in attendance there, neither do all of our members
attend here; but I believe that if a careful
check were made it would be found that the
average attendance in the Senate is far better
than that in the other house.

DECEMBER 12, 1951
To be accused of making needless changes
in a bill for the sake of having something to
do is, I claim, a scurrilous attack. If those
members of the other place who, because they
do not have their own way in connection with
changes in legislation, go about yelling for the
abolition of the Senate, it may be that ultimately this country will be left with just
one chamber. If there are those elsewhere
who want only one single chamber of government which will, or can, pass legislation with
no restraining hand and with no second body
to examine it, let them say so without equivocation. I noticed that the leader and others
of the group to which this critic belongs
announced up to the year 1940 that it was
their party's platform to abolish the Senate.
But in 1940, their leader, who thought the
election might result in making him Prime

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I should like to ask
just why we are refunding these fees. It is
not that I have any objection to the refund
of fees in these circumstances, but I should
like to know what is the principle upon which
they are refunded. Why do we make a charge
at all, if later on we give it back? I think
perhaps some explanation would be in order.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The practice of the Senate
has always been, at least during my time
here, to charge the parliamentary fees on all
private bills and, in the case of bills relating
to church and charitable organizations, to
move in the chamber afterwards that the
fees paid upon such bills be refunded. By
this procedure it is left to the chamber, and
not to any official, to decide whether the
money should be refunded in any particular
instance.

rule, have they?

SENATE
On amendment No. 3:
Page 7, line 35: after "territory;" insert "unless

the Board for good cause otherwise orders;".
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
this and the next amendment are substantially the same. This amendment, which has
given rise to a great deal of dispute, relates
to section 332B, which caused us in the committee more trouble and gave rise to more
discussion than practically all the rest of the
bill. Section 332B brings into the Railway
Act a new provision to the effect that where
transcontinental competitive rates exist, the
rates to intermediate points shall not be more
than one and one-third of those transcontinental competitive rates.
As I said a few moments ago, competitive
rates, in the structure of railway rates, stand
pretty well in a class by themselves. It is
generally recognized that where there is competition railways have to make special rates
to meet that competition and must be as free
as possible to make them; and, having made
them, they are equally free to withdraw
them if they see fit.
This particular section of the bill deals
with the transcontinental competitive rates.
As honourable senators know, railroad rates
between points on the eastern seaboard and
points in British Columbia are subject to
water competition and, in certain respects, to
competition also from railways of the United
States. Our railways have therefore introduced competitive transcontinental rates on
certain commodities which could as well be
carried by water as by railway. There are
not very many of these commodities, but
they are quite important in the volume of
traffic which they provide. Two examples
which were cited before us on a number of
occasions were steel products and canned
goods.
These transcontinental competitive rates
relate only to carload lots. A practical result
of the introduction of these rates can be
illustrated in respect of canned goods, for
which the rate from the Atlantic to Vancouver is, I believe, $1.57 per hundred pounds
while the regular rate from the Atlantic
coast to an intermediate point such as Calgary,
for the same goods carried in carload lots,
is of the order of $3.25. The result, has been,
of course, that complaints have been made
from the western provinces-particularly
from Alberta, which suffers most-that goods
are sent to Vancouver from the Atlantic at
a rate very much lower than applies to
interior points, say Calgary or Edmonton,
several hundred miles further east. The
Royal Commission on Transportation took
these representations into consideration, and

the section of the bill we are now considering is a direct consequence of their recommendation that-as the section before us provides-where there is a transcontinental competitive rate between the Atlantic and the
Pacific, the rate to an intermediate point shall
not be more than one-third higher than the
competitive rate.
Hon. Mr. Ross: That was the recommendation of the royal commission, I believe, not
of the Board of Transport Commissioners.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I said, the Royal Commission. I am sorry. It is their recommendation which is implemented in section 332B.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Did the royal commission
suggest the limitation that is contained in the
amendment now before us?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: No, it is the suggestion
of the Senate committee.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: But did the royal commission suggest the one and one-third exemption that is provided for in this amendment?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes, it did. Section
332 (b) provides for the one and one-third
rule both from the Atlantic to the Pacific and
from the Pacific to the Atlantic, and from
the Atlantic to intermediate points and from
intermediate points to the Atlantic. This
section, if it is brought into force, will
undoubtedly be of considerable advantage to
certain of the western provinces, particularly
Alberta. In the case which I mentioned a
few moments ago, that of canned goods in
carload lots from the East, the present
regular commodity rate from Montreal to
Calgary, is $3.25.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Let me ask a question here.
Is not that rate to Calgary determined on
the basis of the transcontinental rate to
Vancouver, plus the ordinary rate from Vancouver back to Calgary?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: That is so. I shall
come to that in just a moment. The regular
rate from Montreal to Calgary on a carload
of canned goods is approximately $3.25. But,
by reason of the transcontinental rate to
Vancouver, Calgary does not actually pay
$3.25; it pays the transcontinental rate to
Vancouver plus the local rate from Vancouver back to Calgary, which makes the
rate slightly less than the direct rate from
Montreal to Calgary. The railway companies, of course, do not insist upon the
shipper shipping the car to Vancouver and
back to Calgary, which would be absurd;
so Calgary does get a slight benefit by reason
of the existence of the transcontinental rate.
I think Calgary actually pays about $2.97 per
carload on canned goods. If this amendment

DECEMBER 13, 1951
goes into force, Calgary wlfl pay on that
carload one and one-thfrd tiines the transcontinental -rate of $1.57, which as I work it
out, amounts to $2.09. In other words, it
would be of considerable advantage to wholesalers in Calgary and Edmonton who imnport
goods from the Eastern Provinces in carload
lots.
Another effect of this amendnient, if it goes
into force, will be to institute a very large
area in Western Canada to which rates from
the East on goods covered by the competitive
transcontinental rates will be the same,
regardless of the distance. Let me explain.
Taking the average of ail the goods covered
at the present moment by these transcontinental competitive rates from. the East to
Vancouver, one and one-third times that rate
is roughly equivalent to the present ordinary
rate from the East to a point near the western
boundary of Manitoba, not far frorn Brandon.
In other words, as a result o! the operation
of the one and one-third rule, which this
legislation would bring in, Brandon wiil not
gain anything, but ail points west from,
Brandon te the Rockies wiil enjoy the saine
rate as Brandon, regardless of the fact that
they may be seven or eight hundred miles
or even a thousand miles beyond Brandon.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Would it aise help some
points in eastern British Columnbia?
Hon. -Mr. Hugessen: It will help some
points in eastern British Columbia, but not
very much, because of the operation of ths
transcontinental rate to Vancouver plusth
regular rate back, which I mentioned afe
moments ago.
Honourable senators, having given the
background of the situation and what section 332B proposes to do, I amn sure you will
begin to appreciate the reason for some of
the vigorous arguments which were addressed to the committee, both for and against
this particular section. Honourable members
,of the cornrittee know my own views about
the section. I arn not proposing to advance
them, now; aIl I am trying to do is to give
the house as fair a description as I can of
the arguments which were advanced on both
sides.
In favour of the section, we received the
strongest of representations from the Province
of Alberta and, to some extent, frorn the
Province of Saskatchewan. The latter province, was not too greatly concerned, because
at least the eastern part of that province wil
not gain very much froin the application of
the one and one-third rude.
The reasons given by the proponents of the
section were more or less these: first, that

this section wiil carry out the recommendations of the royal commission-which is perfectly true; and second, that it will remedy
the injustice under which the west has
suifered for a number of years, namely, of
seeing goods frorn the East going through to
the Coast at much lower rates than to the
places through which they passed. Here 1
would again refer to the example of canned
goods. The 'third argument presented by the
proponents of this section, and. one which
irnpressed me, was a reference to, the condition which exists in the United States.
In that country there is, I arn told, what
is called the Spokane Rule, which was introduced by the Inter-state Commerce Commission a number of years ago. I amn not
sure whether that rule is sanctioned by legislation in the United States or whether it is
mereiy a rule of the commission; but under
the Spokane Rude rates to intermediate points
cannot be higher than rates to the Pacific
Coast, unless the Interstate Commerce Commission specifically allows such higher rates.
Those who argued against this sectionHon. Mr. Burchili: The honourable senator
mentioned the provinces of Alberta and
Saskatchewan. What about Manitoba?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I was coming to those
who were against this provision, and 1 was
going to start with the Province of British
Columbia. I think it is fair to say that British
Columbia opposed this one and one-third
rule because it feared that it would lose the
benefit of some of the transcontinental competitive rates. In other words, it feared that
if the railroads are unable to malntain these
transcontinental competitive rates as at present-and they are quite free to abandon
thern at any time-and as a consequence
suifer a great loss of revenue on shiprnents
-of goods to the Prairie Provinces, those rates
will have to be abandoned, and, British
Columnbia will lose the benefit of them.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Does this one and onethird provision -apply to.goods and commodities
ail across the board or only to a select ist
of commodities?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: As I endeavoured to
explain, it covers only a certain number of

rates cover are those wh.ich could as easily
and properly be sent by ship as by rail. There

apparently, for some reason or other furniture and automobiles going from the East
to the West cannot be conveniently or
properly or safely sent by sh.ip, so we are
not concerned with thein.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Such commodities might
be shipped by the Great Northern.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes, I said that there
is competition from the American railways
as well.
The second line of opposition came from the
Province of Manitoba and from the City
of Winnipeg. The basis of their opposition
was this. They said: "We are, and historically
always have been the distributing centre for
the West. What you are doing by instituting
this one and one-third rule and by making
the rate to Edmonton or Calgary substantially the same as the rate to Winnipeg, is
to work us an injustice, to cause us to lose
the geographical advantage which we now
possess through being closer to the East
than Edmonton and Calgary are."
The Canadian Pacific Railway also objected
to section 332B. Their objection was based
on different grounds. They said: "Whatever
happens under section 332B, we are bound
to lose revenue.
Either we abandon the
transcontinental competitive rates and lose
to the ships the traffic on which those rates
now apply, or we maintain the transcontinental competitive rates and lose a great deal
of revenue on our shipments to the interior
points." But I think the real basis of the
Canadian Pacific Railway's objection was to
the principle involved in this section 332B.
They were afraid of that section because it
makes a tie-up between competitive rates and
ordinary rates, a tie-up which, if extended in
other directions, might work greatly to the
disadvantage of the revenues of the railways.
Let me explain it this way. There are throughout his country a very large number of cases
in which, by reason of competitive rates, the
rates to farther points are lower than those
to nearer points; and it is the company's fear
that, if the regular rate is based upon a special
competitive rate in this instance, many other
communities that do not enjoy the benefit
of competitive rates which they see accorded
to communities farther away from the point
of shipment, may ask for relief of the
kind being granted under this section 332B.
I have mentioned those who appeared before
us in favour of the legislation and those who
appeared to oppose it. It only remains
for me to say a word about the attitude of
the Canadian National Railways, which was
more or less neutral. They said they did not
believe they would suffer very substantial
loss of revenue from the one and one-third
rule; that they might have to make some
adjustments upwards in the transcontinental
competitive rates as they exist at present.
But it seems to me that the basic thinking
of the Canadian National was this. Faced
with the Spokane Rule of 100 per cent in

the United States, they felt that they were
getting away rather well with the one and
one-third rule in section 332B.
Hon. Mr. Ross: They are, too.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I should say they are.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I have dealt with the
representations which were made to the committee, and now I want to turn to what the
committee did when faced with these representations. We did not take the extreme step
of suggesting that section 332B be deleted
from the bill. We maintained the one-andone-third principle, but we amended the section in two places by inserting in each case
the words, "unless the board for good cause
otherwise orders". The effect of these amendments would be to allow the Board of Transport Commissioners some discretion to vary
the one-and-one-third rule if in any special
case it was proved to the satisfaction of the
board that rigid application of the rule would
cause substantial dislocation and injustice.
I must say, honourable senators, that I'think
these are reasonable amendments.
Hon. Mr. Ross: The honourable gentleman
has said that there was considerable controversy in the committee over these two
sections. Would he be good enough to let us
know how the committee voted on these
amendments, how many members voted for
and how many voted against them?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The vote was seven to
four, if I recall rightly, in favour.
As I was saying, honourable senators, I
think these are reasonable amendments. After
all, this is new legislation.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask if any alternative
suggestion to the one-and-one-third rule was
made before the committee?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: No.
Hon. Mr. Euler: In face of the Spokane 100
per cent rule, I thought that somebody might
possibly have suggested that the rule here
should be somewhat less than one-and-onethird.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: No such representations
were made to our committee, but I understand that before the Royal Commission on
Transportation representatives of the Province of Alberta strongly urged that this
country should be given something similar
to the Spokane Rule. However, that was not
urged before our committee. I think it is fair
to say that the representatives of the Province
of Alberta who appeared before the conmittee were quite satisfied with what they
would get under section 332B.

DECEMBER 13, 1951
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask my honourable
friend if these amendments would give the
board power to fix the rate at less than oneand-one-third in any case?
Hon. Mr. Farris: It could do that, anyway.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: The board has power
to do that anyway, because section 332B as
it stands at present says that the rate to the
intermediate point shall be not more than
one-and-one-third the transcontinental competitive rate.
May I ask my
Hon. Mr. Robertson:
honourable friend a question? The illustration he gave of the rate between Montreal and Brandon was based on the assumption that Brandon was the place beyond
which the present rates would be uniform.
But if in their wisdom the Board of Transport Commissioners, on the basis of equalization, lowered the rate to Brandon below
the one-and-one-third rate, that assumption
would not apply, would it?
No. This merely
Hon. Mr. Hugessen:
applies to the rates between the East and
the western provinces as related to the transcontinental competitive rates.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: As they exist at present.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I do not know that
it would have any effect upon what I was
saying.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Except this, that on
the assumption that the one-and-one-third
rate was applied' where it could be applied,
the rates from the East to Brandon and
Edmonton could not exceed the one-and-onethird rates, but to Brandon they could be
less than one and one-third.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Oh, yes. Perhaps I
was incorrect in answering my honourable
friend. If the Board of Transport Commissioners were to lower the regular rate
between Montreal and Brandon, that would
have the effect of still further increasing this
vast area of territory in which ithe rate would
be the same.
Or of including the
Hon. Mr. Farris:
railway companies to abandon the transcontinental rates altogether.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: As I have said, honourable senators, I think this is a reasonable
amendment. After all, this is new legislation, and nobody knows exactly what effect
it will have or how it will work out in each
particular case. Many of those who appeared
before us in opposition to it expressed considerable apprehension as to the possible
effect it would have on their communities. It
was iri an endeavour to meet these apprehensions, and to allow the Board of Transport

Commissioners to deal with any case of
special hardship which might arise, that the
committee was prompted to suggest these
amendments to the bill. In other words,
what the committee has done is to retain
the one and one-third rule as a general principle, but to give the board some discretion
in its application of that rule. If the amendments suggested by your committee are
approved, the position here will be substantially the same as it is in the United States,
where as I mentioned a few moments ago,
the Spokane Rule is a rule of general application, but one which can be relaxed in
special cases if the Interstate Commerce
Commission thinks it advisable, just and fair.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Can the board, by the discretionary powers given to it, increase to
more than one and one-third the rates to
intermediate points?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I may put it the other
way: The board may retain the present rates,
which are more than one and one-third.
Hon. Mr. Vien: But the board has discretionary power to deal with the rule either
way?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes. At the present
time the board has power to reduce the rate
below the one and one-third. Under the
amendment it has discretionary powers, in
keeping with the wording of the amendment,
"for good cause", in so far as it will serve
the ends of justice and equity to do so.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: What is the meaning
of the words "for good cause"?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I should think they
would be a very strong indication to the
board that, the general policy of the one and
one-third rate having been set down, it would
have to be very careful to make sure that any
departure from that rule was fully justified
on the grounds of justice and equity.
Hon. Mr. Euler: The board is supposed to
do that anyway, is it not?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I do not know that I
can usefully say anything more on the
amendments. I have given as fairly as I can
the representations that were made to us,
the arguments that were presented on both
sides, and the results which the committee
arrived at as shown in the amendments now
before the house. I think the amendments
are just and reasonable, and I intend to support the action of the committee and vote in
favour of them.
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, the amendments made by the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications to the bill before the house would.

SENATE
amend the new section 332B, which deals
with competitive transcontinental rates, and
in accordance with my practice as leader of
the government in this house, any observations I make with respect to the amendments
made by the committee reflect the opinion
of the government. I have had the opportunity of presenting all these amendments to
the government and of asking for instructions.
Briefly, section 332B of the bill provides
that tariffs naming competitive transcontinental rates shall stipulate that the rates on
traffic carried to or from points in intermediate territory shall not be more than one-third
greater than the transcontinental rate on the
same kind of traffic. This is known as the
one and one-third rule.
Competitive transcontinental rates apply
on traffic hauled by the railways across the
continent in competition with steamships
operating through the Panama Canal or direct
to Pacific Coast ports. United States railroads
carrying traffic into Vancouver also provide
competition.
For many years complaints made on behalf
of consumers and distributors in Albertaespecially at Calgary and Edmonton-and
also in Saskatchewan, have pointed out the
anomalies resulting from the these transcontinental rates from Eastern Canada to the
Pacific Coast as compared with the normal
rates to intermediate points. For example,
it would be cheaper to ship certain commodities like canned goods from Eastern
Canada to Vancouver and back to Calgary,
or Edmonton, than to pay the normal class
rate to Calgary, or Edmonton.
That
is the illustration which the honourable
Chairman of the Transport Committee gave
to the house. The transcontinental rates,
which are low in comparison with rates to
intermediate points, are relatively few in
number, but they have given rise to bitter
complaints and endless debate. Under the
present provisions of the Railway Act they
have been justified on the same grounds as
other competitive rates, and so have escaped
the application of the long and short haul
clause of the Railway Act, which, in all cases
except in respect of competitive rates, prohibits a railway company from charging
greater rates for a shorter distance than it
does for longer distance.
The whole matter was considered by the
Royal Commission on Transportation, which
came to the following conclusion:
". . . that when the railways give the trader and
consumer at the Pacific coast the benefit of fast
railway service at rates that are very little more
than ocean rates and thus provide them with two
alternate services at almost the same price, the

consumers in Alberta and other intermediate provinces are entitled to share in an equitable degree in
the beneficial condition thus created by the railways.
The influence of any transcontinental rate from
the East to the British Columbia Coast should be
carried back in the rates to the intermediate provinces (including points in British Columbia east of
the coast) on a basis of not more than one-third
greater than the transcontinental rate on the sea
coast. This is a logical and simple solution to the
matter, one that is readily calculated and applied;
it recognizes the influence on Alberta of intercoastal competition, but at the same time does not
lead to the extreme conclusion that Alberta should
have sea coast rates."

The Royal Commission recommended that
the Railway Act should be amended to provide that when competitive transcontinental
tariffs are published by the railways, such
tariffs shall contain a provision that the rates
to or from intermediate territory shall not
exceed the transcontinental rates by more
than one-third. Section 332B was drafted to
give effect to this recommendation. The
amendment made by the committee added the
words "unless the board for good cause otherwise orders" at the end of paragraphs (a) and
(b), subsection (2) of section 332B.
In the opinion of the government this
amendment would seriously impair, by reason
of uncertainty, the effect of this section. It
would raise doubt about what otherwise is
a clear statutory direction on the one and
one-third rule, and would open the door to
many rate cases, leaving it to the board to
determine whether the rule should apply.
Our understanding of the amendment is
that it means that tariffs naming a competitive
rate for transcontinental freight traffic shall
provide for the application of the one and
one-third rule unless the board for good cause
otherwise orders. This appears to be an open
invitation for applications to the board for
relief from the application of this section and
for an interpretation of the phrase "for good
cause". What other results would flow from
this amendment are at the moment not clear.
Honourable senators, this matter has been
given careful consideration by the royal commission and by the government. We are in
accord with the views expressed in our own
committee that the application of this section
as it stood before amendment will give relief
to the western provinces which have complained of the discrimination against their
shippers and consumers, and at the same time
will not be unfair or prejudicial to the other
provinces, or to the railways.
For these reasons the government is not in
favour of the amendment.

ablest jurists tJhis country lias even knx'awn.
He has presided over several commissions,
and I question whether any other member
of the judiciary has sa intimate a knowledga
matters. Unequestionof transportation
ably he is a most impartial man. The commission over which he presided received
evidence from 'ail over the country.
Alberta presented its case. But Alberta's
case was not accepted and recommended'by no means. The province's representations
will be f ound at page 99 of the repart.
What the commission proposed, and -what we
are naw discussing-namely, ths one ami
one-third rate--did not originate with the
Alberta representatives. As a matter of fact
this rate will not be sa helpful ta Alberta
as its own proposai would have been,
because Alberta's suggestion was mare or
less alang the lina of what has been termed
the Spokane Rula. Those of us who live
in Alberta know a gaod deal about it. It
bas been argued in aur chambars of commerce and other bodies that a mile similar

ta the Spokane Rule shouid be made applicable in Western Canada; and, as I have said,
Alberta's case as presented to the commission was that something along that line
should ha adopted.
The chairman of the cornmittee, lni submitting the report and referring to the
attitude of the Canadian National Railways,
hinted or intimated, I believe, that they had
in mind the thought that the alternative
would be the Spokane Rule. But in the bill
it is proposed to apply what la now cafled
the one and one-third rate; and I want that
to stay in the bill, unaffected by any alteration whatever. I f eel that if this amendment should be adopted, everything would
be wide open again; there would be frequent
hearings before the Transport Commissioners,
and it would be argued that there was no
statutory reason why they should flot do this
or that or the other thing. We would be
involved in continual arguments befare the
board. To remove that possibility, I want
the bull to state exactly where we are in this
matter of rates. The recommendations of
a commission which. has spent as much Urne
in examining transportation matters as the
Royal Commission on Transportation has,
deserve aur serious consideration, and we
should be very careful about repudiating
them. If any are to be rejected, it should be
only for really good reasons.
I remember that when the report was
published, nuany of its recommendations were
reoaived with general acclaizn, not on]y
throughout Western Canada, but in other
parts of the country as well. Perhaps, however, I should confine my reniarks to Alberta.
I feel that this partictilar recommendation
is going to provide some relief ta parts of
Western Canada, and while the provision
recornmended will not give the measure of
relief sought by Alberta, it is being accepted
now because it is the only relief available.
I could give the Alberta viewpoint by
quoting from the report of the Royal Commission and from. the evidence given before
the Senate Committee, but I shahl not do
that I shall simply say that we consider
this suggestion from, the royal commission
as more or less a compromise ta meet conditions that we know to exist in the area
affected. I did not rise to carry on the
debate at length, and I do flot intend to, go
into a lot of material that I could read.
Those who acquainit themselves fully with
the position taken by Alberta will find that
the proposai made by that province before
the commission was far apart from the cammission's recommendation. Hawever, Alberta
is accepting that recommendation, and I feel
sure that I arn expressing the viewpoint of

SENATE
many parts of Western Canada, including
Alberta, when I say that there should be no
interference with this statutory provision.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
perhaps it is poor tacties to rise now, but I
want to say a few words at this stage of the
debate. The question before the house is a
difficult one. The royal commission has
recommended the policy of equalization of
freight rates across Canada, and that is what
this legislation attempts to promulgate. Let
us see how it endeavours to accomplish this.
It is said that under this legislation there
are certain exemptions from equalization. I
agree that this is so, but I would point
out that these exemptions or exceptions existed before this legislation was drafted. The
Maritime freight rates, the Crowsnest Pass
rates and our international rates are all exceptions, and this legislation suggests that they
remain in operation. This may be in contradiction to the recommendation that there
be equalization, but it is a recognition that
our country has grown up under these exceptions. Incidentally, I want to say that I
never missed a meeting of our committee,
that I never was late for meeting, and that
I never left a meeting before it completed
its business. The chairman and the vicechairman of the committee will readily admit,
I think, that I did my share of cross-examining of witnesses who appeared before the
committee.
Equalization is the policy recomnended by
the commission. I would point out, however,
that even if the one and one-third rule were
omitted altogether, at least 50 per cent of
the present tariffs coming under this legislation would not be affected at all. In other
words, ail we are dealing with is probably
50 per cent of the transportation business of
this country.
None of those in favour of equalization
have argued more strenuously than the
people of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta
and British Columbia. In Western Canada
they have argued in season and out of season,
talking over fences, and anywhere else. They
have been in favour of eaualization-and that
is what the commission recommended. Then
along came the people of the Maritime Provinces, maintaining that they were operating
under a certain agreement made at the time
of confederation. They argued that the benefits under this agreement were given to them
to make ýup for certain losses they would
incur as a result of confederation. There is
no question that the large and profitable trade
our Maritimes enjoyed with the eastern
United States was lost as a result of confederation; and so the Maritime freight rates
were brought into effect to help the industries
of the Maritimes to compete with those of

Ontario and Quebec. I do not think any of
us can challenge this argument, and from my
own observation and from talking with members from the Maritime provinces I am persuaded that that condition still exists, and
that those rates are still needed to put the
Maritimes on even a reasonable equality with
the rest of Canada.
Let us deal now with the Prairie Provinces.
There is no doubt that the Crowsnest Pass
Agreement is of immense value to the producers of the three Prairie Provinces in particular, and is of some value to the producers
of British Columbia. Our four western provinces have advocated equalization of freight
rates right from the start, fighting for it
before the Board of Transport Commissioners
ahl year round. As a matter of fact, sometimes I thought they were just wasting the
money they were paying counsel.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Money paid to lawyers is
never wasted.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It depends who the lawyers
are.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Would the honourable
senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) summarize the Crowsnest Pass Agreement for
us?
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is simply an agreement
that a rate of 20 cents a hundred pounds
will apply to grain originating in Western
Canada and being shipped to Fort William.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: From any point in
Western Canada?
Hon. Mr. Haig: It depends on the distance,
of course, but that is the basic rate. The
regular rate would be 41 cents.
Honourable senators, this section introduces
an exception to the equalization of freight
rates right off the bat, and I say to the honourable senator from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr.
Buchanan) that within a very few years we
shall see parties writing exemption after
exemption into this legislation in the hope
of getting votes at coming elections. As
honourable senators can see, even before this
statute has been passed they have started
writing exemptions into it. Somebody said
to me the other day, "You are voting for the
Maritimes and you are also voting for the
continuance of the Crowsnest Pass Agreement. Why don't you kick out the Crowsnest
agreement and have equalization ail over?"
Well, I have stated my position. The Honourable senator
from
Bruce
(Hon.
Mr.
Stambaugh) said the other day, "This means
that whereas we used in Alberta to pay $7
on the standard rate, we shall now pay only
$3.25". Well, of course, any exemption means
that somebody will benefit. I admit that the

DECEMBER 13, 1951
number of articles covered by the transcontinental rate will not seriously affect the
province of Manitoba, and I am wholeheartedly behind the equalization of freight rates.
I want to remind my Ontario and Quebec
friends that we have always felt those provinces never paid their share of the shot as
far as railroads were concerned. That was
because of their geographical position, I
admit, but on the whole we felt that if there
had been a nearer approach to equalization
we would have got a fairer deal. But no
sooner were we granted equalization by the
board than exceptions were put in. Largely
they applied to Alberta, though they do apply
also to Saskatchewan. But there are no manufacturing centres in that part of the country.
In my province the legislation will affect
manufacturing industries in the cities of Winnipeg, Saint Boniface and Portage la Prairie.
Those cities were built up by manufacturing
commodities which were shipped through the
west.
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: You are not opposed
to the development of industries in Alberta?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No. In time there will be
more industries in Alberta than in any other
province. With the natural resources it possesses, Alberta cannot go wrong, even with
a bad government.
Now, I do not care what any railroad man
says, the minute this bill is passed and the
one-and-one-third rule becomes effective, the
transcontinental rate to Vancouver will go up.
Make no mistake about that. It is all right
for some people to say it will not go up, but
it is bound to go up-how far will depend
on exactly how much freight the railroads
carry between Winnipeg and Vancouver at
less than the regular rate by reason of this
one-and-one-third fare. If my friend from
Edmonton (Hon. Mr. MacKinnon) thinks he
is going to benefit from the one-and-one-third
rule, I suggest to him that by the time the
Board of Transport Commissioners gets
through examining the whole problem the
people of Alberta will still be paying the same
freight rates, on the average, as they are
paying now. Take steel, for instance. The
rate to Vancouver will have to be increased
to enable the railway companies to carry it
at the one-and-one-third rate to Calgary and
Edmonton. It is mathematically impossible to
have it otherwise. I spoke to a man who is
said to be one of the best experts in America
on rates, and he said: "If this section is
adopted we shall lose money in some sections,
and the rates in other sections will have to
be raised to make up the loss". There may be
slight reductions in some provinces. Saskatchewan and Alberta may get a little relief,
but very little.

If I had it within my power I would have
voted this section out altogether. That was
my personal feeling, and it still is. I am not
saying that to influence anyone else. My point
is that we should not pass a bill which in one
section equalizes rates and in the very next
section destroys the equalization.
In the committee I voted for the amendments. I may be offending some of my friends
in saying this, but honestly, all that the committee is doing in these amendments to section 332B is saying to the Board of Transport
Commissioners that the board should not
vary the effect of the section unless it deems
it necessary to do so in order to avoid hardship in certain instances. Now, the board
is composed of reasonably sensible men, I
hope-at least, I have always thought they
were-and I can see no real objection to these
amendments to the section. I say to you,
honourable senators, that I shall sleep soundly
tonight if this section is amended as suggested
by the committee; and I shall sleep soundly
if the section is left as it was when we
received the bill. I am positive that the
people whom I have the honour to represent
in this house will not lose much sleep either,
whether we amend the bill as proposed or
not.
I believe that Alberta would have been
getting off very well if the section were not
changed, but I do not think the amendment
would make much difference even to that
prQvince. The senator from Lethbridge (Hon.
Mr. Buchanan) says, in effect, that his province
would prefer to rely upon the statute rather
than upon the opinion of the Board of
Transport Commissioners. Well, if we feel
that way we should specify al the rates in
the statute, and say that Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia shall
not pay higher rates than Ontario and Quebec
pay. Then we from the West would all vote
for the bill. But, would a bill of that kind
be fair? We have to take into account the
geographical contours of the country. We
must remember that Ontario and Quebec
have waterways all around them, that the
great centres of population are in these
provinces, and that they are closer to the big
markets for the goods they produce than the
other provinces are. Then, too, the weather
in the central provinces permits much more
effective motor truck transportation throughout the year than is possible on the prairies.
I know that Alberta used to boast about its
wonderfully moderate temperatures, but in the
last couple of years they have been acting
up a bit occasionally, and I think the railways
are still essential out there.
Some members of our group over here feel
that the western half of Saskatchewan will
benefit from this legislation, if any benefit

SENATE
does come from it, and that the eastern half
will lose, if any loss is suffered. As to Manitoba, about one-quarter of the province might
get a litle help from the measure, and the
other three-quarters will not be helped at all.
Well, three-quarters are bigger than onequarter, so I know how I am going to vote.
If I were allowed to make a suggestion to the
senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
and the senator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr.
Horner), it would be that they toss a coin
to decide how they should vote.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: We will vote with
Alberta.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, I shall not lose any
sleep if you vote with Alberta. I think that
what is being offered us here is a kind of
compromise. Alberta might get some sentimental satisfaction if its position is upheld,
but in Manitoba we are not being fooled for
one minute by thinking that we shall get
much relief or suffer much injury whatever
decision is made on the matter here.
Hon. Mr. Buchanan: Let us not take any
chances.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators, I
am not a member of the Standing Committee
on Transportation, and though I attended
one or two of its meetings I am not as familiar
as I should like to be with the details of the
bill. I rise only to make a few observations,
but not in the hope that anything done here
will enable me to sleep well tonight or any
other night.
First let me say that I agree with the leader
of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), that while
the purpose of this bill is to establish equalization of rates, that purpose is not attained.
Hon. Mr. Farquhar: I cannot hear you back
here.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Wait till he gets warmed
up.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Say something against margarine and then you will be able to hear him.
Hon. Mr. Euler: There does not appear to
be much cause for me to get very warm about
this. I cannot see that it holds out any great
advantage for my province of Ontario. It is
not possible to bring about real equalization
of rates by this measure, because the bill does
not do away with an already existing exception to equalization. I refer to the Crownest
Pass rates. I may say without exaggeration
that as a member of the House of Commons I
had something to do with the continuing of
those rates, some thirty years ago.
Hon. Mr. Asletine: 1922.
Hon. Mr. Euler: When the rate structure
has such exceptions as the Maritime Freight

Rates Act and this one and one-third rule,
it does not result in true equalization. Perhaps we are trying to get as near to that as we
can; the exceptions may be necessary to attain
that end and I do not quarrel with them.
One point concerns me. Can anyone tell
me by what means this figure of one and
one-third was arrived at? It seems to me to
be entirely arbitrary. The Spokane rate,
which is 100 per cent, provides that no higher
rate shall be charged for a short distance
than for a longer distance. I am rather surprised that those who are directly affected,
particularly the people from the Prairie
Provinces, did not ask for the Spokane rate.
How, I ask, did the proponents of the bill
arrive at the one and one-third rate?
I wish to say a word with regard to the
proposed amendments to section 332B. The
bill as presented called for a rate not higher
than one and one-third of the transcontinental rate. The amendment would incorporate
into the section the words "unless the board
for good cause otherwise orders". My friend
from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan) is
against the amendment for the reason that he
thinks the clause as it stands gives some certainty. If I were from Alberta, I would have
an additional reason for opposing the amendment. If I interpret the wording correctly, the
board instead of reducing the rate below one
and one-third might increase it. Perhaps I am
reading something into the section which is
not intended, but to me it says in good
English that the railways may go to the
Board of Transport Commissioners and ask
for an increase of rates over and above the
one and one-third rule. That objection was
not expressed by my friend from Lethbridge,
but it seems to me a sound reason why .he
would be opposed to the amendment. I
would oppose it on the same grounds.
Further, I repeat that I have no explanation of why the arbitrary rate of one and
one-third was arrived at, and that to me is
important.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Mr. Chairman, the purposes of the amendments contained in the
bill to amend the Railway Act are several in
character, but the important one is to be
found in section 332A which declares the
national freight rates policy. The only purpose behind that declaration that we have
heard of so far, is the policy of equalizing
freight rates as far as possible.
I am not blind to the fact that while the
idea may be a laudable one, by reason of
the character of our country, long distances
and competitive factors, it is beyond the

DECEMBER 13, 1951
power of parliament or the Board of Transto accomplish any
port Commissioners
absolute equalization of freight rates. My
criticism of the section under review is that,
as drafted, it limits the authority of the
Transport Board to apply the equalization
principle. The most fortunate people in
regard to the effeet of this legisiation are
our friends east of Montreal, particularly
east of Levis.
Han. Mr. McLean: No.
An Hon. Senator: And west of Fort William.
Han. Mr. Crerar: 1 arn not going to debate
the point with my friend, but every privilege that the Maritime provinces have had
under the Maritime Freight Rates Act is preserved intact by this legisiation. The freight
carried in that area is a very important segment of the freîght business of Canada.
There are other exceptions. In*deed, the
Minîster of Railways recently iuformed the
Transport Committee-of which 1 amn not a
member, but the chairman courteously permitted me to ask some questions--that at
least 50 per cent of the total volume of traffic was excluded from the application of this
principle of equalization.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Correct.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Then how is it possible
to carry out a policy of equalization o! rates,
when at the very commencement of the consideration of the matter it is agreed that 50
per cent, or bal! of the total freight volume,
must not be affected by the policy? 1 submit
that it is a sad mistake to hold out false
hopes to many people who may think that by
these amendments they are going to get an
equalized system of freight rates.
I ýcome now to the section under consideration at the moment, and the proposed amendment to it. Our colleague from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) gave a very clear expianation o! the -purpose of the ameudment in
the bill. The situation may be briefly summarized this way: By reason of competitive
rates we find today that goods shipped froni
say Hamilton, Ontario, to Vancouver, enj oy
a preferred rate. That arrangement was, in
the wisdom o! the authorities in the past, considered essential, but it bas produced certain
inequities. As our colleague from, Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) has stated, the rate
froni Hamilton to Vancouver on a carload of
canned goods is $1.57, while the rate to Calgary is $2.97.
That is, the rate to Calgary was put at a
point where the railway could meet the

charges arising from the shipment of a carload of goods ,- Vancouver and their shipment back to Ca.,gary. I assume that Edmonton carrnes about the same rate. Our colleague from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) asked
the very pertinent question, "What is the
basis of this recommendation of one and onethird? Why was it suggested? Why, for
instance, should the rate to Edmonton from
Hamilton flot exceed one and one-third of
the rate to Vancouver? Unquestionably, as
far as our Alberta frienýds are concerned, this
provision removes or lessens an inequity. But
such are the mysterious workîngs o! freight
rates, that in removing that inequity it produces another so f ar as the city of Winnipeg
is coucerned. Winnipeg cannot benefit at al
from. the application of the one-and-one-third
prînciple.
So we have an anornalous situation which,
I may illustrate iu this way. Assume that
when the ameudment to the bill is passed one
carload o! canned goods is shipped to Winnipeg and another carload is shipped to
Edmonton. Relatively speaking, the increase
in rates to Edmouton is proportiouately
much less than it should be on a mileage
basis, with the resuit that an Edmonton
merchant wiil be lu a position to take lu a
carload o! canned goods and ship it back as
far as Prince Albert in competition with a
Winnipeg merchant who, having received a
carload of canned goods frorn Hamilton, also
wauts to ship it ta Prince Albert. I submit
that that produces precisely the sanie sort
o! inequity as we are endeavouring ta remove
by the application a! the one and one-third
principle to Edmanton as against Vancouver.
What is sought to be doue through the
ameudmeut? Ail the ameudmeut does-aud
I arn supportiug it-is to say that the one
and one-third principle shail apply unless
the Board of Transport Commissioners, for
good cause, otherwise orders. Iu other words,
while the ameudment is peremptory and
maudatory, in that it requires the board ta
see ta it that these rates wiil not be exceeded
by more than one and one-third lu the case
of Edmonton as against Vancouver, it gives
the board latitude to consider further
whether or not there is a good cause why
this procedure shouid uot be applied. Clearly
it is beyoud the power a! parliameut ta study
freight rates and ta determine what is or
what is not equitable. Ail that parliameut
can do and ail that it should do is ta lay
down principles to guide the board; aud froni
that point a! view, I think, the bill would

have been a better one had it been niuch
simpler, and conslsted simply o! a direction

SENATE
to the board, based on national policy, that as
far as possible the board shall enforce
equality in respect of freight rates.
Make no mistake about it, these amendments do not solve the question. We shall
have interminable arguments before the
Board of Transport Commissioners for the
next several years when they are considering
this matter; and while, unlike my friend the
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) I
do not care to enter the realm of prophecy,
I agree with him that this bill does not solve
the question, that it cannot fairly be
described as a measure to equalize freight
rates across Canada, that it does not equalize
freight rates, and that under the powers conferred through these amendments the Board
of Transport Commissioners cannot equalize
freight rates. Why then should it be called
a measure for the equalization of freight
rates? We shall continue, no doubt, to have
the same sort of controversies before the
Board of Transport Commissioners as we
have had in the past, but because this amendment of section 332B does give a little more
latitude to the Board of Transport Commissioners, I am going to support it. It may
justify only a slender hope, but at any rate
it is a move in the right direction.
Hon. J. Wesley Siambaugh:. I am going
to try to answer some of the questions that
have been asked in this discussion. I believe
the honourable senator from De Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Vien) inquired why we had not
asked for the Spokane rate, which would
be 100 per cent equalization. Alberta's representatives did ask for it, but the royal commission did not accept their views; why, I
do not know.
I am prepared to admit that the present
proposai is not equalization, but at least it
is a step in that direction, and it does not
prohibit the Board of Transport Commissioners from equalizing freight rates. It
merely sets a ceiling, a maximum. It is
possible that the reason the Spokane rate
was not accepted was a desire to pleose
Winnipeg.
The Winnipeg representatives
seem to feel rather keenly that they are losing an advantage they have had for years,
but at the same time we have been to some
extent at a disadvantage. The one-and-onethird rate will give us something we have
not had, and the rate to Winnipeg will not
be raised, but our rates on transcontinental
freight will be lowered.
The honourable leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) said he thought that to
pass on freight rates was beyond the powers
of parliament.
I would suggest, if that

is so, that is the reason the royal commission was appointed. Let us accept its recommendations without amendment. I think the
commission was a very capable body, and
i-t spent a lot of time on this matter. The
leader of the opposition prophesies that the
transcontinental rates will go up. The solicitor for the Canadian National Railways
does not think they will. I do not intend to
enter the realm of prophecy by predicting
whether they will be increased or not; I
am prepared to accept counsel's opinion on
this point.
This bill is not limited, and the board can
do as it likes about equalization. What this
amendment really does is to throw the whole
case as regards the one and one-third rate
right back in the lap of the Board of Transport Commissioners. As I stated before, the
solicitor for the C.N.R. said that they have
no objection to the original wording of the
bill. He did not say that we need this amendment; but if it passes you can expect the
C.P.R. to camp right on the doorstep of the
board to get the rate raised on this or that
commodity. On the other hand, if we turn
down this amendment and pass the original
bill, we will take that load off the shoulders
of the board in the same manner as we did
when we made the Maritime rates mandatory.
The royal commission, which recommended
the clause in the original bill was composed
of men picked because of their special fitness
for the position. The chairman is especially
well known for his experience and ability.
The commission studied 150 briefs prepared
by groups of businessmen right across Canada.
Sittings were held in every province. The
commission also had the advice of counsel
from eight provinces, counsel for the railroads, as well as numerous independent
counsel representing the various associations
which presented briefs. I want to say that if
the counsel from the other provinces were
of the same calibre as those from Alberta,
they were indeed topnotchers. The royal coinmission had the best advice obtainable; it
spent months studying these rates from aill
angles; so surely I will be pardoned if I say
I would rather take the advice of the commission than that of some honourable senators
here who have not had nearly as much
experience or chance to study this question
as had the members of the royal commission.
Alberta has been discriminated against in
the matter of freight rates more than any
other province. We pay more freight on the
products we ship out as well as on the
products shipped in. It would appear that
the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)
is opposing this one and one-third rate
because it appears that on some articles

DECEMBER 13, 1951

Alberta might get a better rate than Winnipeg. It may be shocking to Winnipegers that
Alberta should enjoy a better freight rate
than Winnipeg, but if this does happen it will
be the first time.
It has been stated that the Crowsnest Pass
rate, which gives us cheap rates on our grain,
makes up for the high rates we pay on other
commodities; but Saskatchewan and Manitoba enjoy the advantage of the Crowsnest
Pass rate, which is for all the western provinces, and is of equal value to Winnipeg as
to Calgary. The freight rate under the Crowsnest Pass Agreement is 26 cents per one hundred pounds from Calgary, and 14 cents per
one hundred pounds from Winnipeg. In other
words, it costs us just about double the
amount per bushel to ship grain to Fort William from Calgary that it costs from Winnipeg.
They have an advantage over us there, but
I do not see how that can be helped.
Hon. Mr. Haig. How many miles is it from
Calgary to the waterfront?
Hon. Mr. Sambaugh: About 1,200 miles.
Hon. Mr. Haig. And Winnipeg is about 400
miles.
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, we ought to get a
cheaper rate?
Hon. Mr. S±ambaugh: Well, you have it.
You get a rate of 14 cents.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: It is proportionately
cheaper from Calgary.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: Winnipeg ships its
grain for half the price it costs us to ship
ours. It seems to me that the Winnipeggers
want to get it both ways.
Mention has been made of our natural
resources in Alberta and what a rich province
we are; but the benefits from these natural
resources are not enjoyed very much by the
,average Albertan. In the first place, the
federal government gave about half of these
natural resources to the C.P.R. to help that
company build a railroad, not just to serve
Alberta but so as to create a transcontinental
railroad to British Columbia. As I say, the
C.P.R. was given nearly one-half of the richest
land in Alberta, including the natural
resources. Today the C.P.R. is getting millions
of dollars in revenue from those natural
resources, and that revenue is not going
back into the railroad to reduce our freight
rates. Recently the provincial government
turned over practically the other half of the
available natural resources to American oil
companies, all of which means that the individual person in Alberta is not rich. You
might say that the C.P.R. has already received
one-half of our birthright. Surely no one

could begrudge us this one and one-third
rate on the transcontinental freight rates.
So I say that we should kill this amendment and leave the rate as recommended
by the royal commission, and I am going to
move that the amendment before us be not
concurred in.
Hon. Mr. Aselitine: Mr. Chairman, is this a
proper amendment? Surely the usual procedure is just to vote in favour of or against
the amendment when the question is put.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I think that is correct.
I do not think the amendment offered just
now is necessary. All the honourable senator
from Bruce (Mr. Stambaugh) has to do is
to vote against my motion.
The Hon. the Chairman: I was just about
to rule that this amendment is out of order.
Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators,
during the course of this discussion the remark
has been made that transcontinental competitive rates are iniquitous. In my opinion, transcontinental rates may perhaps be anomalous
but they are certainly not iniquitous.
Why do the railways publish transcontinental competitive rates on shipments to Pacific
or Atlantic points of destination? The reason
is that if they did not do so the traffic would
go to water carriers or to other railroads.
Transcontinental rates are lower than rates
applicable to similar goods consigned to intermediate points. That may seem anomalous
at first sight.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Is it necessary for the
railways to give these transcontinental rates?
Hon. Mr. Vien: Yes, it is. If they did not
do so traffic would go to their competitorswater carriers via the Panama Canal, or other
Canadian or American rail carriers. If that
happened, what advantage would people at
intermediate points derive from such a
condition?
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question? Did anyone
say that the transcontinental rates were
iniquitous?
Hon. Mr. Vien: I understood the honourable
gentleman from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
to say that the transcontinental rates had
resulted in iniquity.
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: I did not hear him
say that.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I thought I understood him
correctly.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: I think he said
"inequity".
Hon. Mr. MacKinnon: Yes, "inequity", not
"iniquity".

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Vien: If something causes
inequity, is it not iniquitous?
I submit that people located at intermediate
points are not injuriously affected in any way.
Our freight rate structure contains many
other anomalies which cannot be done away
with. This very bill freezes again, by law,
several anomalous rate groups: for example,
the Crowsnest Pass rate, the Maritime rates,
etc. It has been said also that the people
in Quebec and Ontario enjoy lower rates than
those published on similar traffic consigned
to other parts of the country. But the territory of Quebec and Ontario has a peculiar
geographic situation; it is crossed and surrounded by waterways. If the rail rates in
those provinces were higher, much traffic
would be diverted to water carriers and some
of it to American railroads. Surely our railway companies should be entitled to retain as
much traffic as possible for their own lines.
And why should Quebec and Ontario be
deprived of the advantage accruing from their
geographical position? This does not penalize
the rest of the country, even if it creates
anomalies in our freight rate structure. If
by publishing higher rates in Ontario and
Quebec our railways lost traffic, the people of
other provinces would not be benefited at all.
And similarly, people at intermediate points
are not penalized because transcontinental
British
competitive rates are published.
Columbia, for instance, gets a benefit by the
fact that the rates to intermediate points in
that province are a combination of the transcontinental rates plus the local rates back to
the point of destination. Who suffers thereby?
The rates to intermediate points in that
province are lower, and the rates to intermediate points in other provinces are not
made higher.
We are told: people want equalization of
rates. It was aptly stated by the senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) that 50 per
cent of railroad traffic in Canada is excluded
from the application of this bill: namely,
the traffic protected by the provisions of the
Maritime Freight Rates Act and of the
Crowsnest Pass legislation; also all traffic
moving under other competitive or international rates, or joint through rates, etc.
Certain territories, advantageously located,
will continue to benefit from tariffs published
for the purpose of retaining traffic, and no
rate structure can flatten the Rockies or
change other geographical disabilities. We

freight rates.
principle of national policy, and at times it
has deemed it advisable to do ýso. Groups
of rates have been frozen in our rate structure by law. From many angles the measures
which have done this have been found to be
detrimental to the carriers and to sections
of Canada; from other aspects they are justified. As a former member of the other
house, I recall voting there for the reinstatement of the Crowsnest Pass agreement,
in 1922, and later, for the Maritime Freight
Rates Act. I am still of the opinion that
this was in the public interest, but it could
be said to be a most unorthodox method of
making railway rates.
Notwithstanding the exhaustive inquiry
carried out by the Royal Commission and
the very full information presented to the
committees of parliament which have studied
this bill, I am satisfied that we cannot
today visualize all the conditions under
which this section may be applied. It was
for that very reason that, in 1904, parliament
created the Board of Railway Commissioners,
now known as the Board of Transport Commissioners. Theretofore appeals on rate and
other railway matters were heard by the
Railway Committee of the Privy Council.
It soon became obvious that the cabinet, the
Governor in Council, was quite unable to
deal properly with such appeals. It had
neither the time, experience nor organization to discharge those important duties
properly. So the Board of Railway Commissioners was created and given wide jurisdiction. Since then, the board has at all times,
I believe, discharged its duties ably, efficiently and in the best interest of all the
people of Canada. Its first chairman was
the Honourable Mr. Blair, from Saint John,
New Brunswick, formerly Minister of Railways. The amendment recommended by our
committee purports to give to the board discretionary powers. This is in keeping with
the government policy under which the board
has been created; it is a wise amendment.
If the iron rule expressed in the
unamended section of this bill were enacted,
the railways might find themselves obliged
to cancel certain transcontinental rates. Who,
may I ask, would benefit by such a change?
If railway companies found that the loss

benefits derived from the transcontinental
rate, they would be compelled. either ta
increase or cancel. that rate, without profit to
anyane, and the rigidity of this clause would
leave them fia alternative.
Let us not forget that it is the duty of the
board ta make sure that competitive rates be
compensatory. If, therefore, the board had
no discretianary powers and had ta apply this
iran rule, and the rate were found na.n-compensatory, the board would have no alternative but ta disallow the rate altogether. The
Province of British Columbia and the Maritime Provinces would lose the benefit of
transcontinental rates, the railways would
lose traffic ta competitors and intermediate
points would have gained nathing whatsaever. The amendment suggested is a wise
one. There would be no large amount of litigation befare the board, which would use its
discretionary powers sparingly and judiciously.
I amn in favaur of this amendment.
Hon. J. W. deB. Farris: Mr. Chairman and
honourable senators, I rise with a littie
hesitation because speeches already made
have clearly enunciated the views -that I hold
in this matter. However, as the subject is

to say is that if the people there think the
resources are being dissipated-perhaps that
is a better word-it is a poor argument to
say that compensation for such dissipation
should be loaded on to the other provinces of
Canada.
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: I would point out
that one of the reasons given for our flot
needing the freight benefits was that we were
s0 rich.
Han. Mr. Farris: Nearly everybody thaught

Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: I told you we were

Hon. Mr. Farris: I repeat, if the people of

is flot a good argument why the burden of

Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: We used hait of aur

asking for a littie return.
An Hon. Senalor: Order.
Han. Mr. Farris: Mr. Chairman, 1 approach
this question a littie differently from some
of the other honourable gentlemen who supported the amendmeflt. I agree with the sentiment of disapproval of the section, but I see no
advantage in unduly pressing that objection
at this stage. It is undoubtedly the declared
policy of the government, it is unquestionably
the recommendation of the royal Commission;
the measure has been passed by the House of
Commons, 50 I would not at this stage undertake to buck the tide. I have practiced law
long enough to know that it is unwise to
attempt what is impossible; it only interferes
with what one might otherwise do.
I arn not here tonight, sir, either to oppose
government policy, as it ought to be understood, or to block the recommendations of
the royal commission. But 1 arn here to say
that it is possible ta make some improvements
in those recommendations, and 1 think this
amendment has that effect. To the extent that
it gives a better application of the principle
involved, I think honourable senators might
well support it.
In expressing my views I may be regarded
as a partisan, for I represent the great Province of British Columbia. Provinces other than
British Columbia and the Prairie Provinces

SENATE
should approach this question with a little
more detached mind. It is to them that I
particularly address any remarks that I have
to make. In doing so of course, I shall, and
of necessity, repeat some of the things that
have already been said.
I am not an expert on freight rates, but
there are principles of rate-making which we
all recognize and which, I think, may even
again be re-instated. The government of this
country by its legislation has declared and
proclaimed the doctrine of mileage uniformity.
I do not agree with the suggestion that there
is inconsistency in the fact that it does not
prevail 100 per cent. It is not practical nor
wise that it should. In the first place, there
is the obvious exception; and it is an old
and wise saying that "the exception proves
the rule." I refer to the Maritime freight
rates. I come from the Maritime Provinces,
and I retain a great affection for the country
of my birth. I believe I understand their
problems, and no one would more gladly
support their position if in any way it were
threatened. All I would do is to point out to
my friends from the Maritime Provinces that
British Columbia is the great maritime province in the West, and ask them to extend to
our province some of that consideration
which has enabled them to bring about what
they have accomplished.
Also there is the Crowsnest Pass rate, and
this basic exception of competitive rates.
The principle of competitive rates has
always existed in connection with rate-making
organizations or establishments.
But that
principle does not mean that you are unjust
to one locality because you benefit another. If
any unfairness were attempted, there is always
the Board of Transport Commissioners to take
care of it. But the competitive principle recognizes that there are two types of freight rates,
There is the rate in regard to commodities for
a community that can be served only by a
railway and which alone can justify the
existence and operation of a railway. That is
the basic type of freight transportation which
must justify the existence of the railway and
the rates that they charge. Then there is
the type of freight which is destined for
communities served by water-or sometimes
by competing railways, one of which has a
much shorter haul-and where a railway cannot meet the water competition on a basis
of equality.
What is to be done? If the railway bas to
depend on competitive rates in competition

with water, and the water haulage is much
cheaper, the railway just goes out of existence.
A railway can be justified as regards construction and operation only on the basis of
rates which will enable it to operate at a profit.
That is basic. But a railroad may, as a
matter of what is called "velvet", offer
inducements to attract freight which it could
not possibly carry if it had to depend on
returns from that source alone to justify
its construction and operating costs. I am
reminded of the old story of the farmer
who raised a good deal of grain which he
shipped on a small railroad. He went to
the president and said "You ought to give
me a pass." the president <said "Look, Bill,
you have a fine team of horses. If I asked you
to drive me to town with these horses of
yours, would you do it for nothing?" The
farmer said "No, but if I was going to town
with the team anyway, and I passed you on
the road, you would think me pretty darn
mean if I didn't give you a lift." That, in
effect, is the principle of the competitive rate.
It assumes that the railroad is already constructed and operating, and that its freight
rates are such as to permit it to carry on.
Over and above that, the railway people say,
"Here is a rate which we could not possibly
offer under any other conditions than those
of cut-rate competition; but as our road is
operating, the overhead is provided for, and
all the facilities are here, we will carry this
freight for merely the expense of the extra
haulage; we will make a certain amount of
velvet." That is the principle of competitive
rates.
If that service is prohibited, what is the
result? The railroad is merely deprived of
the opportunity to carry those commodities,
and provinces with maritime advantages lose
the opportunity of getting the benefits of the
competitive rates to which, because of their
situation, they are entitled. That is all there
is to this matter of the competitive rate. My
honourable friend who was once a member of
the Board of Railway Commissioners has
made it very plain.
Then, what about intermediate points?
Take the case of Calgary, or Edmonton. These
cities have not the advantage of water transport; they are under the necessity of paying
rates which support the railroad. Let us
suppose that the Canadian Pacific Railway
stopped at Calgary. The rates for the Alberta
cities would not be any lower than they are

DECEMBER 13, 1951
now. However, the road goes on into Vancouver, and the question of competitive rates
is raised because of the water advantages
possessed by Vancouver. What has Calgary
contributed to that condition? On what
principle should Calgary urge that we at Vancouver should be deprived of a natural advantage? If this principle were carried to its
logical conclusion, the only result would be
to prohibit water competition.
I shall not use the precise figures quoted
by my honourable friend, because they are
rather too complicated for my method of
cafculation; but let us assume that a certain
commodity is shipped to Calgary on a rate
of $2, and that that is the rate which would
be fixed if the road had never gone further.
Then the road goes on to Vancouver; and the
rate there would be, let us say, two and a haif
dollars. But by marine transportation the
same commodity could be hauled to Vancouver for 60 cents. Under those conditions
no business could be done by the railroads
unless, to meet competition, their charge was
reduced. The rate need not be brought down
to 60 cents, because the time element would
take care of part of the difference, but probably it would not be competitive at more than
a dollar.
Hon. Mr. Haig: If I may interrupt the
honourable senator, the actual rate to Vancouver by water is one dollar, and by railroad, $1.33.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Yes, but for the benefit of
my simple brain I am taking even figures,
because the accuracy of the figures is not
essential so long as the accuracy of the illustration is established.
Let us face this situation. The Canadian
Pacific Railway, we will say, has set its rate
at $1 to get that extra business. Thereby it
can make a little profit and confer some benefit on Vancouver. What harm would that do
to Calgary? Wherein would the making of
that rate be unfair to Calgary? I say, honourable senators, that on that basis and principle Calgary is not entitled to take any action
which would raise the competitive rate into
Vancouver. I have no objection to Calgary
pressing all it can to get the lowest possible
rates, but not on a formula which is bound
to result in destroying the natural water
advantage that New Westminster, Vancouver,
Prince Rupert and other coast points enjoy.
94703-17J

I have the Turgeon Commission report
before me. I am sorry that rny honourable
friend from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) is
not here at the moment because I expected to
convert him before I got through. The Turgeon Commission considered this question
and said that it would fix the rate at one and
one-third. My honourable colleague fram
Waterloo asks on what basis was that done.
Well, I have not heard a single member of
this house ever state on what basis that was
done, except the honourable gentleman from
Waterloo when he said it was on an arbitrary basis. I was not a member of the
Senate committee dealing with this problei,
but I was allowed to ask questions in committee. I asked Mr. Knowles on what basis
this was done, and he said it was done on the
basis of compromise. That is the answer
he gave me.
Now let us see what the commission says
about it. I shall read from the report at
page 100:
The influence of any transcontinental rate from
the East to the British Columbia Coast should be
carried back in the rates to the intermediate provinces (including points in British Columbia east of
the coast) on a basis not more than one-third
greater than the transcontinental rate on the sea
coast.

Why should this be so? I have not the least
objection in the world to the board or to
parliament imposing rates on the C.P.R. in
favour of Calgary; but do you not see what
that means to Vancouver?
Then the report goes on:
This is a logical and simple solution to the matter,
one that is readily calculated and applied; it recognizes the influence on Alberta of Intercoastal competition, but at the same time does not lead to the
extreme conclusion that Alberta should have sea
coast rates.

That is the answer to the honourable gentleman who asked why they do not adopt the
American system.
Listen to this, honourable senators:
It should also have a restraining influence on the
railways in lowering rates to meet sea coast competition, because they will I:now that they can
only obtain rates at intermediate points not more
than one-third above the rate to the sea coast.

What does that mean? In the first place,
who ever heard of anything being needed
to restrain a railroad from making lower
rates? That is a new one, that a parliamentary provision is needed to restrain the
C.P.R. from making rates too low. What is
the alternative to that? The very principle

Hon. Mr. Euler: Suppose the House of

Hon. Mr. Farris: Perhaps it will not, but
we should not be deterred by that thought.
I have my own view as to the constitutional
limits of what the Senate should do to a
government bill. I think we should be very
careful before making a very material
amendment to a bill brought in by the government, not a decadent government, which
is supported by a large majority of the
elected house, and which had had the advantage of the opinion of a royal commission.
No matter what our personal views may be,
we should be very careful. Senator Meighen,
when he was here, would not materially
amend a government bill in those circumstances. He would thunder against it, and
leave the matter to the responsibility of the
House of Commons. But as to this small
amendment proposed here, I challenge anybody to say that it is in conflict with the
recommendation of the royal commission.
Mark you, honourable senators, this
amendment was never suggested in the
House of Commons, neither was it suggested
anywhere else until my honourable friend
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) proposed
it in the committee. So the only consideration it bas received at all is the consideration that bas been given to it in our committee and in this chamber.
That fact
imposes a great responsibility on honourable
senators.
I am sorry that my honourable friend the
leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson) is absent from
the chamber at the moment, for I was very
much interested in something that he did.
Yesterday he referred to the wonderful work
done by this committee. This little amendment is the whole crux of the committee's
work; my honourable friend knew that well;
yet he went out of his way yesterday to
express the highest commendation of the
careful study and thought that the committee
had given to this question.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: The committee were not
unanimous.

Hon. Mr. Farris: No, they were not unanimous. There were some honourable gentlemen
on the committee-including my honourable
friend who has just interrupted me-who I
am afraid did not get the full import of the
real effect of this. But it was not the minority
that the honourable leader was speaking
about; he was referring to the fruits of the
committee's work. "By their fruits ye shall
know them". And the fruits of that committee, after all their study, consisted of the
recommendation in favour of this amendment.
But today my honourable friend the leader
spoke again; and you, Mr. Chairman, if you
had listened to him yesterday and again
today, and had been so unfortunate as to be
blind would have said, "Oh, my, this is the
voice of Jacob, but it is the hand of Esau".
Then, Mr. Chairman, if you had felt a little
farther and got hold of that hairy, clammy
hand, you would have known that it was the
hand of cabinet unity. That was all that was
motivating my honourable friend this afternoon when be did not speak spontaneously
from his heart, as he did yesterday, but stood
up here and read this rigid thing that was
handed on to this honourable Senate.
I say, honourable senators, that there is no
reason in the world why we should be concerned with the question of government policy,
and above all with the recommendations of
the royal commission. Of course we are
accepting the royal commission, but does that
mean that we are tied hand and foot? Does
that mean the Senate should blindly follow
word for word the recommendations of the
If in our honest hearts we
commission?
believe that this amendment will improve
something that was not pointed out to the
royal commission, then it should be passed. If,
on the other hand, any honourable senators
are of the opinion that it is wrong to trust
the Board of Transport Commissioners, and
if they think rigidity is the only solution of
the question, then they must vote the amendment down. It seems to me that if we look
dispassionately at this simple and rational
escape clause, that may never be invoked
unless some dire necessity arises, the amendment and the committee that brought it
in should be supported.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I would formally move
mat the committee now rise, and report progress and ask leave to sit again.
The motion was agreed to.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
as it is now 6 o'clock I leave the chair until
8 o'clock this evening.

DECEMBER 13, 1951
At 8 o'clock the sitting was resumed.
The Senate again went into committee on
the amendments to Bill 12, an Act to amend
the Railway Act, Hon. Mr. Beaubien in the
Chair.
On Amendment 3 (Continued):
Hon. F. J. Kinley: Honourable senators, the
method of proceeding on this bill is somewhat
of an innovation. We are in Committee of
the Whole, and set speeches are not required,
but I have a few -comments to make on the
clause of the bill affected by this amendment,
which is in fact one of the significant
clauses of the bill.
Like the chairman of the committee (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) and the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), I had the privilege of
attending most of the meetings of the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications. It was a valuable experience. I think
all of us were impressed with the complexity
of the problem and the ingenuity which railway men must exercise in order to make rates
that can be regarded as reasonably consistent
and acceptable. It seems to me that, to be a
success in this line of work, a man must have
had a great deal of practical training, for
there are many details with which he can
only become familiar through experience in
the field. For that reason, I feel that, although
we learned a good deal during the committee
hearings, we are on a subject with which
none of us is too well informed; and, I suppose our opinions must be rated accordingly.
I was struck by one remark made by the
honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. Farris) this afternoon. He said, "Gentlemen, this legislation is untried. Why not
amend it?" That point was put to the
minister when he was before the committee.
He replied, "I will agree that the legislation
is new, but why not try it out, and if you
want to make amendments, make them in
the face of experience, and not now that the
bill is before parliament." I turn to the
stenographic record and quote the minister's
words. The report reads:
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Mr. Minister, you said If we
changed in any particular the language of this onethird we would destroy the intent of the section.
Well, now, that answer would appear to shut the
door on the possibility of there being future amendments, because the basis on which we are urging
this change at the present time so as to give some
discretion to the board would be the basis on which
any amendment in the future would be presented
to you.
Hon. Mr. Chevrier: No. I do not think it would
disturb that, for this reason, that if the fears such
as expressed by British Columbia and Manitoba
are in effect true, and they prove so after an equalization plan has been put in effect, and after this
statute becomes the law-and that will be a matter,
as has been explained by many of the witnesses, of
some years.-then surely during the time it will be
possible to make an amendment.

So it would seem to me that the argument
that the legislation is untried is a reason why
it should be put through without amendment,
and that amendments should wait upon the
period of trial and error and experience that
is to come. As a member of this committee,
I have only a general interest in this section,
and I do not think I would have said anything had it not been that our chairman was
pretty positive in his opinions; but having
served on the committee I thought that I
should explain in a simple manner why I support the bill as presented to us and as it
came from the other bouse.
In the first place, this bill is to implement
the report of the royal commission, which,
having studied this matter for many months,
presented its report to the government. To
that report the government, after consideration, decided it would give statutory effect.
One of the recommendations was the onethird rule, devised to relieve the situation of
certain of the interior provinces. The minister told us that before this legislation was
introduced il was under deliberation by an
inter-departmental committee which gave it a
great deal of consideration.
I will read further from the record:
The Chairman: Yes, they were; counsel for Manitoba and British Columbia strenuously objected to
certain provisions.
Hon. Mr. Chevrier: Then I must repeat what I
said in the other committee, namely that I would
have to object to the proposed change. I would
object to it for several reasons: first, an interdepartmental committee spent a great deal of time on
drafting this legislation, and considered very carefully the effect of the one and one-third rule. They
realized that there would be objections, but after
having given it careful consideration, they recommended as the bill is drafted.

So it is evident, as I said, that before the
bill was presented to parliament it was the
subject of discussion and consideration by a
committee of experts.
Another circumstance which made me feel
it was my duty to vote for the section was
that my experience on the committee impressed me with the complexity of the problem
Almost
and its numerous ramifications.
everything that was proposed was opposed by
somebody. It might be said that there were
no two minds in agreement from an administrative point of view as to the effect of the
bill, or what was the best course to be taken.
I reminded myself that this bill had had
special consideration in the Commons over
quite a period; and it seemed to me that
when a highly controversial matter of this
kind had been dealt with by representative
men from all over the country, who approved

its provisions; to have produced a bill which
has been agreed to by practically everybody
except the spokesmen for certain provinces

SENATE

who fear they may be injured by the application of this legislation, is an achievement
of which the government can well be proud.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I would like to ask the

honourable senator whether the point we
are now considering was ever brought up in
the other place?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Well, I was not in the
other house.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: But you have the report
of their proceedings.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I know, but the report
consists of many long documents. We have
the statement of the minister: "I say here,
as I said in the other committee, that I am
opposed to the change."
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I think my honourable
friend will agree with me that in fact the
amendment now before us was never suggested in the other place.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I agree that in its wording
the amendment is new, but I believe the idea
of leaving the decision to the board instead
of giving legislative effect to the one-andone-third rule was always at the back of the
minds of those who considered the bill.
Another reason why I approve of the section
as it stands is that in my judgment it is the
proper thing to do. I have listened attentively
to the speeches this afternoon. They were
informative. I was especially interested in
the speech of the honourable senator from
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. Farris), who in his
eloquent way forcibly advocated what he
believes to be the interests of British Columbia, and the thought occurred to me that over
the years British Columbia has been well
represented in the Parliament of Canada. In
our committee the representatives of British
Columbia impressed me as being alert, and
this fact impelled me to think that that
province has certainly been getting just about
as much as anybody out of the freight service
of railways. During his remarks today the
honourable senator from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris) asked, "What have you to
be afraid of?" Well, I would put the same
question to him. What has he to be afraid of?
Hon. Mr. Farris: I told you today.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I believe British Colum-

bians fear that the transcontinental rate
might be altered in such a way as to prove
detrimental to them. The continental rate
is made competitive because of waterborne
freight and because of competition from
American railroads running to the West Coast.
These two factors determine what the transcontinental rate will be, and if it cannot meet
competition it fails in its purpose. It seems

to me, therefore, that honourable senators can
be assured that the transcontinental rate will
not be interfered with to the detriment of
British Columbia. There is no doubt that
we all believe in the desirability of export
trade. An honourable senator from one of
the central provinces has said that he does
not see how the legislation will do much for
his area of the country. Well, the tremendous
amount of goods bought by the rest of Canada
from the central provinces puts enormous
sums of money into the exchequers of those
provinces, and so I really think we are all
vitally interested in the freight rate question.
Taking the transcontinental rate as the
yardstick upon which other western rates are
based, you start with the transcontinental rate
and add to it. In this case it was arbitrarily
decided to add one-third. If this goes through,
it will help Alberta and part of Saskatchewan.
Will this not be a good thing for those areas?
These two provinces have been arguing for
many years that they have been discriminated
against in the matter of freight rates, and
claiming that nothing has been done to relieve
their position. Now, to say that the transcontinental rate might be raised in the future
because these provinces are given some benefit now, is not a good enough argument to
keep this legislation from being enacted.
Let us turn to Winnipeg. The honourable
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) was
frank in his remarks this afternoon. He
looked at two of his colleagues and said he
supposed that because they were on the
borderline they would vote for the legislation
as it stands, while he would probably vote
against it.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Do not be too sure.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Well, the tyranny of our
friendships sometimes controls our actions. I
do not think any law can be made without
somebody being dissatisfied, but I wonder if
the industries of Winnipeg would really suffer
as a result of this legislation? They are in
a little better position than they were, because
of the link between Sudbury and Fort
William, which will cost the government $7
million annually.
One must remember that the West is growing. When western American centres began
to grow it meant that the prosperity of the
ports of New York, Boston and Baltimore
did not continue to advance as rapidly as
before, but at the same time they did not
suffer any great loss. They were merely
sharing prosperity with the rest of the
country. Today there are cities in the State
of New York which are opposed to the St.
Lawrence Seaway because they fear it will
benefit other centres and prove injurious to
themselves. Winnipeg may lose its present

DECEMBER 13. 1951
monopoly in the distribution trade of the
West, but it will have more business than
ever before because there will be more trade
for everybody. We must not forget that
Winnipeg is strategically situated as the
Gateway to the West, and there is no doubt
that it will maintain its importance in the
world of trade.
A great deal of evidence was presented
before our committee. Many opinions were
expressed, but the most persistent one was
that of the chief counsel of the C.P.R. In my
opinion the C.P.R. is a well-managed organization of which every Canadian can be
proud. When counsel for that company
appeared before the committee I suggest that
it was his duty to look after the interests of
his company, and I think he did that in a most
capable fashion. But the main opposition to
this legislation came from the C.P.R. counsel,
and I almost got the impression that the
C.P.R. would be quite satisfied if this bill
were emasculated to such an extent that its
effect would be completely nullified. I do
not say that the representations of the C.P.R.
appeared before us in a spirit of selfishness,
but I think we should evaluate their presentation as special pleading.
I think I have given all the reasons why I
have decided to vote for the legislation as it
now stands, but I should like at this time
to read from page 247 of the Turgeon Report:
For many years now it has been a recognized
factor of Canadian transportation policy that the
hardships arising from our necessarily long eastand-west railway haul have been tempered along
the way by four great measures of relief:
The Maritime Freight Rates Act in the Atlantic
Region, the toll-free canals in Central Canada, the
competitive transcontinental railway rates at the
Pacifie Coast, and the Crowsnest Pass rates in the
Prairies.

I think that another great factor in the
freight rates structure of this country will be
the link between Sudbury and Fort William.
Somebody said here that only 50 per cent of
the railways will be affected by this equalization. Well, equalization is none the less
another step forward. We have the Maritime
freight rates, Crowsnest Pass freight rates
and the transcontinental rates, all beneficial
factors in the freight rate structure of Canada, and equalization will be another beneficial factor in that structure.
The minister appeared before our committee and answared questions. He was flrmly
questioned by counsel and made it clear that
the government would like to see the bill put
through without serious amendment and
given a trial. For that reason, honourable
senators, I am supporting the measure as it
came to us.
94703-18

Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I ask my honourable
friend a question? After pointing out that
the one-and-one-third rate was recommended
in the Turgeon Commission's report, he went
on to argue that that was one reason why it
should be left in the bill.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: One of the reasons, yes.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I should like to ask him
if paragraph (f) of subsection (4) of section
332A was recommended by the Turgeon Commission. That is the paragraph which excepts
Maritime freight rates from any of this process of equalization.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I think you will find that
the Turgeon Commission recommended that
the Maritime freight rates should be considered, and that they should not be disturbed.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Will my honourable
friend point out where that recommendation
is made in the report?
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I am not prepared to do
so at the moment, but if my honourable
friend will wait until later in the evening
I shall show it to him.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: What my honourable
friend read a little earlier was from an
historical survey that is given in this report.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I do not want to delay the
Senate now, so I shall try to find that for my
honourable friend later.
Hon. A. W. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
when I was asked prior to the adjournment
whether I intended to speak on this amendment, I said I did not. My reasons were that
I am not a member of the committee, I did
not attend its sittings, no one by the widest
stretch of the imagination could ever term
me an expert on freight rates, and I am not
specially informed on this subject. I would
have no desire at all to influence any person
else in this matter, and I certainly do not
appear tonight as a teacher. But it is very
seldom that I cast a silent vote in matters
as controversial as this, so just for my own
satisfaction, and not with a view to influencing anyone else, I should like to state for
the record why I am going to take the action
that I intend to take.
I am going to follow the same course that
the senator from Queen's-Lunenburg (Hon.
Mr. Kinley) said he would follow. But first
may I congratulate the senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris), upon te
excellent and exceedingly forcible address
that he made this afternoon. He apparently
swept almost everything away in front of
him, but when I met hirn during the recess

SENATE
I said I was not going to do as he would
like me to do. He asked "Well, why not?"
Here are my reasons.
In the first place, I think the senators from
Manitoba and British Columbia are unduly
nervous about this legislation, and that it
will not result in a lowering of or interference
with the transcontinental competitive rate.
My thought in that regard is this. That rate is
set now because the railways are compelled
by water-borne and other competition to set
it. They ýcannot make the rate
higher
without losing business, and they are not
going to do that, as has been proved by their
previous action. So if this measure has any
effect, it will result in a decrease in freight
rates to intermediate points rather than an
increase in the transcontinental competitive
rates to British Columbia.
My second reason is that I think that the
advance of one-third over the rate charged
to one of the end stations is a sufficient extra
charge to an intermediate station, and I see
no reason why we should allow the railroads
by any means-either by an appeal to the
Board of Railroad Commissioners or any other
way-to make a charge for a shorter haul
which would exceed by more than one-third
the rate for the longer haul.
I am not much of a person to follow
authority. As a rule I stand on my own
feet and am not much influenced by what
others in authority say. Yet, in support of
the bill we have a report of a royal commission, and we have the judgment of the
government and of the Department of Transport and its experts. Even the committee
i-tself was divided, seven to four, so there is
not much opposition to the original section
from that source. The Commons passed
the bill without having received even a
proposal for this amendment. Therefore, the
backlog behind the measure is substantial,
and those who propose an amendment have
the burden of establishing i'ts soundness. I
feel that they have not done so, and in consequence I intend to vote in favour of the
bill and against the amendment at this time.
Hon. Mr. G. P. Burchill: Honourable senators, I do not intend to say very much, but
I do wish to make a few remarks before the
vote is taken.
I listened with a great deal of pleasure and
interest this afternoon to the many able
speeches on this bill and I gained a lot of
information. I especially desire to congratulate the senator from Vancouver South (Hon.
Mr. Farris) upon his address, and to tell him,
a former New Brunswicker, that I am proud
of him. I always was proud of him, but
I was prouder of him tonight than ever
before. My friend can talk as much as he
rany

likes about the qualities of British Columbia,
its maritime features and its great natural
resources, but I say the greatest asset of
that province is the sons and the daughters
of the Maritime Provinces who have done
so much to develop the resources of British
Columbia.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Although my friend
from British Columba made a very able
speech, as the senator from Toronto-Trinity
has just said, he convinced me that I should
vote against the amendment, and I will tell
him why.
The Maritime Freight Rates Act and the
Crowsnest Pass agreement are matters of
statute, placed above and beyond legal interpretation by brilliant minds such as that of
the senator who spoke this afternoon. It
seems to me that if the Transport Board, of
which he spoke so highly, were confronted
by persuasive legal talent such as his in support of the argument on behalf of British Columbia, there might be good reason to fear
what would happen to the Prairie Provinces.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Thanks for the bouquet,
without the vote!
Amendment 3 was negatived on the following division:-Contents, 15; Non-Contents,
26.
On Amendment 4:
4. Page 7, Une 49: after "territory" insert
unless the board for good cause otherwise orders;".
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,

this amendment is similar to the one which
has just been voted upon; it would insert at
line 49 on page 7 the words that amendment 3
would insert at line 35.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is the same question.
Negatived on the same vote!
The amendment was negatived.
On Amendment 5:
5. Page 8, Une 36: after "Act" insert "except section three hundred and thirty-two A,".
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
this amendment, which is of some importance

to the telegraph and telephone companies,
received the unanimous approval of the
committee.

Hon. Mr. Haig: And also the approval of
the solicitors for the department and for the
telephone companies.

Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes. Honourable senators will observe that the subsection 4 of
section 12 provides that the board shall have
power over telegraph and telephone tolls in

DECEMBER 13, 1951
the same manner as it bas power over freight
tariffs. The amendment, which would insert
the words "except section three hundred and
thirty-two A", is designed to take these tolls
out of the provisions which relate only to
freight tariffs, which are expressed in blocks
or groups. This is not the basis upon which
telephone and telegraph rates are made. It
is therefore necessary to make clear that
section 332A does not apply to subsection 4 of
section 12.
The amendment was concurred in.
The bill was reported, as amended.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall the bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: With leave of the
Senate, now.
Hon. G. P. Campbell: Honourable senators,
I move, seconded by the senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert), the following amendment:
Page 6, lines 46 to 48 and page 7 lines 1 and 2:
Delete paragraph (f) and substitute the following:
"(f) arbitraries and rate groupings applicable to
movements of freight traffic so far as such movement takes place upon or over all or any of the
lines of railway collectively designated as the
"Eastern lines" in the Maritime Freight Rates Act
as amended by The Statute Law Amendment (Newfoundland) Act, or"

If you refer to the appropriate section of the
bill before you, you will see that the only
change in language made by this amendment
is, first, to strike out "rates" and substitute
therefor "arbitraries and rate groupings", and
then add the words, "so far as such movement
takes place upon or over" the Eastern lnes.
For the benefit of honourable senators who
were not at the committee meetings, I think
I should briefly refer to the history of this
section and the discussions which took place
upon it. From my observation of the debate
this evening, I assume that all honourable
senators are anxious to see the legislation
spelled out in particular and exact form, and
many honourable senators seem to feel that
we should not leave too much to the Board
of Transport Commissioners. For that reason
I think they will be particularly interested
to hear what I have to say about this section.
When the bill was drafted and presented
to the other place, this paragraph (f) in subsection (4) was not in it. Apparently it was
the understanding of the drafters that the
rights of the Maritimes under the Maritime
Freight Rates Act were fully protected without having in the Act any such provision as is
94703-18

contained in this paragraph. However, it
transpired during the hearings before the
committee of the other bouse that the
Maritimes were somewhat concerned as to
whether the rights they enjoyed under the
Maritime Freight Rates Act were fully protected; and I may add that I think everyone agrees that if any doubt exists there
should be legislation to protect the rights
they enjoy under that Act. As a result, the
amendment which is contained in paragraph
(f) was inserted, and when the bill came to
us it contained this paragraph. During the
second reading I drew the attention of the
house to this particular clause, and I pointed
out the possibility that it could be construed
in a much wider sense than was intended:
in other words, rather than simply reserving
to the maritimes the rights which they enjoyed
under the Maritimes Freight Rates Act; it
took them completely out of the provisions
of equalization as contained in the bill and
enabled them to claim the right to a freight
rate on exactly the same basis as they have
at the present time. I said I felt that the
statute was capable of that interpretation,
and that it might be argued that it was the
proper interpretation to put upon this legislation. I further expressed the view that, if
that were so, some consideration should be
given in committee to this section, because I
was certain that it was never the intention
of the government or the drafters of this bill
to extend the rights of the Maritimes beyond
what they enjoy under the Maritime Freight
Rates Act.
When the matter was being discussed before
a committee of this honourable house, questions were directed to witnesses as to the real
Mr.
meaning of this particular section.
Knowles gave evidence bef ore the committee,
and I asked him a question or two which, with
the leave of the Senate, I will read from the
record, page 164:
Hon. Mr. Campbell: You say the intention of this
legislation is to have a separate rate across Canada
on freight originating within the Maritimes?
Yes, to leave the present rates
Mr. Knowles:
alone.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: Would that not completely
destroy the policy of equalization as enunciated in
the bill?
Mr. Knowles: It would, as far as the Maritimes
are concerned.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: And it might have a very
serious effect upon certain shippers in the central
provinces, particularly those from Quebec and
Montreal?
Mr. Knowles: If you are talking of rates between
the East and the West, no, sir, because the rates
between the East and the West are already on a
higher basis than the rates anywhere else in
Canada.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: But they would not be, after
the rates were increased in the central provinces, as
they surely would be under this legislation?
Mr. Knowles: Well, I do not know as to that.

SENATE
Then again at page 165:
Hon. Mr. Hawkins: I am afraid that a misunderstanding is being created here. This bill does not
set rates, it is only an authority for equalizing
them.
Mr. Knowles: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Hawkins: There is nothing in this that
would save us from having to pay a higher rate on
shipments from Halifax to Regina if the rate was
made higher by the board.
Mr. Knowles: I think you are wrong on that, sir.
The way it has been explained to me by the legal
gentleman is that this leaves you exactly where
you are today.

Then Mr. Matthews, the counsel, w.as asked:
The Chairman:
Perhaps we could get Mr.
Matthews' view on that.
Mr. Matthews: Mr. Chairman, there seems to be
a little difference of opinion about this among
lawyers.

He was speaking of the difference of opinion
as to the interpretation of the section.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Will you just read the section
that you are referring to?
The Chairman: It is paragraph (f) of subsection
(4) of section 332A on page 6 of the bill.

Mr. Matthews then read the section, and
followed up with the statement:
The original bill was drafted without that paragraph, and the equalization section was made subject to the Maritime Freight Rates Act. My interpretation of the Maritime Freight Rates Act was
that the rates were frozen on July 1, 1927, and could
only be increased or decreased as the cost of operations increased or decreased, and we thought that
if the bill was made subject to the Maritime Freight
Rates Act the position of the Maritimes would be
protected. Now, under the Maritime Freight Rates
Act the rate is fixed only on the Eastern lines, that
is east of Levis. But the representatives of the
Maritimes thought they did not have sufficient protection, and that their traffic should be excluded
from the equalization sections of the bill. The point
may have to be settled in the courts some time.
My interpretation would be that on movements
from Halifax to Regina the rate to Levis is settled
and would not be touched, but that beyond that the
regular rate would apply.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: If you changed the language
to read "within the Maritimes"Mr. Matthews: That then would apply only to
local traffic within the Maritimes.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: But it could be spelled out
to cover traffic moving west, outside of the Maritimes. Surely we can draft legislation that will
express what we have in mind.
Mr. Matthews: Well, that is my interpretation.
The point is not clear.

The result of the evidence and the opinion of
counsel, including our own Parliamentary
Counsel, clearly indicates that the interpretation of paragraph (f) is not at all clear, and
that it is likely to be construed in the broad
sense which in the opinion of Mr. Knowles
was the meaning of the legislation.
In order to clear the point, certain questions
were asked of the minister when he appeared
before the committee yesterday morning.
Although that evidence has not yet been
printed, I have a few extracts from it which
I think will clearly show the government's
intention and the policy which this legislation

was intended to express. In speaking about
paragraph (f), the following question was
asked:
Hon. Mr. Hayden: . . . One meaning it appears to
bear in their minds is that it does and could be
said to operate beyond or west of Montreal. Now,
that was not the intention of the government,
was it?
Hon. Mr. Chevrier: No, that was not the government's intention.

This clearly shows that Mr. Knowles'
interpretation of the legislation is not
the intention of the government, as was definitely and clearly stated by the minister.
And further on:
Hon. Mr. Hayden: . . . I say the suggested interpretation that we have had presented here by
various witnesses would give a broader interpretation to the section than the interpretation that you
put on it. You have interpreted it as intended
to preserve rate groupings and arbitraries and
carry as far west as Montreal.
Hon. Mr. Chevrier: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The interpretation given here
by a number of lawyers who are skilled in this kind
of work, and one of the views expressed by our own
Law Clerk, is that it is capable of the broader
interpretation that the movement of goods out of
the Maritimes might carry all the benefits that
exist to any point in Western Canada. Now, that
was not intended?
Hon. Mr. Chevrier: That is right. I do not think
that I should get into a discussion of what it
means, other than to say what it was intended to
mean.

Honourable senators, it seems to me that

if there is one duty cast upon this honourable
body it is to see that legislation, before it
passes parliament, is clear in its terms and
expresses the intention of parliament. We
should not pass legislation which is capable
of two or three different meanings, and which
the solicitor for the department-the one
responsible for the drafting of such legislation-says will probably have to be settled in
the courts. I think the amendment which I
have proposed protects all the rights of the
Maritimes under the Maritime Freight Rates
Act. It puts them in a position where they
can use the arbitraries and the groupings
which have heretofor existed within the Maritime Freight Rates Act. It puts them in a
position where they can use the arbitraries
and the groupings which have heretofor
existed within the Maritimes and to all points,
from Montreal or Levis, or wherever the new
rates start and then they will be on the same
basis as Ontario, Quebec and the -other provinces across Canada. The minister has clearly
stated that it is the intention that the rights
of the Maritimes under the Maritime Freight
Rates Act shall be reserved, and that they
shall not be excluded from the general rate
structures which are to be established under
the new equalization policy which is laid
down under the statute.

DECEMBER 13, 1951
Hon. Mr. Farris: Has Mr. MacNeill passed
on your draft amendment?
Hon. Mr. Campbell: I thank the honourable senator from Vancouver South for bringThe
ing that question to my attention.
members of this house will probably wonder
why the committee did flot produce an
amendment which had been submitted to our
Parliamentary Counsel, and which in his
opinion, in our opinion and in the opinion of
ail legal experts, is the intention of the government. The reason that such an amendment is not before the house is that in coinmittee the honourable senator from. Toronto
E(Hon. Mr. Hayden) moved that this section
be referred to our Parllamentary Counsel
with instructions to draft a clause which
would clearly express the intention of the
governiment. I was very much surprised to
find that anyone would vote against a motion
of that kind, but the motion was lost on
division. The result was that the only way
in which. this matter couid be brought before
this honourable body was by the introduction
of an amendment such as the one I have
carefully considered. I do not hold myself
forward as an expert draftsman in matters
of this kind, and I should not like to assure
this honourable house that this amendment
adequateiy covers the situation. I feel, however, that it does cover the situation much
better than does the present statute. I should
not like to, say whether or not we should
deai with the matter at this time, but I do
urge this house to seriously consider an
amendment to this particular section which,
wil express the intention of the governmnent
in precise language.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I do flot think you
answered the question of the honeurable
senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris). 1 believe he asked whether our
Pariiamentary Counsel had agreed with the
amendmnent whlch. you suggest makes the
situation perfectly clear.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: 1 said that there was
an attempt to have this section referred to
our Parllamentary Counsel for the purpose
of draftlng an arnendment.
Hon. Mr. Euler: But he has neyer passed
on it?
Mon. Mr. Campbell: That motion was
defeated, and he has not passed upon my
amendment. He has not seen it. Honourable senators, I strongly f eel that the Parliamentary Counsel should review this draft
amendment, but I arn not urging the house
to adopt this particular draft amendment. I
have made it clear, I think, that the reason
I have introduced this amendment is to get
the legislation into language which will

as
express the government's intention
expressed by the minister. I arn suie hionourable senators wiil agree with me that we
should not pass legislation in its present formi
when there has been so much dispute as to
its interpretation.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I ask the honourable senator a question with regard to his
reference to evidence submitted by Mr.
Knowles. I understand him to say that Mr.
Knowles agreed that the interpretation of
the section under question was that it
extended the privileges of the old rates both
westbound and eastbound over any line in
Canada. I think he also sald that that is
what was intended.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: You are quite correct.
There is a direct conffict between the testimony of Mr. Knowles and that of the
minister.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
this is a very compli.cated question, and
though I doubt my ability to expiain it in
such a way as to make it clear either to
myseif or to the house, in the course of a
f ew minutes I shall try to do so.
The whole question arises out of what happened in the Commons committee when it
was considering the question. The bill as
originaihy introduced and as considered by
that committee contained no such provision
as is found now in paragraph (f) of subsection (4) of section 332A. The Maritime provinces were interested in preserving two things
in their freight rate structure.
The first
was the special privileges which they obtained,
under the Maritime Freight Rates Act, which
in effect gives a subsidy of 20 per cent on
shipments of freight out of the Maritime
provinces into Central and Western Canada.
It was quite clear fromn the bill as originahhy
inrtroduced that the Maritime Freight Rates
Act provisions were expected from it.
But the second thing which the Maritimes
wished to preserve was not covered. by the
Maritime Freight Rates Act. Apparently over
the years there has grown up in the Maritimes a special system of groupings of
freight rates and of arbitraries over Montreai,
as I think they are called, which in effect
has given the Maritimes hower rates, on
goods flowing both eastward and westward,
than they wouhd be strictly entitied to if
the rates were calculated sohely on a miheage
basis. So the point was this. Here was
this new bull which proposed. to introduce
into our rate-making iaw, by which the Board
of Transport Commissioners wouhd be bound,
a generai principle of equahization of rates
based upon distance; and there ahready existed the system, that had been buiit over

SENATE
the years and under which the Maritimes
benefited, which system would have had to
be thrown overboard if this section providing for equalization had remained in the bill
without some provision for preserving the
position of the Maritimes.
In the committee of the other house there
were some very extensive discussions, and
it was ultimately agreed that that position
of the Maritimes should be preserved.
Counsel for the Maritimes, after consultation
with the counsel for Department uf Transport and with counsel for the other provinces, suggested this amendment which
appeared as paragraph (f) of subsection (4)
of section 332A of the bill as it came to us.
Now, it is true that, as stated by the senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell), when
our committee was considering paragraph
(f) we got different views as to what the
paragraph meant, and it is indeed possible
that the amendment which he suggests does
approach a little closer to what the Maritime provinces really want than does the
very general language of paragraph (f) as it
now stands. But I want to point out to the
Senate that this paragraph has been agreed
to after a great deal of consultation, and the
interpretation placed upon it by the government was clearly expressed to our committee a day or so ago by the Minister. It
may be that the paragraph is capable of a
number of interpretations. I myself do not
think so. It seems to me that what it does
is perfectly clear, but I think it is fair to
say that if there is doubt as to what the
paragraph means the Board of Transport
Commissioners will of course take into consideration the expressed intention of parliament in enacting the paragraph and will
govern itself accordingly. It may be that
the paragraph could have been better
expressed. I do not propose to make any
comparison between the paragraph as it now
stands in the bill and the paragraph as proposed by my honourable friend, but from
a practical point of view it seems to me that
if his amendment carries it -will throw the
whole question back into the maelstrom of
discussion, which in the other house has
been completed, and which may keep us
here, so far as I know, until after Christmas.
May I now give my own opinion as to
just what paragraph (f) means as it stands
in the bill? It is an opinion which I think
I may fairly say was agreed to by a majority
of the counsel who appeared before our
committee. In the first place, section 332A
(1) sets out the general policy of equalization of freight rates. Then subsection (4)
provides some exceptions to that; and one
of the exceptions, the one which we are

now discussing, is that the equalization provisions shall not apply to rates applicable
to movements of freight traffic upon any of
the lines of railway designated as the "Eastern lines" in the Maritimes Freight Rates
Act. Well, if the equalization section of the
bill does not apply to the eastern territory,
then all that happens is that the Maritime
provinces are thrown right back upon the
discretion of the Board of Transport Commissioners. There is no statutory right given
to them to have their Maritime groupings
or arbitraries preserved, but under the section as it now stands the Board of Transport
Commissioners has the power to preserve
those. And, with all deference, I submit
that even though the matter may not be
expressed in this measure quite as clearly
as it should be, we have to leave a great
deal to the discretion and the competence of
the Board of Transport Commissioners; and
I for one do not fear, what my honourable
friend from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell)
fears, that the Board will iso conduct its
affairs as to produce a great inequality of
rates between the Maritimes and the rest
of the country. For myself, I am satisfied to
accept the subsection as it now stands.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable
senators, with reference to the suggestion of
an amendment to paragraph (f) of 332A (4),
I think the crux is whether or not the Maritime Freight Rates Act as we have known it
in the past, with its provision for a reduction
of 20 per cent on the ordinary rate, is now
being extended. In other words, the Act,
as I understand it, provides that goods may
be shipped from the Maritimes westward
to Levis, and in some cases farther west, at
a reduced rate.
There was a difference of opinion between
Mr. Knowles and the learned counsel who
appeared before the committee as to the
effect of paragraph (f) on Ontario. I make no
apology for referring to the Province of
Ontario, for under this euphonious title of
equalization everyone seems to be talking
from the viewpoint of his own bailiwick, so
to speak. If we are going to have equalization, let us have it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: If the passage of this
measure means giving Maritime goods a
special rate both east and west, beyond the
limits provided by the Maritime Freight
Rates Act, then I think we had better look
at it more closely.
In the light of statements made by my
colleague from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell),
if I am in order I should like to suggest the
adjournment of the debate to permit the

DECEMBER 13, 1961

matter to be referred to our Parliamentary
Counsel and whomever he wishes to consult
in the matter.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I feel that I should say a word about the
amendment now before the house.
Unlike the amendments dealt with by the
Committee of the Whole, on which I had the
opportunity of consulting the government
beforehand, it was intimated to me only yesterday that there probably would be an
amendment of the character of the one now
before us. I have not had the opportunity of
seeing the amendment moved by the senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell). I do not
wish to be discourteous to my friend, only
two courses of action are open to me. I
could adjourn the debate in order to give the
house the benefit of specific instructions
received by me from the government, or I
could suggest that the matter be dealt with
now. I take the responsibility of saying that
the government feels that amendments to
this measure at this stage would not materially help the situation.
I have heard suggestions from the Maritimes that the bill should be amended because,
if carried in its present form, the Maritimes
might lose something by it. On the other
hand, it has been said that the bill should
be amended in such a way that a possible
interpretation might give that area of Canada
more benefits than the Minister intended it
should have. Those are the two extreme
views. I would point out to the house that
there is a wide divergence of opinion as to how
this section should be amended. I am advised
that the lawyers worked on it during the
week-end with a view to devising an amendment which would be acceptable to everyone,
and that they ended up about where they
started.
In view of the late stage of the session,
and the fact that the Transport Committee
considered this bill over a period of fifteen
days, I would suggest that the amendment
be voted on now and disposed of one way or
another.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: If the house sees fit
to adopt the amendrnent, it will go to the
other place, where all its ramifications can be
considered; if on the other hand, it is rejected,
the matter will be at an end.
I do not think that the Senate can, in fairness, be accused of acting hastily in its consideration of this legislation. Without wishing to be disrespectful to my friend from
Toronto, I think the amendment should be
disposed of now, one way or another.

Hon. Mr. Campbell: May I ask the honourable leader if he would object to having this
matter referred to the Parliamentary Counsel
to ascertain if it is possible to draft a section
which would clearly express the intention of
the government as explained by the honourable minister when he was before the
committee?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I do not know that I
have any particular objection to the suggestion, but I would point out that I have consulted the Law Clerk two or three times
about this measure, and my information is
that it is most difficult to reach agreement
between the conflicting interests. Had my
friend's amendment been offered a few days
ago there would have been time to have got
the opinion of the rest of the lawyers, as
well as the able judgment of the two honourable senators from Toronto.
I do not think I have ever been guilty of
pressing legislation through, but it seems to
me that the time has come when honourable
senators know enough about this legislation
to make up their minds one way or the
other. Personally, I think the legislation
should pass as it now stands, but I am content to abide by the decision of the house. I
do not think anything will be gained by delaying further.
Hon. Mr. Euler: There is an old saying,
"Fools rush in where angels fear to tread."
We have had some eloquent speeches by
lawyers; but what I have heard from the
honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Campbell) does not convey any great compliment to the lawyers, whether in this house
or elsewhere, who are responsible for this
bill, for it appears that they have been unable
either to draft a satisfactory clause or to agree
on the meaning of what they have drafted.
That, it seems to me, is a reflection upon
the legal profession.
Mr. Knowles, whom I do not know, says
this this section may mean something which
the minister himself says he does not intend
it to mean. Perhaps my honourable friend
is blameworthy for having introduced this
amendment at so late a date, for' apparently
it -can be interpreted as likely to work to
the distinct disadvantage of the province from
which we both come. Surely, if there are
these differences of opinion, it should be possible for members of the learned profession
of the law to draft the section in language
which will make its meaning unmistakable.
As matters are, there is a difference of opinion. Why leave it at that? I do not want
to differ from the leader of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson), but I cannot see
why we should not make use of the man
whom we pay to give us opinions on the

SENATE
legislation which comes before this body.
No harm could be done by delaying the
matter at least until we get the opinion of
Senate Counsel.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Will the honourable
senator tell us what he fears in some interpretation of this clause?
Hon. Mr. Euler: That the rates will be
extended to the west. It is not the intention that the Maritime rates shall be extended
all the way through Ontario, to the disadvantage of Ontario shippers. I take it that
that never was the intention.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Living, as I do, in Manitoba,
I am not specially interested in this debate.
The question now under discussion occupied
a good deal of the attention of the committee.
It may be simply stated in this way. The
minister said that what he wanted to do was
to preserve all the rights which under the
present law the Maritimes hold as far as
Montreal. The question was put to him by
myself and some others. It was also asked
of lawyers appearing for various interests.
Counsel for the Senate said it was capable
of the interpretation which I said could be
put upon it, namely that manufactured goods
could be shipped, say, from Truro to Montreal
as at present, and also that under this legislation the rate now in effect from Montreal
to Regina would stand, and could not be
changed. Of the other counsel, some were
of this opinion; and some thought the section was capable of another interpretation.
I then asked 'the minister, "What do you
intend by this section?" He said, "We intend
to give the Maritimes 'all the rights, arbitraries and so on that are now in effect to
Montreal, but not west of Montreal.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: What is the effect of
the Maritime Freight Rates Act?
Hon. Mr. Haig: My honourable friend from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) said, and I
agree with him, that certain rights had grown
up through judgments and otherwise in
favour of the Maritimes, and learned counsel
for the Maritime Provinces told us that he
was trying to maintain these conditions.
According to my recollection, what the
honourable member from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Campbell) bas said is correct. I would suggest to him, however, with just a trace of
bitterness, that for the past six or seven years
the provinces of Quebec and Ontario have not
taken sufficient interest in this freight rates
question. In fact, they have absolutely
ignored it, and while we in the West and the
Maritime representatives in the East have
been fighting the battle, the central provinces
have left us entirely alone to carry it on. I
am therefore net altogether sorry to see

Ontario and Quebec being "put up against
the gun" because it means that they will
have to take more interest in rate problems
than they have done hitherto. To my mind
the clause as it stands gives to merchants in
the Maritime Provinces the right te ship
goods te any place in Canada on the same
basis as they have shipped heretofore. I also
believe, as do the majority of counsel engaged
in this matter, that that right will not be
interfered with by the present legislation.
I asked counsel for the Maritime Provinces,
"Why will you net consent to an attempt to
draw a bill which will give the shipping
rights to Montreal, and no more?" He said
"I am satisfied with the present legislation".
Had I been a judge, that answer would have
been proof positive to me that he thought
the bill could be interpreted as covering
shipments from Montreal west.
I suggest to the honourable senator that
he should net press his amendment. I think
that is the view of other honourable senators, although in committee only one member,
namely the honourable senator from Halifax
(Hon. Mr. Hawkins) who represents a port
city that will be affected by the one-and-onethird provision, supported my stand. I
recognize that the Maritime Provinces are in
a difficult position in regard to freight rates,
and if the benefit of the doubt is to be given
te anybody I would give it to them. In my
opinion it would be as well to delay this matter until tomorrow. I think the honourable
senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell)
should have moved to refer the questions
back to committee with instructions to consider the amendment. The committee will
sit tornorrow morning in any event. I do net
want to be misunderstood. I believe the
honourable member has made a case. The
leader of the government wants to bring the
matter te a vote tonight, and to that I shall
not object; but I do not approve of passing
legislation as te the meaning of which there
is a violent difference of opinion and that,
in fact, is what we are asked to do. The issue
in committee was decided against us by the
casting vote of the chairman. I remember
this because I was sitting there, watching
the proceedings. He is a very fair-minded
chairman, and he was much disturbed about
the matter. Finally he announced that he
would vote against the amendment. Candidly
speaking, I think he was wrong, but that was
bis judgment.
Hon. Mr. Campbell: May I correct the bonourable senator? The vote was against the
motion to have the matter considered by the
Parliamentary Counsel.

DECEMEER 13, 1951
Han. Mr. Haig: I know, but the point was
clear. I know what I was votîng for. I was
votîng ta refer this bill ta our own lawyer ta
draft a measure which wouid carry out the
wili af the minister as he expressed it. The
honourable member from Toronta made much
the same speech as he did here, except that
it was a littie shorter. He said in effect that,
taking it ail in ail, he thought it was better
ta pass the legisiatian as it was than ta disturb the situation.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Even if it is obscure.
Han. Mr. Haig: To me it is not at al
obscure, J think it gives the Maritime shippers
the right ta ship ail over the country.
Hon. Mr. Euler: But ail the lawyers do not
think as you da.
Han. Mr. Haig: That is the opinion of al
the lawyers excepting the representative of
the Maritimes.
Hon. Mr. Euler: It is not the opinion of the
minister himself.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, the minister did not
say that. What the minister said was, 'II
will express no opinion on the legisiation."
Hon. Mr. Euler: He said it might have ta go
to the courts.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That shows uncertainty.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No; he said he wiouid rely
on the lawyers of the department, and he
recommended that the bill be passed as it
was. The mînister was fair. I asked him,
"What do yau want ta give the Maritime
Provinces?" and he replied, III want ta give
them ail the rights up ta Montreai." Then it
was suggested that this section gaes beyond
that. He said that it was up ta the iawyers
ta decide this, but that he thought it aught
ta be passed the way it is.
Somne Han. Senalors: Question!
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Campbell was
negatived.

ST. LAWRENCE SEAWAY AUTHORITY
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill 33, an Act to establish
the St. Lawrence Seaway Authority.

He said: Honourabie senators, the abject
of this bil is to estabiish an Authority for
the purpose of constructing a deep waterway
between the port of Montreal and lake Erie.
The works necessary for the waterway xnay

States side of the border, or may provide a

intended further that the Authority should
maintain and operate the compieted Canadian works of this waterway.
The Authority to be set up under the bil
is to consist of a president and two other
members, to be appointed by the Governor
inCouncil. They will hold office for a term
not exceeding ten years, and will be paid
salaries ta be fixed by the Governor in
Council.
The Authority will be an agent of His
Mai esty, an'd will have power ta enter into
contracts either in its own name or i the
name of His Mai esty. It wili also be enabled
ta hold property ini its own name, and ta
bring or defend legal actions.
The president wfll be the chief executive
officer, and he wil be charged with the direction and contrai of the business of the
Authority. The president may, subject ta
the provisions of any byiaw, delegate any of
his powers to the other two members. The
Authority will be authorîzed ta employ such
officers and empioyees as it may determine,
and these officers and emplayees will not be
officers or employees of His Mai esty. There
is provision for a pension fund for the
members, officers and empioyees of the
Authority.
The purposes for which the Authority is
established are found in section 10 of the
bill. This section provides that the Authority
is incorporated for the purposes of:
(a) acquiring lands for and constructing, maintaining and operating ail such works as mnay be
necessary ta provide and maintain, either wholly in
Canada or in conjunctian with works undertaken by
an appropriate Authority In the United States, a
deep waterway between the port of Montreal and
Lake Erie;
(b) constructing, maintaining and operating all
such works in connection with such a deep waterway as the Gavernar in Council may deem necessary ta fulfil any obligation undertaken or ta be
undertaken by Canada pursuant ta any present or
future agreement.

Section il of the bill provides that the
Autharity shail, for the aforesaid purposes,
have the capacities and powers of a natural
persan as if it were a corporation incarporated by Letters Patent under the Great Seai.
The Authority is given power ta lease
lands, property and water power, ta borrow
money up ta a maximum Jimit of $300 million, and ta manage and operate any canais
or works similar or related ta the works

covered by the Act that may be entrusted
to the Authority by the Governor in Council.
The Authority is also given power to expropriate land, and the provisions of the Expropriation Act are made applicable to the
exercise of this power by the Authority.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Do I understand the
honourable senator to say that the Authority
can borrow $300 million without specific
instructions from or supervision by the executive? Is an order in council required?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The notes compiled
for me are a condensation of a lengthy report
prepared by the minister. I would refer
the honourable senator to section 13 of the
bill, which reads:
The Authority, with the approval of the Governor
in Council, may, from time to time, borrow money
from His Majesty or otherwise for the purposes for
which it is incorporated, but the aggregate of the
amounts borrowed under this Act and outstanding
shall not at any time exceed three hundred million
dollars.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is fine.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Perhaps my notes have
been unduly condensed, but that was done

to save time. My honourable friend from
Toronto-Trinity has asked a pertinent question, and I thank him for raising it.
Section 15 gives the Authority power to
charge tolls on vessels navigating the canals,
and on their cargoes. In the first instance,
the Authority establishes the tolls to be
charged. The tariffs are filed with the Board
of Transport Commissioners, and any interested person may file a complaint with the
Board as to unjust discrimination.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I interrupt the
honourable leader? I do not want to embar-

cost shall include: (a) payments in respect

of the interest on amounts borrowed by the
Authority; (b) amounts sufficient to amortize
the principal of the amounts borrowed over
a period not exceeding fifty years, and (c)
the cost of operating and maintaining the
canals and works under the administration

of the Authority, including all operating
costs of the Authority and such reserves as
may be approved by the minister.
Provision is made in clause 17 to cover
the establishment of tolls in case of works
constructed by the Authority in conjunction with works undertaken by an appro-

priate Authority of the United States.
The bill makes provision for financing the
costs 'of the Authority by loans and guarantees.
The Minister of Finance, with the
approval of the Governor in Council, is

empowered to make loans to the Authority
out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund or
guarantee payment of principal and interest

on money borrowed by the Authority. It
should be noted ýthat no such loans and
guarantees shall be made or given in any
fiscal year except to the extent that parliament authorized such loans and guarantees
in that year. Parliamentary control over the
financing of the Authority is thus ensured.

There is also provision for temporary loans
to be made by the Minister of Finance to the
Authority, not exceeding an aggregate
amount of $10 million. The power given to
the Authority to borrow is limited to an
aggregate of $300 million, so the amount of
the loans or indebtedness shall not at any
time exceed this maximum. The accounts
and financial transactions of the Authority
are to be audited by the Auditor General.

Hon. Mr. McLean: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: What is good for us in the
national sense will be gaod for the outlying
parts of the country. I believe this projeet
is a great step forward. The Prime Minister
of Canada and the Premier of Ontario are ta
be congratulated on the harmoniaus manner
in which they have worked out the details in
the interest of Canada generally. While the
United States is at the moment divided in its
opinions, we must remember that the St.
Lawrence River enters the sea fromn aur country. We, a nation of 14 million people will
have aur awn shipping facilities, and also
will be serving the millions in the western
United States, although the people of the
eastern United States may very well feel that
the transportation channel through. Canada
will be detrimental to their own shipping
interests.
I do not think that the St. Lawrence waterways schemne will be detrimental ta our port
of Halifax. It is a winter part, and the St.
Lawrence is closed Up for five months of the
year. If the trade flows through the St.
Lawrence waterway system. in the summer
manths, it may well resuit in the railways
thraugh the Maritimes getting a littie more
traffic during the winter months. What some
now think may be detrimental to Saint John
and Halifax, may well work ta the advantage

Hon. R. B. Horner: Hanaurable senators, I
have a few remnarks ta make befare the bill is
given second reading.
Caming -as I do fram. the Province of
Saskatchewan, I am nat really convinced that
the seaway pr'oject wifl be of any great
benefit to my part of the country. Indeed,
I am samewhat alarmed that it may slacken
the development and enlargement of aur
shipping through Churchill, a route by which
we can reach aur ýchief markets and save
a thousand miles. I notice that accurding
ta a report, a ship that lef t Churchill twa
weeks ago saw no sign o! ice in the river
or harbour. I am one o! th-ose who is firinly
canvinced that Churchill can handle flot 7
million but 10 million bushels o! our grain.

I understand that there is ta came before
the house next a companion bull ta this ana,
having ta do with tariffs and tolîs. We
have in the past heard about the wicked
toli gates an the Rhine. This bill, I understand, is for the purpose of callecting touls
ta pay for the construction costs of the seaway project and ta caver interest on barrowed money. It should be pointed out that
the greater part of the produce from Ontario
will flot make use o! the St. Lawrence facilities
but will be c'onsurned by the large domestic
market.
But when the products of the
West pass through the seaway, my province, with its small population, will be paying
a larger proportion of the cost than will
Ontario, and will receive no benefits whatever.
We Dften hear men of considerable experience remark that withaut the development
,of electric power this whole scheme is uneconomic, and that the main abject of deepening
the St. Lawrence is ta secure power. This
power will be available and useful chiefly
for the development of the Province of
Ontario. I do nat wish ta appear sectional,
but this development should be for the
betterment o! ail Canada.
There is a suggestion that the praject
will be useful in aur national defence program. For my part, I hope that long before
the development is campleted the nations
o! the world will have corne ta their senses,
and that we will have no need for such
facilities for defence purposes.
In conclusion, I just wish ta make my
position quite clear. I do nat thin-k the
seaway praject will be a! any great benefit
ta the province a! Saskatchewan; Manitoba
may get some advaýntages from it; the railways will likely lose somne business ta the
larger ships, and ta that extent we in the
West will be faced with increased freight
rates ta make u~p the loss. That, honaurabie
senatars, is the way I feel about the measure
before us.

INTERNATIONAL RAPIDS
DEVELOPMENT BILL

POWER

SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson maved the
second reading of Bull 34, an Act respecting

DECEMBER 13. 1951
Construction of Works for the Generation of
Electrical Power in the International Rapids
Section of the St. Lawrence River.
He said. Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to approve the agreement made
between the Government of Canada and the
Government of Ontario respecting power
development in the International Rapids
Section of the St. Lawrence River. This agreement was tabled in the house on December
12 last, and is a schedule to the bull which is
before us.
The agreement with Ontario has been concluded in the expectation that the United
States w111 flot participate in the 'seaway
projet, and it has been drawn Up on the
underotanding th-at the navigation works
will be undertaken by the federal government
and will be entirely within Canada. It contemplates that Ontario will undertake the
power development concurrently with an
appropriate agency in the United States. In
such cir-cunistances it is desirable that a firm
agreement exist between Canada and Ontario
in order that Canadian treaty obligations shal
be fulfllled, and other interests in Canada
safeguarded.
The undertakinigs on behaîf of Ontario are,
broadly, Vo develop the power resources of
the international rapids section of the St.
Lawrence river concurrently with an appropriate authority in the United States. This is
the same plan as was advanced and made
part of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence basin
agreement of 1941 between Canada and the
United States. However, the -agreement provides that this plan may be modified as may be
agreed upon between Canada and Ontario.
The Canadian Governmnent, for its part,
undertakes to do ail in its power to obtain
the approval o! the International Joint Commission to an application, to be made by
Ontario in an acceptable f orm, for authority
from that body to construct the necessary
works. Under the Boundary Waters Treaty o!
1909, this approval would be necessary since
the international rapids section of the St.
Lawrence river is a boundary water. Canada's
undertaking in this respect is qualified, however, to, the extent that its action must be
consistent with its obligations under the
Boundary Waters Treaty, and that regard
must be had for ail Canadian interests in the
St. Lawrence river.
I will briefly enumerate some of the other
more important provisions.
First, Canada
wiil transfer to Ontario the administration
of such lands belonging to Canada es are
required for the project, and Ontario will pay
compensation for these, except for lands or
property forming part o! the existing canal
system; second, Ontario will transfer to
Canada the administration of such lands

belonging to Ontario as are specified by
Canada as being required for works Vo, carry a
deep waterway in the international rapids
section; third, Ontario wül establish -a commission to safeguard and enhance scenic
beauty and historic associations in the section
Vo whatever extent may be appropriate.
It is recognized that before ail the arrangements are consummated, as contempiated in
this agreement, the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence
Basin Agreement o! 1941, between Canada
and the United States may be approved by
congress and by parliament. In that event it
would be the intention of the government to
reconsider with the Government of Ontario
the terms of the agreement signed on December 3 and to modify them in recognition of
the arrangements that would then exist
between Canada and the United States with
respect Vo the seaway project.
Han. Mr. Roebuck: No transfer of the
canais and ProD)erties of Canada is involved
in this bill, so apparently the Authority being
constituted in the previous Act is without
a transfer o! the present canals.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: It is stated that
Canada will transfer Vo Ontario the administration of such lands belongîng to Canada
as are required for the project.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: But that refers to the
electrification project. My question was with
regard to the transfer of the present canal
system to the Authority constituted in the
previous Act; and your answer was that iV
was .taken care of.
Han. Mr. Robertson: I misunderstood my
honourabie friend. He refers Vo that portion
of the present canal system which is between
Montreal and Lake Erie?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Well, Lake Ontario.
Hon. Mr. Haig: They call it the International Section.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: My information is
that this relates Vo the deep waterway
between the port of Montreal and Lake Erie.
I have no information as Vo what disposition
will be made of the existing canal system as
far as this particular Authority is concerned,
so I cannot answer my honourabie friend's
question.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: If I may interject, I
think probably the answer is in clause 14 of
the bil, which. gives the Governor in Coundil
the power Vo entrust Vo, the Authority the
management of any works upon such terms
as he may approve. I suppose that under
that provision the Governor in Council could
give authority Vo administer some of the
present canals.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is Bill 33, is it?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I take it that the canals of
the St. Lawrence would not extend to the
province of New Brunswick.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I think the area to
which this refers is between Montreal and
Lake Erie.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the Speaker: When shall the bill

BUSINESS 0F THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
before we proceed to the Orders of the Day,
I should like to make a brief statement as
to our future prograrn. Last night in the
other bouse the Minister of Public Works
(Hon. Mr. Fournier) intîmýated that that
bou.se would take up today Bill No. 41, an
Act to amend the Dominion Elections Act;
Bill No. 42, an Act respecting the National
Gallery of Canada; Bill No. 8, an Act to
ainend the North Fraser Harbour Commissioners Act; Bill No. 43, an Act to amenýd
the Civil Service Act; the resolution of the
Minister of Trade and Commerce concerning
the provision for short-term -credit to grain
producers in the prairie provinces; Bihl No.
18, an Act to provide for the establishment
of an Agricultural Products Board; Bill No.
36, an Act to amend the Co)mbines Investigation Act, and Bill No. 23, an Act to amend
the Governimen-t Annuities Act.
I presumne that hope springs eternal in the
other bouse, but it is certain that prorogation
by the end of this week is sirnply out of the
question. In these circuratances I arn going
to suggest to the house that when we adjourn
today we stand adjourned until Monday
morning next, at il o'c1ock. There is a possibility that in the meantirne great progress
wili have been made by the other house, ini
which case I arn sure honourabie senators
would want to be here on Monday morning
to consider as soon as possible any bills that
have been sent over to us. 1 think that, with
perhaps two exceptions, the bis with which
we shaUl have to deal wili not be very contentious in this house, and for the benefit of
any senators who may not be present when
we resumne on Monday morning I wouid suggest that we proceed with the second readings of bis that are more or less non-contentious and then, if it is deemed advlsable,
adjourn until the afternoon, at which time
we could proceed with such measures as
the Combines Bil] and the Annulties Bill, if
they have then reached us.
There is one other point that I wish ta
mention. In a minute or so His Honour the
Speaker will be reading a message from the
other house with a bill ta amend the Canadian Broadcastîng Act. I arn prepared, if
honourable members approve, to move

second reading and explain the bil this
afternoon, but I do not know that anything
very practical would be accomplished by
that, for the bill could flot possibly get to a
committee before Monday. Furthermore, I
arn advised that the Committee on Transport
and Communications has flot yet completed
its consideration of the St. Lawrence Waterways bis that were referred to it Iast night,
and that it is to resumne when the Senate
rises. So it might suit the house better to
have an early adjournment this afternoon
in order that the committee may continuc its
study of those bis without much delay. I
arn in the hands of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable members, if
I might make a suggestion, it wouid be that
the second reading of the Canadian Broadcasting Bill be left over until Monday, in
order that the Senate may adjourn early
and permit the Transport Committee to get
on with the two bis now before it. Before
I went to the committee meeting this morning I had expected that the bis would be
deait with there in hall an hour, but the
longer the discussion went on the more interesting it became, and at the time of adjournment it seemed that the whoie afternoor
would be required to complete consideration
o f the bis. As to the Canadian Broadcasting Bill, I think that if we discussed it without a break we would do a better job.

however, the amendments have been agreed

The motion was agreed to, and the bill was

The Hon. the Acting Speaker: When shall
this amendment be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
it is of course the ordinary practice to have
amendments such as this printed in our
Order Paper before they are considered, but
I would suggest that under the circumstances
we consider the amendment now. The general
object of it, I believe, is to make clear that
the president's powers shall be defined in and
limited by the by-laws passed by the corporation. On behalf of the government I
concur in the amendment.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Was any substantial
amendment made?
Hon. Mr. Haig: There is none other than
the one which has been referred to. I may
say that it does not change the powers or
authority of the president. It merely provides that his powers other than those relating to ordinary management shall be defined
in the by-laws and that the by-laws shall be
approved by the Governor General in Council. The committee as a whole thought it
better to insert this proviso in the statute
rather than that the president should retain
the unlimited powers he had under the
original bill.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: The amendment was
unanimously passed by the committee. We
felt that under the bill as it stood the powers
of the president were too arbitrary, and that
he should be subject to limitations defined
in the by-laws.

to our receipt of the Railway Bill; and in
the light of our experience in that matter
I think it might have been well to have tried
te devise some generally acceptable method
whereby important bills brought down in the
other house, could, prier to their receipt here,
be studied by committees of the Senate. As
honourable senators know, it is neither
entirely regular nor in keeping with our practice to consider a bill in committee before its
introduction into the Senate; but if that technical objection could be overcome, in another
session we might be able to avoid a situation
such as we face now.
Of course, the present situation is a little
different from that in which the Senate usually
finds itself when approaching the end of the
session, when all important legislation other
than the Supply Bill bas been dealt with, and
that measure is the only one which we are
awaiting from the other house. And the
difficulty that used te arise because of the
late hour at which that bill ordinarily came
ta us bas been overcome by our study of
the estimates in the Finance Committee
while they are still under consideration in
the Commons.
I do not know of any procedure that could
have been followed here other than the one
we have followed this session. I have done
what I could to facilitate the placing of the
present bill, and others, before the Senate
as early as possible. It is of course the
undoubted right of senators to take as much

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I move that this bill be placed at the foot
of the Order Paper for second reading later
this day.
Honourable senators,
Hon. Mr. Crerar:
before the motion is put, I think some protest should be made against the flood of
legislation that has just come over to us
this morning. I certainly do net wish ta
hold up the proceedings of this lieuse, but
honourable members here have had no
opportunity to make even a most cursory
examination of these bills before being asked
to pass upon them. This is not the manner
in which legislation should be dealt with by
parliament. The Dominion Elections Bill
is one that need not concern this bouse very
much after it has passed the other place,
but all the other measures are important,
including one-a bill to amend the Financial
Administration Act-which is most important; and we have not had a chance even
ta look at it. It appears to me that we are
being placed in a position where we shal be
simply rubber-stamping legislation as it
comes across from the House of Commons.
In my judgment this is net a good enouggh
position for the Senate te be in when it
comes ta the discharge of its responsibilities,
and I -wish ta enter my protest against such
procedure.
The motion was agreed ta.

SENATE
consist of a board of nine governors appointed by
the Governor in Council and chosen to give representation ta the principal geographical divisions of
Canada.

In referring to the Board of Governors,
the Massey Commission stated in its report,
at page 287:
41. We have no evidence that the present Board of
Governors has used its powers harshly or unjustly.
Il it had done sa, the proper remedy would be an
improved board rather than a second one. However,
we are strongly of the opinion that in view of the
place occupied by radio broadcasting in the if e of
the nation, and particularly because of the new and
even disturbing possibilities of television broadcasting, no effort should be spared to make the
Board of Gavernors of the C.B.C. as effective as
possible.
It should be large enough ta be fully
representative of the country as a whole; and it
shauld be camposed of persons fully qualified by
knawledge, experience and interests not only ta
maintain but to advance the present standards of
radio broadcasting in Canada whether national or
local.
We feel very strongly the importance of
retaining for the Board the services of qualified
Persans who are free ta devate the necessary time
and thaught to these grave responsibilities.

The Commission then recommended:
.that the present Board of Gavernars be enlarged in arder ta make il more widely representative.

The

amendment now proposed provides
an increase in the number 0f governors, from nine ta eleven, in order to give
a broader representation on the board.
The original Canadian Broadcasting Act
provided that the Chairman of the Board of
Governors would be appointed for a termi
of three years; and at that timie the appointment was flot on a full time basis. In 1944
there was an amendment ta the Act which
provided that the chairman would be required
ta devote the whole of his time ta the performance of fris duties, and would be paid
an annual salary to be determined by the
Governor in Council. It is now proposed in
the bill under discussion that the chairman
shall be appointed for a terni of ten years.
The longer terni is advisable in order ta provide for a continuity in this important office,
and is also more consistent wilh appoiîîtments
la various commissions and boards.
Under the original statute, expenditures
exceeding $10,000 require approval of the
Governor in Council.
Owing ta great
increases in the cost 0f technical and other
specialized equipment, of new construction,
and of the various other items required in
the operation of the service, it bas been
necessary for the C.B.C. ta apply for authority of the Governor in Council more frequently than originally intended, and it is
now considered appropriate that the corporation should require authority of the Governar
in Council only for expenditures in excess of
$25,000, as this would be mare in line with
for

the value 0f the dollar today as compared
with that of 1936. This amendment will
reduce the amount of paper work and avoid
delays in undertaking activities, but will stili
provide for a check by the government on
any of the larger individual transactions propased by the C.B.C.
One of the most important problems facing
the corporation is that of financing its operations for the sound-broad casting service. The
annual licence fee for radio receivirig sets bas
remained at $2.50 since 1938. The revenue
from. licence fees for the fiscal year ended
March 31, 1951, was $5,571,991.31. This was
supplemented by revenue in the amount of
$2,463,344.62 fromn commercial broadcasting. Miscellaneous revenue amounted ta
$266,043.80, making a total incame of
$8,30 1,379.73. Expenditures for saund-broadcasting during the same period amounted to
$9,21 4,625.33. After providing for depreciation and obsolescence there was a deficit
under sou nd- broad casting operations for the
fiscal year amounting ta $1,149,093.77.
It i5 of the utmost importance ta recognize
that since 1938, notwithstanding the spectacular increase in prices and costs in recent
years, the radio licence fee bas remained
constant at $2.50 per annum. The fees paid
ta musicians, actors, speakers and other performers, have risen very substantially. There
have been very sharp increases in the cost
of the specialized kinds 0f technical equipment and supplies used in radio broadcasting.
Rentals of studio and office space have
increased very considerably, and in some
cases have more than doubled since 1938.
In common with employment practices elsewhere, salaries of C.B.C. employees have had
ta be increased. In other words, national
broadcasting in Canada is a national institution performing a vital public service. It
bas been faced with very substantial
increases in costs 0f operation and maintenance, and yet up until now there has been
no provision for an increase in income in
kecping with the general rise in prices, and
which would pravide for a proper measure
of financial stability.
The Massey Commission investigated this
financial problemn very thoroughly, and came
ta the conclusion that, as stated at page 294:
... because the C.B.C. serves the nation
as a whole it is reasonable that the revenue
required over and above a moderate licence
fee be provided fromn general taxation.
At the samne page of the report the Commission went on to state:
65. There are, however, seriaus abjections to
an annual grant ta be voted by parliament.
Although other essential gavernment services depend on an annual vote. it is so important to keep

DECEMBER 17, 1951
thie national radio free from the posslbility of political influence that its income should flot; depend
annually on direct action by the goverument of the
day. A statutory grant seems to us a more satisfacfactory method, because it enables the C.B.C. to
formulate reasonably long range plans with the
confidence that its income will not be decreaseci
over a period of years. A convenient; way of
providing adequate revenue for the C.B.C. might
be to set the necessary revenue for the C.B.C. at a
total amnounit ecjual to one dollar per head of the
Canadian population as determined decennially by
the census and estimated each year by the Dominion
Bureau of Statistics.

The Commission then recommended:
(1) That the annual licence fee for radio receiving
sets bie maintained at lis present level, but that a
more efficient method of collection be devised.
(2) That the total annual income of the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation for ail radio broadcasting
purposes other than its International Service be
set by statute for five years, and that this income
be found from licence fees. from commercial and
miscellaneous revenue, and fromn a payment out of
public money sufficient to make up the total
statutory income.

The government considers this to be a very
wise proposal. It is designed to provide an
annual income to, the corporation equivalent
to $1 per head of the population. An annual
grant would flot be appropriate, as it would
not allow for the long terni planning that is
required in this peculiar kind of operation.
Many of the program changes, as well as a
certain amount of technical change, must be
planned at least a year in advance, and it is
important that the corporation should be
assured of a definite revenue over a fiveyear period. 0f equal importance, as emphasized by the Massey Commission, is the fact
that the provision of specific annual statutory
grants over a five-year period will free the
national systemn from. the possibility of political influence and the uncertainty in determining its annual income which might occur
if the system depended upon an annual vote.
Consequently, by section 6 of the bill to
grant, to the corporation, out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, a sumn of $4,750,000 for
the fiscal year commencing April 1, 1951,
and an amount o! $6,250,000 in each of the
four next following fiscal years. The sum of
$1,500,000 has already been provided to the
corporation as an interim grant in the current fiscal year. Honourable senators will

note that the $1,500,000 already provided for

plus the grant o! $4,750,00O makes the total
of $6,250,000, which is the total annual grant
proposed. These grants will supplement the
income from licence fees and from commercial broadcasting, and it is considered that
this will enable the corporation to operate
with the degree of efficiency and effectiveness
which should ohiaractei-ize this great national
public service.

There is no provision under the existing
statute for appeal by privately-owned stations f romn decisions of the Board o! Governors o! the C.B.C. in administering i-ts
regulations. The Massey Commission reviewed
this question, and on page 289 of the report
stated:
49. We thlnk that there should be soie right of
appeal. On the one hand, the right should not
disturb the C.B.C.'s control of and responsibility
for Canadian broadcasting. On the other, it should
provide s means whereby substantial. injustice
could be redressed. We do not wish to limit the
existing power of the C.B.C. to, regulate broadcasting in Canada, but we feel that the honest and
impartial administration of its regulations should be
guaranteed by the right of appeal to a Federal
Court by persons directly and adversely aftected
by final decisions of the Board of Governors under
those regulations.

Following this observation, the commission recommended:
That persons engaged in radio broadcasting in
Canada direotly and adversely affected by a final
decision of the Board of Governors of the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation on any matter In which
this Board has final authority be granted. the right
to appeal to a Federal Court against substantial
miscarriage of justice.

To imnplement this recommendation, an
amendment is proposed in the bull which
would provide for the right of appeal to the
Exchequer Court of Canada by the licensee
of a private station on any question of law
arising out of the suspension of a licence
by the Board o! Governors of the C.B.C.
The bill proposes several other minor
changes which are advisable in view of
changed conditions since the statute was
enacted, ia 1936, and. which will also provide
for clarification.
Ia conclusion, may I express the hope
that honourable senators have taken the ti-me
not only to read but to study the report of
the Massey Commission. It is one o! the
greatest public documents issued in Canada
in this century, and I amn confident that it
will have a far-reaching effect on the cuitivation of a distinctively Canadian culture in
which we may ail take pride. la this
development national radio broadcasting has
an important place, and for this reason the
sections dealing with both sound-broadcasting and television have a serious and important bearing on our consideration of the biUl
now before us.

controlled, as the railroads are controlled, by
an independent commission. How would we
like it if one of our railroads were under the
control, in respect of jurisdiction, of the
other? Suppose a law were passed to make
the Canadian National Railway subject to
the Canadian Pacific Railway in the same
fashion as private stations are controlled by
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, what
would be the reaction of the public? Would
not the national interest suifer? Would
there not be protests on every hand? Or consider what would happen were the Canadian
Pacific Raîlway controlled by the Canadian
National? Yet in principle much the same
thing obtains here. Private stations, having
invested considerable money to develop their
business find themselves under the power of
a competing corporation. The C.B.C. may tell
you that they do not compete, but they do;
and the greater the difficulty of getting financial support, the more severe the competition will become.
The second thing against which I protest
is the $2.50 fee. The radio owner either
should pay $10 or he should not pay anything. As matters are, getting a licence is a
provoking business. People forget it, and then
they are called up and told that if they do
not renew at once they will flnd themselves
before the court. Now the taxpayer is to be
required to put up some $6,000,000 a year.
That is the purpose o! the bill.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: Will that be the whole
amount required? Wil not more be wanted as
time goes on?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Oh, yes, it will keep going
up ail the time.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: I know that People in
my part of the world are concerned over
this.
Hon. Mr. Haig: 17he leader o! the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) intimated that it
costs more today to run the C.B.C. than it
did when it started-I believe in 1933-because costs have been going up.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: It was set up in 1935.
Hon. Mr. Haig: But the general set-up
was completed in 1933, I think. Well, costs
have been going up, but so far as I have seen
there has been no eff ort to recluce the cost
o! living. It may decline a little for two, or
three months, but generally speaking it
moves upward ail the time. This is no
reason why we should, have to meet this
cost. The C.B.C. is spending a tremendous
amount o! money in Toronto and Montreal
and is giving those cities a television service
that the rest of Canada will fot be able to

get for years. I do not knýow why the taxpayers should stand for that. If the government is going to levy a tax at all, why does
it flot levy a tax that will be sufficient to
pay the shot right across Canada? Then if
people want the service they can pay for it,
and if they do not want it the government
can cut off the surplus revenue. This cannot be done now.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: What about increasing
the rates in Toronto and Montreal?
Hon. Mr. Haig:
I understand that a
licence fee of $6 or $8 is going to, be charged
for television sets, but that will not even
begin to meet the over-ail cost.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: I underst-and that the
stations in Montreal and Toronto will tie
in with certain transmission stations operated
by the Bell Telephone Company, and that,
as a resuit, television service wîll be made
available to private stations which otherwise would not receive it. Is the honourable
gentleman aware of that?
Han. Mr. Haig: I underistand that has
been discussed, but I do not know whether
it will corne about. Why -do they not let the
private stations develop their own television
service? 1 can see no objection to it. Unlike
the C.B.C., the private stations would be
spending their own money and not ours.
The absurd part of the present set-up is
that the people of Canada are charged $2.50
for their radio licences and then contrîbute
something like $6,250,000 each year in the
way -o! taxes for their radio service. On top
of all this the C.B.C. is in the business o!
selling programs. The private -stations do
flot derive any revenue from licence fees
or taxation; yet objection is made to them
spending their own money in -the development of television.
Hon. Mr. Foga: They get quite a bit from,
the C.B.C.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The C.B.C. use private
stations to handie certain broadcasts. They
pay for it.
Hon. Mr. Foga: The C.B.C. pays for it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The private stations pay
for it if it is of value to, them. In my city
of Winnipeg there is a Dominion Network
station and the C.B.C., both operated by the
C.B.C. The objectionable thing is that those
who rua the C.B.C. think they formn a superparliament and can decide what the people
o! Canada should and should not hear. That
is not freedomn of speech at ail. -It is a
different matter with the newspapers. They

on, have to get their own revenues in order
to operate. In this case we give one corporation the power to handle news right
across Canada. We pay them for doing it
and at the same time we put ourselves under
their control. That is what we have been
doing right along.
Honourable senators, I protest against certain university professors from Toronto,
Montreal, Winnipeg and elsewhere broadcasting their pet theories over the air on
Sunday nights, and no chance being given to
anyone to refute their statements. Very few
of these men have ever had to struggle in
Recently
life under business conditions.
when a man in London spoke over the radio
about the European federation, his speech
was immediately criticized by a professor
from Winnipeg. You may say, "Well, that
is a case of presenting both sides of an argument". But is it? Does that Winnipeg professor know both sides? A good many of us
went to universities. When attending university as a young man one sometimes thinks
of certain professors as being great men, but
years later he realizes that they never did
strike at the real difficulties of life at all.
I have nothing against professors at all. They
can lecture on economics, mathematics,
language and history all they want, but I do
not like it when they try to tell people how
to run politics, a democracy, or a business.
Only those who have had experience in these
matters are in a position to give advice on
them. Why do businessmen put their sons
and sons-in-law into business at an early
age? It is so that they will learn the business from the bottom up. There are some
things that can only be learned from
experience; they cannot be learned out of
books.
Honourable senators, it may be said that I
am opposed to the C.B.C. That is not so, but
I am opposed to the administrative set-up and
the way in which the affairs of the C.B.C. are
handled. I think an independent body, similar to the Board of Transport Commissioners,
should be set up to handle our radio service.
All business affairs are handled by independent people-and our judges. One side will
argue one way, and the other side another
way, and a judge will decide between the two.
Here we have an organization which is
operated at tremendous cost to 'the country;
yet there is no control over it. Now it is being
given the control of our television interests
over a five-year plan. This is not democratic.
I thought parliament's greatest power was
the voting of money each year to carry on
the business of the country-and here we are
being asked to authorize an expenditure to
cover a five-year period. I protest against

this kind of legislation. I 'think it is a backward step and means that we are giving up
some of our control over freedom of speech
in the organization concerned as it exists at
the present time.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. J. J. Kinley: Honourable senators, I
have just 'a few words to say. I think the
leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson) in explaining the
bill said that there were nine governors in
the Canadian Broad-casting Corporation. It
seems to me tha-t we are using this word
"governor" too loosely in connection with the
affairs of Canada. The office of governor
is a high one in the public life of the country.
The Governor General holds the highest office
in the land, and the office of lieutenant governor is the highest office in the provinces. In
the country to the south of us we find a
governor at the head of every state. I have
been told by Europeans that this term governor creates a wrong impression. They get
the impression of supreme authority.
Hon. Mr. Bishop: There are also governors
of our jails.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I suppose they have
supreme authority; but it seems to me that in
private enterprise or in the setting up of
government boards we should not imitate the
jails in the use of the word governor.
The honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig) spoke about the influence of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. I do not think
radio has succeeded in influencing our people
as much as the printed word. I maintain
that the press of the country still carries
more influence than does the radio. I have
heard people in my section of the country
say that what they hear on the radio goes in
one ear and out the other, but what they
read in the papers is imprinted indelibly on
their minds. The same is 'true of the movies
and the legitimate theatre. Unless a movie
is outstanding, you usually soon forget it;
but when you see live actors or hear and
see light opera-you remember it for a lifetime. I think we can still say that both the
printed word and the personal touch exceed
the influence of radio.
We hear a good deal about freedom of
speech. Well, speech is pretty free in this
country and in the United States. Perhaps it
it too free. Freedom of speech does not mean
licence, and I think the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the private broadcasters
should be held responsible under the law of
the country for what they put out over the
air. I think, for instance, that if they say
anything detrimental against a person's
character they should be liable to court
action.

DECEMBER 17, 1951

My friend the leader of the opposition
(Hon. Mr. Haig) spoke about Sunday radio
programs. I think that we in Canada should
do what we can to see to it that the Sabbath
Day is observed as it should be observed, and
that broadcasters, especially those under the
control of parliament, present Sunday programs that are elevating and clean and as
free as possible from commercialism. Also,
if there is going to be the broadcasting of
opinions that are not always quite what we
would expect from citizens of Canada, let
them be broadcast on some other day than
the Sabbath, for that is a day when many
people, who have more time to listen than
during the busy week, would prefer to have
material presented on a high plane.
One thing that strikes me about the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and other
publicly-owned companies in this countrythe Canadian National Railways, for instance
-is that they are not subject to the stresses
and tests of private business. If a man is
president of a private company he must succeed; that is, he must see to it that his
company makes money, or he will be
removed from office. The test of his efficiency
is whether the success of the company
is according to the rules of business. But the
same test does not seem to be applied to a
person at the head of a government or publicly-owned corporation. If he has a deficit,
he comes to the government or to parliament
to get some money, and nobody ever suggests
that he may be inefficient. It seems to me
that we need to be alert to see to it that we
do not coast along and take it for granted
that the people's money should be used to
organizations
bolster up publicly-owned
whenever they have a deficit.
I was much interested last week in a bill
before the Transport Committee to amend
the Toronto Harbour Commissioners Act.
The oil companies thought that the commissioners were seeking unnecessary authority
in order to tax them, and the Harbour Commissioners said, "But we are a public body,
dealing with interests of the public". Well,
on the other side there are the private
industries of this country, and they are the
ones that pay the taxes to keep the government and these government organizations
going. It has been said that the government
is the biggest partner in every business of the
country, for at least 55 per cent of the profits
of a successful corporation are paid out in
taxes. So if private industry did not succeed
we would not have millions of dollars to
give to the Broadcasting Corporation and
other such concerns. Perhaps we need to

reconstruct our thinking a little on the subject of profits made by private concerns. It
is from those profits that the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, for instance, is maintained. So when it again needs millions of
dollars to carry on its operations, I think we
should make sure that it is properly run
and efficiently managed.
The leader of the opposition very truly
says that this organization should not be a
law unto itself. Well, some of the people
in government companies try to be a law
unto themselves, at least as far as possible.
I am not suggesting that we should return
to the practice -of the old days when a man's
politics had a good deal to do with whether
or not he could get an important job with
the government, in return for which he was
expected to be loyal and grateful. But no
one should consider himself above parliament. I recall a time in the pa'st when there
was considerable concern about whether the
then president of the Canadian National
Railways was not as powerful as the then
government of the country. We want to
guard against anything like that. It is a
good thing to have views expressed on a
matter of this kind, for they give us a
chance to notify important officials that they
should never forget they are public servants.
We should make it clear that while we wish
to preserve their dignity and independence,
their continuation in office will depend upon
their efficiency and virtue, and that unless
they show that they possess these qualities,
they may find it difficult in future to continue in office and to come to parliament for
assistance.
Hon. George H. Barbour: Honourable
senators, I differ with the opinion of the
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) that
the radio licence fee should be $10 a year.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Ten dollars or nothing.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: I do not agree with
that. To my mind the people who are getting the most important service from the
C.B.C. are the fishermen who depend upon
radio for warnings of coming storms. I
believe that radio has been a means of
saving many lives in this way. Another
important class of people served by radio
are those living in remote parts of the
country, in rural areas without electricity.
These people, like the fishermen at sea, have
to use battery radios, and the batteries will
cost a man $15 or $16 or more every year.
These people look to the radio not only for
weather reports and storm warnings, but
for entertainment which is not available to
them from any other source; and I certainly
would oppose any increase in the licence
fee charged to them.

SENATE

The most important section of the bill, in
my opinion, is the one granting the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation $30,000,000
over the next five years. I want to ask the
leader of the government here (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) if he can tell us in how many
years of the corporation's activities there
has been a surplus and in how many years
there has been a deficit. Though we are
asked to vote a definite sum of $30,000,000
over the next five years, I feel that we do
not know the total amount that will have
to be provided. I cannot understand just
what the connection is between the government, the minister and the C.B.C., when that
organization can run up a deficit of a million
dollars or more in a year.
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: Honourable senators, I wish to make a few remarks about
the programs carried by stations of the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Some
of these programs to which I have listened
are, in my view, absolutely immoral. Just
two or three weeks ago I was listening with
my family to a broadcast sponsored by
C.B.C. in which organized adultery was the
theme. My daughter remarked to me, "If
that is the way of life today between men
and women, I prefer to stay with you for
the rest of my life". For this reason I have
had to cut off stations carrying such porgrams.
As the leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig)
said a few moments ago, we cannot answer
what comes to us by radio. Today we are
hearing it with our ears, tomorrow we will
be seeing it with our eyes, and we cannot
disavow what the speakers on distasteful programs are saying to us.
The people of Canada are paying for the
operation of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and they have a right to expect
programs that are educational rather than
depraved. This nationally-owned broadcasting system should educate and not scandalize
our families.
Hon. Norman P. Lamberi: Honourable senators, in attempting to discuss the subject of
this bill at this time one does so with a
depressing sense of futility. A lengthy discussion on this legislation took place in the
committee of the other house, and certain
phases of it have received a good deal of
attention. But with the limitation of time
facing us, I take for granted that there is
really nothing we can say here or ask in
committee at this tirne which would substantially affect the passage or the application
of this measure. Nevertheless, if one has an
interest at all in the matter, he is in duty
bound to raise certain points which the bill
attempts to emphasize.

In connection with this legislation and some
other bills to follow a great deal has been
made of the report of the Massey Commission. I think that the free reference that
is made to the recommendations contained
in 'the Massey Report is liable to blind our
eyes and confuse our minds as to the realities
and true significance of this and other bills.
This measure contains nothing that requires
in its support quotations from the Massey
Report. True, the report made certain recommendations about the administration of radio
in this country, but with all due respect to
the report, I do not think that its recomendations have been made as a result of a great
deal of the evidence that was heard on the
subject.
The whole concept of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation as we know it .today is
a matter of evolution. When in 1935 the
corporation was envisaged, I was very much
interested in the form it would take, and I
was favourable to the form it did take,
namely, a Canadian broadcasting corporation
whose chief objective was to be an agency
for unity in this country. It was to bring
to those parts of the country which were less
populated than the central provinces of
Ontario and Quebec the unifying benefits of
national broadcasts. It was to give to the
people of the prairies and other isolated
points contact with central Canada by means
of a free broadcasting system.
Those objectives were, I think, all to the
good, and for the first ten years they genuinely served in bringing about a degree of
unity from one end of the country to the
other. That unity is, in a large part, attributable to the work that has been done by the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
There are, however, two phases of the
problem that should be discussed and
analysed further even than the committee of
the other house was able to carry its inquiry.
I refer to the technical side of radio and television, involving as it does such matters as
wave lengths and technical regulations and
controls over the operation of radio stations.
This technical phase of the operation should,
I think, be controlled centrally, in the same
way as railways, for instance, are controlled
by the Board of Transport Commissioners. In
my opinion there should, be an institution
which would see to it that all of the technical
requirements of radio in this country are
wisely administered.
The other phase which has given rise to a
strong division of opinion in Canada has to
do with the power of radio and television
being .centred in a federal instrument of the
state. I think that has to do with the quality
and the character of the programs that are

DECEMBER 17, 1951
dispensed by it; as well as the complete and
autocratic control which it has, not only over
its own national broadcasting stations but
over stations which are recognized now as
private stations and confined largely to provincial areas in the different parts of Canada.
As one who has watched and followed from
the beginning the development and application of radio in this country, I say in all
sincerity that I can see a trend towards the
establishment of greater power in an institution with effects on the public mind of this
country that are not wholly good.
That, to my mind, is the whole crux of
the situation regarding the enlarging powers
that are conferred by this bill on the CanaI do not
dian Broadcasting Corporation.
believe there is any set of men, young or
old, in this country who are capable of administering the powerful influence that is inherent in the complete control of radio and television as an instrument of mass communication in this country. To really comprehend
and grasp all that is involved in this legislation, it is necessary to have an historical
view of the evolution of freedom of speech
and freedom of the press and all that is
involved in those terms. It took two hundred years or more of struggle to bring those
freedoms to their present status in this country, and a great deal of enlightenment and
insistency on the part of growing democratic
forces has been required to hold that ground.
As a matter of fact the progress of democracy in the world is registered in the degree
that the press has been made free and freedom of association and freedom of speech
have been accorded.
It is said that the air belongs to the people.
The air we breathe belongs to the people,
but the ether waves in the air that are operated by radio do not belong to the people and
are not controlled by them. The question of
the control of this new medium must be considered in the light of the importance of this
whole matter; and I think the quality and
the -character of the programs dispensed
throughout this country can be affected for
the better only by means of more competition.
I am not going to disparage as a whole the
performance of the C.B.C. over the years.
Some of the services they have performed,
for instance during the visit of Her Royal
Highness and the Duke of Edinburgh, were
highly creditable, and such as one likes to
see a national broadcasting corporation performing. The treatment of the royal visit
was a purely objective, excellent reportorial
job. On the other hand one cannot say the
same of some of the assignments given by
the program department of the C.B.C. to
various people to make news broadcasts and

commentaries. Undoubtedly the people selected for this work are chosen as the result
of an estimate of their abilities, but there
have been many instances of objectionable
material being presented and objectionable
and inaccurate statements being made under
these heads over the radio. Some of these
instances have been mentioned in this chamber, and in this connection I do not wish to
emphasize anything that, from a point of view
taken in the Senate, may have a controversial
aspect. What I am trying to bring out is that
freedom of speech is abused when it is
applied to the utterance of statements of that
kind. There is nothing anybody can do to
correct them. Evidently so far the administration of radio broadcasting is concerned,
there is no provision for editing the copy of
these people before their statements are
broadcast. In connection with newspapers or
magazine publications of any standing, the
editors and owners have a sense of responsibility for the kind of material they circulate
among the reading public. If carte blanche is
given to somebody to speak on a subject of
current interest over the radio, without any
previous checking of his material by the
responsible person in charge of radio operations, that is not freedom of speech at all, it is
freedom of licence; it indicates irresponsibility. This does not, in my opinion, reflect
serious appreciation of the great influence
which the radio should have as an instrument
of education and communication to the people.
If there is no organization to control that sort
of thing, I see only one way to correct it, and
that is by providing opportunity for competition on the part of an agency or agencies
whose broadcasts may tend to restore the
balance in that regard.
There is so much to be said in connection
with this subject that I am sorry we shall
not have more time to deal with it. I think
the bill should be referred to the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce to
enable us to ask questions of the officials.
One question which naturally arises out of
this legislation is: What sort of a basis will
be necessary for appeal to the Exchequer
Court? If a private station or someone else
takes exception to a ruling of the C.B.C., will
the objector have recourse to the Exchequer
Court? On what basis would the appeal be
made? These are things I should like to
know. I raise these points because I believe
this country has reached an important stage
in connection with the development of this
powerful influence in the educational and
informative life of Canadians.
The development of this unknown quantity of television is being left entirely in the
hands of the C.B.C., and I think that the
expense of this undertaking should be shared

SENATE

by private interests in Canada which are
only too ready to share it. I feel that the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation can control television technically as a whole, just as
the wave lengths of radio are controlled, but
it is not practical from a business viewpoint
for this country to say to one of its own
agencies, "Here is $30 million to spend over
five years. Go ahead and develop television
for the people of Canada". I am afraid that
if the evolution in television service reflects
the trend of centralization, power, and propaganda-if I may use that term-that has
been evidenced in radio, it is not going to
benefit Canada as a whole. Some of these
points should be explored fully in an impartial and independent way in our committee.
I should like to see our committee given as
much time as possible to deal with this
important subject.
Hon. J. G. Turgeon: Honourable senators,
in rising to take part in this debate I am
afraid I am going to make two or three
remarks which may readily be called contradictory one to another. First of all, I am
going to recommend that the supervision of
private broadcasting stations should not be
left directly in the hands of the Board of
Governors of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. I am going to further recommend
that we give consideration to the setting up
of another body consisting of either three or
five members. A membership of three might
be satisfactory, but I think five would be
better, because of our two languages and the
various cultures of the several racial origins
which are found in different geographical
areas of the country. In my opinion the
Chairman of the Board of Governors of the
C.B.C. should be ipso facto one of the
members of this new body. I am going to
:suggest all this later as a definite recommendation for consideration.
Honourable senators, I agree with the honourable senior senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert) that at this stage of the session it
would be unwise to make any efforts to
materially amend the legislation now before
us. This legislation is based on the studies
made by the Massey Commission-which I
would commend for its splendid work-and
by the committee of the other house. It has
received the acceptance of the cabinet, which
is a committee of parliament, and has been
passed by the other place. The Senate has
only a few hours now in which to deal with
it and needless to say we cannot do this
properly. My main purpose in rising is to
throw out the suggestion which I have outlined as to a new body to supervise the action
and conduct of private stations, and I hope

that this suggestion will come up for consideration in the next session of parliament,
which I assume will commence in February
of 1952.
Honourable senators, I am opposed in principle to the government-I was going to use
the word "interfering", but that may not be
the proper word-administering anything
that is essentially not government business.
I made this statement in 1936, when I was a
member of the House of Commons committee
under the chairmanship of the honourable
senator from Provencher (Hon. Mr. Beaubien), who is our Acting Speaker today which
was studying the legislation to reorganize the
C.B.C. I was afraid that if this reorganization were carried out it would not meet with
success. In view of criticisms that have been
made, I want to say that upon looking back
to 1936, when the C.B.C. was established, I
think the work done by that body bas been
extraordinarily good. I extend this reference
of good work to each member of the Board of
Governors and to all those responsible for
administering the affairs of the C.B.C.
This does not mean, however, that every
action taken by the C.B.C. bas always found
favour with me. I agree with what the
honourable senator from Kennebec (Hon. Mr.
Vaillancourt) said this morning. I do not know
just what broadcast he was speaking about,
but I know that there has been a discussion
lately about broadcasts being directed against
religion. I am in thorough agreement with
the principle of free speech. I agree again
with the honourable senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) that the theory or doctrine or whatever you wish to call it of free
speech does not mean that the taxpayers of
Canada who hold radio licences should have
to pay for the opportunity of hearing opinions
or doctrines with which the great majority
of Canadians do not agree. I am not critical
about what bas been said by the various men
and women whose names have been mentioned during the last few weeks of parliamentary discussion. I want to point out,
though, that all the arguments made by the
representatives of the Soviet Union against
the free world are based upon two things: one
is what they call capitalism, and the other is
what they call religion. These are the two
things that the communists are trying to
destroy in this world. Therefore I would
suggest that great care be exercised by those
directing radio organizations, and particularly
the public broadcasting corporation, as to
statements that may be made along that
general line.
I am not against free speech. Speaking in
this chamber in the session of 1951 on the
work of the United Nations, after I had had
the honour of being one of the five official

SENATE
At 2.30 o'clock the sitting was resumed.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, let
me say at once that my contribution to this
debate will be brief.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: No, no.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I am delighted that that
remark meets with approval in at least one
quarter of the house. In view of the number
of important bills which we have yet to consider at this late date, I would certainly be
showing a discourtesy to the house if I were
to unnecessarily take up its time.
The amendments to the Canadian Broadcasting Act which we have under consideration at the moment appear to have developed
largely out of the report of what is known
as the Massey Commission, on the development of arts, letters and sciences in Canada.
I do not fully agree, I must say, with the
somewhat eulogistic references that the leader
on this side has made to that report. I think
the commission did a great deal of painstaking
investigation, but of course there is room to
qualify or to differ with the recommendations
found in the report.
There seems to be abroad a curious notion
that the implementation of this report will in
some mysterious fashion help us to develop
a culture. If I understand these amendments
aright, they have in a substantial measure at
least to do with that feature of the report.
In the first place, what is culture? We use
such terms in a very generic sense. I took
occasion to consult a standard dictionary as
to the definition of "culture", and I found
that it applies to many things, such as the
productions of plants and the cultivation of
the soil. But in the sense that we are asked
to consider it today-and I would like my
colleagues to note this carefully-the definition is this, "the training, improvement and
refinement of mind, morals or taste". It is in
this sense that the report of the Massey Commission deals with the matter, and there is
of course room for interesting discussion as
to how culture according to this definition can
best be advanced.
We usually consider that in the matiter of
culture the countries of Europe, over the centuries, have made more substantial advancement than we of the North American
Continent have made in our comparatively
short and more recent growth, and that in
those countries Ithere is a keener understanding of the importance of the refinement of
mind, of morals and of taste. The degree to
which this refinement takes place in a country
is a measure of that country's progress
towards a higher civilization.

This development in other countries, I am
bound to say, came about altogether without
the assistance of the modern media of communication. The culture of France-probably
the most cultured nation in the world-was
not the product of radio broadcasting or television. The same is true of Italy, Great Britain
and other countries. It is therefore a miscalculation to expect that the granting of an
additional $30 million to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation for the development of
its radio and television services is any indication or any evidence that growth will take
place in our culture. As a matter of fact,
apart altogether from radio broadcastingand of television, which we do not yet have
-Canada
has made substantial, if slow,
progress towards culture as defined, namely,
"training, improvement and refinement of
mind, morals and tastes".
Such progress bas come about through the
voluntary efforts of people who have an
appreciation of the importance of these
things. We have seen advancement, for
instance, in the field of music, in which for a
great many years, festivals have been held
where people gather and compete with each
other, and where competent judges are
present to pronounce upon their performances. We have had the development of
drama, particularly through the medium of
the Little Theatre movement in many towns
and cities across Canada. We have had a quite
remarkable development of the ballet. I
venture to say that all these forms of
advancement had no relation whatever to the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, but
developed simply because of an urge on the
part of some people to reach out for the finer
things of the spirit, and to give expression
to their desires and their hopes.
The proposals contained in this measure
may build up high expectations, but it has
one feature which I think we must guard
against. If any notion grows that we can rely
on radio broadcasting-and on television
when it comes-to advance culture in this
country, it creates the very great danger-and
I say this without criticism, implied or
intended, of the C.B.C. management or its
Board of Governors-that the control of this
development will be largely in the hands of a
comparatively few people.
In recent years we have had ample evidence of the tremendous and vital importance
of radio-communication as a means of
influencing mass opinion. The development
of Hitler's Nazi Germany and Mussolini's
Fascist Italy would not have been possible
but for the radio. In more recent months,
the suppression of liberty and freedom in
the Argentine, once a democratic state, has
been largely the product of mass appeal

DECEMBER 17, 1951
through broadcasting. Without any criticism
intended or implied of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation or its management, I feel
we should be very careful about confiding
these important powers and possibilities
solely to the judgment of a few men. You
may say that there is nothing to fear, that
al they will do is to try to stimulate and
advance developments which are now going
on. But I repeat that the people who control
the communication of ideas through broadcasting have not only a tremendous responsibility but an enormous power. I do not agree
with al the programs that come over the
C.B.C.; nevertheless I would be very reluctant to suppress them. If some of them are
plainly objectionable that evidences nothing
more, I think, than that, notwithstanding a
desire on the part of the governors and management to operate in a fair and judicial way,
they make mistakes.
I would offer this suggestion. I have
listened to various radio broadcasts, particularly on the Sunday evening program to
which my honourable friend from Kennebec
(Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt) referred, and I am
bound to say, particularly with respect to
two or three commentators who appear to be
pretty regularly employed, that personally I
would have written them off and written off
the opportunity they have had to transmit
over the air-waves what appears to me to be
a peculiar type of propaganda. Far be it for
me to say that no such propaganda should be
allowed. But I am not impressed with the
argument that somebody else can present the
other point of view. At a public meeting
varying opinions can be put forward; the
columns of the press give space to al sorts
of viewpoints; but once a broadcast is sent
into tens of thousands of homes you can
never catch up with or correct some of the
impressions which may be created by it.
That fact should ever be in the minds of
those who have control of this medium.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Sometimes I wonder what
will be the end-effect of it all. One goes
into homes where the radio is on every hour
of the day, presenting a medley of ideas and
music and almost everything else. How in
the world can a listener ever develop a clear
or coherent appraisal of the matters he hears
about, or form a considered judgment? Some
may say this is not a danger; but to me it is
rather a terrifying possibility, especially as it
was precisely through these methods that the
dictators to whom I have referred obtained
control over the mass thinking of their
peoples. Unless in a democratic society there

are enough citizens who take an interest in
public business and are critical and inquiring
in respect of the way in which they are
governed, there is always a possibility that
some great wave of mass hysteria may be
aroused; and then we may be in a very
difficult way indeed.
The proposal before us is to furnish the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, out of
the treasury of Canada, with practically
$30,000,000 over the next five years. This
money, of course, will come from the pockets
of the taxpayers. I assume that, as a licence
fee today is charged for the privilege of
having a radio, when television is established
licence fees will be charged to those who
have television sets. It is clear that the
revenues of the corporation wil be very
substantially increased by the appropriation
contained in the bill before us.
There are two other points I wish to
mention. I agree wholly with one of the
criticisms made by the leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig) and one or two others
who have addressed themselves to the same
matter: I have long felt that it is an anomaly
that the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation,
which itself is actively in the broadcasting
field, should supervise and direct private
broadcasting stations; and I am wholly in
favour of the idea that there should be a
board whose responsibility will be not
administrative, in the sense of arranging
broadcasting programs, but wholly supervisory, much like the present Board of Grain
Commissioners, which supervises laws relating to the grain trade.
While I hope that nothing I say will be
construed as a criticism of the board, I
believe that in these matters we have to
look below the surface. There is no question that power, whether exercised by a board
of governors of a broadcasting corporation,
by a government, or by business, is an
extremely dangerous thing. Less than a
century ago a great political philosopher
who was also a noted historian expressed
this principle in the saying, "AU power corrupts; and absolute power corrupts absolutely." If there is one lesson that stands
,out in the pages of recorded history it is
In my
the truth of that declaration.
approach to these -questions I try to test them
by some of the well-founded principles that
come to us as a result of the long and painful experiences of civilization in its onward
march.
There is another point which I wish to
discuss, and this is where I disagree with my
honourable friend the leader opposite (Hon.
Mr. Haig). I am opposed to the abolition of
the licence fee. The radio service which our

SENATE

people get is a service for which they should
pay a charge. Let us take, for example,
the Board of Grain Commissioners.
A
charge is made for inspecting and weighing
every bushel of grain that passes from the
farmer to the market in Canada or elsewhere. Why is that charge made? It is
because the inspecting and weighing of grain
is a legitimate service that the farmer gets.
In days when, I am bound to say, we did
not dispense money quite so freely as we do
now, this was felt to be a fair and legitimate
charge. I think this principle is fair and
sound. It is argued that you cannot collect
all the fees. Well, there may be difficulty
in collecting from some people, but the arm
of the law can be very long. What is needed
is a strict enforcement of the law and, the
awarding of sufficiently :stiff penalties to
make people realize that it is unsafe to have
a radio without a licence.
Hon.ourable senators, periodically the business of the C.B.C. comes under review by a
committee of the other place. That, as far
as it goes, is all to the good, but the tendency
before some parliamentary committees is to
try to score an advantage against someone
else. I sometimes think that some of the
committees set up by parliament are not as
objective in their approach to the iproblems
placed before them as they should be,
Before I resurne my seat, let me say that
it is rather unfortunate that we should have
to deal with this matter in such hurried
fashion.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I was much interested
in what the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) said about the
great power that is being placed in the
hands of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. I wonder if he could tell us how this
differs from the policy with regard to the
British Broadcasting Corporation.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I do not know that it
differs very greatly. I was in Great Britain
for a couple of months this summer, and I
often listened to their programs.
I am
bound to say that they usually appeared to
me to be of a higher quality than the programs we have here; but this very matter of
monopoly has received a good deal of criticism in the British press.
Hon. J. G. Fogo: Honourable senators, we
have listened to some excellent speeches on
the broad aspects of this legislation, but I
am going to address myself to one narrow
feature which has been mentioned at least
once in this chamber, for I think an inaccurate impression may have been created.
Earlier in the day, when the honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. Haig) chose the members
of the Senate as an example of what might

be termed "impartiality" in his remarks
about alleged partiality on the part of the
C.B.C., I was tempted to rise on a question
of privilege. On second though, however, I
decided that I ought to address myself
directly to the point.
I think the suggestion was made that the
C.B.C. has been used as an agency of government for political propaganda. I have been
in a peculiarly intimate position with reference to political broadcasting for some
twenty years, commencing at a time when
there was no such thing as the Canadian
Broadcasting Company or Corporation, and
neither before the institution of the C.B.C.
nor since has there been any evidence, within
my knowledge, of partiality on the part of
the board or the governors or the management in the presentation of what may be
termed political material; nor have I seen
any evidence that this government or its predecessor used this agency as a means of
promoting its political ends. If that suggestion was made it ought not to go uncorrected.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I interject here to
say that I never said that. I said propaganda,
but not political propaganda.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: I certainly misunderstood
the honourable leader opposite.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I never suggested that on
the part of any government. I said propaganda, but not political propaganda. I was
kicking about these university cranks.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: Perhaps the connection
misled me because reference was made to
the person or body which appointed honourable senators, who are expected to be impartial because they are appointed for life. I
think the suggestion was made that if we
were appointed for only ten years we might
be in fear of the end of our tenure and be
tempted to become partial.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Let me correct my honourable friend. I said that that was possible.
That is all.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: At least it was suggested,
and I thought it appropriate to make a
remark or two on the subject.
I have had occasion to complain to the
C.B.C. a number of times when I thought it
was accorcling too many privileges to parties
other than the one with which I happen to be
connected, but I learned later that the other
parties were making equally strong cormplaints about the privileges accorded by the
C.B.C. to my party. I was bound to conclude
in the end that the C.B.C. was holding a
balance, for everybody felt that he was not
getting an advantage but that the other fellow
was. So it is apparent that at least a middle
course was being followed.

DECEMBER 17, 1951
When I first came into contact with radio
broadcasting in this sense it was not a public
project, but a private project, and the system,
if I may call it that, of free time for political
broadcasting had not been introduced. That
came later, and I believe from my observation that it has been a good system, and that
it gives representatives of various political
groups, recognized as such in this country, an
opportunity to present their views in an
orderly fashion and to reach many people
who would not be reached either by the
printed word or by orators on the platform.
From what I have seen of the administration
of this free time political broadcasting, it is
my view that the C.B.C. officials and management have been eminently fair at all times to
all parties, and I think that all who have
been in the picture would agree with me.
One other statement to which I might make
reference was that no check is kept on what
is said over the radio. I think there is pretty
nearly as much check on what is said over
the radio as there is on what a man says on
the street or what he prints in his paper. The
check is in the law-the criminal law, the
civil law and perhaps, in certain instances,
the law of good taste. So in that respect
there is the same check on radio that there
is on all the other media of publicity. To
catch up with an audience who hear any
particular broadcast may be a little more
difficult than to catch up with people who
have read something in a newspaper. A
letter to the editor of a paper may be printed
and reach a certain number of people, and if
it contains a reflection on you that is not
libelous but that you wish to correct you may
be able to get the paper to publish at a later
date a retraction or a letter from you; but
what assurance have you that the people who
read the first letter will read yours? There
would be much the same kind of difficulty in
trying to correct a statement that has been
broadcast.
The complaints that have been made from
time to time, particularly by so-called private
stations, have not been that there are no
checks, but rather that the C.B.C. had exercised certain checks on them. I do not think
these checks have been felt to be very harsh
or drastic. In any event, every radio station,
privately or publicly owned, is still responsible for what it broadcasts, and if it puts out
anything contrary to the law there is a
remedy just the same as there is in the case
of any other medium.
The question of dual control has been
debated for at least four or five years in this
house, in the other bouse, in the newspapers,
over the air, by special committees of the
other house and finally by the Massey Commission. And, perhaps surprisingly enough94703-20

for dual control is superficially attractive-all
these committees and bodies, after hearing
evidence and studying the whole matter, have
come to the conclusion that the system
initiated in 1932 ought to be continued.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: In 1935.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: The original Act was passed
in 1932. The administrative body was given
a different name then, but the basic system
is substantially the same now as at the
beginning.
I am not sufficiently well informed ta
know all the reasons for this conclusion, but
I believe there are reasons, and that if this
bill goes to committee they can be stated
there. We are free to take our choice between
the British system, on the one hand, and the
American system on the other, and decide
which offers the ibetter model for this country.
In Britain, as I understand it, radio is completely under governnent control and is
administered by the British Broadcasting
Corporation. There are no private stations
at all. In the United States the broadcasting
is done entirely by private concerns, on a
commercial basis. In Canada we have a
combination of these two systems, part of our
broadcasting being done by the C.B.C. and the
remainder by privately owned stations.
Despite the complaints that one hears fram
time to time, I have not noticed that any of
the private stations have been suffering
financially from the regulations of the C.B.C.
In fact, they are doing rather well. I think
that if we probed into the matter we would
find that a very substantial part of their
revenue is derived from the C.B.C., and
through the agency of programs and adîvertising procured for them by the C.B.C.
Honourable
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck:
senators, I shall make but a few remarks.
I am urged to take that course of action by
the experience of my friend from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar). He began by saying that
his remarks would be short, whereupon he
was greeted with a round of applause, and
the only other applause accordedi to hin was
when he sat down. Yet, he is one of the most
attractive speakers on the floor of this house.
So, honourable sienators, I shall take the
lesson that was accorded to me in those
rounds of applause and endeavour to be
brief.
Let me say at the outset that this is a very
important measure, and one which should be
studied with care in this nouse and, in committee, although it is doubtful whether that
will be done under the present circumstances.
The bill proposes some broad amendments
to the Act. It provides that a grant of $30
million be paid to the C.B.C. over five years.
Also it provides for a longer tenure of office

law. The law has already been taken care of
by giving complete authority to the board to
exercise its judgment in the case of violation
of regulations.
One or two senators in the course of their
remarks referred to "cranks" on the air. Let
me remind the leader opposite, for one, that
it is the "cranks" that make the machine
go round. It is men with ideas that differ
from our own who provoke thought and
bring about progress. It seems to me that
when the C.B.C. is no longer a fit -subject for
criticism because we agree with everything
that comes over the air, it will then have
run its course and it will be time that it was
abolished. When criticism ends, thought stops.
When C.B.C. programs are restricted to those
which have universal appeal, they certainly
will be colourless and useless. I think it was
Tennyson who uttered words to the effect
that he is all fault who hath no fault at all.
Certainly that would apply to broadcasting.
As soon as anybody can feel sure that when
he turns on the radio he will hear only a
voice with which he agrees, the time for
turning on the radio will have gone by.
It is very difficult to know what should
g? on the air. It is not enough to keep within
the law; one must always keep within good
judgment and realize that he has a franchise
to the ears of the thinkers and listeners all
over Canada, and must give them, not necessarily that with which they agree, but certainly that which is not profane, or immoral;
which, to use the words of one of the speakers
this morning is not anti-social. But for goodness' sake, let us not put a ban on the cranks;
they are the ones who stir us into action.
Hon. L. M. Gouin: Honourable senators, I
have listened with great attention to the
remarks which have been made on this very
important bill. First of all, I wish to join in
the protests which have been made today by
my fellow senators from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) and Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) and, I believe, last week, by the
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), concerning the fact that these important measures
come to us by the truckload-so to speakat the very end of the session. I think that
this system, or absence of system, is one of
the factors which, sorry as I am to have to say
it, tend to discredit this house in the eyes of
the public. All of us are put in a humiliating
position when we have to stand up suddenly
and approach so momentous a question as,
for instance, the very nature of the rights cf
those who are interested in broadcasting, the
private stations and the state-owned radio.
Two suggestions have come to my mind
concerning the possibility of adopting some
procedure which would put us in a more
favourable position to do full justice to the
subject of these various government bills
94703-201

which reach us only in the dying hours of
the session. The honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity, whom I greatly esteem, has
made a suggestion which surely deserves consideration, that at the beginning of the session the Senate should take a fairly long
recess, and that at the end of the session we
should remain on watch, maintaining our
vigil as long as is necessary. However, in all
fairness to our colleagues who live at a great
distance from Ottawa, those who are neither
from the Queen City of Canada nor the
metropolis of Montreal, it must be remembered that they would be greatly handicapped
if ithey were obliged to come here for the
opening of the session and then return to
the west coast or the east coast or some other
distant place. Personally I am inclined to
think that what, under the very able leadership of our colleague from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar), we did concerning the budget
is the only practical solution. For instance,
if the subject-matter of Bill 17 had been
referred to the Finance Committee at any
appropriate date during the session, it would
have been possible for the members of that
committee, or others who wanted to attend its
meetings, to get a much better picture of the
subject than the one I myself have just now.
I am more or less like a lawyer who at the
very last moment is entrusted with a case and
has to plead it. So I make these remarks
fully realizing that I cannot do justice to this
very difficult subject.
On the vital question of the nature of the
rights of those who exploit private broadcasting stations, which we have just heard
discussed by the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity, may I first say that I am not
personally interested in any station, so that
I am able to express freely what my conscience requires me to say on the subject.
As an example of these private enterprises,
consider what I would call an historical
broadcasting station, CKAC Montreal. Let
there be no doubt about it that this station
and others like it enjoy the support and
sympathy of the French-speaking public. All
I know about the actual ownership of CKAC
is that according to my information, it is the
property of La Presse newspaper. I do not
argue that the owners have a legal vested
right in the channel used, but-and I say this
sincerely, and not merely in compliment to
our colleague, the honourable senator for
Repentigny (Hon. Mr. DuTremblay)-this
station has been giving exceedingly satisfactory service to our French-speaking public;
we regard it as a national institution, and it
is listened to with the greatest attention and
satisfaction by great numbers of working
people in such areas of Montreal as St. Henri,
my own native constituency of St. James, and
the northern part of the city. For these

SENATE
listeners it is literally a friendly voice. I believe
that this station enjoys more popularity than
any other; and I would suggest that it has
acquired at least some equitable rights on its
own wave length. So, although sometimes our
opinions differ, I do not for a moment assume
that the excellent governors of the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation would act like bandits-if that expression is permissible-or
would attempt to confiscate Station CKAC. I
contend that the users of that wave-length,
through their efforts over a long period of
time-longer than the thirty-year period allowed for prescription under our system of
law-have at least a moral right to their
property.
I had difficulty in following the argument
that the air belongs to the Canadian people.
The lands in Canada which have not
already been granted by various Crowns-in
the old days by the French Crown and later
the British Crown and today the Canadian
Crown-are the property of our people. The
air we breathe in Canada belongs to our
people and cannot be appropriated. The
airways also belong to our people, but from
time to time companies such as the TCA or
Colonial Airways may obtain flying rights
through definite air channels from Montreal,
say, to New York. The St. Lawrence river
belongs to the Canadian people, and
resembles the airways more than anything
else because it has an international aspect in
that our neighbours to the south have certain
rights on the river. The vessels of various
shipping companies serve our people on the
St. Lawrence, and sometimes those companies
obtain the equivalent of franchises.
Honourable senators, I think that a Senate
inquiry into this whole problem at some
future session would make a most interesting
and worth-while contribution to parliament.
Our colleague from New Westminster (Hon.
Mr. Reid) has made several references to
broadcasting problems, but in these final days
of the session he is unable to be here to take
part in the debate. Rightly or wrongly, I am
convinced that it is illogical to have one corporation sit as a judge and decide upon questions which affect not only its own interests
as a national broadcasting system but the
interests of its competitors.
Under this legislation there is a right of
appeal to the Exchequer Court in matters of
law, but in my opinion there would be very
few questions wholly of law. Generally
speaking, the questions would contain an
element of law and an element of fact. Let
us take for granted that the governors exercise their discretion in a fair way. This does
not mean that they cannot err, and of course
I think they would be the first to recognize
that they are not gifted with infallibility. If

at some future date we set up a committee to
study this problem, I would be anxious to
make full inquiries about this right of appeal,
and to make sure that the body responsible
for supervising broadcasting in Canada is set
up along the lines of the Board of Transport
Commissioners, as was mentioned by the
honourable senator from Cariboo (Hon. Mr.
Turgeon) this morning.
The honourable senator in his speech made
reference to the Massey Report and, the
cultural aspect of broadcasting. Our colleague
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) also touched
upon this subject. This is hardly the proper
time for me to make any prolonged statement about culture as dispensed by the C.B.C.
and by private stations, but I want to say that
we have a French program called RadioCollege, which is universally accepted by
French radio audiences as one of the outstanding contributions of the C.B.C. It is an
excellent program and I have never heard
any complaints about it. But educational
programs and federal grants to universities
do raise vital problems, because the whole
question of provincial rights in the fi'eld of
education becomes involved. I have been a
university professor since 1919, and during
those years have been teaching-either to my
credit or to my debitHon. Mr. Roebuck: To your credit, I would
say.
Hon. Mr. Gouin: -and if a committee were
set up I would try to freely express my
opinion about the cultural aspects of broadcasting.
At the present time I want to address my
remarks to certain programs to which strong
objection has been ýtaken. I do not like
censorship any more than anyone else, and
I particularly believe in freedom of speech.
Within reasonable limits I am in favour of
having all legitimate political parties express
their opinions. This is a good thing. The
senator from Carleton (Hon. Mr. Fogo) said
that the presentation of news of a political
character was very satisfactory. It is true
that complaints have been made f'rom time
to time by various parties. Perzonally I
think that neither the Progressive Conservative party nor the Liberal party often got too
much from the C.B.C. The broadcasts in
English that I have listened to expressed
views that generally were rather more to the
lef t than mine, and on the contrary the broadcasts in French were often more to the right
than I am. From this I imagine that I am
more or less in the centre field.
But even though we are in favour of freedom of speech, as we all are, we certainly
agree that there are limits to it. It was said
by the senator from Carleton (Hon. Mr. Fogo)
that a check is imposed on radio stations by
the criminal law, the civil law and the law

DECEMBER 17, 1951
of good taste. But some of the matters that
are broadicast are in a sort of no man's landi,
so to speak. A certain program which I found
absolutely shocking from a religious or moral
point of view does not come within the provisions of any d'efinite section of the Criminal
Code.
But since a great deal of the money needed
to sustain the state-owned broadcasting
system is paid by the taxpayers, surely they
have a right to expect from it a little more
toleration for their religious opinions in particular. Surely we cannot be blamed for
protesting if our money is used to broadcast
very objectionable remarks concerning what
is most sacred and most dear to our hearts.
I think we all agree that we live in a
Christian democracy. We have no right to
impose our own religious beliefs on other
people. I am sixty years old now, and during
political campaigns in the past people have
said very unpleasant things against me, but
I think no one ever taxed me with religious
fanaticism. I believe in religious freedom.
I belong to the Council for Christians and
Jews. I frankly admit that I may have made
errors in the past, but-to use a phrase which
Laurier frequently uttered-never knowingly
have I raised my small finger to stir up
religious or racial prejudice. I say we live
in a Christian democracy, but that does not
mean that we have no toleration for nonChristians-that my Jewish friends, for
instance, are to be persecuted for their
beliefs. During the war whenever I could do
anything for Jewish refugees who were
victims of Nazism, I did it with all my heart,
and the gratitude which these people have
shown to me will remain one of the great
satisfactions of my life.
Our fundamental principles in this country
are what I would call our Judaeo-Christian
morals, principles which go back to Moses and
the Old Testament. Certainly the Canadian
people would not willingly spend their money
to have these principles attacked. Radio
programs which I have occasionally heard
have shocked me. I do not claim that all
the programs in the series have been of the
same kind, but recently many people have
protested against programs which they
declared to be simply atheistic. Well, I do
not want to persecute atheists-as a matter
of fact, I rather pity them-but I do not think
they have acquired vested rights to the air,
or that they are entitled to a right to broadcast their opinions. There should be a
prohibition of broadcasts which directly or
indirectly tend to undermine the respect that
we all have for our democratic institutions.
I am not thinking only of the Senate when I
say that. Though I am quite accustomed to

abuse I am rather astonished that broadcasting facilities should be so generally put at the
disposition of people who make abusive
remarks. Of course, in the end these remarks
probably do not harm us so much as the
people who make them. Insults have never
constituted an argument.
Honourable senators, I repeat that we live
in a Christian democracy. We want our
children and our grandchildren also to live
in a Christian democracy, in a land of justice
and toleration. Therefore we are anxious
that our Christian and democratic institutions
be preserved, and we do not want to run the
risk of having them destroyed gradually by
those who grossly abuse freedom of speech.
The least we can expect from broadcasting
stations, in particular those of the C.B.C., is
that they be true and faithful guardians of
our Christian civilization and of the two
noble cultures which we have inherited from
France and Britain.
Some Hon. Senators: Question.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
before the debate is closed I wish to make one
remark. The senator from Prince (Hon. Mr.
Barbour) asked me if I could tell him in what
years the C.B.C. has had a surplus and in
what years a deficit. That is a very pertinent
question, and as I have not the information
here I would suggest that it would probably
be forthcoming in committee if my honourable
friend repeated his question there.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was:

NORTH FRASER HARBOUR
COMMISSIONERS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. Robertson moved the second reading of Bill 8, an Act to amend the North Fraser
Harbour Commissioners Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the amendments in this bill seek to do two things. One
is to increase the number of commissioners
from the present three to five, and the other
is to provide that the chairman and other commissioners may be paid, out of the revenue
of the corporation, such remuneration for
their services as the Governor in Coundil may
from time to time determine. The present Act
does not authorize payment of salaries to the
commissioners, although for quite a number of
years they have been receiving salaries out
of the comnission's income from harbour dues.

SENATE

Two of the commissioners have each been
paid $150 a month, and the chairman $200 a
month, plus $75 for expenses. Section 2 of
the bill authorizes the Governor in Council
to determine the amount of salaries to be
paid to the chairman and the other
commissioners.
At present two of the three commissioners
are appointedi by the Govern'or in Council;
the thirdi is appointed jointly by the three
municipalities, Vancouver, Burnaby and
Richmond. It is proposed that the number
of commissioners be increased to five-four
of whom will be appointedi by the Governor
in Council-so that there may be a widier
representation of interests on the commission
than at the present time.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was

senators, when shall the bill be read the
third time?
Hon. Mr. Haig: It need not be referred to
a committee.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I gave an undertaking
to the Law Clerk that these bils would all
go to committee, so that he could examine
them. I therefore move that this bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
NATIONAL

GALLERY BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. Norman P. Lambert moved second

reading of Bill 42, an Act respecting the
National Gallery of Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, I am very
pleased to say that this bill represents one
feature of the Massey Report which, as fiar
as I am concerned, is entirely acceptable. I
was also glad to note that the measure passed
through the other house almost unanimously.
The bill before us seeks to do four things,
niamely:
(1) to increase the number of members of
the Board of Trustees from five to nine
members;
(2) to provide that the board may enter into
contracts and may dispose -of property vested
in the board;
(3) to provide for a National Gallery
purchase account and a special operating
account, to meet the expenditures of the
board; and
(4) to make provision for the appointment
of necessary officers wid employees, in
accordance with the terms of the Civil
Service Act.
I may say that the setting up of a speci.al
operating account for the gallery is in keeping

with the procedure followed in relation with
the Federal District Commission, whereby
appropriations are made by parliament every
year to provide for the acquisition of
properties by the commission in connection
with the planning of the city and surrounding
district. The provision in this bill relating to
the National Gallery is similar in character.
One could say a good deal about the
National Art Gallery, but time forbidis. I
should like, however, to refer to the history
of the development of painting in this country
during the past hundred years, commencing
with the advent of the great Krieghoff
pictures and coming up to the present time.
There was gradual growth up until about
1913, but since that time there has been a
very pronounced development of a Canadian
type of art, which has served to identify us
as a people not only to ourselves but to
countries throughout the worldi. Painting is
the one artistic medium through which the
people of this country have been more
adequately interpreted to the people of other
lands than any other. The National Gallery,
which is the centre of this effort on the part
of Canada, should therefore receive our
earnest attention and sympathy.
I need only refer to the fiact that during the
recent war about 10,000 reproductions of
Canadian pictures were sent in the form of
silk screen prints to al parts of the world
where Canadian troops were stationed. These
prints represented, I think, the best of our
Canadian painters, and the wide distribution
did more than any other one thing in the
past fifty years to stimulate interest in and
an appetite for Canadian painting. One had
ample opportunity to judge that result in the
years following the war. I have observed
here in Ottawa that young men and young
women, when they returned fron overseas,
would spend a few days here on the way
home to other parts of Canada, and, would
visit the Art Gallery to see for the first time
the originals of many of the prints that
decorated their mess halls and common rooms
in various parts of the world.
I should like to refer particularly to something that was said a couple of years ago by
one of the founders of the School of Seven,
which has been an outstanding influence not
only in popularizing Canadian paintings
among ourselves, but in establishing a title
for Canadians abroad. Mr. Lawren Harris,
one of the outstanding leaders and founders
of that movement wheh it was organized in
1910, in an addiress to the Canadian Historical
Society, said this:
It is largely through the basic interplay between
our vast land and the response it inspires in our
hearts and minds that we shape our character and
outlook as a people.
Through the arts as an
expressive and creative instrument we are able to
bring our great environment into effective focus.

DECEMBER 17, 1951
I think that that expression adequately sets
forth the achievements that our Canadian
artists on canvas have made towards unifying this country and, as I said presenting it
as an entity more adequately than bas been
done through any other form of artistic
endeavour. We are making progress in other
arts, such as music, literature and architecture, but I think that the gifts of our
Canadian painters, more clearly than any
other agency, have given us a glimpse of
what we think of Canada when we try to
observe it as a whole.
A good deal bas been said about the services of the Art Gallery in establishing local
facilities and sending travelling exhibits of
pictures to the rest of Canada. These services
have been performed conscientiously and
well, within the limits of the facilities under
which the officials of the gallery have had to
work. All I want to say is that a great deal
of the interest which is manifested in Canada
today is due to the devoted efforts of our
pioneer artists themselves and the vast group,
almost numberless, and located in
-now
almost every centre of any size, to expressing
in paint and on canvass the aspirations of
Canada. Those artists deserve our thanks and
acknowledgments. In passing this bill to provide the Art Gallery here, in compliance with
the recommendations of the Massey Report,
with greater facilities for carrying this message from the ,artists of Canada to our people
as a whole and to countries abroad, we are
not only complimenting ourselves but rendering a service to the country as a whole now
and for the future.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Is there any proposal
to build an adequate art gallery at the
National Capital?
Hon. Mr. Lambert: I meant to refer to that.
There is in the bill no reference to the new
quarters which, I know my honourable friend
will agree, are badly needed if they are to
be commensurate with the representative
character of our artistic activities. But there
is a plan for a new gallery. The Greber plan
model, as anyone who bas looked at it will
know, bas marked on it a place for a new
gallery. It remains for the directors of the
gallery and the Federal District Commission
to agree upon the desirability of that site.
The site which is marked in the Greber plan
is immediately on the far side of the new
bridge. Elsewhere a suggestion bas been made
that the site should be at the foot of Elgin
street, in territory which would have to be
cleared. That question bas yet to be decided,
and therefore no reference to it is made in the
bill; but from what I know, I believe that
before very long steps will be taken to
establish new housing for the Art Gallery.

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: May I congratulate the honourable senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) on his presentation of
this bill. I do not know how far thé bill will
go in carrying us forward, but certainly it
can do no harm. I would like to express
my agreement with the statement of my
honourable friend about the importance of
the subject and the marvellous grip which
painting has taken upon the Canadian people,
inducing them not ony to admire the
works of others but to actually do something
themselves. This, I think has advantages.
I was speaking last Saturday to a teacher in
the Ottawa Technical School, and be told
me that in Ottawa the interest in painting is
so great that no less than two hundred and
fifty students are attending night classes to
learn to paint, and he rather feared that the
time would come when the wall space of the
city would be exhausted.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Are senatorial candidates included?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Oh, yes. Painting is
a lovely occupation; it is highly cultural
and provides great pleasure and adventure.
As a sport there is scarcely anything that
exceeds it in attractiveness, and anything we
can do to improve the culture of our country
in this field is our duty.
I am glad to see this bill; I think it bas
certain virtues; and I am quite sure that it
will pass.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not intend to continue
the discussion, but I was hoping that the distinguished senator frorn Thunder Bay (Hon.
Mr. Paterson) would say something. My city
is under great obligation to him for his
encouragement to the Art Gallery and to art
work in Winnipeg.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Norman M. Paterson: I had no intention of speaking on this bill, though I am
vitally interested in it, having worked very
closely in certain instances with Mr.
McCurrie, and having donated at least one
or two works of art here. Some years ago,
after visiting the continental galleries and
spending a winter in Bournemouth, I became
very much interested in pictures. Really, as
a hobby it is worse than fishing. When a
man comes along with pictures, even though
your walls are crowded with them, you start
stacking them in the cellar; you cannot resist
buying. It is an awful disease.
I want to pay tribute to our National
Gallery. After visiting the Tate Gallery, the
National Gallery and the Kensington Art
Gallery in London, I can say that we have

Honourable senators, I have nothing else
to say about this bill, and I would be willing
to have it given third reading at this time.
Hon. G. P. Burchill: Honourable senators, 1
agree with what has been said by the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig). I have
always been intrigued by the single transferable vote, and I think that it would
improve our electoral systern.
Honourable senators, I indeed regret that
it is deemed necessary or desirable to drop
the word "Dominion" from the title of this
Act. I suppose it is just a matter of sentiment,
and does not make any difference one way
or another; but in the face of present world
conditions I wonder if this is an appropriate
time to drop this appellation. I belong to a
class of people-perhaps it is too old a class,
but at any rate it is a class-who cherish what
they were taught when they went to school
concerning the origin of the word "Dominion".
When Canada was coming into being as a
nation that word was proposed by a Canadian statesman who belonged to my native
province-proposed by a Canadian, for Canadians-as the name of our country. The word
was chosen from a passage in one of the
Psalms:
He shall have dominion also from sea to sea ...

That sentence is inscribed over the main
door of this parliament building.
As I say, a liking for the name is perhaps
just a matter of sentiment. But today many
large industrial and commercial enterprises
which are part of the fabric of this country
have incorporated that word into their own
narnes, and are proud of it.
I want to place myself on record in this
chamber as regretting very much indeed that
it was felt necessary and desirable to drop
that ancient name to which we have all become so accustomed.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: Are you sure that because the word is being dropped it will disappear from use?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I am not sure of that.
I am sorry that the name is being dropped.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, I take the different view with regard
to "dominion," and am rather pleased to see

the disappearance of that word, ancient
though it is, in favour of the simple word
"Canada." The British North America Act
does not call Canada "The Dominion of
,Canada." It says that this country shall be
a dominion, called Canada. I like "Canada"
better than "Dominion", with its connotations.
So that feature of the bill does not offend me.
But there are two other points in addition
to what was referred to by the leader of the
opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), omissions from
the bill rather than contents. The bill may
be more important in what it leaves out than
in what it takes in. I agree with him fully,
as he knows, on this matter of the transferable vote, and I may tell him that the
recent election in the Province of Ontario to
which he referred this morning, might not
have gone quite the way Ltdid had the transferable vote been in effect. The election gave
to the party whidh succeeded only 48 per cent
of the total vote cast, but due to a division of
it slopponents, the government was returned
by a sweeping majority of members of the
House of Assembly. In constituency aîter constituency the successful candidate was elected
by la minority of voters, and I submit this is
an unhealthy thing. But the difficulty about
getting the transferable vote made part of
our electoral system is that governments like
to see their oppositions divided, and so hesitate to adopt the transferable vote. Of course
parties out of power favour it, but when they
get into office they look at the picture from
a different angle. I should like to see provision for the transferable vote in our Act,
and I suppose that will come in due season.
Another thing which I should like to see
at least considered when we are next dealing
with the Elections Act is a limitation such
as they have in England on election expenses.
Elections have been becoming more and more
expensive as years go by, and the outrageous
sums-I do not think that tern is an exaggeration-the outrageous sums which are
expended on elections in this country are in
fact a scandal. It is time that we adopted
the English method and made it illegal for
any candidate to spend more than a very
moderate amount. Such a rule would improve
the moral tone of our election campaigns and,
I think, might lead to greater purity in
governments after their election.
Another thing which I should like to see
considered, and which of course is not in
this bill, is some form of compulsory voting.
As things are at the moment, that party wins
which gets out its vote. In any close contest
the party which actually polls its favourable
vote will win over the side that bas not the
same efficiency in this respect. So elections
frequently turn not on the popularity of the

SENATE

candidate or of his cause, but on the effectiveness of his organization on election day, and
that effectiveness frequently depends on the
amount of money that he has to snend.
I think all politics would be better and
purer and nobler if our election law provided
for a compulsory form of voting, the transferable vote and a limitation on expenses of
candidates. Perhaps when we get into committee we might get the views of officials
as to how these changes could be carried
out. The bill no doubt is a good one, but
we have had very little time as yet to study
it. We need more time for the important
legislation that is going through our hands.
Hon. Gray Turgeon: Honourable senators,
I had not the faintest intention of speaking
on this particular bill, but because of some
suggestions that have just been made and of
the fact that the bill will be going to committee I do wish to say a few things. First
of all, I am deadly opposed to compulsory
voting, on principle. I am also opposed to
the alternative vote, on principle. I wish to
emphasize that the alternative vote is not
worth anything unless voting alternatively is
itself made compulsory. I -am against the
whole system of proportional representation.
I listened to the illustration given by the
leader of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), in
which he pictured candidate No. 5 as the
Communist Party candidate in an election
campaign. He said he would not vote for
No. 5, that that candidate would get the
smallest vote. But the supporters of No. 5
would be the first to get the right to vote
the second time; they could vote a second
time while the supporters of those who got
the most votes, but who did not get a majority, would not have the right to vote twice
at all. The only persons who would vote a
second or third time and have their vote
counted would be supporters of the candidate
who got fewer votes than the successful candidate did.
That general sort of system has been in
effect in Europe, and what do we find there
today? In the parliaments of France, Italy,
and other countries aligned with us in the
North Atlantic Treaty, representatives of
parties which received the smallest support
from the electorate are frequently in a position to prevent the carrying out of treaties
entered into by the governments of those
countries with their partners in the North
Atlantic Treaty organization. I suggest that
we should keep facts like that clearly in mind
when we are considering changing our
electoral laws as has been proposed today.
As to election expenses, I wish to call one
matter to the attention of the senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck). I remember that some years ago a question

similar to that which he bas just raised was
brought up in the other house. Judgment as
to the amount of expenses allowed was to be
based upon the number of voters in the
district. Perhaps in the area to which I refer
I was an interested party, for I happened to
represent the district of Cariboo, which extended from within ten minutes flying time
of the Vancouver airport to the Yukon and
the Northwest Territories. The number of
voters in that immense area was very small
compared with the number in any of the
several constituencies in the city of Vancouver. The amount of money suggested by
the committee of the other chamber was so
smal that a candidate in that large area
would be prohibited from spending enough
money to enable him to visit the people whom
he hoped would vote for him. That presents
a problem which we should keep in mind.
I am not objecting to a reduction of 'the
moneys spent on election costs, but in the
interests of the candidates who run in the
rural districts, particularly in the northwest,
where the voters are sparse, we should allow
an amount sufficient to carry on the election
campaign.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I move that this bill be referred to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
CIVIL SERVICE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson moved second
reading of Bill 43, an Act to amend the Civil
Service Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of these proposed amendments to the Civil
Service Act is to provide that the salaries of
the Civil Service Commissioners shall be set
by the Governor in Council, and that the
Governor in Council, on the advice of the
Prime Minister, may retain the services of a
commissioner beyond the age of 65 years.
The Civil Service Commissioners are, by
statute, given the rank and standing of deputy
ministers. The question of their continuation
in office beyond the age of 65 years and of
the determination of their salaries are not,
however, subject ta the same prolcedure
applicable by statute to deputy ministers,
namely, action by Governor in Council. As
a consequence, increases in compensation
granted to the Civil Service Commissioners
have been authorized by means of an item
in the estimates; similarly, to extend the

DECEMBER 17, 1951
chairman's term of office past the age of
sixty-five an item was also inserted in last
year's Appropriation Bill.
Objections to "legislation by appropriation"
have from time to time been voiced. It was
decided to set the matter straight this session,
and to make for the Civil Service Commissioners the same provisions regarding
extensions in office and salary changes as
apply in the case of deputy ministers.
Section 1 of the bill provides for the
extension of a commissioner in office beyond
the age limit of 65 years, for a period not
exceeding five years. This is the same as the
provision for deputy ministers, with the added
proviso that a commissioner's extension must
be on the recommendation of the Prime
Minister.
Section 2 of the bill provides the same
procedure for the adjustment of the salaries
of commissioners as is now provided for
deputy ministers. The salaries provided by

the Act as it stands are $10,000 for the
chairman, and $8,000 for the commissioners.
Their actual salaries since April 1, 1949, have,
under the Appropriation Act, been $12,000 and
$10,000 respectively.
These are the only changes the bill makes
in the Civil Service Act, which still preserves
in full the independence of the Civil Service
Commission and the freedom given it to
operate the merit system.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Which commissioner is
this measure aimed at?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: It applies to the Civil
Service Commission.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: But I suppose that one
af the commisisoners is approaching the
age of 65 years, and it seems desirable to
keep him on.
Hon. Mr. Haig: One is over 65 years.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Those over the age
limit are being kept on by order in council,
I presume.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Does this apply to the
chairman?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: He is a very good
chairman.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Robertson: I move, honourable
senators, that this bill be referred to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: Should this bill not
properly be sent to the Civil Service
Administration Committee?

Hon. Mr. Robertson: Strictly speaking,
my honourable friend is quite right, but by
reason of the late stage of the session, I
thought it would expedite matters if all legislation were referred to the one committee,
namely, the Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: Personally, I am
quite agreeable to that procedure. I simply
wished to inquire why it was not being referred to the Committee on Civil Service
Administration.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: By this means there
will be maximum consideration given to the
measure.
The motion was agreed to.
FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Salter A. Hayden moved the second
reading of Bill 25, an Act to provide for the
financial administration of the Government
of Canada, the audit of the Public. Accounts
and the financial control of Crown Corporations.
He said: Honourable senators, as the title
of this bill implies, the bill provides for the
financial administration of the Government of
Canada, for the audit of Public Accounts, and
for the financial control of Crown corporations. The substantial provisions of quite
a number of existing statutes have been consolidated in this bill. By reference to schedule E honourable senators will notice that
no less than seven existing statutes are included in whole or in part in the measure
now before us. I wish now to refer to only
two of them.
The Department of Finance and Treasury
Board Act is not wholly repealed, but the
sections which remain unincorporated are
those relating to the Royal Canadian Mint.
The only other of the seven statutes which
is not incorporated in its entirety in the bill
is the Government Companies Operation Act.
Certain sections of this Act are to be repealed
and, in substance, appear in the new bill.
Other sections, having to do with pension
rights, the status of a government agency, and
the right to sue and be sued are left outstanding. What may be their ultimate destiny
one can only guess, but I venture to say that
at a subsequent session of parliament some
separate enactment will be introduced to deal,
for instance, with the Royal Canadian Mint
and with powers contained in the Government Companies Operation Act which are
withheld from the consolidated bill before us.
It is not my intention, and I think honourable senators would prefer that I tell them
so right away, to go into any detailed explanation of the operations of the public account-

SENATE

ing system, or of the duties of the Minister
of Finance, the Auditor General, the Comptroller of the Treasury and other officials.
What I propose to do is simply to state in a
general way what the bill does, and then to
refer to some of the changes which differentiate this bill from the existing legislation.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: To what bill is the
honourable senator referring?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Bill 25. I believe copies
were distributed this morning.
In a general way this bill may be said to
have three functions, as enumerated in the
title. The first is to provide for the financial
administration of the Government of Canada.
For this purpose, certain sections of the
Department of Finance and Treasury Board
Act and the Consolidated Revenue and Audit
Act, 1931 have been gathered up and simplified and clarified, and in some instances
amended, and incorporated in this bill as
being the framework of the law and the
procedure which are to govern the financial
administration of the Government. The audit
of the public accounts, it will be noted, is
included in the title.
The second feature of Bill 25 is that it
provides for the operation of a central stores
account. Heretofore various departments of
government have maintained their own stores
accounts, and under a statute known as the
Department of Transport Stores Act, procedures and mechanism are provided for the
handling of stores in relation to the Department of Transport. What is being done under
the second phase of this bill is to repeal the
Department of Transport Stores Act, to gather
up the practice and procedure under that Act
to the extent that it serves as a good model,
and to provide the mechanism for a central
stores account. I shall have something to
say about that in a moment.
The third feature is to establish a more
uniform and comprehensive system for regulating the financial arrangements between
the government and its Crown corporations.
It will be recalled that, particularly during
the war years, a number of Crown companies
were set up at various times pursuant to the
provisions of the Department of Munitions
and Supply Act. UJnder the authority contained in that act, and by virtue of orders
in council passed from time to time, a company would be incorporated under Part I of
the Companies Act of Canada. The powers
in connection with the audit would usually
be provided for in the by-laws of that Crown
company, and the auditor would be named
under the provisions of the Companies Act.
In this bill a procedure is established to deal
with various classifications of these agencies
or Crown companies.

I think at this stage I should mention
schedules B. C. and D. which will be found
at the end of the bill.
Schedule B contains a list of the type of
Crown corporations defined in the new bill
as being departmental corporations. It
includes such bodies as the Agricultural
Prices Support Board, the Dominion Coal
Board, and the National Gallery of Canada.
The groups in schedule C are known as
agency corporations, which under the bill are
one form of Crown corporations. Among
them are such well known bodies as Canadian
Arsenals, Canadian Commercial Corporation,
and National Harbours Board.
The third group, comprised in schedule D,
are known as proprietary corporations. In
this list will be found such well known names
as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation,
Canadian Farm Loan Board, Polymer Corporation, and Trans-Canada Air Lines.
Let me illustrate the difference in terms
relative to these three groups of Crown corporations.
The agency corporation group, comprised
in schedule C, are required to submit operating
budgets as well as capital budgets. These
operating budgets, to be submitted annually,
require the approval of the appropriate minister and also of the Minister of Finance, but
they need not necessarily be laid before parliament.
So far as concerns the agency corporations
and the proprietary corporations, these are
types of bodies that are listed in schedules C
and D; for example, in C, Canadian Arsenals;
in D, Polymer Corporation. Both these types
of Crown corporations must submit annually
capital budgets, which require, in addition to
the approval of the appropriate minister and
the Minister of Finance, the sanction of the
Governor in Council.
In schedule B will be found the departmental type of Crown corporation, for example the Agricultural Prices Support Board. So
far as the audit is concerned, this type of body
is subject to the general audit provisions of the
bill.
I will now touch briefly on a few changes
contemplated in the bill. Under existing
legislation the Auditor General is required to
do a prepayment audit of accounts, and there
seems to have been some duplication there,
because the Comptroller of the Treasury has
an obligation to audit accounts before
payment is made. The Auditor General himself raised the question of whether, if on
information he then had he made some prejudgment of a particular account that was
before him, it might afterwards be thought
that his consideration of aldditional material
was prejudiced by reason of his having
studied the matter at an earlier stage. In the

DECEMBER 17, 1951

present bill the functions are divided, the
Comptroller of the Treasury taking on the
job of auditing and passing on the authority,
and so forth, before payment is made on an
account. The Auditor General's function is
then limited to auditing payments, and he is
thus relieved of the responsibility of doing
a prepayment audit, which he must do under
the present law.
Another change authorizes the Governor
in Council to delegate more of the powers
and duties of the Cabinet to the Treasury
Board. Here I would refer honourable senators to section 5, at page 3 of the bill, which
outlines the duties of the Treasury Board.
It provides that the Treasury Board shall act
as a committee of the King's Privy Council
for Canada in an advisory capacity. The
Treasury Board now acts in that capacity
in relation to certain matters, but additional
items brought under its advisory purview by
subsections (1) and (2) of section 5, include
such things as estimates, financial commitments, establishments, the terms and conditions of employment of persons in the public
service, and general administrative policy in
the public service. The idea behind this
amendment is to take some of the load off
the Governor in Council-in other words,
the Cabinet-so far as the accumulation of
routine work is concerned, and to pass this
work to the Treasury Board, which is really
a committee of the Cabinet. The Treasury
Board is to review the matter and then
make recommendations to the general body
of the cabinet, which will then deal with it.
Honourable senators will also observe that
under subsection (2) of section 5 the Governor in Council may authorize the Treasury
Board to exercise all or any of the powers,
other than the powers of appointment, of
the Governor in Council under the Civil
Service Act, the Civil Service Superannua
tion Act, the Defence Services Pension Act,
and 'parts II to VI of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police Act. These are .administrative functions. For instance, the parts referred to in the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police Act have to do with provisions dealing with pensions for constables and officers,
and matters of that kind. It would appear
to be a move in the right direction to relieve
the Cabinet as a whole from dealing with
the full load of routine responsibilities in
the first phase at any rate.
Section 7 of the bill increases the power of
the Treasury Board to make regulations. I
would illustrate this by referring to just one
item--paragraph (b) of section 7-where it is
provided that the Treasury Board may make
regulations respecting the keeping of records
of property of His Majesty. Heretofore the
various departments have been maintaining

records independently, and this provision
will enable the Treasury Board to set up a
uniform system of recording, which will
mean that the records will be more accessible and easier to understand, because they
will be correlated according to common
practice.
Section 17 of the bill provides that the
Minister of Finance may acquire securities.
This conforms to the present practice, and
naturally the authority to invest is limited
to securities of the Government of Canada.
Part V of the bill, which is new, provides
for the machinery for setting up a central
stores account. From time to time we have
been dealing with the question of revolving
funds. Some of these have been provided
for under special Acts of parliament, and
in ýthis case provision is made for the mechanism to handle the central accounting of stores.
The authority to set up a revolving fund, as
a result of which stores may be accumulated,
will still have to be provided by parliament
under certain Acts before the provisions in
Part V can start operating.
Another point I wish to mention seemed
to engage the attention of the committee of
the other place for some time, and led to
some of the amendments incorporated in the
bill now before us. It has to do with the
authority to delete uncollectable items from
the Public Accounts. As the bill was originally
drafted, the limit was set at $100, and the
uncollectable items were extinguished as
well as deleted. Under the legislation now
before the house, the Governor in Council,
on the recommendation of the Treasury Board
has power to delete from the public accounts
items up to $500 which have remained uncollectable for over five years, and those
accounts up to $1,000 which have remained
uncollectable for over ten years.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Are they to be noted by
the Auditor General?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: At the present time
they must be reported in the Public Accounts,
but if this bill is enacted they may be deleted.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: With no reporting of
them at all?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No, but the debits are
not extinguished, whereas the bill as originally
drafted provided for their extinguishment.
Section 27 of the bill bas to do with the
payment of guarantees. Where a guarantee
bas been given under the authority of
parliament by or on behalf of His Majesty
for the payment of any debt, the amount
required by the terms of the guarantee
may, subject to the act authorizing the
guarantee, be paid out of the Consolidated
Revenue Fund.

CANADIAN
NATIONAL
RAILWAYS
FINANCING AND GUARANTEE BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill 45, an Act to authorize
the provision of moneys to meet certain commitments for new equipment incurred by the
Canadian National Railways System during
the calendar year 1951, and to authorize the
guarantee by His Majesty of certain securities
to be issued by the Canadian National Railway Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
would provide authority for the financing of
railway equipment ordered in 1951. It may
be recalled that in the Financing and Guarantee Act passed at the end of last session
authority was granted to the railway company to incur commitments for the acquisition
of new equipment in the amount of $111,512,920. It is now anticipated that $55,581,816 worth of new equipment will be delivered
before next June 30, when next year's Financing and Guarantee Act can reasonably be
expected to have received Royal Assent. This
sum of roughly $551 million covers the cost
of 74 diesel units of various type and 6,415
cars of varying specifications.
May I point out just here that there is a
difference between authorizing commitments,
as we did last year, and authorizing payments
for them. Had the time taken to deliver
various equipment been as long as was
anticipated, the probability is that payment

Section 5 authorizes His Majesty in right of
Canada to guarantee any securities issued
under section 5. A general guarantee is signed
by the Minister of Finance: each bond of a
guaranteed issue is signed by an officer of
the Department of Finance designated in the
Order in Counril authorizing the issue. New
bonds issued for transfers or exchanges are
signed by an officer of the Montreal Agency
of the Bank of Canada designated by the
Minister of Finance. Section 6 allows the
Minister of Finance to make temporary loans,
limited to $55,581,816, to pay for equipment.
Section 7 gives authority to assist various
companies comprised in the National Railway
System.
Some of the equipment being
covered in this bill is for the Grand Trunk
Western Railroad.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I an not sure that I
heard all that the leader said. May I ask if
this sum which we are asked to vote now is
in addition to the amount we authorized last
session?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: No. Last session we
authorized the railway company to incur
commitments for the purchase of new equipment to the amount of approximately $111,500,000. It was expected that it would take
some years to secure the whole of this equipment, and that none of it would be delivered
before June 30 next, by which time the annual
Financing and Guarantee Act may be passed.
But for certain reasons-perhaps the urgent
need of the equipment, plus availability of
necessary steel-it is now expected that about
half of the equipment whose acquisition has
been authorized will be delivered before

June 30.

This bill does not authorize any

additional commitments; it simply provides
moneys to pay for some of the commitments
authorized last session.

PRAIRIE GRAIN PRODUCERS'
FINANCING BILL

INTERIM

SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bil 44, an Act to provide
for short-term credit to grain producers i
the Prairie Provinces to meet temporary
financial difficulties arising from inability to
complete harvesting operations or to make
delivery of grain.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
designed to provide short-term credit'to grain
producers in the Prairie Provinces to meet
temporary financial difficulties arising from
inability to complete harvesting operations
or to make delivery of grain. Titis credit will
be made through bank loans guaranteed by
the Crown.
There are, at the present time, certain grain
producers who, because of delayed uncompleted threshing, have been able to deliver
little or no grain this year, and there are also
some producers whose deliveries have been
restricted by lack of available storage space
in country elevators. The government feels
that a restricted problem does exist, and has
decided to make advances available through
the chartered banks to producers in these
circumstances.
Under the proposed plan, the banks will
operate under an arrangement simîlar to the
Farm Improvement Loans Act. They wil
make loans on their own account to farmers,
and the goverament will stand prepared to
meet losses Up to 25 per cent of the loans
made-that is, the government will pay a
bank a total amount not in excess of 25 per
cent of the aggregate principal amount of the
guaranteed loans made by that bank. This
guarantee is larger than under the Farm
Improvement Loans Act because the risks
are greater, and about the same as under
the Veterans Business and Professional Loans
Act. The banks will be able to caîl upon
the government to implement its guarantee
on October 1, 1952, after there has been an
opportunity for deliveries to be made from
the 1952 crop as well as the current crop.
The loans shouid, however, be fully repaid
out of the proceeds of the 1951 crop.
As the boans are intended only to provide
some cash for a limited period to those
farmers who have been unable to deliver

any significant volume of grain, it is proposed that the limit shail be $1,000 to any
one farmer. In making individual boans, the
banks will take into consideration the quantity of unthreshed or threshed grain, which
producers will have for delivery when their
threshing is completed or when elevator
space is available. In determining the amount
of individuai loans the banks will also take
into consideration deliveries which producers
have already made.
Within the maximum provided, the amount
of money which will be loaned in each
individual case will be determined by the
banks on the basis of their experience and
îudgment, and of course they will bear in
mind the considerable guarantee which is
being provided by the Government of Canada.
It is intended that these temporary loans shal
be repaid just as quickly as producers can
deliver their grain.
These boans, honourable senators, are flot
la any sense to be regarded as a form of
relief. They are interim advances made available at commercial rates of interest to producers who have grain stored on their farms
or who have crops which they have every
reason to believe will be harvested in due
course. It is hoped that the provisions of
this bibi will solve the financial difficulties of
those producers who have been unable to
harvest and market sufficient of their crops
to provide for their current living expenses.
The number of producers in that position is
growing smaller 'every day, but there are stili
certain areas where the credit to be made
available will relieve a situation that might
otherwise resuit in considerable hardship
during the coming winter.
Hon. W. M. Aselline: Honourable senators, I think I should say something about
titis measure which, la my opinion, is the
most important one we have considered today.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: This is your bill, is it
not?
Hon. Mr. Haig: He needs the money.
It furnîshes some
Hon. Mr. Aselline:
relief, at any rate, to the farmers of Western
Canada who have been unable on account of
adverse weather conditions to thresh and
market their crops. Ia fact, I rather think
that the minister must have read the speech
I made on November 20 last before he prepared this measure. Perhaps I will be pardoned if I read what I had to say at that
time about the plight of the western farmers,
and what should be done under the circumstances. At page 106 of the Officiai Report
of Debates I said this:

SENATE
The question is, how are these farmers going to
finance over the winter? What are we going to
do? A great deal has been said about this in the
other place, but very little in this chamber; and I
have nt
been able to find out what the government intends to do. In my opinion the problem
is the responsibility of not only municipal and
provincial authorities, but of the federal authorities as well. I believe that the banks would be
willing to lend money to the farmers if the credit
restrictions which were imposed last spring by
the Bank of Canada were removed or modified.
A man who has a good crop on his farm, in
swath r in the granary, should be able to borrow
from h s bank a reasonable amount of money
with which to carry on. I understand, however,
that the banks are prohibited from taking security
on grain before it is warehoused, so that such
loans as they might make would be only on the
security of the farmer's note, and possibly on
nothing more. I hope that the problem will be
solved, and that somehting will be done immediately.

The measure now before us is right along
the line of my thinking when I spoke on November 20 last. Its provisions have been quite
well explained by the honourable leader of
the chamber, but there are one or two points
which I should like to mention before second
reading takes place.
In my opinion the loans are so small that
no losses will result. In the first place, if a
farmer does not have $1,000 worth of grain,
he cannot get a loan for that amount; but if
he has $10,000 or $20,000 worth of grain, the
maximum loan is still $1,000.
If he has
already marketed grain to the value of $1,000,
he is prohibited from borrowing under this
arrangement. I am in that unfortunate position, because my grain was threshed some
time ago and I have already marketed more
than $1,000 worth.
This measure, while it may help some of
the smaller farmers, will not be of much
assistance to the bigger operators. Take, for
instance, the big farmer who has already
marketed at least $1,000 worth of grain. The
costs of threshing, harvesting and marketing
would have long since used up that amount
of money; but he is prohibited from enjoying
any benefits from this measure, and must
borrow from the banks in the ordinary way.
It seems to me that the bill should have
included in it the rate of interest at which
the banks would loan under this arrangement. My understanding is that the ,minister,
in his original drafting of the bill, incorporated the rate of interest, but that it was
eventually left out. Although the farmer
should not be asked to pay more than 5 per
cent interest on this money, I am quite sure
that in some cases the bank will require
6 per cent or perhaps even 7 per cent. The
farmer whose credit is exceptionally good
will get a loan at a lower rate than a farmer
whose credit is not as good. Se, as I say,
the loans will be made at from 5 per cent to
perhaps 7 per cent interest. I understand

that in the measure to come before us later
the interest rate is set out. It is my opinion
that that should have been done in this case.
In my remarks on November 20 last I
stated that the banks did not have the
power to lend money on this kind of security. Although, this measure does not amend
the Bank Act, it provides for special application of section 88 thereof to loans of this
kind. The bank will, therefore, be able to
accept as security grain standing in the field,
lying in the swath or threshed and in the
granary.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: May I ask the honourable senator if this type of loan will come
behind the other loans that the farmer may
already have made?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: No.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No. I will deal with
that next.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Such a loan is right out
in front.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: As honourable senators
know, we have a system of marketing grain
called the quota system. Before a farmer
can market any grain he must get a permit
book, in which shall be set out the description of the land that he owns and the
number of acres he has in various kinds of
crop. This statement must be sworn to when
application is made for the permit book.
Whenever the farmer markets a load of grain
he must have the book with him at the
elevator, and the elevator man marks down
the number of bushels and the date of
delivery. Suppose a farmer wants a loan of,
we will say, $1,000. He takes his permit
book to the bank; the banker examines it,
and if none of the farmer's grain is marketed
the advance is made and the book is stamped
to show the date and amount of the advance.
When the farmer's grain is offered for sale,
this statement stares the elevator agent in
the face, and a ticket for the grain is made
out to the bank. Consequently the grain
cannot be used for any other loan than the
advance which, under this bill, is made by
the bank. That condition continues until the
loan is entirely paid, at which time the bank
cancels the memorandum in the permit book
and the farmer continues to market his grain
in the usual way, and with the money
received for it he can pay off any other debts
which he may have outstanding. Of course
his borrowing powers are not confined to the
amount te which he is restricted in respect
of this bill: if he has other security he can
borrow from the same bank, or elsewhere.
Honourable senators will gather from this
brief statement that the bank is in a highly
preferred position; and unless there is fraud

DECEMBER 17, 1951
of some kind, or the unthresbed crop is a
complete loss, or is washed away in the
spring by freshets before it can be threshed,
the bank does not; stand to lose anything.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Neither does the government-very mucb.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: So that if the bank does
not lose anything the government will not
have to advance any money under this bill.
[t seems to me that every precaution possible
under the circumstances has been taken.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: When the honourable
senator spoke on this matter on November
2Oth, did he mention what interest rates
should be charged?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: No, I did not, because
I had not worked out a concrete plan. It
had not -occurred to me at that time that the
government would guarantee the banks. Al
I then anticipated was that the government
mîght make some amendment to enable the
banks to take security unýder the sections 1
mentioned.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: Were borrowers actually
charged as much as 6 per cent?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I do not think that even
6 per cent is the maximum. I noticed in
reading the debates in the other bouse that
the minister thougbt the prevailing rate would
be more like 5j per cent. Wbether or flot
that will be the case I cannot say. When I
spoke previously on thîs matter I referred to
the credit restrictions applied by the Bank of
Canada as preventing the making of new
loans, and 1 thought that if tbose restrictions
were removed and the banks were allowed
to take security under Section 88 of the Bank
Act there might not be any need for a
guarantee. However, this bill goes further
than anytbing I had in mind at the time.
That is why I did not; mention any interest
rate.
Also there is an additionah safeguard.
Hlon. Mr. Hayden: Under section 10.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It will be observed that,
unýder section 10 of the bull, notice of every
loan is made to the Canadian Wheat Board,
and the board is required to pay to the
minister any moneys that corne into their
bands for the farmer who bas borrowed the
money. That provision would cover Wheat
Board payments made under producers'
certificates which are made after the initial
payment and before the farmer receives the
full amount of his returns for bis wbeat for
tbe wbole crop year. Another restriction is
to this effect, that no bank can make a boan
and receive the protection of this bill if the
loan is made after June 30th of next year.

Yet another protection is that the total
amount of guaranteed loans must flot exceed
$20,000,000: banks may, of course, continue
loaning indefinitely, but must do so at their
own risk. To be honest, the bill goes further
and is a better bill than I expected it would
be when I made my remarks on November
2Oth.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: A good government.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I give the minister al
credit.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: May I ask the leader
of the government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) for
an explanation of the term, "total amount"?
Do I understand that if one hundred loans
of $1,000 apiece are made, which would be
$100,000, and fifteen boans, amountîng to
$15,000, are not repaid, the government wil
pay the whole shot? It is the sum total of
the $15,000, not 25 per cent of eacb boan,
that will be paid?
Han. Mr. Robertson: That is so.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: Then the bank canflot possibby lose.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Nobody will lose.
Everybody is happy.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: I noticed that this bull
states expressly that it is to aýpply "to grain
producers in the prairie provinces". Does it
apply also to the wheat producers of the
Peace River District of British Columbia?
In that area wheat constitutes 90 per cent
of the whole production. The farmers operate
under exactly the same conditions as the
farmers of the Prairie Provinces, though they
are not in the area which. is ordinarily called
the Prairie Provinces. I should like to knoxv
whetber these provisions apply to them.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: That would be an
excellent question for the committee. 1 would
think the intention is that it should apply
to any producer who sýuffers from theinclemency of the weather.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: It reminds one -of the
Old Age Pension Act, which requires you to,
have resided in Canada for twenty years.

not concerned about that: what appears there

that this is no time for a discussion on this

Honourable senators, the preamble to the

Crown . . .

I shall not read the whole of the preamble,

after a day therein appointed, not being more than
six months after the passing of this Act, the provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick shall
form and be one dominion under the name of
Canada; and on and after that day those three
provinces shall form and be one dominion under
that name accordingly.

few years ago about the dictionary meaning
of the word "Dominion", and the word was
defined quite differently in the various dictionaries. The word "dominion" connotes
a power, a sovereignty, and yet under the
Statute of Westminster we have the same
powers and authority as has England, and
the Commonwealth of Australia.
So I say to my friend from Northumberland: "I share your sentiments, I too am
proud of the word 'Dominion'." It symbolizes
our birth as a nation. Canada has acquired
maturity and today is an equal partner with
its sister dominions in the British Commonwealth of Nations. We are proud of Canada
and we are proud of the name "The Dominion
of Canada."
Hon. L. M. Gouin: Honourable senators, in
view of what has just been said by the
senator from Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte)
and what was said yesterday by our colleague from Northumberland (Hon. Mr. Burchili), I consider it my duty to make a few
remarks. The senator from Ponteix, who is
well aware of my very deep friendship for
him, is proud of the word "Dominion". He
considers that it has no connotation of dependency or subordination. He referred to section 3 of the British North America Act,
where, as I freely admit, we find the word
"Dominion". He referred also to the Statute
of Westminster, 1931, where again the word

So that what was created at that time was

and when you say "Canada" today you are
in effect saying the Dominion of Canada.
It means the same thing. Canada is my
country, and it is still the Dominion of

-exercise their joint authority. In French
the word "dominion" was translated by
"puissance".
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: But that is not a correct translation.
Hon. Mr. Gouin: That is the translation
which was adopted at that time, and I am
sure my honourable friend from Ponteix does
not consider it as being accurate.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: Will my honourable
friend allow me to say a word? It is true that
no French word has been correctly used as a
definition for "dominion". "Dominion" is a
French word and is used by the French
Academy today. My friend knows Siegfrid.
Would he disagree with his translation?
Would he disagree with his own brother-inlaw who uses the word "dominion". I repeat,
there is no translation for it.
Hon. Mr. Gouin: I am sorry, but my honourable friend and I are talking of two different things. I repeat emphatically that the
word "puissance", as the translation for the
dominion in our French texts is absolutely
erroneous. The word "dominion" -cannot
possibly be translated. What I say is that in
1867, willingly or by inadvertence-we shall
never know what exactly took place-the
word "puissance" began to be used in Canada
as the translation for "dominion". Surely
nobody has ever pretended that the so-called
Dominion in 1867 was really "puissance" or

has marched on to the point of sovereignty,
of independence as an equal member within
the commonwealth, a member enjoying a full
equality of status-although not of stature,
as I know very well-with even the United
Kingdom.
While listening to remarks of my honourable friend from Ponteix and also to those
which were made yesterday by my honourable friend from Northumberland, I was
hearing in my mind those words "Canada
marches on." In that march some of our
Canadians have been gloriously in the vanguard-men like Macdonald, Cartier, Laurier,
Borden and King and, 'today Mr. St. Laurent.
Others were in -the rear-guard, and have
always tried to prevent Canada from affirming her sovereignty and her independence.
In 1867 Macdonald and Cartier wanted to
adopt the expression "Kingdom of Canada",
which would have been an excellent
expression-

SENATE

on the battlefields of France and Belgium. As
a result of her contribution to victory, Canada, through Premier Borden, in 1919 signed
at Versailles the Treaty and the Covenant of
the League of Nations. Canada in her own
name became a member of the League.
Canada was then still called a "dominion",
but the meaning of that word had radically
changed. Only foreigners would still call
Canada a colony, and we would resent it
deeply. Canada has marched on; she has
acquired an international status.
Canada continued to march forward under
the leadership of the late Mr. King. She
opened ber first legations abroad, in spite of
those who did not believe that such a step
was compatible with the status of a dominion.
By the Statute of Westminster, 1931, the
Dominions have been recognized as equal
members of the Commonwealth with Great
Britain. With such an equality of status, our
Dominion has so much grown and evolved
since 1867 that it is no longer a "dominion"
within the meaning first given to that term.
Canada, as you know, continued to march on
during the days between the two wars, and
in particular during the period when the dark
clouds of the second world conflict began to
approach ahd to roll over our heads. Canada,
represented by Mr. King, the United States,
represented by Mr. Roosevelt, agreed to form
a permanent joint defence board, in spite,
again, of those who contended that such a
step was incompatible with our status as a
Dominion.
1939! Poland is attacked! Canada marches on!
Canada, as a free and independent nation,
declares war in her own name against the
German aggressor. 1940! Canada marches on,
for a while as the main ally of Great Britain,
and as one of the few allies surviving of
those who had entered the conflict. 1941!
Pearl Harbour! And Canada marches on
again, this time declaring war against the
Japanese aggressor, even before Great
Britain. Certainly Canada has marched on:
the so-called Dominion of 1867 had no right
either to make a treaty or to declare war in
her own name. During the last conflict, as
you know, one million men and women
entered our armed forces. Overseas, and on
our shoulder badges, there was only one
word, "Canada". Canada marched on in
Normandy, in Asia, in Africa, in Italy, France,
Belgium, Holland and Germany. All of those
who served overseas felt proud of being Canadians-just Canadians.
A few years ago, by our Canadian Citizenship Act, we became legally entitled to use
the word "Canadian citizens"-again in spite
of those who attempted to slow down the

process of emancipation and the march of
Canada towards fuller sovereignty and independence.
Canada marches on! And as
Canadian citizens since 1945 we have been
called upon to make ever greater sacrifices
to contain and to prevent aggression. We
shall continue, probably for many years, to
be asked to shoulder the always heavier burden of national defence.
But, Canada marches on. Such sacrifices
will be accepted courageously by ail Canadians worthy of that name, if such sacrifices
are asked of them in the name of Canadaonly in the name of Canada.
Yes, Canada still marches on; and we
consider ourselves Canadians, only Canadians,
not "Dominionees" or anything of the kind.
Our country does not need any other name
than Canada, only Canada, and we cannot
regard ourselves as being dominated by any
other power, whatever its name. The word
"dominion" is for me a thing of the past. Let
the dead bury their dead.
Yes, indeed, Canada marches on-always
forward. So let us march together straight
ahead, towards ever greater freedom towards
fuller independence. Canada marches on, a
free and sovereign country.

AGRICULTURAL

PRODUCTS
BILL

BOARD

SECOND READINGS

Hon. Wishar McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill 18, an Act to provide
for the establishment of an Agricultural
Products Board.
He said: Honourable senators will recal
that during the war three boards were set
up to handle the sale from government to
government of food products.
The Meat
Board was set up to administer the agreements between Canada and Britain for sale
and delivery of meat products, the Dairy
Products Board to administer similar agreements for sale and delivery of cheese, and
the Special Products Board to administer
agreements for the sale and delivery of
other agricultural products. These agreements
were entered into and boards established
under the War Measures Act.
Following the war, in 1947, an Act cited
as The Agricultural Products Act was passed
providing authority to continue the boards,
with similar powers, through the transition
period.
This legislation was re-enacted
annually until March 31, 1951, when it was
allowed to expire. The terms of these
measures, which required the authority provided under the War Measures Act or the
Emergency Transitional Powers Act of 1945,
gave to the boards, in periods of war or
emergency, powers which in ordinary times
could not be conferred by this parliament.
These powers had to do mostly with cornpulsory delivery. It is not intended to confer
such powers upon the board being set up
by the terms of the bill which is before us.
This bill will set up one board, composed
of persons employed in the different branches
of the departments concerned with the purchase and sale of farm products. The board

SENATE
will have no authority to compel delivery
of a product produced on the farms of
Canada. It will only receive the product
when the price offered in a competitive
market results in its delivery.
The boards set up under the Agricultural
Products Act of 1947 served as agencies for
the Agricultural Prices Support Board in the
purchase and sale of commodities under price

rescinded it was necessary to set up a
legally-constituted authority to undertake
this service.
When it was decided to purchase butter, in
order to make it possible to try and stabilize
the price of that commodity it was found
necessary to set up a legally-constituted
authority to undertake this service.
We have been approached from time to
time by other governments to provide an
agency to enable them to purchase certain
farm products in Canada. If it were decided
by the government to perform this service,
it would be necessary to have a legallyconstituted board. Under the Emergency
Powers Act, the government, by Order in
Council 3415, set up such a board. It was
considered that such a board was necessary
for the proper administration of the policies
of the department, apart from any emergency which might exist; therefore it was
thought proper to have special legislation
setting up such a board. This board will
have power to buy and sell agricultural
products whenever an order in council is
passed authorizing the minister to instruct
it to do so.
There are many details of the proposed
operations of this legislation with which I am
not familiar; but as I have been specifically
asked how this legislation will affect the
butter situation, which is the immediate purpose for setting up the board, in reply I
would read parts of the following release
from the recent federal-provincial agricultural conference. This has to do, of course,
with possible applications under the price
support program. I quote:
In April, 1951, authority was granted the Agricultural Prices Support Board to offer to purchase
butter from May 1, 1951, to April 30, 1953, on a basis
of 58 cents per pound delivered Montreal. This was
an increase of five cents per pound over the previous year and represented the first time that any
program under the Agricultural Prices Support Act
had been announced in advance for a period of two
years. There bas been no butter offered under this
program to date.

And further on:
In August the government placed all imports of
butter under permit and provided that the Agricultural Products Board would be the sole importer
with authority to import such quantities as would
be necessary to stabilize butter prices and meet
Canadian domestic requirements. At the same time

authority was provided for the purchase of quantities of Canadian butter on the basis of 63 cents
per pound delivered Montreal. Under this program
there bas been a firm purchase of 10 million pounds
of imported butter, of which approximately 8,500,000
pounds have been delivered with the balance due
for arrival early in the new year. In addition an
option has been secured on an additional 5 million
pounds which can be imported if required.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the honourable leader a question? Subsection (3) of
section 4 provides:
. . . the Board shall not sell an agricultural product
pursuant to paragraph (a) or (c) of subsection (1)
at a price lower than the purchase price thereof
plus handling, storage and transportation costs.

If they get into that position what do they
do with these products?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Let them rot.
Hon. Mr. Robertson The subsection starts
out as follows:
Except with the approval of the
Council, the Board shall not . . .

Governor

in

The only explanation I can make is that
under these circumstances the board would
have to endeavour to have the Governor in
Council do otherwise.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I do not wish to make any extended remarks.
This bill appears to me to do the very
opposite of a measure that we have been
discussing a good deal lately, and one that
I think we shall have to discuss a good deal
more in the next few days. This bill sets
a priceHon. Mr. Hayden: A minimum price.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, it happens to be a
minimum price' that this bill authorizes. The
situation with respect to the Wheat Board
is even worse. A farmer cannot sell to
anybody but that board. It does seem
strange to me that parliament should pass an
Act making it illegal for anyone to sell
butter below 63 cents. The government does
not want the consumer to be able to get
even a nip of butter unless he pays at least
63 cents a pound. My honourable friend
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck)
-asked a question that I was going to ask.
In fact, I think I rose first, but the Honourable the Acting Speaker was looking at my
friend.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Both of you being so
good looking, His Honour could not easily
distinguish between you.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, I say to His Honour
that I think he used good judgment in recognizing my friend from Toronto-Trinity. As
I say, the question that my honourable
friend asked was one that I had in mind. I

arn sure, though, that hie will not be fiattered
ta know that we were tbinking along the
same line.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I arn deeply flattered.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I was gaing ta ask wbat
would bappen if the governiment gat a lot of
butter an hand and could nat seil it. 0f
course, the answer is obviaus. The gavernment would have ta "take a beating." It
would bave ta pass an Order in Council
authorizing sale a! the butter at whatever
price cauld be obtained for it on the market.
After ail, butter can only be held for a certain lengtb of time. After that the quality
deteriorates, and I for one would nat want
it. Tbe peculiar tbing about this bill is that
it wauld make it impossible for a farmer ta
seli bis butter at 50 cents, even if hie wîshed
ta do so. He would find bimself confronted
witb the fixed price.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Why not describe this
bill as the "Agricultural products price
maintenance bill"?
Hon. Mr. Haig: That would be a good title,
because that is just what it amnounts ta. In
a day or twa we shaîl bave before us a bill
aimed at making it illegal for a manufacturer
ta fix a retail price for the sale o! his gaods.
As a Canadian fram the Western provinces,
where we depend iargeiy on tbe products o!
agriculture, I know tbat aur farmers would
be glad ta bave a fixed price for their praducts. In the spring tbe farmer saws bis
grain, and the tbing that worries hlm is
wbether bie wiil really ever barvest a crop
at ail, and, if sa, whetber the price will be
bigh enougb ta pay hlm for bis labour and
operating costs. In this bouse we sometimes
hear of the gamble that is taken by a man in
business wbo purchases stock or orders bis
factory ta produce a certain quantity of
goods. But that is natbing to tbe gamble
that tbe farmer takes. Out in aur province
-and 1 presumne tbe farmer in every other
province takes just as big a gamble. He risks
ail bis year's activities on the one crop, and if
it cannot be harvested, or if after being
harvested it cannat be sold, hie loses everything. Tbat bas been the prablem. faced
by the farmers as far back as I can remiember,
wben I was a boy of six or seven.
Tbe man who produces bogs or cattie bas
the same kind of prablem. Wben a cal! is
dropped in the spring bie has to decide
whetber it will be warth wblle ta raise tbe
animal in the hope a! selhng it at a profit
wben it is two or tbree years aid. He gambies on getting back at that time tbe cost o!
maintaining the animal. That kind of thing
bas always been a bugbear ta ahl farmers,

and I can understand why they wouid favour
the establishment of minimum prices for
their products. As Canadians we believe
that the worid market for everything should
be free and open, but this legisiation illustrates a fact that fundamentally we ail know
niamely, that farmers need some stability of
prices for their products.
I amrn ot opposing the bill. I realize that
we must have something like this in order
to support the farming community in our
dominion. I hope my bonourable friend
from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Gouin) wil
pardon my use of that word. I mean ta indicate the country as a whole, as distinct from.
the provinces; but so as not to hurt bis feelings I will say "in our Canada."
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It does not sound right.
Hon. Mr. Haig: We were brought up in too
early a schoal. I will put it this way: "in
aur country." Everybody in our country
wants ta support the primary praducer and
give bim a chance to obtain a reasonable
return for the labour and capital that hie
puts into bis products.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: May 1 ask the honourable gentleman a question? If the Wheat
Board sells wheat at the same price ta al
miliers-ta Ogilvie, Lake of the Woods, and
Robin Hoad-all of them will have ta sel
t-heir flour at the same price. If tbey do, will
they then be guilty of a offence?
Hon. Mr. Haig: The senator fromn Thunder
Bay fiatters me by asking for a legal opinion
on that point. I should say that if the committee on combines could go ta work on that
matter they would conclude that quite a combine existed there. The Wheat Board compels millers ta seil their wheat at the one
price. True, tbey are not obliged to do that
by law, but any miller who raised bis price
above that of the others would flot be able
ta seli his flour. I think this legisiation is
alright for farmers. What I have ta say
about the bill which would prohibit manufacturers fromn maintaining retail prices, I
shahl reserve tili that bill cames before us.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, tbis bill bas just reacbed us, and I do
not know anything about it beyond wbat was
stated by the leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson).
I do flot know that I bave a settled opinion
an it, but I view it witb considerable daubt.
It is proposed ta give ta the governrnent
power ta engage in tbe buying and seuling o!
agricultural. products. At first blusb that daes
not seemn ta me a praper functian of gavernment. It is s0 different frorn the kind of
civilization inta wbicb 1 was born, wbere
private individuals carried an the business of

SENATE
buying and selling, and governments were
expected to be a judicial authority holding
the balance fair and even between all parties.
But today we find the government engaged
in the business of buying and selling.
The leader of the opposition speaks about
the hazards taken by grain growers. It is, of
course, a risk that has been taken from time
immemorial. When the first man planted the
first seed he was filled with anxiety as to
whether it would grow or be destroyed by
excessive heat or cold, wind or rain. In fact,
farmers have always gambled on whether
they will get a crop. There has always been
an element of chance in farming, and there
is today. My friend has stated that the desire
of the farmer is to shift responsibilty in the
speculation to the shoulders of the rest of the
people.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Right.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The element of chance
will not be minimized by the fact that he
who plants does not bear the full responsibility for the success or failure of the operation, but shifts it to somebody engaged in
some other occupation. What is required in
this matter is not a socialistic status, but
rather an insurance policy, which should be
part of the costs of carrying on the business
of agriculture.
When this bill is considered in committee
it will be explained in more detail, and
perhaps I will learn more about it than I
know now. But my first impression of it is
unfavourable.
I understand that there is now on hand
some 10 million pounds of butter, bought by
the public of Canada-a purely socialistic
move-with 8 million pounds delivered. In
addition, we have on option some 5 million
pounds. Perhaps such a system will serve
some public purpose, but the final result may
not be a happy one. I am satisfied that
continued operations of this kind by government agencies will not lead us in the direction that we desire to go, but in all probability will end in disaster.
Hon. G. H. Barbour: Honourable senators,
I should like to say a few words about this
bill. In the first place, I am in favour of it,
and I only wish I could say as much for the
bill on combines that is to the front in
another place. I do not think the operation
of this measure will be a drain on the people
of Canada, other than the farmers, who
react very quickly to losses. When the price
of eggs, for instance, goes down, and eggs
become unprofitable, the farmer stops feeding his hens enough to produce the quantity
of eggs they would produce if they were
well fed, and he raises fewer chickens. The

result is that within a year or two the public
is paying a higher price for eggs. The same
is true of butter.
Another problem facing the citizens of
Canada today, and one which will become
more acute, is the shortage of milk. Dairy
farming is a seven-day-a-week business.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Why not have the government set up a public dairy to milk the
cows?
Hon. Mr. Barbour: If the dairy farmer
worked on a fourty-four or a forty-hour
week, milk would probably cost twice as
much as it does now.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: The growing of potatoes is the chief cash crop of the farmers in
Prince Edward Island, and I will tell you
how price support legislation helped them
in the last two or three years. The honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) some time ago made a comparison
of the income taxes paid in the various provinces, and referred particularly to the small
number of tax payers among the potato
growers of Prince Edward Island. In 1949
and 1950 the price of our potatoes, including
perhaps the best class of certified seed potatoes in the worldHon. Mr. Grani: Hear. hear.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: -was
only 68 cents
a bushel. Last October the board set the
price at 90 cents a bushel, and shortly afterwards it was increased to $1.10. The market
then ran away, and advanced to $2 a bushel.
You see, honourable senators, potatoes which
for two years were sold at an average price
of 68 cents a bushel-and some were sold
as low as 45 cents-are today going at $2
a bushel. The farmers decided that potato
growing was unprofitable, and they reduced
their acreage; also, the poor growing conditions in the summer resulted in lighter crops.
For my part, I think we would be better off
if we had an average price. I know that
the price cannot be completely controlled,
but if the farmer got, say, $1 a bushel for
his potatoes year in and year out, he would
be better off, and no hardship would be
inflicted on the people who live in the city.
This measure may help the production of
butter. If the price is stabilized at around
63 cents a pound, we probably will not have
to buy so much from foreign countries.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Mr. Speaker, I have
not had an opportunity to scrutinize this
bill very closely, but it is quite apparent
to me that it represents another long step
down the socialist road-

DECEMBER 18, 1951

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: -a direction in which
we have now been travelling for several
years.
Let us look at the definition of agricultural
products, under section 2 of the bill. From
a hasty glance, it would seem to embrace
everything that could possibly be described
as an agricultural product; but if anything
has been overlookedHon. Mr. Aseltine: Wheat?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: -the Governor in Coundil
on the advice of the minister may designate
it an agricultural product.
We come then to section 4, to which I
would like to direct for a moment the attention of the house. This section contains the
powers assigned to the board; and from very
long experience I have found it wise to take
a good close look at powers given in legislation presented to this house. If the provisions
of the section mean anything, this section
opens the door to state trading in all these
agricultural products. I can recall the time,
not very many years ago, when our socialist
friends, known as the C.C.F. party, had as
the main principle of their program state
trading in agricultural and all other products.
To this principle there was much opposition.
We who call ourselves Liberals opposed it
because Liberalism, if it means anything,
stands for the freedom of the individual. Our
Conservative friends also were opposed to it.
The C.C.F. fought election after election on
that issue and never once came within
reasonable distance of achieving office.
Now we have in this bill, which is
intended to be a permanent measure, the setting up of a state authority for the purposes
of state trading. Sometimes I wonder whether
we have all become socialists; whether the
C.C.F. party, having had its policies rejected
by the people, is by methods of this sort
ensuring their adoption. This is a very grave
question, because to my mind what is
involved is a serious principle of policy. The
board is empowered to sell or deliver agricultural products of any kind, under agreements made with other governments or, I
assume, with private traders. It can purchase
and negotiate contracts for the purchase of
agricultural products. I suppose this means
that if the government in its wisdom considers that the price of some agricultural
product in Canada is reaching too high a
level, it can check the movement by entrusting this board with the responsibility of
importing commodities to check the rise in
prices. If it does not mean that, I do not
know what it means. For instance, if the
94703-21j

price of butter were to rise to an unreasonable level, the board could, in pursuit of a
policy euphoniously described as "stabilizing
the market", buy butter from New Zealand
or Australia. The same course could be
adopted in respect of eggs or any of a number
of other products which are mentioned in this
bill; and in that respect the measure is allembracing. But that is not all: the board
may store and process products, and set up
manufacturing establishments. At the moment I cannot foresee this board setting up a
factory to manufacture, let us say, margarine, but the possibility cannot be disregarded.
Now, is this legislation necessary at this
time? Recently we have been inclined to
plume ourselves on the fact that we have
been getting away from official rigidities and
official regulations. Only the other day, the
regulations as to dealing in foreign exchange
were obliterated, so that merchants and other
business men can now deal freely in foreign
exchange and more intelligently plan their
operations. But by this bill we seem to
persist in this regulatory policy-to my mind
a mistaken one-so far as agricultural
products are concerned. For the life of me
I cannot see the necessity for it. Are we
ever to return to something like a free
competitive market in agricultural products?
We have seen the consequences-which to
say the least, have been rather unfortunate
-of state trading in wheat. On a previous
occasion this house was asked to pass an
estimate of $65 million to reimburse the
farmers in a measure, for the fruits produced
by a wholly mistaken policy. Are we going
to get away from that sort of thing, or are
we going to move further along the same
road? That, so far as I am concerned, is a
question posed by this legislation, and I have
no hesitation in saying that I am opposed to
the principle and opposed to the bill.
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: Honourable
senators, it is not possible today to conduct the affairs of the world and the intercourse between its people precisely as in
other days. I am for free enterprise, for
liberty of trade and commerce and so on,
but it is necessary to prepare for the world
of tomorrow. We remember that in 1932 and
1933 the inhabitants of some countries were
unable to get sufficient food to nourish themselves, while we in Canada were obliged to
burn our surplus wheat, and in Brazil great
quantities of coffee were destroyed.
The bil before us is not a socialist
measure; it is to make us ready for the conditions which will confront us tomorrow.
One is reminded that even now there is too
much grain in the West, and yesterday we

SENATE

voted millions to help the farmers. That,
I suppose, might be called a socialistic act.
But the same difficulties are experienced by
growers of apples, potatoes and other products; and if as a consequence the farmers
stop producing enough food for the people,
what will happen then? It is not to my mind
any argument to say that free enterprise "can''
do this or that; it is necessary that free
enterprise "shall" do this and that. That
is the situation.
We cannot sell our apples in Quebec
because private enterprise cannot buy them,
and so it is necessary for our farmers to form
co-operative companies in order to can their
apples, make apple juice, and so on. Private
enterprise was ready for twenty years to
organize for the future, but nothing was done.
In my opinion this bill will prove to be the
salvation of the agricultural interests in this
country, and it will also help bring about a
better distribution of food throughout the
world. I hope that other countries will enact
similar legislation so as to prevent a repetition of what occurred in 1932-33.
I am not for socialism, but I am in favour
of any legislation which will make it possible
for our farmers to produce and sell the food
our people require. This should be the case
all over the world. We must all co-operate
in these times if we want our way of life to
be better than it was half a century ago.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable
senators, the last two speeches recall to my
mind the haunting refrain of a well-known
song entitled "The Song is ended, but the
medody lingers on." This bill represents the
point of view of organized agriculture in this
country. In fact, I do not think this legislation would be before us today if this were not
true. The constituency which was served so
well by the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), and in a most
humble way by myself, has certainly changed
fundamentally. I have no doubt that the
senator from Churchill still remembers
vividly the voices of those from the Middle
West who were crying out strongly in favour
of a policy of selling anywhere in the world
provided they could buy anywhere.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: This point of view
amongst the organized portion of agriculture
has disappeared, but for how long I do not
know. Whether for old-timers like my
colleague and myself the song is really ended
and just the melody lingers on is something I
do not know. Last week it was announced
that exchange control has been removed
from Canada's financial relations with other

countries. To my mind this is one of the
most welcome measures to be announced in
a long time, and I think it will challenge all
countries affected by it to try to trade their
way out of their difficulties and establish the
value of their currency by virtue of a freer
exchange of goods and the operation of
commerce.
We have the classic examples of planned
economy in Diocletian of Rome and of Joseph
and the corn in Egypt. I suggest that this
kind of thing is unsound and cannot be
eternally applied. I feel that this year the
Agricultural Products Board legislation will
work because nature has interlvened on
behalf of those who will direct the administration of this legislation. I do not think
the minimum prices level will be reached in
many of these commodities. lt will be something like the working of the first Wheat
Board in 1919-20. The prices established at
that time as a result of the operations of the
Wheat Board created for all time the impression amongst the farmer's grain marketing
organizations in Western Canada that high
prices were to be associated with government marketing. It may not take long for the
government of this country to realize, as it
did over thirty years ago regarding wheat,
that it will not be willing to bear the burdens
thrust upon it as a result of the marketing
operations of this Agricultural Products
Board. It is quite possible that next year
nature will provide more bountiful crops, and
that there will be an excess production of
many of the commodities which are mentioned in this bill. Then, the government will
be called upon to shoulder the load, just as
every government in the past has been called
upon to do in similar circumstances. Possibly
the pressure from the Federation of Agriculture and other like bodies will be all the
greater then, and the responsibility of the
government to the country as a whole will be
greater too.
I do not think we should regard this legislation as being unchangeable, and I look forward to seeing it amended so that the real
value of farm products may be determined
in the intercourse of trade between Canada
and other countries.
Some Hon. Senators:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Thomas Farquhar: Honourable senators, I just wish to make a few remarks at
this time. The honourable senator from De
Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Gouin) has just told us
in a fine address how Canada is marching on
in many ways. While the honourable senator
was speaking I was disappointed that our
colleague from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
was not in the chamber to hear him.

DECEMBER 18, 1951
As a resuit of listening to debates in this
house from time to time I have corne to the
conclusion that some of us have not kept Up
with the times, and this is my reason for
referring now to the remarks made by the
senator from De Salaberry. He said that
Canada is marching on, and I feel that possibly
some of the older members in this chamber
have not kept pace with Canada; possibly
sorne of us have held too strongly to the old
school of thought and have flot kept up with
changing conditions. Canada is marching on
and we have to keep Up wi.th the ýchanging
times; we have to deal with new conditions
aF they arise.
I feel that this is a very important bill.
Those of us who are close to agriculture--I
myseif happen to be in the dairy businessknow that the dairy business at least is at
present in a very serious state. We read al
the time of farmers in various parts of the
country going out of the dairy business
because they no longer are able to make a
living in it. That kind of thing has been
going on so long that it has become really
serious. After ail, a farmer is not going to
continue producing anything year after year
if it is un'profitable.
As Canada develops and goes ahead we
cannot always obtain guidance ýby looking
back to the old days 'when we were boys.
What we did then is flot necessarily what
should be done today. Sometimes we hear
people say that they are Liberals of the
old school. Well, I think that Liberals too
are changing, in keeping with the spirit of
the times.
Han. Mr. Crerar: May I ask my honourable friend a question? Doés he consider
that the Socialists were right fifteen or
twenty years ago when they were advocating state trading?
Conditions were
Hon. Mr. Vaillancaurt:
not the same twenty years ago as they are
today.
Hon. Mr. Farquhar: I arn sorry, I did not
hear the question.
Does my honourable
Hon. Mr. Crerar:
friend think now that the Socialists and the
C.C.F. were right twenty years ago when
they advocated state trading?
Hon. Mr. Farquhar: I do not dlaim that the
Socialists were right at that time, or that
they are right today. Nevertheless, I think
we have to admit that Liberals have adopted
many principles that Socialists were advocating years ago. Today, we who cail ourselves Liberals are supporting some of the
planks that Socialists used to have in their
platform.

Honourable senators,
Hon. Jacob Nicol:
if this is not a socialistic measure-and My
colleague from Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt), says it is not-then I do not know
what a socialistic measure is. The bill wil
put a large part of the trade of this country
into the hands of bureaucrats. So far as I anm
concerned, I have had enough to do with
bureaucrats. I arn willing to work, to carry
on my affairs in the best way I can, but
I arn getting tired of receiving orders from
bureaucrats who do not know any more
about things than we do ourselves, and yet
tell us how we should proceed.
My colleague from Kennebec says that
conditions have changed a good deal in the
last twenty years, that the world has moved
forward, and that Canada must pass a
measure like this in order to make it possible
for our country to carry on. If that is so,
then Canada has become socialistic.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Nicol: I think that private enterprise has carried on in Canada satisfactorily.
Then why should this board be given power
to trade in ail kinds of agricultural prýoducts
from one end of the country to the other?
As my honourable friend from Kennebec
knows, co-operatives have been formed in
the province of Quebec fDr trading in certain merchandise, and they have operated
well. What will happen now to co-operatives
trading in honey, for instance? Will this
,board be able to notify them that it considers
the decîsions they have taken are unwise,
and that it will tell them what Vo do? I
arn opposed to the xneasure and intend to
vote against it.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
if there are no further speakers I wish to
refer to sorne of the arguments advanced in
this debate.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, if the honourable the leader (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) speaks now he will close the
debate.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I do not see why hionourable senators should be greatly surprised
to see a bill like this brought in. Sorne years
ago the fixing of a minimum price for agricultural products was, rightly or wrongly,
adopted as a policy of this country, and it
followed that sooner or laVer if circumstances
so required, there would have to be some
legislative provisions for carrying that policy
into effect. As was said by the honourable
senators from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert)
and Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), the agricultural interest of this country constituted for
a long period our really private enterprise.
Year in and year out they had to be prepared

SENATE

to meet competition from anywhere, and
were quite willing to do so if the concerns
from whom they bought were subjected to
similar competition. But in the end, realizing
that most of our secondary industry was protected in some manner or other, the agricultural interests gave up the struggle and
became reconciled to the idea that some kind
of protection was necessary for their industry.
Then parliament approved the policy of price
support for agricultural commodities. I am
not arguing at the moment whether that
policy was good or bad. My point is simply
this, that it is the law of the country. Inevitably the time had to come when it was necessary to put that policy into effect through
purchase of agricultural products by the
department at certain minimum prices.
Now when a board, acting on behalf of the
department, acquires certain products, it will
become the board's responsibility to decide
what to do with thern afterwards. My honourable friend asked me what would happen if
the price of a certain product dropped after
the board had purchased a considerable
quantity of it. I should think that the board
would have no alternative to selling it at less
than purchase price. I know of nothing else
that could be done. To whom the sale would
be made is a matter that the board would
have to decide. It might be to individuals,
or more likely to some outside governmental
authority.
This bill gives statutory form to a board

instances of public authority engaged in generating hydroelectric energy, but Ontario
years ago took over from private enterprise
the generation of electricity in that province.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I interrupt to the
extent of saying that that is a natural
monopoly? There are only a few sources of
power, and its distribution requires the intervention of the state in a monopolistic way.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I am merely citing

this case to show the general nature of the
operation of public authority. I could go
on to mention railways, tramways, electric
lighting systems and telephone operations,
all of which have in certain instances been
directed by public authority.
Rightly or wrongly, a group of agriculturalists in this country elected to ask for, and
secured, minimum prices for farm products.
I would point out that if the minimum prices
are fixed we must inevitably expect some
public authority to dictate maximum prices.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is, you abandon
private enterprise?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I did not abandon it.
My friend was just as much a member of the
house that passed this original legislation as
I was. I repeat that the inevitable consequence of minimum prices throughout our
structure is the setting up of maximum
prices. Whether this might be called "near
socialism"

is a question of degree.

NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY
ACCESSION OF GREECE AND

TURKEY

Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson moved,:
Resolved, that it is expedient that the Houses of
Parliament do approve the protocol to the North
Atlantic Treaty on the accession of Greece and
Turkey, signed by Canada at London on October 17,
1951, and that this house do.approve the same.

He said: This resolution seeks the approval
by parliament of the protocol which was

tabled in the Senate on December llth. It
will enable an invitation to be extended to
Greece and Turkey to join the North Atlantic
Alliance, in accordance with the unanimous
decision of the North Atlantic Council at its
meeting in Ottawa last September to recommend to the twelve countries which are parties to the North Atlantic Treaty that these
two countries be admitted to full membership.
It is perhaps unnecessary for me to review
in any detail the arguments which caused
this unanimous decision to be taken, though
I might refer briefly to those points which
carried most weight in formulating the Canadian position on this issue.
As was evident from the public debate
which attended the North Atlantic Council's
consideration of this question, some members
of the North Atlantic Alliance, at least
initially, had certain misgivings regarding
the desirability of extending membership to
Greece and Turkey, and would have preferred some alternative method, outside the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, for
associating them with Western defence plans.
On the whole, such misgivings had their
origins in the fear that the admission of two
geographically remote countries, which did
not entirely share the political and social
heritage of the present members of the

Alliance, might adversely affect the attainment of the long-term objective of the North
Atlantic Alliance, namely, the creation of a
closely-knit community dedicated to the promotion of economic stability and social wellbeing of its peoples.
In the event, however, this disadvantage
was acknowledged to be far outweighed by
the many obvious advantages of having
Greece and Turkey as full members of the
alliance. Among other things, it was recognized that the military urgency of the situation in the Eastern Mediterranean area
required the rapid creation of some defensive
organization, and that any attempt to make
the necessary arrangements outside the
framework of NATO might have taken too
long to organize. In any event, the two
countries concerned had publicly declared
their reluctance to accept any defence
arrangements other than full membership in
the North Atlantic Alliance, and in so doing
had received the full public support of the
United Kingdom and the United States, the
two countries which, apart from Greece and
Turkey themselves, have the greatest defence
responsibilities in the Eastern Mediterranean
area.
Quite apart from considerations such as
those just mentioned, which would have
made it difficult to reach a satisfactory solution other than admission to NATO, there is
the generally accepted fact that an attack
on Greece and Turkey, regardless of whether
or not they were parties to the North
Atlantic Treaty, would precipitate a general
war in which most of the countries of the
North Atlantic alliance would almost certainly be involved.
It follows logically,
therefore, that no time should be lost in
enabling them to participate as soon as possible in the defensive planning of NATO.
Indeed, their strategic location on the
unguarded southeastern flank of the North
Atlantic area renders their adequate defence
an essential element in the security of that
area as a whole.
Nor must we overlook the fact that Greece
and Turkey are in a position to make a substantial contribution to the defence potential
of NATO. They have already demonstrated
their resolute determination to defend their
own territories against outside aggression,
despite the overwhelming pressure to which
they have been constantly subjected by their
powerful Soviet neighbour. They have, moreover, earned the respect and admiration of
the whole free world by making a valuable
military contribution to the United Nations
cause in Korea-and this notwithstanding
their preoccupation with the security of their
home territories. If for no other reason, such

CANADIAN BROADCASTING BILL
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT-CONSIDERATION
POSTPONED

On the order:
Consideration of the amendment made by the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce to
the Bill 17, an Act to amend The Canadian Broadcasting Act, 1936.

Hon. Mr. Hugessen:

Honourable

senators,

may I suggest that this order stand for consideration until later today?
The order stands.
ADJOURNMENT

Hon. Mr. Robertson: I move, honourable
senators, that the house adjourn during

The motion was agreed to, and the Senate
adjourned during pleasure.
At 4 p.m. the sitting was resumed.
NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY
ACCESSION OF GREECE AND TURKEY

The Senate resumed from this morning the
adjourned debate on the motion of the Hon.
Senator Robertson:
Resolved, That it is expedient that the Houses of
Parliament do approve the Protocol to the North
Atlantic Treaty on the accession of Greece and
Turkey, signed by Canada at London on October 17,
1951, and that this House do approve the same.

Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members,

it would certainly be an anti-climax if I were
to address myself at any length to this subject after the very happy hour or so we spent
this afternoon listening to the Minister of
External Affairs. It was a very pleasant
experience, and the minister's speech gave
me, and I hope everyone else who was present, a fund of information about NATO and
its relation to the affairs of western Europe.
I do not wish to do anything to dull the
impression which the minister's statement
made upon our minds. He gave reasons for
a conclusion at which a good many of us had
already arrived, that NATO, by the very
nature of its organization, is a more effective

agency than UNO for the prevention of
aggression. He also explained, in answer to
questions asked by two or three honourable
senators, that Canada, among other nations,
through its government and parliament, will
have the power of deciding what action she
will take; and occasions for making such decision will probably arise over and over again in
the years to come. For what it is worth, it is
my opinion that we are not now in a position
to judge of the developments or the obligations which will occur in future, for nobody
can foresee what turn world events will take.
If any of us had been told in 1939, when Their
Majesties the King and Queen were visiting
Canada, that by 1951 or 1952 Canada would
have membership in an organization like the
United Nations, much less NATO, we would
have scouted the idea as beyond belief.
I approve this protocol; I endorse it; and I
take this opportunity personally to thank the
Secretary of State for External Affairs for the
very able statement he gave us. There was
no attempt to evade questions, and I personally learned a great deal from what he
told us.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. L. M. Gouin: Honourable senators, I
am sure we shall all join with the leader of
the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), in the very
complimentary remarks which he just made
and I wish to thank him for the suggestion he
made this morning that our Secretary for
External Affairs should appear before the
Senate Committee on External Relations. The
reference of the resolution to that committee
enabled us to obtain a very interesting and
illuminating explanation from the minister.
His appearance was purely for explanatory
purposes, and no report by or on behalf of the
committee is required. We were not called
upon to adopt any resolution, we were given
the opportunity to hear a report, and I
repeat, a very interesting report, concerning
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and
the admission to it of two additional members.
I think that for the sake of the public at
large, and especially for those members of
this house who did not have the opportunity
to attend our meeting, it would be in order
for me to make a few comments concerning
the effect of the protocol. At the conference
of NATO which was held in Ottawa it was
decided to invite Greece and Turkey to
become members of the organization. Who
took the initiative in this move I do not know,
but my impression is that it came from both
ides, and resulted from the plan of containment which was adopted some years ago. The
1 rotocol, which has already been signed by
t he twelve present members of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, extends, as

DECEMBER 19, 1951

respects the area covered by it, the obligations which existed under the North Atlantic
Treaty of 1949. For that reason the government, although not obliged by the constitution
to do so, but in accordance with well
established convention or usage, requested
the approval of both houses of parliament to
the protocol already signed on behalf of
Canada on October 17, 1951.
The protocol contains only three articles.
Under Article I will.be f.ound the conditions
concerning the coming into f orce of the
protocol and the deposit of the instrument of
accession with the Government of the United
States on behalf of the Kingdom of Greece
and the Republic of Turkey after their acceptance of the invitation extendedl to them.
The article to which I wish to devote the
very few remarks I hope to make before
resuming my seat is Article II, which contains
the definition of the territory that will be
covered by the North Atlantic Treaty afiter its
extension to Turkey and to Greece. Undier
Articles 5 and 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty
as adopted in 1949, certain territory was considered as being protected against any attack
by an aggressor on the principle that any
attack within that territory would be
regarded as an attack against all the members
of the North Atlantic Organization. According to Article 6 of the original treaty, the
North Atlantic territory included only parts
of North America and of Europe, but the
acceptance of Turkey means that a part of
Asia will now be covered by the Tretaty. That
is why section 1 of Article Il of the Protocol
refers to the territory of Turkey, and section
2 refers to forces, vessels, or aircraft of any
of the parties in the Meddlterranean area.
Canadians may now be wondering what
effect this extension of territory may have
upon their own obligations. First of all I
would point out that even without the protocol, if any further aggression had been committed in Greece or if any aggression had
been initiated against Turkey, our whole
system of collective security would have been
threatened, and it would have been necessary
to intervene for any member of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization merely in the
interests of military strategy. In other words,
it would have been the duty of all these
countries, including Canada, to take whatever steps each might deem advisable to
resist such aggression. Greece has already
been the victim of aggression, but the situation in that country is fairly satisfactory now.
Turkey has not yet been the victim of communist aggression, but time and again it has
been the object of threats. Turkey has an
efficient army, and its forces in Korea have
distinguished themselves by their heroism
and courage. The same may be said about
94703-22à

the Greek forces in Korea. The situation,
therefore, from a practical point of view
remains unchanged as far as Canada is concerned, but the idea behind the protocol is
to make it clear that an act of aggression
against any one of the fourteen members of
the North Atlantic Treaty will be looked
upon as aggression against all fourteen members. It must be clearly understood, that
the Canadian people will not be obliged to
make any definite contribution in men or
money, and that under Article V our obligation is more or less a moral one, though I
myself would consider it just as binding as
any purely legal obligation.
As I have said, according to the protocol,
if there is an attack against any member
country of the North Atlantic Treaty, including Greece and Turkey, Canada will consider
it an attack against its own territory. Consequently we agree that in accordance with
the principle of collective self-defence outlined in Article LI of the charter of the
United Nations, we shall assist any country
or countries attacked. In other words, the
North Atlantic Treaty is a purely defensive
pact, and the protocol is purely a defensive
agreement.
It is not for the purpose of facilitating
aggression against Soviet Russia that Turkey
and Greece have been invited to become
members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization. These two countries are considered to be essential links in our first line
of defence. If any such country is attacked,
we are obliged under Article V to assist that
country, but the limit of our assistance is to
be determined by the Canadian parliament.
We are bound to assist and to take such
action as we may deem necessary-including
the use of force-to restore and maintain
the security of the North Atlantic area as
extended by this protocol. If there is an
attack, the government would take any steps
which might be necessary to resist aggression
in a case of emergency, but would apply to
parliament for approval of the course of
action decided upon. It must be emphasized
that the protocol does not deprive parliament
of its very clear right to approve or to
repudiate any action taken or recommended
by the government in the case of an eventual
declaration of war and the necessity to participate in military operations. I believe it
is in the interest of peace that the protocol
should be adopted unanimously by this house.
It is in the interest of peace that Canada has
signed the protocol in its present form. And
it is in the interest of peace that, I trust, the
protocol will be ratified by the Canadian

CANADIAN BROADCASTING BILL
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT NEGATIVED
The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the amendment made by the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce to Bill 17,
an Act to amend the Canadian Broadcasting
Act, 1936.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
this order stands in my name, and ordinarily
I should move concurrence in the amendment. The only reason why it stands in my
name is that during the absence of the chairman of the committee yesterday afternoon
I was for a time acting as chairman; but the
amendment to which the report refers, and
which it recommends, was considered in the
morning. I opposed that amendment, and
therefore I opposed the committee's report.
In the circumstances it would not be
appropriate for me to move concurrence in
the amendment, and I have asked the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck), to make the motion.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck moved concurrence in the amendment.
He said: Honourable senators, in view of
the fact that I moved the amendment in committee, I think it is very fitting that I should
move concurrence in it here.
Perhaps, for the benefit of senators who
were not present at the committee, I had
better give an explanation of what the
amendment is and what it involves. But
first let me say that I am not a fan of private
radio stations or an advocate for them, and
I do not carry any brief on their account or
on anybody else's account. My own view
is that private radio stations should be subject to the control of the C.B.C. or such other
authority as the government may set up for
that purpose. I do not subscribe to the
theory that those who gain the valuable
special privilege to use as their own an air
channel to reach the thoughts and the hearing of the people of Canada have any vested
interest in that right, or that a channel once
assigned to some broadcasting institution
becomes a fee simple which is the property
of that institution and that it can do with it
as it likes. That is not my appreciation of
the position of the private broadcasters at
all. They occupy a position of value, they
have a special privilege not granted to all

others-a monopoly of the use of certain air
channels. They hold a very important position in the community.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Would the honourable
gentleman apply that principle to all public
utilities or people to whom concessions of
natural resources have been made by the
Crown?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Well, in a general way.
It is a very sweeping questionHon. Mr. Vien: I speak of vested interests.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The senator from De
Lorimier asks a very sweeping question,
whether I would apply that principle to all
people who have received concessions of
natural resources from the Crown. I would
say, in a general way, yes, but subject perhaps to some qualification as to each case
that he might mention. My view of a special
privilege granted to individuals by a government is that it should be exercised with due
restraint and looked upon as a special
privilege which may be withdrawn.
Radio broadcasting is in a field by itself,
and the necessity for regulation of it is much
more apparent and pressing than it is with
respect to many other special privileges
granted to private individuals-as, for
instance, the special privilege to run a railway-because, particularly in times of war,
the people who broadcast must be made to
conform to certain regulations and restrictions. The power to broadcast is sometimes
the power to disrupt, to do great damage; or,
on the other hand, the power to do great good,
to create mass opinion. The greatest power
exercised by the dictators was through their
control of the air, so that the people could
hear only those things which the dictators
desired them to hear.
It is dangerous to allow a private individual
or private interests to have a perfectly free
hand, a monopoly, in the right of access to the
car of the nation. A broadcasting station is
in a different position from a newspaper in
this respect. A newspaper's words are on
record, in print, and the publisher can be
held responsible in a way that a broadcaster
cannot. This is not exactly on the point, but
it is cogent to what I am arguing. I contend
that private broadcasters should be subject
to public control, and I oppose giving them
an absolute ownership of air channels or the
right to use them just as they like.
With that in mind let me say that here, as
in all other cases, dictatorial methods are not
wise. We live in a democracy, and it is
much better to gain our ends by an evenhanded justice than by wielding a big stick
over the heads of people.

DECEMBER 19, 1951
licence. Under those circumstances the broadcaster is out. So, it is not a case of the
difficulty or the impossibility of defining what
are infractions, and there is no confusion
as between general poor management and the
violation of regulations. That is the important
point in this amendment.
Here we are dealing with one thing only:

Now, it has been the law of Canada for a

a private station violate or f ails Vo observe
the regulations made by the corporation, the
corporation can take certain actions and

been the law right along. But recently an
amendment was made, which will be f ound
in the bill now before us. So that we may
have clearly in our minds what the proposed
changes are, I shahl read subsection 6 of section 7 of the bill. That subsection would
provide:

SENATE
Hon. Mr.

Hon. Mr.
amendment
Hon. Mr.

Dupuis: Do I understand that this
was made in committee and was
Roebuck: No. I will come to my
in a moment.
Haig: This is what the govern-

ment wants.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: To make the matter
perfectly clear, I shall read now from the
bill. Subsection 7 says:
(7) Where the corporation orders the suspension
of the licence of a private station under subsection
six, the licensee may by leave of a judge of the
Exchequer Court of Canada appeal against such
order to the said court on any question of law
arising out of the naking of such order and the
said court may stay the operation of such order or
suspension pending its final decision and may affirm,
alter or rescind the order appealed against.

I have read the whole subsection as it stands
in the bill. I might as well read the next
next subsection:
(8) The corporation, before making or arnending
a regulation that affects private stations, shall give
notice of such intention in the Canada Gazette and
shall give private stations a reasonable opportunity
to be heard before such regulation or anendmnent
cornes into operation.

That provision is not at the moment in question. What is in question is whether, when
an appeal is made to a judge of the
Exchequer Court, that court in hearing the
appeal shall be limited to questions of law.
Let me try as best I can-and not without
difficulty-to distinguish between questions
of law and questions of fact. Perhaps the
best illustration is that of a libel action. A
says something about B that B considers to
be defamatory, and he brings an action
against A. He writes in his statement of
claim the words of which he complains, and
at the opening of the trial the judge reads
the pleadings and rules on whether or not
the words complained of are capable of a
defamatory meaning. If the judge rules
that the words, with the innuendoes that
are pleaded, are not capable of a defamatory intprpretation, the trial stops right
there.
If on the other hand he rules
that they are, the trial proceeds. Now, that
decision is a decision of law, and, the question of law having been determined, the
court proceeds to find out whether the words
were in fact spoken, whether they were in
fact defamatory of the plaintiff, and if so,
whether they are justified by any of the
defences which have been urged. The occasion may have been privileged. It may be
that although the words, if taken literally,
mean one thing, in actual fact they mean
something different from what they were
understood to mean by those to whom the
words were spoken. You may remember
the Virginian in the old novel who said to

somebody who had made a remark, "When
you say that, smile". That is to say, you may
call one of your friends an "old rascal", or
use some expression of that kind, but, if you
say it with a smile, it does not carry its
literal meaning. That is one defence which
may be raised in an action of this kind. The
question of whether the words constitute a
libel is one of fact.
There is a regulation of the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation that no broadcaster, private or other, shall indulge in
attacks upon any religion or race or nationality. Let us assume that the board of the
C.B.C. comes to the conclusion that this
regulation has been violated in some article
published or broadcast by a private station,
and makes an order suspending the rights
of that station. Notice of the suspension is
sent to the Minister of Transport, and he,
who under this law is a mere conduit
through which the power flows, must notify
the licensee that he is out; and the licensee,
apart from this possibility of appeal, is
finished.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: May I point out to the honourable senator the provision that before there
is any suspension the party must be notified
and have a hearing.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: With great deference,
I think not.
Hon. Mr. Fogo: I would refer the honourable senator to subsection (6).
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The words referred to
are:
Such order shall not become effective until the
expiration of ten days after the making thereof;
and any such order shall be forwarded to the Minister of Transport, who shall forthwith communicate the same to the licensee.

So soon as the Minister of Transport gets
the order he communicates it to the licensee;
and. that is that; he has no discretion in the
matter.
Supposing, however, that the licensee
feels that he has been unjustly treated, that
the article complained of does not mean what
the C.B.C. and the board thought it did, or
that some other of a thousand possible
defences are raised. Application is made to
appeal. The judge of the Exchequer Court
holds that it is reasonable that the case should
be heard, and in the public interest he gives
leave to appeal. Then what have you? You
have an appeal to a court hog-tied in advance
by parliament, in that it can hear and determine only questions of law, not questions of
fact. Such an appeal is illusory. What are
the questions of law that could be raised

suppose it might be argued that there is
no such regulation, or that the regulation
does not mean what it says, or something of
the kind. But it is not with 'that sort of
argument that any licensee would take to
court; it would be on the facts, as to whether
the article in question is libellous, whether it
violates the regulations.
The idea of an appeal is not mine. I did
not draw this section; nobody in this house
drew this section; and nobody here, perhaps,
is much concerned about whether there is to
be an appeal or not, at least under these circumstances. But I say that if there is to be
an appeal it should be a real appeal: we
should not deliberately so tie the hands of
the appeal judge that he cannot inquire into
the facts of the case as well as the law before
he cornes to his decision. Far better to have
no right of appeal at all than one which is
jug-handled, which hog-ties the judge so
that his decision is not such as will command
.the respect of the public. If there is to be a
right of appeal to a judge, let the judge be
free to inquire into the facts and, as I have
said, to consider and determine questions
both of law and of fact. It was with this idea
in mind that I moved the amendment. Subsection (7) of section 7 of the bill is as follows:

SENATE
that is the desire of the dominion parliament
then this section has no business to be before
us at all.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: If it is desired to make
the C.B.C. an absolute and final court-a
court taking part in the work, a court of first
instance, a court of appeal, and a court of
everything else-then we should strike out
the entire section. We should have no illusionary appeal. If we are going to have an
appeal it should be a real one. It is not an
argument against what I say to cite cases of
arbitrary legislation which has been passed
by a provincial legislature or by the Dominion Parliament.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, in its report on Bill 17, an Act to
amend the Canadian Broadcasting Act, 1936,
the Banking and Commerce Committee
recommended that clause 7 be amended to
provide for appeals from suspension orders
not only on questions of law, but also on
questions of fact.
This particular appeal section was inserted
in its present form only after the government
had fully considered its possible application.
The government felt that appeals should be
confined to questions of law because the
Board of Governors of the Corporation is, by
law, the authority vested by parliament with
the responsibility of administering the
Broadcasting Act. The effect of the amendment would be to substitute the judgment
of a judge of the Exchequer Court for the
judgment of the Board of Governors, on matters which the members of the Board, by
virtue of their experience in broadcasting
matters, are more competent to decide. If
the section were revised in the manner
recommended by the committee, appeals on
questions of law or fact, or mixed law and
fact, would be permissible, and this would
open the door to the potentiality of appeal
in every case.
Honourable senators, when speaking on the
motion for second reading of this bill on
Monday morning, the honourable leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) made the following
comparison:
How would we like it if one of our railroads were
under the control, in respect of jurisdiction, of the
other? Suppose a law were passed to make the
Canadian National Railway subject to the Canadian
Pacific Railway in the same fashion as private
stations are controlled by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, what would be the reaction of the
public? Would not the national interest suffer?
Would there not be protests on every hand? Or
consider what would happen were the Canadian

Pacific
Railway
controlled
by the Canadian
National? Yet in principle much the same thing
obtains here.

Honourable senators, I do not think this
presents a true picture of the situation. In
its wisdom the parliament of Canada, either
rightly or wrongly, conferred upon the C.B.C.
the full responsibility in the matter of broadcasting in Canada; and the government feels,
unless parliament decrees otherwise, that
there should be no whittling away of this
definite responsibility. Therefore, honourable
senators, I would ask the house not to concur
in the amendment.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
was present at the meeting of the committee
and heard the whole discussion. I will not
attempt to retrace the detailed explanation
given by the senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck). Subsection (7) of section
7 of the bill says, in effect, that anybody who
feels offended by an order of the C.B.C. suspending the licence of a private station may,
by leave of a judge of the Exchequer Court,
appeal to that court against the order on
any question of law arising out of the making
of the order. That is a new section and an
advance, but I agree entirely with the senator from Toronto-Trinity that it means nothing at all. Look at the Board of Transport
Commissioners.
They have made a large
number of rules and regulations on freight
rates, but if my memory is right there has
been only one appeal on a question of law
arising out of the making of any of their
rules or regulations; and that was an appeal
from a temporary order that was to come into
effect on a certain date, an order which in
the circumstances the board had not the
power to make.
Well, I say quite candidly, I can see no
object in our having meetings of a committee if, after the committee has considered
a matter carefully and fully and a majority
of the members have voted for a certain
decision, the leader of the government is to
come here and say that the government does
not agree with that decision. In the present
case the Banking and Commerce Committee
carefully and fully deliberated upon the
Broadcasting Bill, with the assistance of
officials from the C.B.C. itself, and by a
majority of members the committee came to
a certain decision. Now, that cannot be said
to be a decision of members belonging to the
party in opposition to the government, for
I was the only member of the opposition
party at the committee, so the decision of the
committee was expressed by men who, with
the exception of myself, were appointed by
a Liberal administration. I repeat, what is
the good of having a committee go into all

DECEMBER 19, 1951
the merits of the bill and listen to representations from officials, if the goverenment is
to oppose the committee's recommendation?
There has been some reference to the
lawyers on the committee. My honourable
friend opposite is always joking about lawyers, but if he got into trouble be would run
to a lawyer faster than anybody else. In
fact, he would hire a taxi to get to the lawyer's office at the earliest possible moment.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: Do you mean me?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, that is just what you
would do.
I certainly cannot be accused of not attending committee meetings. This session I have
not missed a single meeting of any committee
of which I am a member, and in every instance I have sat right through the meeting,
except perhaps when someone sent for me
and I had to step out for a short time. I say
that without fear of challenge. But what is
the good of sitting on a committee for two
or three hours, examining witnesses and
studying a bill thoroughly, if we are to have
the experience that we have had here today?
The amendment that the committee reported
was moved by a senator who belongs to the
same party as that of the government in
power and it was carried by a majority of
members of the same party, yet the leader
of the government gets up in this chamber
and asks that the amendment be not concurred in.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: What would be the use
of this chamber if it could not reject a committee amendment when deemed necessary?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Don't worry; I will get
to that. You don't need to hurry me at ail.
I could understand that the leader of the
government might feel it desirable to challenge the committee amendment if it were
directly contrary to government policy, but
that is not the case here. The government
had already inserted into the bill an amendment making possible appeals to the
Exchequer Court on any question of law
arising out -of the making of an order by
the C.B.C. for the suspension of the licence
of a private station, and the committee's
amendment simply struck out the words
which would limit appeals to questions of
law.
I agree entirely, as any lawyer would,
with what has been said by the senator
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck).
Here is the situation. The C.B.C. regulations prohibit anyone from broadcasting
over the air a statement prejudicial to any

race or religious creed. If any station disobeyed that order its licence would be subject to cancellation, but the C.B.C. has never
yet cancelled a licence. That is what the
record shows.
Hon. Mr. Howard: That is a good record.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: There has not been
a case justifying cancellation.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Therefore this subsection
(7) must be intended to apply to some other
Remember, regardless of what
order.
appeals are made under this subsection, the
Minister has the right to cancel a licence
if he sees fit.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Haig: There is no question about
that. He has discretionary power to cancel
the licence of a station withnut a recommendation from anybody.
Let me illustrate the effect of the comSuppose the C.B.C.
mittee's amendment.
ordered the suspension of the licence of a
private station in Montreal, alleging that
the station violated some regulations. There
would not be much difficulty in establishing
the facts before the court. A copy of the
script that was used would be available, and
it could easily be shown that the broadcast
was made. There would be no difficulty in
establishing the facts.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Or the regulation.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No. It would not be like
an action for libel or slander, where a judge
has to hear a lot of witnesses and decide
who is telling the truth and who is lying.
There would be no difficulty of that kind
at ail, for ail the evidence would be on
hand.
Those of us who voted for this amendment in committee think that it would make
the C.B.C. a little more careful before cancelling a licence, and provide for a fairer
basis of appeal in any case where a licence
was cancelled. Of course, the C.B.C. can
refuse to renew any licence at the end of
the year; and, as I have said, the Minister
can cancel a licence out of hand at once.
Furthermore, I cannot imagine that a Judge
of the Exchequer Court would allow an appeal
if the Minister thought that the continuation
of a licence to a certain station was against
public policy. And I have such confidence
in the Minister that I feel sure he would
suspend the licence of any station which
broadcast a statement (prejudicial to people
of any race or colour. For instance, suppose
a certain station broadcast that coloured
men should not be employed in a certain
industry. I believe that, no matter what
any judge might say, the Minister would

SENATE

not allow a station of that kind to continue
broadcasting. I may be wrong, but that is
my own belief. Therefore I do not think
there is a great deal involved in the amendment. But I agree entirely with the senator
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck),
that it is no use having a statutory provision which does no good at all. That is
merely a joke. If the amendment is rejected,
a station owner who consults a lawyer will
be told that it is no use making an appeal,
becauseHon. Mr. Aselline: "It is already decided
against you."
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes. The statute gives
the C.B.C. the power to pass regulations and
the right to cancel licences. I submit that
this section should either be stricken out
altogether or be amended so as to have
some meaning.
What is the use of the Senate if, after a committee has given mature and deliberate consideration to a certain subject and reached a
conclusion upon it, the leader of the government is going to read to the house a statement that the government does not agree with
the committee's recommendation? If that can
be done we cease to be a Senate, we are a
superfluous body of members drawing salaries. This is an opportunity that I have been
looking for these last two or three years, an
opportunity to challenge the government
members in the Senate either to stand up and
be counted for the independence of this house,
or to admit by their action that they are
simply puppets of the government ready to
jump whenever the government leader pulls
the string.
Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators, I
should like to point out the very striking
difference that there is between the provisions in this section and the provisions of the
Railway Act with respect ta appeals from the
Board of Transport Commissioners. In the
first place, the Governor in Council may at
any time, in his discretion, upon application,
or of his own motion, vary or rescind any
order or decision of the board. Appeals are
allowed as of right from decisions of the
board to the Supreme Court of Canada on
questions of jurisdiction.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Appeals may also be taken,
with leave from the board, on a question
which, in the opinion of the board, is a
question of law or of jurisdiction, or both.
The fundamental difference under the measure now before us is obvious; there is no
right of appeal from a decision of this board
to the Governor in Council; indeed, the jurisdiction of the Governor in Council is wiped
out.

Honourable senators will please note lines
29 and 30 on page 3, which read as follows:
. . . any such order
Minister of Transport
municate the same to

terms of such order.

shall be forwarded to the
who shall forthwith comthe licensee and shall take
necessary to carry out the

By law the minister receives imperative
instructions to carry out such order. Nowhere
else in our statutes is similar language to be
found with respect to the powers of a minister. The minister is always given discretionary power over the action of boards or
commissions. It will suffice to refer honourable senators to the provisions of the Income
Tax Act, the Customs Act, and several
others, where the minister may approve,
but is not compelled to, and may set aside
any decision of his administrative officers.
Under the legislation before us there will
be no such discretion; on the contrary, imperative instruction is given, and the minister
must carry out the directions of the board.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: He is a puppet under
this legislation.
Hon. Mr. Vien: The minister becomes the
executive officer of the C.B.C.
The senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck) and the leader opposite (Hon.
Mr. Haig) have accurately stated that the
right of appeal on questions of law is new,
and is introduced by the government itself.
Until now there was no appeal, even on questions of law. The government now finds it
expedient to assuage the rigors of the Act,
and to grant a right of appeal from possible
arbitrary decisions. But I concur in the
views expressed that such right of appeal
should be effective and not illusory. In matters coming before the board it will very
often be impossible to distinguish between
questions of law and questions of fact; in
most cases, such questions are mixed questions of law and fact.
The amendment adopted by the committee
purports to give, in all cases, an effective
right of appeal on law and fact; and so that
frivolous appeals may be avoided, leave must
first be obtained from a judge of the Exchequer Court of Canada.
I am strongly in favour of this amendment.
Hon. Gray Turgeon: Honourable senators.
I feel an obligation, at least to myself, if not
to those who must listen to me, to say a word
about this amendment. Ever since I became
a member of parliament in 1935 I have been
a strong friend of and advocate for private
stations. For many years I have felt that
these stations should not be under the enforced supervision of the Board of Governors
of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

DECEMBER 19, 1951
When this bill was up for second reading the
other day I took the liberty of suggesting
that, because of circumstances beyond our
control, it would be well at the next session
to place the private broadcasters under a new
board, of which the chairman of the Board
of Govern-ors would automatically becuine
a member.
My real reason for speaking now is to
explain why I intend to vote against the
amendment. Incidentally, with ail due respect
to my personal friend, the leader opposite,
I think a senator has every right, if he sees
fit, to vote against a recommendation which
cornes from one of our committees. I arn not
a lawyer, and I do not have the knowledge
which lawyers possess; however, I think that
under this bill private stations have the same
right of appeal to the Governor in Council
as they wouid have under this proposed
amendment.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No, no.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: I have read the statute,
and I think I understand it. Subsection 6 of
section 7 would add a few adjectives which
do not appear to vary the principle. The
minister in charge of radio has the same
responsibility under the present Act as he
would have under the proposed amendment,
namely, of automatically passîng on to the
private stations the information that cornes
to hlm from the Board of Governors when
there is an order for cancellation. Therefore,'
I say that this proposed measure does not
take away any right of appeal to the Governor in Council which private stations have
enjoyed.
A new, though limited right is
provided-the right to appeal to the Exchequer Court on questions of law but not on
questions of fact.
As I see it, the main point of our discussion
is whether we are going to admit-and I arn
not prepared to admit it-that the Board of
Governors of the C.B.C. is the proper body to
supervise the administration of the private
stations. I do not think it is. But if we
change this proposed legisiation, and broaden
the rights that a private station faced with
the cancellation of its licence may have, taking away the proposed right o! appeal on
questions of law, but adding a permission to
appeal on questions of fact, those o! us who
desire to see the responsibility of supervision
given to a different board might just as well
desist from trying, because it would be
unlikely that any further effort to improve
the position of the private broadcasting stations would have much effect.
An Hon. Senalor: Anyway, there will neyer
be such a board.
Hon. Mr. Turgeon: Possibly that is so. I
ar n ft
arguing, I amn simply stating my

position and explaining why it is my intention to vote against this arnendment.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: I have only a few
words to say, but I think I should first question the statement made by the honourable
leader on the other side (Hon. Mr. Haig) that
where a committee of this house reaches a
conclusion the Senate, upon consideration of
the report of the comrnittee, is bound to
adopt the report of that committee.
Han. Mr. Haig: I did not say that. I said,
on governrnent legislation, introduced at the
request o! the government.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I arn sorry I misunderstoodý my honourable friend. But I do affirm
that this house has every right to consider in
every way reports made by its committees,
and that it is not necessarily bound by their
reports, particularly where, as in this case,
the report is not unanimous. The vote on
this amendment was, I believe, eight in
favour and five or six against.
My honourable friend from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) took a good deal
of cornifort from the fact that of the four
lawyers 'who were members of that cornmittee, three voted in f avour of the amendment, and only one, who happens to be
mysel!, voted against it. Well, upon that
question I simply appeal to my friends from
the province of Quebec, and ask if they wil
nlot agree with me that one lawyer from
Montreal is always worth three lawyers !rom
Toronto?
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Han. Mr. Hugessen: This is a very simple
question. A good deal has been said this
afternoon about the dreadfully arbitrary
powers 0f the C.B.C. over the private stations.
If honourable senators will read the amendments to the Canadian Broadcasting Act
which are incorporated in this bill they wll
see that those arnendments are full of additional safeguards against any arbitrary action
by the C.B.C. Look, for instance, at subsection (8), a new provision, which states
that the corporation-that is, the C.B.C.before making or amending a regulation
which affects private stations, must give
notice of such intention in the Canada
Gazette and give private stations a reasonable opportunity to be heard before such
regulation or arnendment cornes into operation. That is an entirely new protection for
private stations. Or take subsection (6). As
it stood, that subsection gave the C.B.C.
power to suspend the licence of a private
station which violated the regulations. It
did that, and nothing more. But subsection
(6) as amended provides that in case of any
alleged violation the corporation may,

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, I do not know when we may expect
to receive any legislation from the other
house. I have no information that-to use a
phrase from one of our rules-is "not held in
common with the rest of the Canadian subjects of the Crown". So far as I am aware,
the only person who has any knowledge at
all of what may happen in the House of
Commons is my honourable friend the leader
of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig), and he has
not let me into his confidence on the matter.
All I can do now is to suggest that the Senate
adjourn during pleasure, to reassemble at the
call of the bell, at 4 o'clock. In the meantime
I shall gather as much information as I can,
and perhaps those who are in a better position than I am to ascertain what is likely to
be done in the other house may enlighten
us when we resume.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, and
the leader of the government has suggested
that I have some inside information. I wish
I had, for I would be quite willing to tell
what it was. Unfortunately I have none at

all. The only thing I know is that I personally intend to take a train for Winnipeg
tonight. Christmas comes but once a year,

COMBINES INVESTIGATION BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bill 36, an Act to amend
The Combines Investigation Act.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

House of Commons concurred in the committee's report that a Royal Commission be
appointed, under the Inquiries Act, to continue the work initiated by the committee.
On July 8 the Royal Commission on Prices
-the
Curtis Commission-was appointed,
and on March 18, 1949, the commission issued
its report, which was published in three
volumes and was most comprehensive in
nature.
The commission conducted a most extensive inquiry into all phases of the question
and into the reasons for the increase in the
cost of living and the price index, both
domestic and international. There were 77
public hearings, and 179 witnesses were
heard. The conclusions of the commission
covered a wide range of subjects, and
included special reference to the subjectmatter of the bill now before us.
On page 41 of Volume 1 of the report of
the Royal Commission on Prices there was
the following specific recommendation:

On June 27, 1950 the government appointed
the MacQuarrie Committee to study combines
legislation. While it was asked to inquire into
various matters concerning the general subject
of combines legislation, the specific question
of resale price maintenance was part of the
problem. In the letters and notices sent out
by the committee to interested persons, attention was specifically directed to the question
of resale price maintenance, and also to the
recommendations and comments contained in
the various volumes of the report of the Royal
Commission on Prices.
This committee submitted an interim report
as of October 1, 1951. At page 21 of that
interim report, the committee expressed itself
on the question of resale price maintenance
as follows:
The committee has studied resale price maintenance in the light of the two standards of judgment originally set up, namely, the desirability of a
free economy and the need for economic efficiency.
This study has led the committee to the general
conclusion that resale price maintenance, on the
growing scale now practised, is not justified by
either of these standards. It represents a real and
undesirable restriction on competition by private
agreement or "law" and its general tendency is
to discourage economic efficiency. That is why, in
our opinion, the prescription and the enforcement
of minimum resale prices must be viewed as manifestations of a restrictive or monopolistic practice
which does not promote general welfare.

The Speech from the Throne at the opening
of parliament foreshadowed legislation in connection with this matter. When the session
opened, the report of the MacQuarrie Committee, together with a draft bill containing
what in the opinion of the Department of
Justice would be necessary if the joint committee felt that it should report favourably
on the recommendations contained in the
report, were referred to a joint committee of
the Senate and the House of Commons. This
committee reported to the two houses of
parliament; a bill was presented to the House
of Commons and passed; and now, in the ordi-

nary course of procedure, it has reached us.
The circumstances surrounding the arrival
here of this legislation as has so often been
the case in the past do not contribute to or
facilitate the detailed consideration we would
like to give it. I am bound however to point
out two things in connection with this phase
of the question. The first is that, with the
possible exception of the old age security
legislation, no measure that has reached us
in recent years, certainly since I have been
government leader, has been so thoroughly
considered within and without parliament as
this has been-first, by a select committee
of the House of Commons, in 1948; by two
committees of inquiry, extending through

1949, 1950 and 1951; by a joint committee of
the Senate and the House of Commons, in
recent weeks; and then by the House of
Commons. In the light of these facts, and
since honourable members of this house have
closely followed these discussions, I have no
doubt that every senator has even now
arrived at pretty definite conclusions. Nevertheless, despite these facts, I as government
leader will welcome and facilitate whatever
additional consideration this house may wish
to give to this important question, because,
in the final analysis, it is through our action
that parliament decides whether or not it
approves of the underlying principle of resale
price maintenance.
In common with other members of this
house I have endeavoured to keep abreast
of relevant discussion. I have studied the
recommendations of the two committees of
inquiry. I have sought, perhaps not ineffectually, to wade through the briefs and the
mass of statistics presented to the joint committee, as well as the arguments and counterarguments in the House of Commons. I have
been inundated with telegrams and letters
from those who are concerned lest anything
be done to interfere with the growing practice of retail price maintenance.
I have noticed with the greatest interest
the argument that, since manufacturers enjoy
the benefits of tariff protection limiting
competition from without our borders, and
the agricultural community have succeeded
in having minimum prices for their products
established by parliament, the distributing
trades, and particularly retailers, should be
permitted to enjoy the protection from
competition which retail price maintenance
might reasonably be expected to afford. As
one who spent his whole business life as a
retailer I am bound to admit that when the
argument for retail price maintenance is put
on that basis it is in logic difficult for me to
resist it. In effect its advocates say this:
"Private competitive enterprise has disappeared as far as whole segments of our
economy are concerned: why should the
retailing section of our conomic system
alone be singled out to withstand the merci-less winds of competition? Just as manufacturers, organized labour and agriculture
have succeeded in limiting competition, we
retailers should have the same right; parliament should not interfere with our plans".
I find it very difficult, honourable senators,
to escape one conclusion, and that is that
many of those engaged in the business of
producing and distributing in this country
have one great ambition in common, and
that is a desire to escape from or minimize

SENATE

the possibilities of present and future competition. I am not sure what our particular
economy would be if we were successful in
accomplishing a non-competitive society; but
one thing I know, and that is that we would
have to stop orating about the benefits of
private competitive enterprise. Having decided that everybody and everything should
enjoy the benefit of minimum prices and
returns, it would remain for us only to
determine how the state could best control
maximum prices as a permanent part of our
economy. When that was done the difference
between ours and a socialistie state would
be barely recognizable.
The plain truth about our present situation
is that business and agriculture generally in
Canada are leading a campaign, perhaps
unconsciously, to change our economic
system into a government-controlled economy,
Business, agriculture and organized labour,
each in its own way, has enjoyed in the past
ten years a degree of prosperity such as it
had never contemplated in its wildest dreams.
In the main that prosperity still continues;
but fearful that the end may be just around
the corner, each in its own way is seeking
to establish floors under its existing prosperity. By so doing they all hope to securein terms of the report of the Curtis Commission and I quote-"A happy release from
the unending struggle against the harsh
correctives of the free market system."
Those of us who were in business between
World War I and World War II can appreciate
this viewpoint; but if we give up our free
market system, it will be replaced by something not much to our liking. Our actions
in protecting business and its employees-by
tariffs and so forth-from competition from
external sources, or in protecting agriculture
-by tariffs and floor prices-from competition from without or within, all conspire to
place an additional burden upon the consumer, no matter how sugar-coated the pill
may be. We are now asked by opponents
of this bill to facilitate the continuance of
a system of limiting competition in the
distributing trades; it, too, to add another
burden on the consumers' backs. Is it
reasonable to assume that those overburdened
consumers will not at some time strike back
from sheer desperation, and demand from
this government or some other government
direct action through government controls to
prevent this "ganging-up" on them that has
become such a large part of our economic
system? Let there be no doubt on this score,
that to legalize retail price maintenance
would place an additional burden on the
consumer. Some of the advocates of retail
price maintenance in the other place are
now making a curious point that, after ail,

it affects only 15 per cent of the total retail
trade, and since it took fifty years to reach
this level it would be centuries before all
retail trade was conducted on this basis.
My whole business life prior to my becoming
a member of the government was in a branch
of the automotive retailing trade that did not
enjoy retail price maintenance, and my answer
to that line of argument is that it is my belief
that retail price maintenance, if legalized
under existing circumstances, would spread
like a prairie fire. And why should it not?
If the practice is beneficial to the 15 per cent
presently engaging in it-and it appears to
be-and if, as its advocates say, it is not
harmful to the consumer, why should the
remaining 85 per cent of the retail trade not
adopt the practice overnight? Certainly if
this parliament put its stamp of approval on
the practice, the first thing I would do, if I
were going back to my old business would
be to urge the company which I represented
to take up with their automobile manufacturers the question of our adopting retail
price maintenance. I would do so for two
reasons. The first is that I would be relieved
of the fear that my competitor was reducing
his price either by cash discounts or increased
trade-in allowances, and secondly, I would
hope that the manufacturer, in setting the
selling price to the public, would enable me
to enjoy the higher discounts that retailers
who engage in retail price maintenance are
presently enjoying. When I was in the retailing business, our dealer discounts were
about 23 per cent from the list or selling
price. A car that I offered for sale for
$2,000, taxes and freight paid, cost me $1,540.
The $460 gross profit represented 23 per cent
of the $2,000 list or selling price. In reading
the Curtis Report I find that the discounts of
the dealers in businesses enjoying retail price
maintenance have been increasing. One case
cited indicated an increase of from 25 per cent
to 371 per cent; some others showed increases
up to 40 per cent. Documents filed with the
special committee give countless instances of
increases of from 33à per cent to 38 per cent.
Assuming, then, that justice was done to
automobile dealers as compared with household appliance or drug dealers, and they
were allowed 333 per cent instead of 23 per
cent, the selling price to the public of my
$2,000 car would have to be $2,310. And
remember, the volume of the automotive
trade is five times that of household electrical
appliances. Let there be no mistake: retail
price maintenance, if legalized, will spread
rapidly, and it will affect the consumer. But
actually that is not my main argument. If
manufacturers, organized labour and agriculture are, in their own interests, to be permitted to fleece the consumer, I know of no
particular reason why the retailer should .not

DECEMBER 29, 1951
be permitted to do so as well. My chief
concern is that none of us should be
unwittingly led down the .garden path to a
fate that we would not care to contemplate.
It is interesting to speculate on why agriculture and the retailing part of our distributing system in particular, hitherto the
corner-stones of the private competitive
system, should seek to discard that system in
favour of another which in essence is a
controlled economy. I do not think there is
any doubt that the protective tariff in all its
ramifications is the basic reason why we have
swung so far away from our system of competitive enterprise; and some wish to go even
further. Through tariffs and the like, manufacturers and a large section of organized
labour have secured protection from certain
competition; but while they were receiving
this protection, no governmental action was
taken to control their maximum prices. Now
business generally seeks to emulate their
example. Since this is so, it was perhaps
not unnatural that agriculture, long a cornerstone of free enterprise, should have given
up the strggle, thrown in the sponge, and
pinned its faith and hopes to minimum prices
and now the retailer demands the same
consideration.
What, then, shall we in this house do, honourable senators? I think that, in the light of
the circumstances, we should pass this legislation making retail price maintenance illegal,
but at the same time point out to the retailer
that even if he got the privilege of restricting
competition it would be of doubtful value,
since it would almost certainly be followed
sooner or later by governmental action to set
his maximum prices and to control his margins. We should remind him of the government's definite assurance that if the small
retailer should become the victim of predatory competition by large retailers it is ready
to co-operate fully with the law enforcement
officers of the province in the vigorous
enforcement of section 498A of the Criminal
Code whenever it becomes evident that the
practices forbidden by that section are being
engaged in. The government further agrees
to give close and continuous attention to the
effects of the legislation now being considered
by this house, and to any practices which may
develop, either as a result of the legislation
or independently of it, and which are contrary to the public interest. Should such
practices develop, the government will consider what other legislative action may be
appropriate.
To any retailers who are envious of the
good fortune of agriculture in having had
floor prices established, we might point out
that even this can become a double-edged

sword. Only recently evidence was given before one of our standing committees that
while the butter producers secured minimum
prices through price supports, they found that
their maximum prices were subject to a
novel but very effective type of control. In
recent months the government imported from
Europe ten million pounds of butter, which
it is holding for the purpose of controlling
any undue rise in the price of butter. That
is a very simple form of control but, as I
have said, it is also a very effective one. I
have no doubt that it may be applied elsewhere, if and when it is deemed expedient in
the public interest.
There still remains one segment of our
economy which has enjoyed certain freedom
from competition from external sources, with
no corresponding control as to what its maximum prices should be. I personally have long
held the view that something should be done
about it, and so have no difficulty in finding
myself in agreement with that part of the
Curtis report which states:
We would favour the extension of the principle
of lifting dumping duties or reducing the customs
tariff . . . where alternative import sources of
supply would lessen the danger of monopolistic
growth.

All things considered, honourable senators,
I think we should stick to private competitive enterprise, despite all its faults, and
support the principle of this bill. This government, urged to impose direct controls as a
method of curbing inflation, has decided that
that would not successfully accomplish the
purpose. It has adopted temporary restrictions through financial controls and credit
controls. I repeat that of necessity these controls are temporary. The government pins its
faith to the old and tried system of competition, which has built up this country; but it
must be a system of real competition, not
one which, though we boast of it from the
house-tops, is known by us to be so weakened
by various methods as in fact to be no longer
competition at all.
Honourable senators, I suggest that it is
the duty of this house and of all people who
believe in our system of private competitive
enterprise to do everything possible to enable
real competition to function effectively in
helping to solve the problems of inflation and
the rising cost of living, which problems may
endanger not only our own country but the
whole western world.
Hon. Arthur Marcotte: Honourable senators,
I am the "lone wolf" of my party here today.
Perhaps my rising to speak after the very
fine address which we have just heard from
the government leader may be taken as indicating that for the time being I am speaking

SENATE
for the official opposition. I am not. I am
the plain senator from Ponteix, speaking in
my own name, and what I say will be an
expression of nothing but my own views. I
freely admit and I do so in clear conscience,
that I support the bill, because I believe in
freedom of trade and freedom of action by
individuals. I do not like government control
over anything, unless it be unavoidable. The
leader has suggested that the measure before
us is a temporary one, which will have to be
judged by its results and which may, as time
goes on, be amended as deemed necessary.
In these circumstances I am in favour of the
bill.
I do, however, wish to raise a side issue.
As you know, I have always been opposed
to the establishment of a joint committee of
members of both houses for the consideration
of a controversial matter. I have never liked
that procedure, and I do not suppose that I
am going to change my opinion on this before
I die. This Senate, this body of which we are
so proud, was created for what purpose?
Chiefly to consider and, as deemed wise in
the particular circumstances, to amend or
reject or approve what has been done by the
other house. At least, that is my way of
interpreting the function of the Senate. That
is why, although I did not say so at the time,
I was opposed to the appointment at this
session on the Joint Committee on Combines
Legislation. In the last two days I have read
the committee's report and proceedings, and
I was glad to find that the senators appointed
to the committee were good representatives
of this house and did their work well. There
is sitting opposite me at the moment an
honourable gentleman who took a very
important part in the committee's work (Hon.
Mr. Lambert). But the committee was composed of 24 members of the House of
Commons and only 12 senators. Why was
there this disparity between the two houses?
If we are to have a joint committee, why is
each house not equally represented on it?
That is what I should like to know. I say that
senators should not submit to being a minority on a joint commitee.
Furthermore, in reading over the committee's proceedings, I find that senators were
sometimes not treated as they should have
been. I observed that in one instance my
honourable friend from Huron-Perth (Hon.
Mr. Golding) made a statement to the committee chairman, and no attention at all was
paid to it. In fact, the senator apparently
was treated much as if he had been a school
boy interfering in the committee's work. If
the Senate is to continue to participate in
joint committees, the members of this house

should at least be treated as senators and not
as messenger boys for the House of Commons.
I have no mandate to speak for this side
of the house on the question now before us.
I was requested by my leader to be here on
December 27th. I was here on that date, and
again on the 28th, and I am now here on the
29th, attending the house with the regularity
that I have practiced for twenty years.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: Upon accepting the
honour of appointment as a senator, I was
commanded to be here, "all difficulties and
excuses whatsoever laying aside", and since
then I have attended every day that I was
physically able to be here. I am not the only
one who takes his responsibilities to the
Senate seriously, and I congratulate the honourable senators in attendance today. I recall
that once when I was on a train I received a
telegram to return to Ottawa in order that
the house might have a quorum. Fortunately,
there is no such problem today.
I was not able to follow the explanation
which the leader of the government gave of
the legislation before us, for I am not an
economist and I do not possess the commercial
knowledge necessary to grasp the intricacies
of the subject. I have, however, read the
evidence taken, and I hold certain views as
to how a problem of this nature should be
handled. It is my opinion that the Senate,
which is a non-political body, is the best
place in which to give consideration to such
a contentious matter. The subject now before
us could well receive the same full consideration in one of our committee as was given
to the Railway Act and the Income Tax Act.
If the legislation before the house does not
work out, I suggest that next tinle such a
measure should be considered dispassionately
by a committee of this bouse; in that way
the Senate would be performing in regard
to legislation the functions for which it was
created, namely, to revise, to amend, to reject,
and if workable, to approve.
Hon. L. M. Gouin: Honourable senators,
I shall try to be as brief as possible. However,
I believe that even those who differ most
strongly with my views on the question
before us will agree that I have the right
to express freely my opinion and to discuss
the principle of this very important measure.
The leader on this side, in his interesting
and eloquent remarks, spoke of the question
of legalizing price maintenance. I wish to
put very .clearly before the house the fact
that the present question is the outlawing
of price maintenance, which in itself is
perfectly legal at the present time, and is

DECEMBER 29, 1951
a custom of trade which has become sanctified not only by long usage but also by well
established jurisprudence, particularly in my
own province of Quebec.
To understand the changes which will
result from the legislation which we are now
considering, I think it is necessary for me
to summarize the origin of our laws against
combines.
In 1889, honourable senators, by a statute
known as 52 Victoria, Chapter 41, the
Canadian Parliament enacted for the first
time that it was a misdemeanour to combine
to unduly prevent or lessen competition.
These original provisions were reproduced
in the Criminal Code of 1892, section 520.
The provisions concerning combines are now
found at sections 496-7-8 of the Criminal
Code as revised in 1906. I would add at once
that in 1935 section 498A was added to cover
unfair practices such, for instance, as discriminatory rebates.
The first Combines Investigation Act dates
back to 1910, 9-10 Edward VII, Chapter 9.
As honourable senators know, in 1919 two
new Acts were adopted; firstly, the Board of
Commerce Act, 9-10 George V, Chapter 37,
which created a court of record for the
investigation of combines; and secondly, the
Combines and Fair Prices Act of 1919,
Chapter 45, which was intended to regulate
profits on necessaries of life, such as food,
clothing and fuel.
These two measures enacted in 1919 gave
to the Commissioner of the Board of Commerce wide powers; powers so wide, honourable gentlemen, that in 1922 both Acts were
declared ultra vires by the Privy Council.
(Board of Commerce Act 1919 (1922), 1 A.C.
at 191).
J would at once point out that the constitutionality of the present bill also is open to
serious doubt for the reason that it too encroaches upon property and civil rights. I am
not the only one who entertains this opinion,
and I regret that the question of the validity
of the bill has not been submitted to the
Supreme Court of Canada. It is very clear
that it will be contested by means of a test
case before the courts in the near future,
if and when it is adopted.
Let us for a brief moment return to the
two Acts adopted in 1919 and declared by
the Privy Council in 1922 to be unconstitutional. In 1923 these two measures were
repealed and a new Combines Investigation
Act was adopted, 13-14 George V, chapter 9.
As revised, that Act is found in the Revised
Statutes of Canada (1927), chapter 26. It
was again amended in 1935, 1937, 1946, 1949
and 1950.

I wish to add at once that the Privy Council
has upheld the validity of the Combines Investigation Act in its present form-that is,
without the amendment now submitted to us
-in case of Proprietary Articles Trade Association versus Attorney-General (1931) A.C.,
310.
The bill before us, honourable gentlemen,
differs fundamentally from the legislation
which was upheld by the Privy Council. I
shall now try within a minute or two to sum
up our jurisprudence, in order to show that
the essential characteristic of an illegal combine is that it operates to the detriment of
the public,-a condition which, under the
terms of the present bill, is no longer requisite. Here is the summarized definition, given
by the Privy Council in the Proprietary Articles case:
"Combine" as defined by section 2, that is, shortly
stated, a combine which is to the detriment of the
public and restrains or injures trade or commerce.

That quotation, which is absolutely vital to
my argument, occurs in the decision of the
court which was then the highest tribunal to
which our cases could be appealed. The
characteristic of a legal combine is that it
operates to the detriment of the public.
I now quote the brief corresponding definition in the Criminal Code, section 496:
A conspiracy in restraint of trade is an agreement between two or more persons to do or procure
to be done any unlawful act in restraint of trade.

Again, in section 498 of the Criminal Code
certain combines or agreements in restraint of
trade are declared to be indictable offences
when such agreements, for instance: (a)
unduly limit the facilities for dealing in any
article or commodity which may be a subject
of trade or commerce; or (b) restrain or injure
trade or commcrce in relation to any such
article or commodity; or (c) unduly prevent
or lessen the manufacture or production of
any such article or commodity, or unreasonably enhance the price thereof; or (d) unduly
prevent or lessen competition; and so on.
I call to your attention the words "unduly"
and "unreasonably' injure or prevent or
lessen. The basic idea is that such a combine
is illegal because it is detrimental to the
public interest. Under our Combines Investigation Act an agreement or combine in
restraint of trade is condemned only when it
thus operates or is likely to operate to the
detriment of the public interest. Under our
Criminal Code such acts constitute offences
only when they unduly limit the distribution
or production of an aricle or unreasonably
enhance the price of any commodity.
Therefore, under our Criminal Code an
agreement in restraint of trade is not in

SENATE

itseif crirninal; it becornes a crirninal offence
only if competition is thereby diminished
unduly or unreasonably.
Noxv, let it be noted that the amendment
now before us abandons cornpletely the principle so clearly ernbodied in our existing
leg-isiation. A combination or combine among
varlous producers or retailers is an offence
only if such "horizontal combine"-to use the
expression currently employed-operates or
is likely to operate to the detriment or against
the interest of the public. On the contraryand this, I submit, is quite illogical-in the
case of any agreement or so-called "vertical
combine" between a producer and any other
person to seli such producer's articles at a
so-called fixed or maintained price, such a
vertical combine is illegal ipso facto. In the
bill before us, clause 1, such vertical combine
is declared to be illegal even though Lt is flot
shown to be in the least detrimental to the
public. I submit that this is rnost illogical,
and that it is contrary to the principles
afflrmed by our jurisprudence thus to discrirninate against those who follow a practice
which has becorne a well-established tradition, or customn of trade, sanctioned by our
courts.
To support my contention, may I refer very
briefly to a few typical cases. I arn not trying
in any way to be legalistic about this question. I want to lay before this bouse principles of justice and of common sense which
forrn the basis of our liberal economy;
principles which are as sound econornically as
they are well-recognized legally.
There is the American Tobacco case, which
xvas decided in 1897 by Mr. Justice Dugas and
is reported in 3 Rev. de Jur., 453. The trial
judge was called upon to examine the validity
of an agreement of the company with jobbers
to seli at fixed prices and to seli only to retail
dealers. He declared that this agreernent was
valid, since "the acts complained of in this
case were only acts of ordinary business competition asserted by a manufacturer in disposing of bis property as he saw fit."
the
gentlemen,
honourable
Evidently,
judge had in mind the provisions which are
ernbodied in our own Civil Code, article 406:
Ownership is the right of enjoying and disposing
of things in the most absolute manner. provided
that no use be made of thern which is prohibited
by law or by regulations.

That is to say, any manufacturer or dealer,
as owner of certain articles, enjoys the right
to seli or not to seil such articles.
In other words, any manufacturer or dealer,
as owner of certain articles, may seli or not
seli such articles because, according to the
principle ernbodied in section 407 of the Civil

Code, no one can be compelled to give up bis
property. Any owner may dispose of what
belongs to hlm. in the rnost absolute manner;
he rnay seli conditionally or unconditionally.
Under our civil law there is nothing illegal
in the condition stipulated by the vendor that
a purchaser shail resell only at a certain price.
Conditions are illegal. only when they contravene section 13 of our Civil Code, which
reads:
No one can by private agreement, validly contravene the laws of public order and good morals.

Honourable senators, I corne now to the
case decided by Justice Pagnuelo in 1904,
Wampole v. Lyons, (1904) 25 Que. S.C. 390,
and I quote:
That an agreement between a manufacturer and
a retailer that the latter would seil at a fixed price
was not illegal, or in restraint of trade, or contrary
to public policy, provided the manufacturer had an
interest in making the contract.

In 1909, a case originating before the
courts of Quebec, United Shoe v. Brunet,

(1909) A.C. 330, went to the Privy Council.
The agreernent, which was declared valid,
concerned the lease of sorne machinery on
the condition that only the plaintiff's machinery was to be used. Here it was held that
there was no proof of restraint of trade.
I just wish to mention an Ontario case
which is of special interest; Rex v. Beckcett et
al, (1910) 20-O.L.R. 40. In this case some
manufacturers were selling at fixed prices
and had agreed to seli only to wholesalers.
The complaint was laid under section 498 of
our Crirninal Code. The accused was acquitted. The judge held that the proper method
of distribution was from manufacturer to
wholesaler, then to the retailer and then to
the consumer. The judge was of opinion
that if persons who belong to the wholesale
trade sold at retail, such a system. would
injuriously affect and demoralize the trade of
not only the wholesaler but also the retailer,
and that the position of the consumer would
be no better in the long run, and might even
be worse. This will be the effect of the present
bill in the opinion of several economists and
of nurnerous people who have a practical
knowledge of business conditions as they
exist today.
I shaîl merely indicate now the volumes
and pages of various judicial reports containing judgments which affirmn the principle
upon which I base my opposition to the present bill. Honourable senators, because detriment to the public was not shown, contracts
were declared not to be illegal. in the following cases involving some restrictions of trade:
McEwam v. Toronto General Trust, 54 S.C.R.
381; Stewart v. Thorpe, 49 D.L.R. 194.

DECEMBER 29, 1951
Honourable senators, though "pooling" is
sometimes called a monopolistic restriction
upon competition, pooling and marketing
were upheld as not being detrimental to the
public in the following cases, in re: Growers
of B. C. Ltd., (1925) 1 D.L.R. 871; Rex v.
Chung Chuck, (1929) 1 D.L.R. 756; Saskatchewan Co-operative Wheat Producers, (1926) 3
D.L.R. 810.
In a Quebec case, Tanguay v. Lang, (35 R.J.
444), the Quebec Superior Court upheld the
validity of the Canadian Fire Underwriters
Association, a body regulating fire insurance
business. Again, because there was no illegal
design to eliminate competition, judgment was
rendered in favour of Famous Players (1932,
O.R., p. 307.)
I now mention a last case. Once upon a
time in a remote place there were two moving
picture houses. One of the owners agreed to
close his theatre, thereby eliminating competition and creating a monopoly in favour of the
other theatre. This agreement was held valid,
however, because there was no injury to the
public. This was the case of Rex v. Applebaum, (1933) O.W.N. 576.
Section 498 of the Criminal Code, and the
Combines Investigation Act as it now reads,
cover the same field, but the latter is somewhat wider in scope. Under both Acts the
test of criminality is whether there is detriment to the public. According to Mr. Ian
Wahn, even monopolistic control is not ipso
facto conclusive as to the existence of public
detriment, and here I wish to cite Mr. Wahn's
interesting article, Canadian Law of Trade
Combinations, published in the Canadian Bar
Review of January-February, 1945.
Honourable senators, by this analysis of our
jurisprudence I have tried to show that socalled vertical combines are not considered
by our courts as being in themselves illegal.
Let us turn now to the MacQuarrie Report,
the recommend·ations of which have given
birth to the present bill. During our lifetime
we have al read many reports. Generally
these reports have set forth the facts upon
which the findings are based, but in this
respect the MacQuarry Report is quite different. In section 2 of the beginning of this
report there is a mere reference to "private
sources". But the report nowhere refers to
any particular brief, even where it seems that
extracts from briefs are being quoted. Nor
does it refer to any definite evidence. We
may assume, of course, that the commissioners have ascertained' or discovered some
undisclosed facts, but there is nothing factual
in the opinions expressed. I submit that the
comnissioners defend in abstract terms a
very controversial theory of economics. I
must add that, as a starting point, they refer94703-23

in section 3, on page 7-to "a system of
control by private law or agreement". That
seems to be the corner-stone of their thought.
And in paragraph 3, on page 18, which is part
of chapter III, entitled "The Committee's
Views", we read:
resale price maintenance establishes a private
...
system of law allowing no appeal to the courts of
justice, as it is clearly shown in the British White
Paper.

The report then cites an extract from the
W'hite Paper, which is a publication of the
United Kingdom Board of Trade, issued in
June 1951. In a moment I shall refer to
that extract, but first I wish to examine the
assertion that we should prohibit and condemn the fixing of resale prices by individual
suppliers because agreements to fix such
prices are in the nature of a "private system
of law."
I cannot speak for the other provinces, but
in Quebec our whole system of civil law is
based upon what we call, in French, "le principe de la liberté des conventions". In English
I would describe that basic principle, the
corner-stone of our Civil Code and of the
Code Napoléon, as the right to contract freely,
to bind oneself legally by any agreement
which, as it is stated in section 13 of our
Civil Code, is not contrary to "the laws of
public order and good morals." This principle
is consecrated in the famous legal maxim, "La
convention est la loi des parties", "Any valid
agreement has the force of a law governing
the contracting parties."
Under the principle of "la liberté des conventions", or "freedom to contract", any
manufacturer has the right to dispose in the
most absolute manner of the things manufactured by him. He cannot be compelled to
give up such property. Those rights are laid
down in sections 406 and 407 of our Civil
Code. The owner may sell his goods or he
may not sell them. If he decides to sell he
may make the sale subject to a condition,
provided the condition be not, as section 1080
of the Civil Code puts it, "contrary to law or
inconsistent with good morals." I cannot emphasize that principle of our Code too strongly,
for it is upon Liberty-with a capital L-that
our whole legal structure has been built.
Freedom to contract is the very soul of our
civil law. Our ancient writers used to speak
of "la faveur de la liberté," or "the benefit
of freedom." In our system of law the presumption is always in favour of freedom.
Restrictions or incapacities are the exception,
not the rule.
To sum up: an act is lawful unless it is
prohibited either expressly or as contravening
section 13 of the Civil Code, which I have
already quoted.

SENATE
Honourable senators, free enterprise also is
based upon the same fundamental principle
of "la liberté des conventions," or "freedom
to contract." In certain quarters it is now
assumed for the first time that vertical price
fixing is an evil in itself, that it is the negation
of the system of free enterprise. I submit,
on the contrary, that price fixing by individual
suppliers is a commercial custom sanctified
by immemorial usage and thalt it essentially
forms part of free enterprise. Of course,
honourable senators, I can understand very
well that all those who wish to destroy free
enterprise-and among them I would include
in particular the C.C.F.-favour anything
which might tend to replace our liberal economy by some form of totalitarianism. Though
they preach a state-controlled economy-what
I should call a pink strait-jacket-these supporters of the MacQuarrie recommendations
contend, as do the commissioners themselves,
that the prohibition of vertical price fixing
will promote free competition and economic
efficiency, and that it may lower prices somewhat. But nobody has much illusion about
that.
I am not a professional economist, but
as a defender of our liberal economy, as a
firm believer in true and sound Liberalism,
as it was understood in particular by the
late Sir Lomer Gouin and his fellow Liberals
of the time, may I make one or two additional
statements? I know that many persons, better
informed and more experienced than I, share
my views on this matter.
To appease the clamour for price controlwithout wage control, of course-the government offers as a New Year gift to Canadian
consumers the bill which we are now discussing. It is presented as a contribution
to the fight against the high cost of living.
However, nobody believes that it could
possibly have any appreciable effect in
reducing the present scourge of inflation. Of
course, I am opposed to any abuse of the
custom of price fixing, but the outlawing
of even reasonable use of that custom will
destroy the commercial stability which we
now enjoy. I am thinking of conditions in
my own province, with which I am most
familiar. Commercial stability may have
some disadvantages, but it is essential to our
prosperity. At any rate, I believe that no
one would wish to replace it by anarchy.
The banning of any use whatever of the
system of retail price maintenance would
reintroduce into business the principal of the
survival of the fittest: the law of the jungle.
Mr. McGregor, the former Commissioner
under the Combines Investigation Act, a most
conscientious theorist, has the franknessand I congratulate him upon it-to admit
that the amendments proposed in this bill

would eliminate the so-called inefficient
distributors by reducing the number of outlets of distribution, -which supposedly exceeds
the number that the MacQuarrie Commission
considered theoretically necessary.
To put it more plainly, one effect of the
amendments based on the commission's philosophical thesis would be this: In Montreal,
for instance, small groceries at the street
corners would disappear-to the advantage
of the chain stores, which possess the purchasing power of big business. The small
druggists close to our homes would lose
money, and some of them would be obliged to
close their stores. How many bankruptcies
there would be, Mr. McGregor does not know,
nor do I. But in Montreal, in the constituencies inhabited by the middle class and by
workers, proprietors of small businesses,
including grocers and druggists, are most
apprehensive of the result of the measure now
submitted to us.
Vertical price fixing is denouced at page
8 of the interim report of the MacQuarrie
Committee, which adopted the argument of
the British Board of Trade that I mentioned
a few moments ago. I do not know exactly
the conditions that prevailed in the thirties
or that prevail today in the British trade;
I keep my eyes fixed on Canada.
On the question of Canadians being driven
out of trade by action taken behind closed
doors, and not being allowed recourse to the
courts, I shall refer to a few cases which
indicate the situation in our own labour
world. But I first wish to quote section 497
of the Criminal Code:
The purposes of a trade union are not, by reason
nierely that they are in restraint of trade, unlawful within the meaning of the last preceding section.

The last preceding section there referred to
is section 496, which I have already cited, and
which has to do with conspiracies to commit
an unlawful act in restraint of trade.
By section 4 of the Combines Investigation
Act trade unions are, and quite rightly, prolected. The section reads:
Nothing in this Act shall be construed to apply
to combinations of workmen or employees for their
own reasonable protection as such workmen and
employees.

On the subject of labour combinations a
decision was given by the Supreme Court of
Canada fifty-five years ago in the case of
Perrault v. Gauthier, (1897) 28 S.C.R., 241.
In some stone quarries of Quebec members of
a trade union refused to work with a nonunion man. One non-union workman lost his
job, and he was thus prevented from obtaining further employment. The Supreme Court
held that he had no action for damages
against members of the trade union. The

which happened to be distasteful to them as indictable crimes by declaring the purposes to be unlawful.

I am afraid that the present bill is a reactionary step.
One additional criticism which I would
make before resuming my seat is that the
bill does not enact any protection against the
practice of "loss leaders". I am well aware
that some representatives of big business are
in favour of the bill. They have nothing
to fear from the "loss leader"; on the contrary, they occasionally use this device, which
consists of selling an article below cost for
the purpose of enticing customers to their
stores. The provisions contained in section
498A of the Criminal Code, and to which our
leader referred, cover some kinds of "loss
leaders", but I submit there are thousands of
other cases which under the provisions of that
section are not prohibited.
It is all very well to tell us that some
remedial legislation will be enacted at a later
date if it should be then considered necessary.
I fear that by that time great harm will have
been done. While I do not speak as the
representative of any interest, I may say that
a number of small merchants in Montreal
have told me that they are alarmed at this
legislation.
Certain druggists conducting
businesses of average importance have said
that they are in a state approaching panic.
About twenty years ago I appeared on their
behalf before the legislature of Quebec. At
that time, it is true, business in the drug
stores of Montreal was at about its lowest
ebb. These people are now in a much better
position to stand on their own feet, but their
position remains vulnerable in the face of
legislation such as this. It should also be
pointed out that the majority of the population
are very glad to have a drug store located
close to their homes. It may be argued that
from an economic standpoint Montreal would
be better off if its needs were served by no
more than, perhaps, ten drug stores. But
would that really be in the public interest?
I say no. Not only druggists and corner
grocers are affected, but all those whose prosperity is dependent upon them. I accept the
opinions of these people, who know their
business and who are honest and reliable. I
attach the greatest importance to their views
and I sympathize with their anxiety. They
are not theorists; they have the practical
experience and knowledge, which count with
me much more than anything else.
The legislation before us aims at applying
some abstract principle instead of trying in
a practical manner to correct abuses when,
and only when, their existence is proved to
the satisfaction of our courts. Instead of
seeking to prohibit only such abuses, the bill

attempts to destroy freedom to contract. I
repeat that I am as anxious as anybody in
another place can be to correct abuses and
to remove anything which may be detrimental
to the public interest. The present bill, however, is a blanket condemnation of any kind
of price maintenance in the face of experience
that such price maintenance gives stability to
our economy.
I have read again our jurisprudence and I
have studied the entire proceedings-some 900
pages-of the Joint Committee on Combines
Legislation. I have also studied a number
of articles in the various law reports. As a
law student I was interested in so-called
trade combinations, and later the thesis that
I submitted for my degree of Doctor of Laws
dealt with the right to strike and the right
to organize. All the principles that I have
professed since 1919 are opposed to the kind
of legislation now before us. And though
the practice of resale price maintenance may
have become distasteful or obnoxious to the
former commissioner, Mr. McGregor, I find
it strange that during his tenure of office he
never, to the best of my knowledge, did anything to have the practice banned.
Honourable senators, I for one do not
intend to vote in favour of legislation merely
to follow the dictates of anyone else, however well-meaning and conscientious he
nay be. If we adopt this measure we may
one day be faced with "a loose variety of
criminal equity", somewhat akin to the juris-

prudence of the Star Chamber. As a Liberal
I am obliged to make my own judgment,
and to base it on facts as well as on principles. I consider that the legislation submitted to us is contrary to the political and
economic creed which I have always
defended, and I want to preserve what we
still have of our liberal economy in this
country.

SENATE
PRAIRIE FARM ASSISTANCE

BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill 46, an Act to amend
the Prairie Farm Assistance Act, 1939.
He said: As honourable senators are aware,
the Prairie Farm Assistance Act provides for
payments to farmers in the spring wheat area
on a cultivated acreage basis where the crop
yield is low. The purpose of the legislation
now before us is to assist in maintaining bona
fide farmers over the winter and to enable
them to continue their farming operations.
All farmers in the spring wheat area contribute one per cent of the returns from their
marketed crop to the fund from which these
payments are made.
The Act, which has been in effect since
1939, has been amended from time to time.
In 1950 it was amended to exclude from
payments under the Act all Crown and
municipally owned lands which had been
leased or granted to farmers since 1940,
because experience indicated that much of
the land which had been or might be so
leased was submarginal for farming purposes.
It was considered that accessible lands which
had not been taken up prior to 1940 would not
likely bo of a suitable nature for cultivation.
Following the amendment of last year,
representations were made to the effect that
since 1940 certain provincial lands which
were suitable for cultivation had been opened
up for settlement. These lands had not
previously been made available for settlement because of the lack of access roads or
other facilities. Field inspection carried out
by the department substantiated these representations.
For the most part lands in these areas,
along with similar lands still to be opened
up, lie north of township sixty, and the submarginal lands which it is desired to exclude
from the awards lie to the south of that line.
I particularly call the attention of honourable
senators to the words "south of that line,"
for they have a bearing on the amendment
made in the other place, to which I shall
presently refer. The purpose of the amendment is to allow these arable lands to benefit
from the provisions of the Act, and that is
accomplished by removing them from the
restrictive provision introduced by the amendment of 1950.
If honourable senators will refer to the bill
before them they will note that subparagraph
(vi) of section 1 reads as follows:
(vi) lands lying north of township sixty in each
of the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia.

That paragraph was within the past hour
amended in the House of Commons to read:
(vi) lands lying north of the south boundary of
township sixty in each of the provinces of Alberta
and British Columbia.

I assure honourable senators that the
amendment is in keeping with the general
intention and purpose of the Act, and I ask
the house to give favourable consideration
to this measure.
Hon. Mr. Marcotte: Honourable senators,
I do not think any extensive remarks from
me are necessary. This bill appears to be
of an administrative nature and, speaking
for myself and I am sure for those members
on this side who are not in the chamber,
there is no objection to the measure.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
THIRD READNG

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,

when shall the bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: With leave of the
Senate, now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES (NORTH
ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION)
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the

second reading of Bil 15, an Act to provide
for privileges and immunities in respect of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
follows the general scheme adopted in 1947
to give effect to the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations.
The measure calls for approval and confirmation of the agreement set out in the schedule
to it. If and when this bill becomes law,
the Canadian government will take the steps
called for by the Agreement to effect Canadian ratification of the agreement.
The bill further provides that the Governor
in Council may take such action as may be
necessary to carry out the obligations, duties
and rights of Canada under the agreement
when it comes into force. Although no definite
assurance can be given, it is unlikely that
there will be any large-scale exercise of
privileges in Canada by the organization. For
this reason, the bill was drafted in the
simplest and shortest form possible.
The agreement follows generally the form
of agreement which, beginning with the

DECEMBER 29, 1951
General Convention on Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations in 1946, has been
adopted, with more or less minor variations,
to define the privileges and immunities of
practically all important international organizations. Certain departures have, however,
been made from the precedents in order ta
meet the particular requirements of NATO.
Part I contains certain general provisions.
In particular it defines those subsidiary bodies
of the organization to which the agreement
applies. These include any organ, committee
or service established by the council or under
its authority (article 1 (c), except military
headquarters

-

for instance,

SHAPE

-

and,

unless the council decides otherwise, any
other military body.
Part II deals with the status of the organization itself. Article 4 gives it judicial personality. This means that when subsidiary
bodies to which the agreement applies wish ,to
conclude contracts, to acquire and dispose of
movable and immovable property, and to
institute legal proceedings, they shall do so in
the name of the organization.
The immunities and privileges provided for
in articles 5 to 11 are those which by agreements of this type are normally accorded to
international organizations. An article generally found in such agreements concerning the
treatment of official communications in the
matters of priorities, rates and taxes, has been
omitted. A number of governments object to
it, either as being impracticable in their territories or contrary to their national policy; and
the International Telecommunications Union
has raised objection to provisions of this kind
as being contrary to the International Telecommunications Convention.
Part III covers national representatives and
their official staffs, and follows approximately
the pattern established for the United Nations
in New York. In general, those officials, down
to the equivalent of third secretary level,
permanently stationed in another member
state, will enjoy the immunities and privileges
accorded to diplomatic representatives and
their official staffs of comparable rank (article
12); those temporarily in another member
state for NATO purposes will receive a somewhat lower but nevertheless adequate scale
of privileges and immunities accorded to similar personnel under the agreements relating
to other international organizations (article
13); and the official clerical staff .not otherwise
covered will receive a slightly lower scale
(article 14). In article 19, dealing with taxation, a formula has been evolved and very
carefully drawn to provide exemption for
members of the staff who are paid directly
by the organization at the normal rates, but
to enable those states which arrange to pay
94703-24J

their nationals employed on the staff at higher
rates out of their own budgets to charge
income tax on the salaries and emoluments so
paid.
Part V concerns the settlement of disputes.
Parts VI and VII contain final provisions.
The agreement is subject to ratification, and
will come into force when six states have
ratified it. It may be denounced by giving
one year's notice.
May I add, honourable senators, that this
bill has been before the other house in the
last hour or two, and reaches us in the form
in which it was originally presented to that
bouse. As it is highly unlikely that in the
immediate future NATO will have its headquarters or operations here, it is more a case
of the other countries involved extending in
one way or another these immunities to our
nationals. For that reason, and because the
bill is entirely in keeping with our undertakings under the general convention, I ask
the bouse to give it favourable consideration.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

Hon. Mr. Robertson: I move that the bill

The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
PUBLIC WORKS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson moved the
second reading of Bill 26, an Act to amend
the Public Works Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill,
unlike the other two which I have just
explained, was in its original form the subject
of a good deal of contention in the other
place. As at first presented, it was intended
to amend the Public Works Act in consequence of a change in the Financial Administration Act which was approved earlier this
session, whereby provision was made for the
control of tenders for not only the Department of Public Works but all other departments. Section 39 of the Financial Administration Act this year reads as follows:
The Governor in Council may make regulations

with respect to the conditions under which contracts may be entered into and, notwithstanding
any other Act, (a) may direct that no contract by
the terms of which payments are required in excess
of such amount or amounts as the Governor in
Council may prescribe shall be entered into or have
any force or effect unless entry into the contract has
been approved by the Governor in Council or the
Treasury Board, and (b) may mgke regulations

Honourable senators will also note that

contracts are not in respect of prescribed
amounts, but no contracts in excess of an

amount which the Governor in Council may

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
as far as I am aware there is no further

legislation to be dealt with by this house.
At the moment the members of the other
house are putting the finishing touches to the
resolution with respect to the accession of

Greece and Turkey to the North Atlantic
Alliance. The Senate, of course, in its usual
diligent manner has already given approval to

this resolution.

hope that the other house, influenced by the

After which the Right Honourable the
Deputy of the Governor General was pleased
to close the Fifth Session of the Twenty-First
Parliament of Canada with, the following
speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
The people of Canada have been deeply gratified
by the rapid and steady recovery of the King's
Health. The transcontinental tour of Their Royal
Highnesses, the Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of
Edinburg, was the occasion for a universal and
heart-felt manifestation of the attachment of the
Canadian people to the Crown and the Royal
Family.
Throughout the session, my ministers have continued to give constant attention to the policy of
seeking the security of our country in co-operation
with other peace-loving peoples through the establishment of real and lasting peace.
To resist aggression there and to discourage aggression elsewhere, armed forces of our country,
combined with United Nations contingents from
other countries, are performing their duties in
Korea with valour and distinction. Meanwhile,
negotiations to bring about a cease-fire have been
undertaken and are continuing.
Elements of the Army and Air Force have been
despatched to Europe to form part of the integrated
force under the command of General Eisenhower.
In furtherance of our international policies,
certain of my ministers have been absent from
Canada for sessions of the General Assembly and
other organs of the United Nations, for meetings
of the Council and other organs of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization; and for the negotiation of a Pacifie Fisheries Treaty with the United
States and Japan.
You have approved of a protocol which provides
for the extending of an invitation to Greece and
Turkey to join the North Atlantic Alliance.
You have enacted legislation to implement agreements between the parties to the North Atlantic
Treaty regarding the status of their forces. You
also enacted a measure respecting the Canadian
Forces.
The Pension Act bas been amended to provide
for substantial increases in the rates of pension for
disabled veterans and widows of veterans and for
their dependents.

In response to the main purpose for which you
were summoned to the present session, you have
enacted a measure to provide for the payment, from
January 1, 1952, of pensions as a matter of right
and without a means test to all Canadians with
appropriate residence
qualifications who have
attained the age of seventy years.
You have given your approval to a measure to
prohibit persons engaged in manufacturing, buying
or selling articles or commodities from fixing
specific or minimum resale prices.
You have authorized the creation of a corporation
to be known as "The St. Lawrence Seaway Authority" for the purpose of constructing, operating
and maintaining, either alone or in co-operation
with the United States, a deep waterway between
Montreal and Lake Erie.
You have also approved an agreement between
the government of Canada and the government of
the province of Ontario with respect to the development by Ontario, concurrently with an appropriate
authority in the United States, of hydTo-electric
power in the international rapids section of the
St. Lawrence river.
The Railway Act, the Canadian National-Canadian
Pacifie Act and the Maritime Freight Rates Act
have been amended in general conformity with the
recommendations of the Royal Commission on
Transportation.
You have made legislative provision for a limited
guarantee of short-term bank credit to grain producers in the Prairie Provinces, in order to meet
temporary financial difficulties resulting from inclement weather during the harvest season.
You have passed legislation embodying recommendations of the Royal Commission on National
Development in the Arts, Letters and Sciences with
respect to radio broadcasting. You have also revised the legislation respecting the National Gallery
of Canada along the lines of the recommendations
of the Commission. My government is continuing
to give careful consideration to other recommendations in the Commission's report.
You enacted measures respecting the Agricultural
Products Board, Canada Land Surveys, the Revised
Statutes of Canada and the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling.
Amendments have been made to the Dominion
Elections Act; the Judges Act, 1946; the Exchequer
Court Act; the Supreme Court Act; the Public
Printing and Stationery Act; the Bills of Exchange
Act; the Canada-United States of America Tax
Convention Acts of 1943 and 1944; the Civil Service
Act; the Toronto Harbour Commissioners Act; and
the North Fraser Harbour Commissioners Act.
You enacted a measure providing for the financial
administration of the government of Canada, the
audit of the public accounts and the financial control of crown corporations.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
May Divine Providence continue its blessings
upon our nation and upon the efforts of peaceloving peoples to establish the rule of law in the
relations between nations.
