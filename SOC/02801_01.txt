SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
His Excellency the Governor General was
then pleased to open the First Session of the
Twenty-eighth Parliament with the following
speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I have the honour to welcome you to the
first session of the 28th Parliament of Canada.
Across the land there are great expectations of what this Parliament will produce.
My Ministers recognize the responsibility for
leadership which these hopes entail. They are
determined to do al that they can to carry
out the mandate they received from the people of Canada in the recent general election.
They recognize their duty to ensure that the
wishes of Canadians concerning their Government be fulfilled as quickly and as completely as the general advantage will allow.
At the same time my Government is conscious that aspirations and their realization
have to be tempered by a sober awareness of
29234-l

reality. In the complexities of modern society
effective programs take time to develop and
more time to implement. At all stages they
require financial and intellectual resources
which are not unlimited and must be used
with careful planning and the hard judgment of priorities. It is a simple fact of life
that everything cannot be done at once.
My Government has planned the legislative program of this first session in the context of a Parliament of normal duration. To
make way for the consideration in later sessions of new programs that ministers are
already developing, it is proposed, during the
current session, to elucidate priorities and to
set in motion new policies. Of equal importance, though of far less drama, Parliament
will be asked to deal with a host of matters
essential to the smooth and up-to-date functioning of government which were not disposed of in the previous Parliament. My
Government considers that its first responsibility, and the first responsibility of this Parliament, is to clear the accumulation of
essential legislative adjustments, improvements and modernizations left over from the
last Parliament. Unless they are cleared up
promptly, efficient public administration and
the effective operation of the Canadian
economy and society will be hampered.
My Ministers believe that much of the
delay and difficulty in the handling of Parliamentary business during recent years could
have been avoided or reduced by the
improvement of parliamentary rules and
procedures. It is their view that Canadians
feel that Parliament is too far removed from
the people it serves; its operations are too
slow and ponderous; its deliberations are
often insufficiently informed and its decisions
are too few and too much delayed. In order
that parliamentary institutions may retain
the confidence of the people, and in order
that they may cope successfully with the vast
scope and complexity of government today, it
is essential that provision be made for legislative machinery that can act speedily on the
large number of varied, detailed and complicated legislative, financial and policy questions that will be the normal, and indeed the
growing, parliamentary program of the
future. My Government accords the greatest
importance to parliamentary reforn and, to
this end and as a matter of the highest priority, it bas already had useful discussions
with representatives of Opposition parties
concerning changes in the rules and procedures of the House of Commons.

SENATE DEBATES
So that the Official Opposition, to which we
in Canada give formal recognition as a vital
part of our democratic process, as well as the
other parties in opposition, may be in a position to cope more effectively with the heavy
load of action and decision each session must
face, you will be asked to make new provision for the Official Opposition, and the other
parties in their parliamentary role. You will
also be asked to consider additional facilities
for the better discharge of the functions of
Parliament generally.
My Government is deeply and irrevocably
committed to the objectives of a just society
and a prosperous economy in a peaceful
world. My Ministers believe that the unity of
the country is fundamental to the attainment
of these goals, as-indeed---to the enjoyment
by each Canadian of the maximum possible
liberty, happiness and material well-being.
Constitutional reform remains the best longterm guarantee of Canadian unity and my
ministers are directing officials in discussions
with the provinces which are proceeding
well and will, through a series of intergovernmental conferences, lead to proposals that
Parliament will wish to consider. In the
meantime, however, to further the objective
of a united Canada, you will be asked during
the current session, to enact a totally new
Official Languages Act based on the recommendations of the Royal Commission on
Bilingualism and Biculturalism. You will also
be asked to approve a new Publication of
Statutes Act to change the way in which the
law of our bilingual land is presented and
made known in both the official languages of
our land. You will also be asked to consider
measures relating to Indians, to citizenship,
to national symbols, to cultural agencies, to
transportation of all kinds as well as to communications (including satellites), educational
television, and the financing of the Post Office.
Some of these proposals involve the righting of wrongs and others the opening of
opportunities long denied. Together they
exemplify the essential connection between
justice and national unity. The attainment of
a just society is the cherished hope of civilized men. While perhaps more difficult to
formulate for groups than for individuals,
even the members of majorities-political,
religious, linguistic or economic-must know
what it is to suffer injustice. My Government
is deeply concerned to provide and to ensure
increased justice, dignity and recognition to
the individual, particularly in an age which
is characterized by large governments, industrial automation, social regimentation and

September 12, 1968

old-fashioned laws. A great deal has been
accomplished in recent years to make the
Canadian society more just in terms of
income distribution and security against the
vicissitudes of life. Pensions for the aged,
provision for the sick and for the needy have
been made more effective by legislation
passed in recent Parliaments and by action
of the provinces. Notwithstanding such measures, poverty continues to exist in Canada.
My Government recognizes that, but it also
believes that it would be deluding and cruel
to pretend that there is a simple, all-encompassing or instantaneously effective remedy.
Poverty can be dealt with successfully and
permanently only by continued and determined action in a variety of ways by all
governments. For its part, Parliament can be
assured that the federal Government will
contribute fully and assume leadership wherever it can properly do so. To this end, the
proposals you will have for your consideration will include the establishment of a
department charged with the objective of
ensuring that people in all areas and regions
of our country have as equal access as possible to the opportunities of Canada's economic
development.
At the same time, there are other and
broader elements vital to a just society, and
my Ministers feel that these must receive, at
this and in later sessions of Parliament, a
degree of attention they have not had hitherto. Toward these ends, you will be asked to
enact important changes in the Criminal
Law, to provide new protections for consumers and investors, to up-date food, drug and
health legislation, to revise or amend legislation relating to the machinery of justice, and
to correct a number of particular injustices,
including those resulting from certain provisions of the Industrial Relations and Disputes
Investigation Act. During the course of the
present session it is anticipated that the Government will receive reports from inquiries
with regard to labour legislation and veterans pensions, and it is the intention of my
Ministers to bring their proposals in these
matters before you as soon as possible.
My Government believes that the objective
of a just society must always include the
pursuit of a prosperous economy as well as
the fair distribution of its proceeds. Just as
we have in the past tended, perhaps, to consider justice in our society largely in material
terms, so we must recognize that there has
been a tendency in Parliament and to some
degree in Government to concentrate on the
distributive aspects of our economy. In this

September 12, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

course we have sometimes tended to neglect
those aspects that can affect the productivity
of our country, and hence the total provision
of economic well-being for our society, and
its competitiveness in the changing conditions
of the modern world. The natural resources
of Canada and the industries based upon
them continue to be of immense importance
to our economy but the advantages of our
great physical resources by themselves are no
longer an adequate base for a growing and
prosperous modern economy. We shall
increasingly have to compete on even terns
with those countries of the world which are
most advanced technologically in the provision of the sophisticated products of modern
life. Unless Canada can maintain an economy
that is efficient, competitive and productive
in relation to the most advanced nations on
earth, we cannot have the basis for a society
from which poverty has been eliminated, we
cannot maintain high levels of employment
and income and we cannot ensure the standard of life to which Canadians generally
aspire. It is against this background, as well
as with the consciousness that the interests of
al must be fairly balanced, that the Government is approaching its policies and programs of an economic character. In this same
context, Parliament will be asked during the
present session to consider proposals for a
systematic and continuous review of prices
and costs in our economy.
Just as incomes cannot increase faster
than productivity if price increases are to be
restrained, so government spending by all
levels of government cannot increase faster
than productivity if we wish to restrain the
increase in levels of taxation. These two
realities are among the most important that
Canadians and their leaders must bear in
mind during the months and years ahead.
Measures that you will have to consider
relating to the Kennedy Round reflect the
outcome of a major international effort to
reduce the barriers to international trade and
emphasize the opportunities opening up for a
great trading nation like Canada. A measure
to be brought before you dealing with the
amendment of the Bretton Woods arrangements results from comparable efforts to stabilize and improve the whole international
financial system.
Conscious of the limitations it must place
on its expenditures, my Government has
acted within the framework of previously
announced guidelines to select carefully the
programs which in the light of regional needs

and opportunities it considers most promising
for the promotion of a prosperous economy.
My Ministers will bring before you legislation relating to the encouragement of manpower programs, regional improvements,
domestic investment, export development, and
resource administration, including a Yukon
Mineral Act and an Oil and Gas Production
Act relating to Canada's increasingly important northern resources. In addition, my Government will propose a Freshwater Fish
Marketing Act, and intends to investigate
immediately a number of methods for promoting greater efficiency in the production
and marketing of grains, including the establishment of a National Grains Council. You
will be asked to approve amendments to the
Farm Improvement Loans Act, the Farm
Credit Act, the Farm Machinery Syndicates
Act, the Prairie Grain Advance Payments
Act, and the Fisheries Improvement Loans
Act. You will be asked to consider a Canada
Development Corporation Act, a Federal
Cooperatives Act and an Export Development
Corporation Act.
The growth of our population and the
changes in the nature of our mobile urban
and industrial society lend a new importance
to conservation in its traditional sense. We
have taken and are taking effective strides
through
conservation
economic
toward
progressively better use of our resources to
achieve a high and long-term productivity.
We must also give new attention before it is
too late to the preservation of our natural
heritage for the enjoyment of Canadians of
future generations. You will be asked to consider measures concerning National Parks
and Historic Sites and Monuments. These
and other facilities for the repose of the mind
and restoration of the spirit, for sport, and
for physical relaxation are and will be of
increasing importance to our social environment. They offer Canadians and to visitirs to
Canada the possibility of a quality of life
richly satisfying and ever more difficult to
come by in this and in other industrial countries. Of broader importance is the problem
of pollution, which must receive increased
attention from federal, provincial and municipal governments. My Ministers are actively
engaged in preparing proposals on these subJects and, in due course, these will be
brought before you for your examination.
The natural riches with which Canada is
blessed must serve to remind us that we have
a substantial responsibility and a great opportunity in matters of foreign aid. My Government intends to press forward its plans and

SENATE DEBATES

programs for international cooperation and
development which include the establishment
in Canada of an International Development
Centre.
In international affairs generally, my Ministers regard the current situation as uncertain and deeply disturbing. Talks are under
way in Paris concerning Vietnam but so far
negotiations have not advanced as we had
hoped they might. The Government has followed with anxiety the attempts to promote a
peaceful settlement in Nigeria and has participated actively in international efforts to
relieve the sufferings of the civilian population. The situation in Czechoslovakia has also
caused the gravest concern to the Government, not only for its effects on the prospects
of détente and future evolution within Communist countries, but also for its consequences for the freedom and well-being of
the Czechoslovak people. For those of them
who have to seek refuge in other countries,
my Ministers have already taken steps to
offer permanent homes in Canada.
The Government has undertaken and is
pursuing a thorough review of our external
and defence policies. Canada's contribution to
NATO, relations with Peking, with Latin
America and with Europe are bein g studied
currently. Reviews of our relations with
other areas will be undertaken later and, as
conclusions are reached, Parliament will be
invited to consider them.
The events in other lands to which I have
referred are a vivid reminder that our good
fortune as Canadians includes rights and
freedoms as well as material advantages.
They alert us to need not only for vigilance
in the conservation of our democratic institutions but also to the importance of constant
concern for their improvement. Efficient government responsive to public requirements
and open to public participation is essential
to the meaningful operation of the democratic process. It will be the more vital in the
future as technology and science provide new
and more immediate means for the dissemination of information and for the involvement as individuals of all our people. The
Government has already taken steps to
review its information services in order to
introduce as soon as possible improvements
by which the flow of information into and
out of the Government will be more efficient
and effective permitting the people of Canada
a continuing informed and more active participation in the activities of their Government. In addition as part of the continuing
process of modernization and development of

September 12, 1968

governmental machinery you will be asked
during the current session to enact a Government Organization Act. This measure will
complete a number of changes in organization
and structure announced by the Prime Minister some weeks ago and will complement the
Parliamentary reforms so fundamental to the
successful operation of our democratic institutions.
The reinforcement and renovation of Parliamentary and administrative machinery
and the clearing away of the substantial
backlog now outstanding in the legislative
program will free Parliament so that it can
come to grips with difficult and pressing
problems relating to youth, poverty, regional
disparities, urban growth, individual welfare
and the application and encouragement of
scientific technology. These subjects are of
concern to all governments in Canada and it
is clear that a great deal more has to be done
than has so far been contemplated. It would
be wrong however to expect solutions to be
found easily or indeed to be found at all
except on the basis of close co-operation in
good faith between federal, provincial and
municipal governments, not only in planning
but in implementation as well.
To assist in this process it would be useful
to have available to all governments an institute where long-term research and thinking
can be carried out into governmental matters
of all kinds. At the present time there is no
such facility available in this country and it
is the intention of my Ministers to bring
before you in the near future legislation that
will fill this most important gap in our governmental apparatus.
Members of the House of Commons:
During the current session you will be
asked to appropriate the funds required for
the services and payments authorized by
Parliament. In addition to this business the
legislative program that the Government proposes is very extensive but many of the items
have been seen before or are of an uncontroversial nature. A list of the Bills relating
to the matters to which I have referred will
be tabled by the Prime Minister later this
day and other portions of the program will
be brought forward as the session proceeds.
It is very important to the proper government of the country in the years ahead that
the proposals for the current session be
dealt with. In Canada as in other countries
of the world democracy today faces a decisive challenge. It must adapt to new circumnstances and new demands or fail in its purpose. This challenge is not abstract but a

Hon. Lazarus Phillips moved, seconded by
Hon. Raymond Eudes:
That the following Address be presented to His Excellency the Governor General to off er the humble thanks of this
house to His Excellency for the gracious
speech which he has been pleased to
make to both Houses of Parliament,
namely:
To His Excellency, the Right Honourable Roland Michener, Chancellor and
Principal Companion of the Order of
Canada, upon whom has been conferred
the Canadian Forces' Decoration, Governor General and Commander-in-Chief of
Canada.
May it please Your Excellency:
We, Her Majesty's most loyal and
dutiful subjects, the Senate of Canada,
in Parliament assembled, beg leave to
offer our humble thanks to Your Excellency for the gracious speech which
Your Excellency has addressed to both
Houses of Parliament.
Honourable senators, I pray your indulgence
as this is the first time that I have had the
privilege of speaking to you in this chamber.

upon unrivalled continuous experience for
many years in the public arena.
In recent months the Canadian electorate
has expressed its views as to the constitution
of the membership of the other house, with
consequent Government changes. As a result
of such election, we are assured of political
stability.
The cry for Canadian unity has resounded
loudly through the land, and we in this
chamber, together with those in the other
chamber, are now called upon to give effect
to the views of the electorate. This is not the
time for smug self-assurance on the part of
the victors, or for wakes on the part of the
non-victors. What is required is an inspired
desire and will to proceed to the performance
of great tasks.
In this connection, knowing, as I do, the
love of country shared by Senator Flynn and
his colleagues, and without derogation from
Senator Flynn's high responsibilities as Leader of the Opposition, we can look forward to
a very serious session of deliberations, for
the consideration of legislation and other
matters.
I thank my Leader (Hon. Mr. Martin) for
the honour accorded me in moving the
Address in Reply to the Speech from the
Throne. I come, honourable senators, from an
ancient and proud race, and I practise a
religion which has not been unconnected
with the spread of civilization on this planet.
I should like to feel that when the Right
Honourable Lester Pearson recommended my
appointment to this chamber he had in mind

will agree with me that in the development
of our beloved Canada this group has contributed its fair share to the country's communal, political, economic, cultural and intellectual activities.

[Translation]
First of all, I wish to take this opportunity
to congratulate the honourable Senator Deschatelets on his appointment. He succeeds the
honourable Senator Sydney J. Smith who bas
discharged so admirably the arduous duties
of that office.
Our new speaker has already proved his
great qualities as an individual and as a
member, qualities which, enhanced by his
personal charm, guarantee that under his
guidance, our debates will proceed according
to the highest traditions of this august
chamber.
Indeed, those who most deserve to be congratulated are all the honourable senators.

SENATE DEBATES

We have been subjected in recent days to a
shock of a different nature in terms of the
report submitted by the Economie Council of
Canada. The low standard of living of a large
portion of our population surely calls for
profound study.
[Translation]
We, twenty million Canadians, can hardly
boast of the vast natural resources by which
Divine Providence blessed our country, as long
as a substantial proportion of our fellow-citizens spend their lives in the shadow of poverty and despair.
[English]
The report suggests that this chamber
could well be used as the instrument for a
study of the root causes of this problem, and
for the formulation of remedial policies for
submission to the proper executive authority.
Honourable senators are aware, of course,
that the present Government is giving serious
consideration to this whole subject matter,
and I am sure that this house would want
the honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Martin) to inform his colleagues of
our appreciation of our responsibilities and
of our desire to co-operate in every way
possible.
I have alluded to the subject matter of
national unity. Born and reared as I have
been in the Province of Quebec, I am
extremely responsive to the legitimate aspirations of the predominant majority in my
provmce.
Having regard to my membership in a socalled minority of minorities, I must, however, with emphasis, draw the attention of
honourable senators to the fact that there are
millions of Canadians in this country who
are not classified as belonging to the so-called
two founding races. I should like to record
the views of this important grouping that in
the pluralistic mosaic of Canada the aspirations and ambitions of all Canadians must be
placed on an equal footing. This is not by
way of suggesting any delimitation or restriction to the legitimate constitutional and historic rights of the two great races that assisted in founding this country.
[Translation]
National unity will not exist within our
country and, as a nation, our destiny will
remain unachieved until such time as the
word "Canadian" means, for all Canadians,
the sum total of the rights, privileges, duties

and obligations which every citizen of this
country enjoys and shares equally, from sea
to sea, regardless of his ethnic origin or
religion.
[English]
During the last election campaign we
heard a great deal about Senate reform.
We are living in a country where universal
suffrage has changed the character of our
parliamentary institutions and of the executive branch of government. The legitimate
but, on occasion, strident demands of the
social welfare state expressed through its
citizenry bas resulted in the evolution of governmental institutions now under the control
of the executive and administrative branches
of our federal Government.
This in itself is not an evil, provided that
there are necessary corrective forces to see
that authority does not lead to abuse, and
abuse to indifference to the public welfare.
In this respect the judiciary can play an
important part having regard to the constitutional protections, both written and unwritten, enjoyed by every citizen.
Honourable senators, this chamber, in my
opinion, can also perform a useful purpose in
that respect. Contrary to some impressions,
the concept that this house is a citadel of
privilege and a fortress of prejudice does not
conform to the facts. To the extent that we
were subjected to feudalism in this country,
we have emerged from this condition and this
house does not partake of those outdated and
quasimediaeval characteristics. It is my view,
therefore, that this house can be considered
as one which is completely au courant with
current social and political trends. In our
deliberations in this august chamber, it is my
earnest belief that one of our prime duties
should be to see that at all times the fundamental rights of our fellow Canadians are
not impaired in any way and that our essential liberties remain at all times without
being subject to erosion.
It might well be desirable that a careful
study be made by a committee of this house
to consider ways and means for the purposes
of bringing about this desired objective.
The constitutional issue and the distribution of powers between the central and provincial governments is, of course, a matter of
grave concern to all of us. Al governing
bodies enjoy the privilege of taxing the citizen and in the struggle for such right too
little attention is paid to the citizen who,
because of the bloodletting, may be subjected
to a form of anaemia which in due course
could lead to an accelerated demise.

SENATE DEBATES

In the final analysis the wellbeing of the
community consists in the happiness of the
individual, and surely that individual is most
happy in a free state when he is given the
opportunity to accumulate some worth for
the benefit of his family. In my professional
capacity I have witnessed the results of the
impairment of initiative resulting from excessive taxation. Notwithstanding the pressures of groups, this country will not succeed
in reaching true maturity and great heights
unless the individual is encouraged to
improve his lot to a reasonable degree. Such
encouragement leads to improved education
by the individual himself, greater initiative
and a display of discipline, all of which tend
to improve the person himself.
These observations, I am aware, ring in the
ears of some people as if I were speaking
from a nineteenth century platform. In my
opinion, however, these good old-fashioned
virtues still have considerable value.
Universal suffrage, as predicted, tends to
make governments responsive to group pressures. Courage is required to resist the same.
However, it is the duty of government not to
spoon-feed people but to create that political,
economic and social climate which will enable the individual to develop the inner qualities and gifts with which he is endowed by
nature. Let us hear less of giving and a little
more of encouraging others to do things for
themselves.
It is part of the normal political scene in a
democratic country to hear much about the
"just society", disparity in regional economic
development, our lag in the production of
technical facilities for the development of our
natural resources, our failure to increase our
gross national product at a fair rate, our
serious maladjustment in the distribution of
our gross national product, our fear of
foreign investment, the relationship of capital, business and labour, the generation gap
and campus unrest, all of which cumulatively
create in the minds of some people a certain
malaise. This should not be so.
The subject-matters to which I have just
referred are merely the normal problems that
arise within a vigorous democratic nation
which is on the march. We should not be
worried about differences of opinion between
various groups of our population, because
perfection is not the lot of man and there
will always be problems that will have to be
solved. I would assume that honourable senators would prefer living in a vigorous imperfect society rather than be lulled into lassitude in a perfect society.

Sepiember 13, 1968

What is important, however, and what
should be the cause for concern, is the fact
that some of these problems are approached
by fellow Canadians with acrimony, bitterness, lack of understanding and respect and,
alas, sometimes with violence. In such an
atmosphere solutions of a lasting nature cannot be made.
The essence, as I see it, honourable senators, is that we must attempt to develop, not
by way of lip-service only, but, in truth, a
mutual regard and respect one for the other,
and having done so we must mobilize not
only our personal intellectual resources but
also all the institutional facilities that we
have available-our provincial governments,
our federal government, our business institutions, our universities-all these co-operating
in any orderly fashion to meet the problems
of the day.
A great political thinker of the nineteenth
century-my impression is that it was Walter
Bagehot-stated that there is a danger that
people do not truly believe in the biblical
message that man was made in the image of
God. If one truly believed that this were so,
then one could appreciate the divine spark
that rests in all of us, and this would be very
helpful indeed when sitting down to conference tables in attempting to solve differences.
We open our deliberations in this chamber
by reading from the Bible. As we listen to
these prayers it would be well also to hear
that voice from the Bible which speaks of
this divine spark.
Let us, therefore, honourable senators,
thank Providence for this our great and
glorious country. Let us commit ourselves to
the cause of world peace. Let us attempt to
obliterate, or at least reduce, poverty in our
land. Let us in utter humility attempt to be
fair to all of those who have been denied
some of the good things of life that are given
to others. In the process we shall enrich our
own personalities and bring about a greater
and richer Canada.
Before closing I desire to thank honourable
senators for the courtesies and amenities
extended to me since my entry into this
chamber. I am particularly grateful to Senator Flynn for overlooking the fact that I have
been a loyal and persistent devotee of a
party to which he does not belong, and in
this respect he has overlooked my lack of
judgment and perspicacity.
I should also like to remind the bouse that

SENATE DEBATES

In Canada, poverty is a fact of life. Its
persistance at a time where the majority of
Canadians enjoy one of the highest standards
of living in the world is a disgrace.
How can we speak of a just society in
Canada when a fifth of its citizens do not
partake of its material wealth, when whole
areas of its territory, well-defined geographically, are almost excluded from its
prosperity?
How can we speak of a just society when,
we know from experience what difficulties
certain classes of our society encounter to
pick up those crumbs of a prosperity which,
in fact, is theirs by rights.
The Speech from the Throne heralds the
determination of the government to establish
and strengthen this just society in which all
Canadians, whatever their region, their language their profession or trade, may take a
full share in the affluent society which is
Canada. The human mind does not know of
rest. The establishment of a just society is
everybody's responsibility. It is a primordial
and essential truth, which cannot bear one
instant of apathy. In particular, it is our
truth, the truth of the members of this Parliament and of the Senate. There will always be
problems, evils to suppress, improvements to
make. The progress of science and technology
are changing the world each day, and every
government must be ready to adapt itself to
inevitable changes. None of their gaps can be
filled without a constant intellectual effort,
without financial resources which, because
they are limited, must be used according to a
careful and general planning and a strict
order of priorities.
The just society will require the revision of
our federation, with a view that justice in
our country is but an idle dream without a
stronger Canadian unity, a closer and more
efficient co-operation between the federal
Government and the provinces, both with
regard to economic and financial as well as
linguistic and cultural matters.
Social security programs, legislation concerning industrial relations and labour disputes must also be revised in the light of the
experience now acquired and of the basic
principles concerning the relations between
the State and the individual. An individual
realization of that fact is necessary, because
the State cannot do everything; it is not a
perpetual Santa Claus. It must not replace
the individual and relieve him of his obligations. However, it is its responsibility to see

September 13, 1968

to it that each and every right of the
individual is preserved and to protect aggressively every one of his liberties; for
instance, with regard to advertising, definitely exaggerated and often deceiving, on health,
consumption and investment. We must also
get rid of stupid slogans religiously followed
such as "Buy now, pay later".
Therefore, a just society is on the one hand
a just Canada. It is also and especially a just
world. Our role extends to the international
society and, at that level, our responsibilities
are unlimited.
We, as Canadians, are really privileged.
We live in an affluent society, in a civilization whose standard of living makes it even
possible to consider the organization of our
leisure time, while two-thirds of the humanity
fight daily for their survival.
How many men, women and children have
died from hunger, disease or exhaustion since
the speech from the throne was read. How
many of them have fallen victims of disasters
or wars of which we had a glimpse only a
few days ago on our TV screens, as we
thanked God we were spared. At this very
minute, how many babies are born only te be
doomed to about thirty years of a miserable
life, obsessed by the daily hunt for a slice of
bread or a bowl of rice. The gap separating
the "have" and the "have not" nations is
getting forever deeper at an alarming pace.
The rich become richer and the poor
become poorer. The political tension between
East and West is not relaxing and is second
only to another tension, which is vital for
mankind, between the Northern and the
Southern hemispheres.
The countries of Latin America, Africa and
Asia are desperately seeking to occupy the
place which is theirs, by right, at the table of
humanity, under which fall sparingly the
remains left by privileged nations.
Two thirds of humanity call for their just
society.
Our responsibilities are enormous. They
are burdensome, all the more so because
Heaven has gratified us with privileges we
do not deserve. Just society has no nationality. A just society in Canada cannot be conceived without a just society in the world.
The setting up of such a just society in
Canada and in the world will be the basic
concern of our business during this session.
The Speech from the Throne is a starting
point. Let all the bills we shall have to exam-

RETIREMENT OF HON. THOMAS VIEN, HON. M.
WALLACE McCUTCHEON, AND HON. JEANFRANÇOIS POULIOT; DEATH OF HON. F. W.
GERSHAW AND HON. CHARLES GAVAN
POWER
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, during the prorogation of Parliament
five of our colleagues resigned or died and
are no longer with us. The Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Martin) bas been kind
enough to suggest that on this occasion it
might be appropriate, because I had been the
Leader of the Government during their
terms here, if I led off in the tributes that are
customarily paid to our departed colleagues. I
thank him indeed for this courtesy. I am sure,
Mr. Speaker, both you and the new Leader of
the Government will understand if on an
occasion like this I do not observe the amenities usually accorded both to a new Leader
and to a new Speaker. That I will perhaps
have occasion to do in the course of the
debate on the Speech from the Throne.
The first of our colleagues to which I would
refer is the Honourable Thomas Vien, who
resigned from the Senate on April 1, 1968. I
do not intend to repeat the tribute which was
paid to Senator Vien-a former Speaker of
this house-on December 20 last. We all
remember the pleasant occasion then, when
we honoured both Senator Vien and Senator
Power, on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of their entry into Parliament. It was a
Confederation project of the Senate, if you
will. Both had seen Confederation develop
from the benches of Parliament and both had
contributed personally to the process.
Senator Vien was 26 years in the Senate.
He was appointed in September 1942. In
Parliament he held many important offices.
He was elected Deputy Speaker of the House
of Commons in 1940, was summoned to the
Senate in 1942, and appointed Speaker of the
Senate in 1943. He is, and was, one of the
leaders of the Bar of Montreal, and I am
happy to say he continues his practice there.

September 17. 1968

I sometimes wonder if we ever had a more
courteous or a more gentlemanly colleague
than Senator Vien. His was certainly la
grande manière-and he did not assume it; it
was in his makeup.
On behalf of all senators, I thank him for
the years, the many years, of service which he
rendered to Parliament; and in doing so I
wish for him and for his wife and children,
and for their children, many years of happiness together.
We sustained another loss in the resignation
of Senator M. Wallace McCutcheon on May 13
of this year. Senator McCutcheon was one of
our colleagues for but six short years. In that
time, however, he made a very notable contribution to the Senate. Abundantly reflected
in his speeches was his broad experience in
business and in many other facets of national
life. In committees his examination of witnesses testified not only to his early training
as a lawyer but to his eminence in the field of
actuarial science.
Idle words never fell from Senator
McCutcheon's lips here. He was too preoccupied with the serious work that was to be
done both in Government and in Opposition.
He was a Minister, at first without portfolio
but later of Trade and Commerce.
The bare elements of his career in the Parliamentary Guide are a litany of offices he
held in enterprises both public and private
that contribute enormously to our national
life.
Personally, I regretted his decision to
resign. In fact, I tried to dissuade him, as did
many other senators, but he wanted, in his
own words, "to be where the action was"in the House of Commons. His motives were
noble, even if history and precedent-including the notable precedent of the Right Honourable Arthur Meighen-were against him.
Honourable senators, action in public
affairs is a virtue, but so too are reflection
and wise judgment, and, as he proved by his
years of performance, Senator McCutcheon
would have been just as effective here as in
the other house.
As I thank him for his immense service to
Parliament and, incidentally, for his personal
kindness to me during the years of my leadership, I express on behalf of all of his former colleagues here our wish that, with his
wonderful wife and fine family around him,
he will find satisfaction in all his future
undertakings as weil as in the distinguished
service he gave with the Senate as his forum.

September 17, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

I think it came as somewhat of a shock to
us all on June 28 to learn that Jean François
Pouliot had resigned his seat in the Senate.
No one will deny the independence of Senator
Pouliot in thought, w'ord and deed. My first
recollection of him is from the days when I
was a student. I was having a holiday on the
lower St. Lawrence and, as I was going past
the parish church in Cacouna on Sunday
mornmg after mass, Jean François was standing in the back of a car haranguing the crowd.
I need not tell you that there was an election
on. He was fiery then and the fire even yet is
not an ember.
Senator Pouliot came from a family which
served its province and its country in public
life through three generations. His own service probably outstripped them all. He was in
the House of Commons for 31 years of continuous service from 1924 and he was in the
Senate, where he had 13 years' service, from
1955-a total of 44 years of service to the
Parliament of his country. In these years he
strove mightily for the welfare of the people
of Temiscouata. One never thinks of Temiscouata without immediately thinking of JeanFrançois Pouliot. His people look out from
their fertile farms to the Laurentians to the
north, farther away than the 25-mile expanse
of the St. Lawrence at that point; they see the
beautiful offshore islands, the Pilgrims and
Brandy Pots; they see the shipping of the
world pass by; they are a contented, lawabiding people and Jean-François Pouliot
made himself part of their daily life.
One wishes one could record some of the
events of his parliamentary career. Today
colour is said to be a great asset in public
life. He invented it! Today pungent criticism
is of the very fabric of public debate. He
epitomized it! Today bilingualism is one of
our worthiest national goals. He personified
it! Today humour and wit still enliven the
political dialogue, or should. Both were the
handmaidens of his performances! I hope
some day his biography will be written, and
it might well be called "An Independent
among Partisans". Certainly we shall miss
him.
As a lawyer, as a juristconsult, as a journalist, as a man with a sense of history-all
this is in his record, though only sketched in
the Canadian Parliamentary Guide. Perhaps
it is to be found more voluminously in the
records of Hansard both of the House of
Commons and of this honourable house.

We wish the charming Madame Pouliot,
their son François and himself health and
contentment and many years of retirement.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): The Epic
of Gilgamesh was one of Babylon's most
ambitious efforts. Its discussion of man's pursuit of immortality is rather important in the
early Babylonian literature, and I select this
important passage from that part of the work.
It reads as follows:
O Gilgamesh, where are you going?
The life you are seeking you will never find.
When the gods created mankind, death they
allotted to man
But life they kept in their own hands.
How true we find this in the Senate! On
June 26 yet another of our colleagues passed
to the Great Beyond in the person of the
Honourable Dr. Fred W. Gershaw. It is difficult adequately to express the profound sense
of loss which all honourable senators will feel
on his passing. Senator Gershaw was conscientious; he was dedicated to the Senate
and to the work of its committees, perhaps
particularly, Senator Roebuck, to your committee, the Divorce Committee.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Parliament was a life that he not only loved but
ennobled. He was 15 years in the House of
Commons; he was 25 years in the Senate.
Dr. Gershaw was a great physician. Technically he was capable, and his practice and the
work of his clinic in Medicine Hat testify to
that. But, above all, be was a compassionate
man; be had feeling for his fellow men. He
was, indeed, a true Christian humanist, and
we saw this so often here when honourable
senators felt the need for a physician's
services.
The speeches he made in this chamber
were not frequent. They were quiet. They
were concise. They were informative. He had
an acute awareness of scientific developments, particularly in the field of medicine.
He was very much in the van of progress in
that field, for the alleviation of human suffering. On numerous occasions he spoke here on
the problems of health in the underdeveloped
countries-which constitute some two-thirds
of the world's population-and be had direct
experience of the needs of those countries
through his work in the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association.

SENATE DEBATES
He came from the west country. He loved
it. He was born there. He was trained there.
There he developed the integrity and the
competence of his professional life. He
worked there, and he spoke of its peoples and
their problems. He wrote of its history and
development in his little book of essays entitled, "The Short Grass Area-Stories of
Southern Alberta." He was a great family
man, and to mourn him he leaves a wife and
four daughters.
Dr. Gershaw had a full life, a good life,
because he lived a life of service. Of him it
can truly be said, "He loved his neighbour."
I am sure too that on May 30 everyone was
more than deeply shocked to learn of the
death of Charles Gavan Power. I happened to
be in Athens, Greece, in mid-June, returning
from a Commonwealth Parliamentary Association meeting in Mauritius. When I was
there I wrote a letter to Chubby in which I
said that I was writing from the place where
Demosthenes had made his reputation as an
orator. I joked about the absence of oratory
in Greece just then, but the plethora of it
that he must be experiencing in Canada during the election period. Little did I know that
he would never see that note, because when
it was written he was dead and buried.
When we honoured Senator Power on
December 20 last, I called him a living
legend. How happy we all are that we
marked the fiftieth anniversary of his entry
into Parliament. At the gathering in Mr.
Speaker Smith's chambers his little speech,
including his reference to my colleague to my
immediate right, Senator Lamontagne, was so
delightful! I personally relish the criticism he
made of me, which was accurately recorded
in the Ottawa Journal. I had said that no one
but he had sat for 50 years continuously in
the Parliament of Canada. How quick he was
to say, "As usual, Connolly is wrong. Laurier
has the record." In my rooms later I had an
opportunity to chide him on his arithmetic. I
was tempted to write the Ottawa Journal a
letter with the heading: "Chubby is still the
Champ". For Laurier was elected to Parliament in 1874 and was dead in 1919. He had 45
years of continuous service in Parliament.
Chubby had more than fifty!
Honourable senators, I shall not review his
career again. Our Hansard, on a previous occasion, is adequate in that respect. It is of the
man that I would speak. I would speak of his
kindness, of his generosity, of the sort of
devil-may-care attitude that he displayed so
much, of his great wit, and, indeed, of his

September 17, 1968

deep humour. He loved good talk. He loved
good companions. He loved good books.
In December I remember quoting some
lines from Belloc that he had used in the
other place in 1942 when the 25th anniversary
of his election to Parliament was observed.
Those lines run:
From quiet homes and first beginnings,
Out to the undiscovered ends,
There's nothing worth the wear of winning
But laughter and the love of friends.
Those lines, I think, epitomize Chubby Power's philosophy of life. He had friends galore-Irish, French, English, and Scotch-all
of us.
Of his career, I think he might be content
if I paraphrase Belloc in this way:
When I am dead, I hope it may be said:
"His sins were scarlet, but his words
were read."
For words of wisdom in abundance Chubby
had-wisdom born of a deep experience of
politicians whom he admired and respected,
and of voters who loved him.
He has published a book. Some day there
should be a biography written of him.
In my mind's eye, I can see his colleagues
and friends, those who knew him best, talking of him around the convivial hearth. They
will speak of his escapades with Lucien Cannon and many others. They will speak of his
election demeanours, and perhaps too of his
self-admitted electoral misdemeanours. They
will speak of his humanity-at times strong,
and at times weak. And, honourable senators,
only of a great man can one say such things
in a chamber as august as this one. They will
speak of his days in the Ministry for Air, and
of his work on behalf of the veterans as their
Minister.
They will wonder at the enigma of his
resignation from the Ministry, when he went
out for one reason and Colonel Ralston went
out for the opposite. They will marvel at his
courage too when he, Lapointe, and Cardin,
in the interests of a unified national war
effort, took on the Duplessis Government in
1939, which was then at the height of its
power, and defeated it. His own career and
the life of the federal Government of which
he was a member was on the line on that
occasion, but courage and determination won
through.
His story is indeed a profile in courage, and
his life an exercise in the promotion of
national unity.

There will be much to say in a biography
of Chubby, and much of it will be the good
talk he loved.
His body lies tonight in the warm soil of
his beloved Quebec. May that soil lie lightly
on him. May "his grave the warmer and
sweeter be." His warm heart is stilled. May
his noble soul, now gathered unto his fathers,
rest in perpetual peace.
Han. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators,
as you have been reminded by Senator John
Connolly, it is less than a year ago since I
and others rose in this chamber to praise both
Senator Power and Senator Vien, wlio lield
the record of having been elected to the other
place in December, 1917.
Senator Power holds a record that no other
Canadian ever held, that of being in Parliament for an uninterrupted perîod of 50 years.
Last summer lie passed away after a short
illness. Known to ail as "Cliubby", the late
senator had a most engaging personality. A
parliamentarian in the truest sense of the
word, as was said by Senator Connolly, he
has been for a long time a living legend.
Chubby Power had only friends, and even
his political foes liad great admiration for
him. After his return from, the First World
War, wliere lie was wounded twice, lie was
elected in 1917 to represent the riding of Quebec South in the House of Commons. His
constituents renewed his mandate and their
confidence in him ten times, and hie represented them in the House of Commons until
lie was summoned to the Senate in 1955.
During the Second World War, as Minîster
of Defence witli particular responsibility for
the Air Force, Senator Power not only built
our own Canadian Air Force but was responsible for the success of the Commonwealth
Air Training Program.
A traditional politician, he built tlie nowdisappeared riding of Quebec Soutli into one
of the strongest Liberal ridings in Quebec.
Only once did the Conservatives win it, and I
liad this unique lionour. His talent as a politi..
cal organizer was equalled only by lis talent
as a parliamentarian. A die-hard Liberal, he
nevertheless on several occasions criticized
lis party's stand, and everybody recalîs that
he resigned from Mr. King's Cabinet on the
conscription issue.
It miglit be long before Canadian politics
produces another man like Senator Power. At
this Urne I wish again ta assure Mrs. Power,
her two sons, Francis Gavan and William
Pendleton, and her daughter Rosemary, and
aîl the members of the late senator's family,

of our deepest regret, and to extend my personal condolences and tliose of the political
group on this side of the chamber.
[Translation]
I mentioned earlier that we had marked in
December the 50th anniversary of the election
to the House of Commons of Senator Vien,
wlio has decided to go into well-deserved
retirement. Senator Vien lias had a career
whicli can only be compared to that of Senator Power. He is retiring from public life
after over 50 years of loyal service to lis
country for, even during the period wlien lie
sat neither ln this house nor lin the other
place, lie was a member of the railway
commission.
As I have already pointed out, Senator
Vien was elected to tlie House of Commons
for the flrst time in 1917, and represented the
riding of Lotbinière until 1925.
Later, having moved lis family and lis
lawyer's practice to Montreal, Senator Vien
was elected to the House of Commons for the
riding of Outremont, before being appointed
to the Senate in 1942. From 1943 to 1945, lie
was Speaker of the Senate.
Those who knew him here will not soon
forget his interventions in our debates, interventions whicli were always to the point,
highly erudite and bearing the imprint of a
great wisdom.
A man of eminent distinction, lie was a
credit to the Senate. I want to assure hlm
that ail senators sitting at the far left of the
Speaker hold him in great affection and I
convey to him on their behaîf our best wishes
for continued good healtli and happiness.
H-onourable senators, we were surprised to
leara during this summer near at end that
Senator Jean-François Pouliot liad resigned
for health reasons.
We were surprised, indeed, because even
during the last session, lis frequent interventions la our debates lad left us the impression that lie was la perfect liealtli after the
accident he lad suffered last year. Fortunateiy, according to the last news, he is better
now and back home at Rivière-du-Loup. We
are very pleased about it.
Because of lis long and fruitful political
career and also of lis qualities as a jurist,
Senator Pouliot is well known right across the
country.
Over a period of 44 years, Senator Pouliot
sat continuously ln one or the other house
and, at the time of lis resignation, lie lad
been sitting in this house for 13 years.

SENATE DEBATES
Throughout those years, we came to know
the numerous quaities of Senator Pouliot and
those who knew himn well will flot soon forget
his fighting spirit, his sense of detail and his
working capacity. The resignation of Senator
Pouliot deprives the bouse of a member both
colourful and very lovable. For my part,
because of ties of friendship with my family,
I feel a very deep personal loss.
On my own behaif, and on behaîf of my
colleagues, I wish Senator Pouliot a peaceful
retirement, which in any event hie well
deserves after having dedicated himself to his
fellow citizens for such a long period of time.
We also take this opportunity to extend our
respectful compliments to Mrs. Pouliot.

On March 26 Senator Gershaw resigned
fromn this chamber and less than three months
later hie passed away. He had a long career as
a surgeon, and hie doubled that career with a
political life which lasted for almost haif a
century. Senator Gershaw was first elected to
the House of Commons in 1925 after an
unsuccessful attempt in 1921. He was re-elected in 1926, 1930 and 1940. He was summoned
to the Senate in 1945, and served here for 23
years.
Senator Gershaw was a kind and sociable
man; hie was a very human person. Because
of this hie had no enemies, only friends. We
shall cherish his memory. On behalf of the
Opposition I wish to convey our deepest
regrets to his wife and their children.
Honourable senators, I have kept for my
conclusion my comments on the resignation of
Senator Wallace McCutcheon.
Senator McCutcheon resigned to seek a seat
in the other place. Our loss would have been
a gain for the Commons; but, unhappily, the
electors decided otherwise. Consequently,
Parliament and Canada are deprived of the
services of a most competent man wbo, during the years he was with us, displayed his
unique qualities in the field of administration
and finance. We on this side will miss him
very much, because hie was a highly valued
adviser. The Senate also will miss him, and I
wish that circumstances-be it inspiration to
the Prime Minister, provoked by the Leader
of the Government-will allow bis re-entry
here.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Donald Cameron: Honourable senators, I do not wish to trespass on your time
for very long, and I shaîl not be able to pay
tribute as eloquently as did Senator Connolly
to those members who have resigned or
passed to the Great Beyond.

Spebr1,16 17, 1968

As a lifelong friend and colleague of Senator Gershaw, I could flot let the opportunity
pass without saying a word about hlm and
the place he occupied in bis native Province
of Alberta. It is true that hie did not have the
advantage of being born in Alberta. Having
started out in Manitoba, hie graduated from
the University of Manitoba School of Medicine. At a very young age he moved to, the
Province of Alberta, where he became that
most revered of ail people in a pioneer community, the general country practitioner.
In the early days of the horse and buggy,
the team and demnocrat, and at a later date in
a Model T Ford, he traversed the plains area
of Alberta, tending the sick, making friends
everywhere, and above ail, taking an interest
in the work in the schools. He took a tremendous interest in young people, and right up to
the last two or tbree years hie made a practice
of visiting ail of the schools in the old Medicine Hat constituency.
As was said by Senator Connolly and Senator Flynn, he was elected to the House of
Commons in 1925, 1926, 1930 and 1940; and he
lost out in 1921 and 1935. In other words, he
had a batting average of .666-which in basehall parlance is a pretty good average.
In addition to bis many qualities as a
humanitarian and as a physician and surgeon,
hie served his community on the schooi board
and in many other ways. He served as a local
historian, writing stories of the pioneers; and
hie assisted many persons to scholarships and
helped them get further education.
In the years when hie was in the Senate hie
always had something to say and he said it
well. He had the respect and confidence of all
of bis colleagues.
I would like to join with the other honourable senators in paying a trîbute to a fine
Canadian who bas left a pioneer country
much better for his having been there.
Hon. M. Grallan O'Leary: Honourable senators, I crave your indulgence for just a few

SENATE DEBATES
THE SENATE
INTRODUCTION OF BILLS IN BILINGUAL FORM

Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators,
with the leave of all members in the chamber, I would ask for agreement to have all
bills introduced in the Senate in bilingual
form.
Je peux dire que cette proposition a été
acceptée à l'autre endroit. I would hope that
if this is agreed to, arrangements would be
made by the staff to provide hard covers that
will adequately serve the new forms which
are almost twice the size of the forms of bills
formerly introduced in this house.

column is French. The form could not be
made much smaller, unless the border on the
left-hand side were reduced.
Perhaps the suggestion of the Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Flynn) could be followed. I suppose we would also have to collaborate with the other place, at which time
these observations could be noted. In any
event, we will see what can be done.
Hon. Mr. Fournier (De Lanaudière): I have
a supplementary question. I understand that
the Government of the Province of Quebec
publishes its bills in the same bilingual form
as suggested by the honourable Leader of the
Government here. I wonder if the honourable
gentleman is in a position to tell me if there
is a difference between the size of the bills
we intend to publish and those which are now
being published in Quebec.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I
am not objecting at all. It is proper that we
should have the bills in both languages.
However, I do not like the format on which
they appear, as it is larger than book form. I

tors, is it agreed that the printing of all bills
be in bilingual form?
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: You mean wider?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes; wider than ordinary books. They will overhang. They will

that will not be the case.

not intend to participate in the debate on the

September 17, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Speech from the Throne, I wish at the outset
to address a few words to our new Speaker.
[Translation]
In fact, Mr. Speaker, I should like my first
word to be a tribute to you. I have had the
privilege to know the Speaker for several
years and to have been his colleague in the
cabinet. Therefore, I have been able to
appreciate his great qualities and especially
his respect for the individual, his great wisdom and his untiring devotion to his province
and his country. I wish him many happy
years as he presides over the proceedings of
the Canadian Senate.
[English]
I intend to say just a few words in favour
of this motion with the hope that it will carry
as soon as possible. Its purpose is merely to
reconstitute the committee on Science Policy
which was set up by this chamber on November 8, 1967. Moreover, if this committee is to
continue its work efficiently, it ought to meet
as soon as possible to prepare its schedule of
hearings for this fall.
It is generally recognized that the former
committee, during the few months of its
existence, did useful work. We heard more
than 20 individuals from Canada and abroad
with a great reputation in their respective
fields of activity who came to speak to us on
such varied topics as science and society,
Canada's scientific effort in the light of the
experience of other countries and the broad
objectives of science policy. I want, on behalf
of all the members of that committee, to
express my gratitude to all those great scientists and administrators who so readily
accepted to give us the benefit of their
wisdom.
The committee has also succeeded in providing for the first time in our country a public forum for the discussion of science policy.
The public demand for our proceedings has
been very high indeed. Moreover, we have
been receiving numerous requests from
organizations and individuals asking to be
heard and make representations. If we have
succeeded in this role, it is largely due to the
press and I want to express the committee's
gratitude to the reporters who have covered
its proceedings so faithfully.
Moreover, the committee has already had a
useful impact within the public service itself.
I know that as a result of our activities the
interest in research has been revived in
several departments, and reviews of scientific
programs, which were long overdue, are now
being conducted by federal research agencies.
29234-3

For the first time in our history-and again
I think this is due to the activities of that
committee-science policy became a political
issue during the last electoral campaign. The
leader of the Conservative party had very
interesting proposals to make on this issue
when he said that our scientific effort should
be intensified and better integrated. And I
must say that when he made these proposals
I was about to vote Conservative. But just a
few days later the Liberal party issued the
following statement on science and technology
which did not receive wide publicity at the
time and I think it is worth our while to put
it on the record now:
Innovation and research are major
keys to Canada's economic growth. In
this era of rapid technological change,
our industrial development and the evolution of our society will depend increasingly on our scientific effort. The Government has developed important programmes to assist industrial research and
development, but much remains to be
done. Canada spends less on research and
development than many other nations,
especially in the private sector. Our productivity performance needs to be strongly improved.
To achieve these goals, your new Liberal Government will:
Give vigorous support to science in
both pure and applied forms as a basis
of modern economic development. In
pursuit of this objective, your new
Liberal Government will give careful
study and attention to the forthcoming
Report of the Senate Committee on
Science Policy. In its study of the Senate report, we shall give careful attention to the relationship between public
and private research and to the development and retention in Canada of
highly trained scientists and engineers.
Emphasize applied research to problems of environment, human resources,
housing, natural resource development,
northern development, water pollution,
space telecommunications, transportation, transmission of energy, and
nuclear energy. By 1975, our goal is
that Canadians will spend about $2 billion a year on research and development, both private and public. A greater percentage of government funds will
be directed to private, applied research.

SENATE DEBATES

is highly desirable to adopt this motion as

As I indicated before, I am not too sure
that this decision will really mean anything

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE

MOTION FOR TERMINATION OF DEBATE

MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE
CONTINUED

Hon. Paul Martin moved, pursuant to
notice:
That the proceedings on the order of
the day for resuming the debate on the
motion for an Address in reply to His
Excellency
the
Governor
General's
Speech from the Throne addressed to
both Houses of Parliament be concluded
on the eighth sitting day on which the
order is debated.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Without going into
detail, would the honourable Leader of the
Government indicate the general reasons for
this motion?
Hon. Mr. Martin: The purpose of the
motion which I have put in my name, following discussions and soundings with many
honourable senators, was to bring some
order in our deliberations. Undoubtedly, there
were good reasons in the past for allowing
the debate to run indefinitely; but under our
procedures, whatever advantage there might
have been can now be employed by any
honourable senator in raising a matter which
he would have raised in the Address in reply
to the Speech from the Throne. It seems to
me that this is an orderly way in which to
proceed.
I hope that I do not transgress the traditions of this bouse when I say that there were
some aspects of this matter which I did discuss with the honourable Leader of the Opposition, taking advantage of his richer experience in these matters; and it was following
such discussions that this motion was made.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, since
the Leader of the Government bas referred to
the discussion we had about this matter, I
will say that I have already indicated to him

The Senate resumed from Friday, September 13, consideration of His Excellency the
Governor General's speech at the opening of
the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Phillips (Rigaud), seconded by Hon. Mr. Eudes, for
an address in reply thereto.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators,
because of the results of the general election
held in June, and because the present Prime
Minister has taken over from Mr. Pearson,
we are told that this 28th Parliament is a
"New Look" Parliament, and commentators
have suggested that the Speech from the
Throne sets the pattern for the "just society"
of which we have heard so frequently, if not
specifically, during the election campaign. As
I look around this chamber, I am willing to
agree that to some extent there is a new look
in the Senate. Some important changes are
evident.

[Translation]
First of all, there is your presence in the
Speaker's chair, honourable Senator Deschatelets. In my name and on behalf of those who
sit on your far left, I offer you our warm
congratulations, the assurance of our co-operation and our confidence in your discharging
your new office.
Having known you more than twenty-five
years ago when we were both lawyers for the
Wartime Prices and Trade Board, having met
you again in the House of Commons in 1958,
and having observed your fine career up to
the office of Minister of Public Works, before
coming here, I know advisedly that the Government's decision was a wise one that was
well received in all circles, especially here
in the Senate. I add that you are wonderfully
well assisted by Mrs. Deschatelets.

September 17, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

[English]
The present Speaker bas succeeded Senator Sydney Smith who, in the best tradition of
the Speakers of the Senate, has honoured this
exalted position. We wish Senator Smith to
know that we are very grateful for the manner in which he discharged his responsibilities, and in this we want to associate Mrs.
Smith.
Another change in the physionomy of this
chamber is the new Leader of the Government. We are unanimous in applauding the
summoning to the Senate of the Honourable
Paul Martin, and his appointment as Leader
of the Government.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
[Translation]
The new leader was the senior member of
the House of Commons. One of the most brilliant parliamentarians of our time, he had an
almost unparalleled career. Elected ten times
in the riding of Essex East, he was in turn
Secretary of State, Minister of National
Health and Welfare and Secretary of State
for External Affairs. Only one honour was
denied him, which be deserved by virtue of
his great experience and his talents. Circumstances were against him. Politics is often a
cruel game. Very possibly, had there been
more small "c" conservatives at the convention last April, he would have been elected.
We in the Senate console ourselves by thinking that the House of Commons' loss is our
gain. We assure him of our loyal cooperation
in the discharge of his duties.
[Englishl
While congratulating the new Government
Leader, I cannot forget that Senator John J.
Connolly, his predecessor, was a most
efficient, charming and popular leader.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: We had only one criticism:
he worked too hard, and we were always
afraid that he would endanger his health. On
behalf of all members of this group, I offer to
Senator Connolly our warm thanks for the
consideration he always showed us, and I
add our sincere wishes for his continued good
health.
Since the dissolution of Parliament last
April, two of our colleagues have died and
three others have resigned. We have paid our
tributes to these colleagues.
On the first day of this session we greeted
six new senators. On behalf of our group, I
officially welcome them, and wish them a
fruitful and happy career in the Senate.
29234-3j

Two of them, namely, Senator Lazarus
Phillips and Senator Eudes, were charged
with the task of moving and seconding the
motion for an Address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne. Both did exceptionally well.
Their speeches in substance and in form, and
in their delivery, were excellent. Of course,
Senator Phillips is a man of wide experience.
His reputation as a lawyer has spread all
across Canada. His maiden speech was equal
to our expectations and we look forward to
his frequent contributions to our debates.
[Translation]
As regards Senator Eudes, another colleague of the bar, with whom I had the pleasure of serving in the House of Commons from
1958 to 1962, he is today, as he was then, an
excellent parliamentarian and a very good
speaker. I imagine that he will also give us
the pleasure of hearing him frequently.
[English]
Honourable senators, if the changes in the
personnel of this chamber to which I have
alluded give the Senate a somewhat new look,
can we find in the Speech from the Throne a
fundamental newness in the Government's
policy and philosophy?
I know that one should not expect the
Speech from the Throne to spell out in every
detail the legislation which the Government
intends to submit to Parliament. However, I
suggest that one is usually able to read
between the lines whether the Government
has in mind something really precise, but I
fail to find anything behind the text read by
His Excellency. The only novel aspect is the
use, as a leitmotiv, of the concept or the words
"just society". Of course, one recalls that this
was the slogan of the Prime Minister's very
personal and exclusive campaign.
If I try to visualize this "just society" with
the throne speech as a background, I cannot
help but conclude that this concept is now
even less precise and more distant than it
sounded last June. To support this conclusion,
let me quote from the Speech from the
Throne:
A great deal has been accomplished in
recent years to make the Canadian society more just in terms of income distribution and security against the vicissitudes of life. Pensions for the aged,
provision for the sick and for the needy
have been made more effective by legislation passed in recent Parliaments and
by action of the provinces. Notwithstanding such measures, poverty continues to
exist in Canada. My Government recognizes that, but it also believes that it

Canadians in the Province of Quebec. Furthermore, it was, and it is, the policy of the
Progressive Conservative Party that we
should proceed with an orderly review of the
Constitution in order to correct omissions and
bring about clarifications which will reduce
the causes of tension between our two levels
of government.
The only new aspect that I am prepared to
recognize as far as the present Government is
concerned is a more conciliatory attitude of
the Prime Minister, and I only hope for the
sake of progress in this vital field of national
unity that I am correct in believing that the
Prime Minister has decided to adopt a less
rigid stand and will be prepared to listen to
all reasonable viewpoints and proposais.
The Speech from the Throne does not contain any reference to the reform of the Senate. From statements made by the Prime
Minister in recent weeks it would appear that
he has in mind some proposals which he
intends to make to the forthcoming federalprovincial conference. In his speech in Vancouver be put the question: "Could the Senate, by changes in its composition, method
of selection, or jurisdiction, be made a more
effective protector of regional or linguistie
interests?"
Constitutional reform of the Senate is of
course primarily the responsibility of the
Government and we shall look forward with
great interest to any announcement which
may eventually be made. On the other hand,
operational reform is primarily the responsibility of the Senate itself.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: The Leader of the Government in the Senate (Hon. Mr. Martin) bas
indicated that be may have some suggestions
concerning our procedure, and we are willing
to discuss these at any time.
The principal solution, however, for
increasing the role of our chamber in the
legislative process is to have more legislation
initiated here. This may be difficult, unless an
amendment is made to the B.N.A. Act which
would authorize certain so-called money
bills-and I am thinking of practically ail
bills except taxation and appropriation bills
-introduced
in this chamber, especially
when the legislation has not too much political or, if you prefer it, electoral impact. We
are better equipped to deal with technically
difficult legislation than is the other place.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: We could save the other
place a lot of time by dealing first with this
kind of legislation.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I would also hope, now
that the Government can count on a majority
in the Commons, that the huge majority it
enjoys here will be less timid in criticizing
and even amending the legislation coming
here. In other words, the official Opposition
in this chamber, in view of its small number,
should be able to count on many who sit
opposite to help in the task of endeavouring
at ail times to improve the bills which we
will be invited to consider and adopt.
Similarly, the part of the Throne Speech
dealing with international affairs does not
indicate any new departure. It suggests the
mere continuation of the policies of the Pearson administration. We agree that we should
continue with the review of our external and
defence policies, principally with Canada's
contribution to NATO, relations with Peking,
with Latin America and with Europe, and in
matters of assistance to underdeveloped
areas. However, this review should not proceed in secret and Parliament, especially our
own Committee on External Aff airs, should
be put to task on it.
One of the principal elements of a just sociiety is, of course, a prosperous economy and a
fair distribution of its proceeds. I have quoted
previously from the speech to indicate that,
while the Government is concerned with
fighting poverty, it does not appear to be
clear as to the concrete steps it will take to
achieve its objective. Poverty is something
relative, as has been shown by the last report of the Economic Council. It varies from
time to time and from region to region. Some
years ago the Council concluded that any
bachelor earning less than $1,500 a year
should be considered a poor man; now it says
that the same person is poor if he does not
have an annual income of $2,000. One could
also say that you may be a poor man with an
income of $3,000 a year in a large city like
Montreal or Toronto, while living a decent
life with half that amount in some rural
communities.
What is clear in the present economic context is that the continuous rise in the cost of
living and inflation at their present rhythm
will not permit a successful fight against
poverty. Relative stability of prices and
wages and a growing economy are essential if
we are to achieve a truly just society, otherwise wages will continue in the pursuit of the

SENATE DEBATES
increasing cost of living, we will have ta continue to increase social assistance and, consequently, taxes, and very likely these increases
will always be ahead of the growth of our
productivity. Drastic measures will eventually
have to be taken if the present trends continue. I suggest that in recent years we have
been caught in a vicious circle due to our
inability to maintain a balance between prices
and wages on the one hand and our productivity on the other.
During the last session we enacted legislation to create a Department of Consumer and
Corporate Affairs. We are now told that we
will be asked to consider proposals for a systematic and continuous review of prices and
costs in our economy. I suggest that any such
review will not be sufficient in itself, because
although we have known up to now the
trends of prices and costs, it has not prevented unbridled inflation nor a constant increase
in the cost of living.
Therefore, the Throne Speech is at best a
dissertation about and a recitation of the
problems confronting Canadians and the general direction which the Government intends
to take for correcting them. Nothing definite
is revealed of the Government's intentions
and we will have to wait for the legislation to
judge whether a really bold policy has been
designed for the most important fields of the
federal Government's responsibilities. We
hope that this legislation, which will eventually be unfolded after we have dealt with the
backlog of bills left in abeyance by the dissolution, will be more meaningful than the
Throne Speech. Eventually the illusions and
expectations of the last election campaign will

September 17, 1968

fade away and will have to be replaced,
either by concrete action and results on the
part of the Government, or by deception, in
which case the Government realizes what its
fate will be.
[Translation]
Honourable senators, I will summarize the
impression I got from the Speech from the
Throne by stating that it fails to suggest anything which gives Parliament a really new
look or which ensures a spectacular start towards the goal of a just society. In fact, the
text is merely a rehash of the legacy which
the Trudeau administration inherited from
the Pearson administration. True to the
Liberal tradition which feels that it is very
important to appear at least to be doing what
one is unable to do, on old themes new words
have been put.
We will therefore wait for the legislation
before expressing a more definite opinion.
Who knows but that the Government might
remedy the vagueness of the Speech from the
Throne with bold and realistic legislation.
Before resuming my seat, I want once again
to assure the Government Leader of the full
co-operation of the Opposition, the fact that
our small number prevents us from giving
serious worries to the Government vouching
for our impartiality.

I am sure that the question will arise in
The Honourable Senators Blois, Burchill, Cameron, Croll, Farris, Fergusson, almost everyone's mind as to the situation

SENATE DEBATES

from now on. Honourable senators will recall
that the bill which we passed last session, and
which is now law and is in operation in the
courts, provided that those cases which were
filed before the act became effective on the
second day of July last, shall be dealt with
under the former act. So, to clean up the
docket, we still have a considerable number
of cases awaiting our attention.
Going back only to 1963, and not into
ancient history, our docket contains 200 cases
ready for hearing. In addition to that, there
are another 100 in which some detail is still
to be completed-such as the payment of the
fee, the finishing of the necessary advertising,
or some such matter of that nature which
would prevent the case from being listed for
immediate hearing. That would make some
300 cases pending on our docket. In addition
to that, there are 70 cases in which the documentation is not yet completed. Lack of documentation is serious, and that is why I have
separated these cases into two divisions.
So, there are 370 cases on our docket which
we must complete before we shall have
finished the work of the last one hundred
years. Of those 370 cases approximately 60
are contested.
How long it will take us to deal with these
cases is problematical. Already a number of
cases have been withdrawn. I noticed that six
were withdrawn the day before yesterday,
and I will tell you one reason why. In the
past, when we granted a divorce on the
application of the wife, she was "out" so far
as alimony was concerned in the Province of
Quebec. According to Quebec law, her right
to maintenance terminated completely on
divorce, whether she was the respondent or
the petitioner. But that is not so under the
new act, which applies to all provinces and
which gives the courts trying the claim for
dissolution of the marriage the power to grant
applications for alimony, the custody of children, and so forth. Accordingly, one might
expect that when the petitioner is a woman
she will consider very carefully whether to
proceed under the former act or whether to
apply to the courts under the recent act, and
should she decide on the latter course she will
probably withdraw the petition now before
us.
Thus, it is a little difficult to forecast just
how long it will take us to complete the docket as it now stands. One of the Commissioners
said recently that it would take us until
Christmas. A careful gauging of the situation

September 18, 1968

would suggest to me that we may be dealing
with some cases in January or February of
the coming year. But whether it is Christmas
or February is not important. We are very
rapidly approaching the conclusion of the Senate's work in this regard, provision having
been made for divorce courts in the Provinces
of Quebec and Newfoundland.
So, honourable senators, in order that we
may proceed with the necessary preparation
for the moving of resolutions in some 500
cases, I would suggest that this motion be
dealt with now.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, I
agree with what has been said by Senator
Roebuck as to the matter of urgency, and it is
my opinion that this motion should be agreed
to immediately, However, I would ask the
honourable senator to indicate whether I am
right in thinking that in principle petitions
for divorce can still be presented to the Senate, notwithstanding the coming into force
of the Divorce Act on July 2 last. Would he
also tell us whether any petitions have been
presented to the Senate since the date of the
coming into force of the Divorce Act?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I think not. Honourable
senators will understand that even under the
Dissolution and Annulment of Marriages Act,
passed in 1963, the right to appeal to the
Senate by way of petition for a bill of divorce
remained. That has never been changed. The
old rule that Parliament is endowed with the
power and authority to grant a divorce is as
intact today as it was a hundred years ago. I
think we should realize that it will be necessary for us to keep the Standing Committee
on Divorce in existence for many years to
come, perhaps for always. Parliament can
never say to the public, "You are precluded
from petitioning us for relief of any kind,
divorce included."
The old rules that were left standing in
1963, when we adopted the then new law, are
still in force and will continue to be necessary
for years to come. We must always have a
Standing Committee on Divorce to which
petitions for divorce may be referred from
time to time, although it is likely there will
be very few. Only once since 1963 has any
appeal been taken against a decision of the
commissioners, and that appeal was disposed
of by a special committee appointed for the
purpose.

to the deliberations and to the functioning of
the Senate. His achievements in that regard,
while known indirectly, are fully appreciated
by me. As his colleague in the Government of
Canada since 1963, I learned to appreciate his
capacity and experience at the cabinet
table-information that I had every right to
anticipate, because of years of friendship during our common participation in the public
life of our country.
I thank the Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Flynn) very much for the generous way
in which he formally welcomed me to this
bouse and to the leadership of the Government in this chamber, in his opening address
yesterday evening in the debate on the
Speech from the Throne. I thank him for the
collaboration be gave me before this Parliament was convened, when on two occasions I
discussed with him matters which arose out
of our common responsibilities.
I have known the Leader of the Opposition
for a long time. I served with him in the
other place and while we did not always
agree on political matters, there were more
occasions for agreement than disagreement
and I am honoured to find myself opposite
him today.

September 18, 1968

Honourable senators, the only other comment I wish to make about what the honourable Leader of the Opposition had to say yesterday evening about the Speech from the
Throne-in terms of what I might regard as
perfectly legitimate and understandable
political criticism-is in regard to belittling
by the Leader of the Opposition of the concept of the just society by the Government of
the day and by its Prime Minister in
particular.
I can only say that the concept of the just
society reflects the writings over a long time
of the Prime Minister and I believe that,
regardless of our political affiliation, we will
recognize that, in the heavy responsibilities
which be now assumes, his main desire is to
serve the interests of this country, a desire
that we all share in common with him. I am
sure that he will prove to be a unique,
important and great figure in the public life
of Canada.
Honourable senators, I did not come into
this place, into this historic chamber, to preside over the liquidation of the Senate.

deprecated in the House of Commons. If

Septernber 18, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

we are going to have a democracy, the
practice must continue. There have to be
parties and party manoeuvres; there have
to be confiicts and controversies innumerable in variety and wearisome in length.
The great scheme of bringing sections
together, letting each see the viewpoint
of the other, has to be worked out in the
representative Chamber. Sometimes we
are too impatient and critical of governments in allowing what seems inordinate
time for discussion of public business.
That discussion is good, but it is not the
function of the Senate. Members of the
Second Chamber must get away, lift their
minds far from these hard-drawn lines of
party, or they cannot serve their country.
They have to make up their minds to
give every government fair play and not
to stand in the way of legislation unless
they are convinced it must be defeated on
its merits, and that the consequences of
failure to defeat it would be serious; nor
to stand stubbornly in the path of any
Government proposal unless it is brought
there by largess in this or some other
part of the Dominion rather than the true
interests of the nation.
With those words-occupying the same role
as he occupied-I find myself, in this first
foray in our discussions, in full agreement.
Honourable senators, I repeat, I did not
agree to come here in order to preside over
the liquidation of this chamber. The criticisms against the Senate must be seen in the
light of the criticisms of Parliament itself, not
only in Canada but throughout those countries where Parliaments like ours exist.
In spite of changes in its rules, no Parliament, for instance, has come in for more
criticism than the contemporary House of
Commons in the United Kingdom.
As Professor E. D. Briggs, of the University
of Windsor, has recently written:
The (Canadian) Senate has long been
badly misrepresented by both the general
public and by many political scientists.
No one could have listened today to the
honourable Senator Roebuck, giving the conclusions of his work this summer, bearing i'
mind his labours over the years as Chairman
of the Divorce Committee, without recognizing the work accomplished in the Senate and,
in this instance, the very distinguished
achievements of the senator himself.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
29234"4

Hon. Mr. Martin: Of course, that is but one
small aspect of the work which has been done
in this chamber.
I am grateful to Professor Kunz, of McGill
University, who sets the record straight with
his penetrating analysis of the Senate. His
book was published in 1963 and is, as you
know, an excellent portrayal of the purposes
of the Senate, what it has achieved and what
it proposes to do. He clearly establishes the
Senate's usefulness and its constructive character; but he does not overlook its disabilities and weaknesses-nor should we. He
writes:
Less fettered by the rules of debate
and removed from the actual arena of
party strife, the Senate has been successful in effecting useful modifications in
public legislation under Conservative and
Liberal governments alike, for the purpose of introducing technical improvements and of checking executive extravagance; in taking a first look at complex
or non-controversial measures and, since
1935, at all private bills; in holding valuable debates on matters of broad national
policy and of administration in narrow
fields which directly or indirectly, have
influenced government policies, intentions, and attitudes; in making use, to a
greater and greater extent of its standing
and special committee system in the triple field of legislation, scrutiny, and
inquiry, with the additional general
advantages of bringing affected interests
into direct contact with representatives of
the administration, and of obliging governments to explain their policies and to
reply to serious and constructive criticisms and suggestions; and in representing the territorial and other minorities,
by intervening on their behalf and by
providing (through the operation of the
appointing system) a socially recognized
means of acknowledging their relative
importance in the federal state. Part of
this is work such as the House of Commons also carries out. But the House of
Commons does not have unlimited time
and, being the focal point of the political
power struggle on the national level, is
under the domination of the great rival
party machines. As a result, even if some
of these functions are performed by both
houses, they do not do it in quite the
same way, and there are some aspects of
the work which are better done the Senate's way than the Common's way.

SENATE DEBATES

I would invite the critics of the Senate to
read these words, because in spite of the
criticisms and in spite of the fact that they do
not do the work in quite the same way,
"there are some aspects of the work which
are better done the Senate's way than the
Commons' way." He continues:
But all through the years the Senate has

money bills.
-in a responsible manner, using persuasion rather than obstruction to defend its
stand vis-à-vis the House of Commons. In
matters of economic and social policy it
has wisely taken the lead of the elected
bouse and for the better part of the period under review it has accepted, indeed
supported, the policies of successive governments in that regard. The Senate bas
never, during the last three decades at
any rate, posed as an "Upper House" in
terms of traditional class values and,
unlike some of its continental counterparts, membership of the house has not
been associated with the notions of social
superiority. An impartial study of the
record of the Senate during the years
1925 to 1963 amply confirms the argument that the Upper House is a useful
complement to the Lower.
Honourable senators, this is a responsible
analysis by one who is not a member of this
house, who is an authority on the institution
of parliamentary government and who has
seen it in operation in many countries. It is
an analysis which the critics of this chamber
ought to note. Having said that, I stress that
we nevertheless should not be satisfied to rest
on this statement as a complete apologia for
our existence. It does not entitle us to be
complacent or to say that the Senate ought to
be left as it is.
Apart from improvements through constitutional revision, it seems to me that we have,
ourselves, the opportunity of making the
desired improvements; that we do not need to
wait for others to make them; that we do not
need to wait for work in the other place; that
we do not necessarily have to wait for the
Government itself. Our usefulness could, perhaps, be increased not only in the fields of
legislation but in the area, particularly, of
scrutiny and inquiry. Here is what the distinguished Professor Kunz of McGill University
concludes:
The most obvious ones are connected
with a continued expansion of the Sen-

September 18, 1968

ate's committee work in the fields of
legislation, scrutiny, and inquiry, but
particularly in those of scrutiny and
inquiry. Greatly helped by the flexibility
of its timetable and its ruling spirit of
impartiality, the Senate could develop
some effective and important means of
overseeing certain aspects of financial
administration, especially in the sphere of
Crown corporations, and checking certain
executive practices, especially in the
sphere of delegated legislation. The Senate could also increase the number of
special inquiries conducted annually, and
enlarge their scope and variety. All this
requires very little external stimulus and
can be achieved through imaginative
leadership and, perhaps, a few changes in
internal organization. Indeed, the best
practical way of "reforming" the Senate
seems to lie in further exploiting the
potentialities inherent in the structure of
the institution itself.
And I noted with satisfaction this was the
point of view which the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Flynn) took last night.
Addressing myself to our opportunities, I
suppose it would be natural that, coming as I
do from a department of the Government
recently concerned with Canadian foreign
policy, I should reflect my immediate responsibilities in that area, and what have been
during the whole of my public life a deep and
abiding interest.
Today, more than ever before in our history and in the history of the world, governments and peoples are really concerned with
international policies. This period of interdependence in which we live gives to foreign
affairs a rank of high priority in the national
agenda. I have had, as I said a moment ago, a
long association, both as a Member of Parliament and as an individual, with international
affairs in this country. As Secretary of State
for External Affairs, I recognized the need
for parliamentary concern and interest in the
basic problems of war and peace, and I am
sure that the Canadian Senate has a role to
play in this area that will add to its usefulness and its stature. This is not the only area
of inquiry or investigation where I see additional use of our labours and our efforts, but
I am sure that in this area so vital to our
country and to the world there is an opportunity for us.
At the end of the First World War, Lord
Bryce, in a comparative study of the general

September 18, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

functions of the Upper House in the United
Kingdom and in other countries, gave the
highest priority to the discussion of foreign
affairs. He called for "a full and free discussion of the large and important questions,
such as those of foreign policy, at moments
when the House of Commons may happen to
be so much occupied that it cannot find sufficient time for them. Such discussion," he said,
"may often be all the more useful if conducted in an assembly whose debates and divisions do not involve the fate of the Executive
Government."
The examination and revision of government bills coming from the Commons is
important work, and this applies to private
bills or consultation bills, but I have a strong
conviction that the point that Lord Bryce
makes is vital and has an application for us
in Canada at the present time.
I hope I will not be thought presumptuous
if I say that the great international issues of
our time can be and should be discussed in
this chamber more often perhaps than heretofore, and that we can do so in what I am sure
will be the thrust of objective debate.
I have had an opportunity of discussing the
External Affairs Committee with its distinguished chairman. Speaking as an individual
senator, I would like to sec our External Affairs Committee assume something like the
importance and stature which its counterpart
has acquired in the Senate of the United
States. It will be argued that in the United
States the Foreign Relations Committee plays
a role largely because the Senate is an elected
body. There is no validity to that argument. I
recognize, of course, that the Constitution of
the United States provides for direct responsibility with regard to the appointment of
ambassadors, and with regard to the treatymaking power, powers not presently available
to us in the written portion of our Constitution.
The Chairman of the Senate Committee on
Foreign Relations in the United States wields
a substantial power in Congress and in the
nation. fHe and that committee do now, as
they did before the Senate became an elected
body, exercise great influence. The fact is
that the Senate of the United States became
an elected body in 1913. Over 100 years
before that the Foreign Relations Committee of the appointed Senate in the United
States exercised considerable influence. Seventy-five years before the Senate of the United
States became an elected body, Charles Sumner, who later became Secretary of State for
Foreign Affairs in the United States, demon-

strated the importance of the committee in
many situations, among them, for instance,
those which had to do with negotiations
between Great Britain and the United States
over the remaining presence of Britain in
America, and over the Alabama claims.
There is great concern in this country at
the present time about these matters. We
should not leave the discussion of these questions alone to the academic community; we
should not leave them alone to the news media. This is at least one of the forums in Canada best suited, with sufficient time at its
disposal, to consider and discuss foreign policy. The Senate is one parliamentary vehicle
operating between Parliament and the public
in the area of foreign policy, a first item on
the national agenda. What does the invasion
of Czechoslovakia mean? Wherein lies
the strength and weakness of a nonproliferation treaty on nuclear weapons?
What should be Canada's relationship at the
present time to Europe? What should be our
position regarding collective security arrangements? Is our foreign aid program adequate?
Are we doing too much or are we not doing
enough? Are we doing it in the right way?
I recall with interest the interesting and
useful meetings on foreign aid of the Senate
External Relations Committee during the last
Parliament. What are we doing to strengthen
collective security in the United Nations?
How do we bring peace to the Middle East?
What is our position on the war in Vietnam?
Are we going to leave the discussion of these
matters to protest and dissident groups or are
we going to join in the discussion and seek to
give some direction? Even if we only succeed
in reaching a consensus, I know we recognize
the value of discussion in the Senate!
The very nature of the Senate is that it
provides a place where the senators of the
nation and the citizens of the state can discuss matters of great moment to the state and
to the world.
I have indicated that I have no doubt about
the usefulness of the Senate, in a confederation like our own. There is no doubt in my
mind of the contribution that this body has
made, and every senator within hearing of
my voice has made, long before I came here
or ever thought I would be invited to come.
But, in my judgment there is need for
improvement, as we have long acknowledged,
and that need is not necessarily because of
anything we have failed to do. Much of this
improvement can come from within this
chamber, in its organization and through its
procedures.

SENATE DEBATES
I would remind the house that the federal
Government on the 5th and 6th of February
last, when it met with the provincial governments to discuss constitutional revision, gave
some indication of its interest in this matter
of improving whatever role might be available to this Upper House. In the document
entitled "Federalism for the Future," bearing
the signature of the then Prime Minister of
Canada, and distributed to all representatives
attending the conference, the Government
affirmed that it believed the role and the
powers of the Senate should be reviewed. At
page 26 of this document, which I am sure
has been distributed to all honourable senators and which bears rereading, it was noted
that:
It might well be reconstituted so as to
enable it to play a new role in representing the federal character of our country.
It might, for example, be called upon to
make a special contribution in securing
the rights of Canadians and in protecting
the bilingual character of Canada. It
might also be expected to reflect better
than it does now the regional interests of
our country.
These are not my words; these are the words
of the Government of the day, although, of
course, I was a member of that Government.
If the role and the powers of the Senate were to be changed, it would also be
appropriate, in the judgment of the Government of Canada, to consider changes
in the method of appointment. For the
method of selecting senators clearly
should be related to the particular role
and functions of an Upper House in a
federal form of government.
Our proposals for a controlled development of the Constitution do not envisage
a discussion at this meeting of Senate
reform. But we did want to make known
the Government's view that the Senate
can be made a more effective institution
of federalism, and our willingness to discuss at subsequent conferences this
aspect of Canada's Constitution.
Now, what I would want to emphasize is
that this document does not go further than
to discuss possibilities for future consideration in the constitutional review. I must add,
of course, that I believe, apart from what the
Government might want to propose to the
provinces, and which would ultimately have
to be considered by the two Houses of Parliament, that much of whatever changes should

September 18, 1968

be made or could be made, we have now in
this chamber the power to discuss. I am certain that we must find a way, perhaps
through this chamber, to give the provinces
more direct participation in the federal process. The question will be how to do that. Dr.
MacKay, the author of the classic, The Unreformed Senate, in his revised edition puts
this question: "Should we not give careful
examination to direct representation of the
provinces in the Senate?" I mention this
because in discussing the question of
improvement in our procedures, we would
have to take into account declarations made
by the Government on this subject, particularly in its recent discussions with the
provinces.
A moment ago I mentioned the importance
of foreign policy, the importance of our helping to project the nature of that policy and its
implications. I would be remiss if today, having said that, I did not refer to what is mentioned in the Speech from the Throne and
also to what was so ably referred to last night
by my honourable friend, the Leader of the
Opposition. The fact is that the invasion of
Czechoslovakia has occasioned our deepest
concern. While we must continue to work for
the easing of tensions between East and West,
we must recognize that recent events in
Czechoslovakia have slowed down this process.
Certainly, the Canadian Government could
not sit by and not protest. And, of course,
there are limitations as to why at the present
time it could do little more.
Article 24 of the Charter of the United Nations, which was approved by Parliament in
1945, imposes on the Security Council the primary responsibility for the maintenance of
international peace and security. Canada is
now a member of that Council, and will be
until the end of December this year. Therefore, we had a responsibility to see that the
United Nations, within its regrettable limitations, took the action it did.
What are the principles that we, as a country, have a duty to uphold? They are: the
recognition of the sovereign equality of all
nations-that is the bedrock on which the
Charter itself is based; and they include the
requirement that all members shall refrain, in
their international relations, from the threat
or use of force against the territorial integrity
or the political independence of any state.
These principles embody fundamental concepts of international law. There would be no
hope for ultimate peace in the world if these
principles were to be wantonly abandoned

SENATE DEBATES

importance and as an added protection for
their observance.
That is my respectful reply to the observations made in this context by the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Flynn)
last evening.
The Commission points out that section 133
of the British North America Act specifically
refers to the use of the English and French
languages. As my honourable friend reminded
us last evening, the fact is that in this section
the guaranteed usage of both languages is
limited to debate in the Parliament of Canada
and the Legislature of Quebec, the official
publication of the Statutes in Ottawa and
Quebec, and pleadings and processes of all
federal and all Quebec courts. But there is
no explicit provision for the use of English or
French in either the federal or the Quebec
administrative services, or in delegated
legislation.
The Commission believes that section 133
should be amended to remove any uncertainty that English and French are the two official
languages of Canada, and to provide rules for
the application of the principle of equality.
I hasten to add, as the Prime Minister bas
repeatedly indicated, that these objectives do
not in any way overlook the rights of other
ethnic groups in this country. The Government fully agrees with the Commission when
it emphasizes in its recommendation that
...
nothing in this section shall be taken
to diminish or restrict the use, as established by present or future law or practice, of any other language in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Would
the honourable leader of the Government
give the page reference?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Yes. This is to be found
at page 133 of the Report of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism. I
thank Senator Connolly (Ottawa West) for
asking me to give that information.
The Government bas decided to introduce
an official languages act because it believes,
as the Commission urges, that the Government must legislate forthwith on language
matters in order to give French and English
equal status within its own jurisdiction.
As the Commission sees it, the main aim of
an official languages act should be to ensure
that Canadian citizens can deal with administrative bodies in the two languages, and to
give the Governor in Council the necessary
authority for negotiating with provincial and

local authorities involved to widen the opportunities for Canadian citizens to deal with the
branches of government in both official
languages.
When this bill comes here we will have an
opportunity to deal with it. I assure the house
that the Government regards this as one of
the vital measures to be placed before the
present Parliament. It is one which I firmly
believe is essential, if we would take those
steps necessary for the preservation of our
national integrity and unity.
[Translation]
We witnessed recently a demonstration of
the policy of involvement at a time when
Canadians are conscious, more than ever I
think, of the progress we have made as a
nation.
All Canadians, whatever their language or
culture, must feel like citizens of all Canada;
that is the meaning we give to the policy of
involvement.
Involvement is the opposite of separation.
National unity is the concern of each and
everyone of us.
We have outlined as basic objectives the
equality of rights for all Canadians. Those
rights must apply to any Canadian who feels
left out of the mainstream of life in the
community.
Our goal must be to make the federal Government a huge point of convergence in
Canadian life, without ever losing sight of the
position of the provinces.
It cannot be denied that powerful forces
are being exerted against the present division
of powers between the federal and provincial
levels of government. We have said clearly
that we must recognize set limits for the federal powers. What are those limits?
First, our power to manage the economic
affairs of the country.
Second, the indivisibility of our international presence.
Third, our power to act in the national
interest in matters concerning all Canadians.
In order to protect those powers, the Government is willing to extend the participation
of the provinces in the federal activities and
institutions which may be of concern to
the provinces. We favour the revision of
our Constitution to create a federalism
within which all the provinces will have the
right to play their role fully in the federal
form of government.

SENATE DEBATES
We must proceed without delay-that is the
opinion, the position of the federal Government-with constitutional amendments to
define more clearly the fields in which
jurisdiction is doubtful, but we must insist on
keeping for the federal Government the powers it needs to ensure economic prosperity,
equal opportunities to all Canadians, and the
integrity as well as the unity of our country.
Similarly, honourable senators, we must
make sure that the provincial governments
participate fully in external activities which
are of concern or interest to them.
However, we must defend, it seems to me,
the fundamental principle of the indivisibility
of our foreign policy. We must ensure that
only one voice speaks abroad on behalf of
Canada.
It is imperative, for the unity of our country, that its foreign policy not be fragmented.
We must toil towards national unity. I am
convinced that we all agree on the matter of
national unity.
[English]

Honourable senators, you have all been
generous in listening to me for this
length of time. I have sought to give some
indication of my approach to my responsibilities as a senator in this house and as Leader of
the Government. I take my seat, expressing
my earnest desire to be of some service, as a
former prime minister who sat in this place
once said, "as the link between the government of the day and this chamber in opening
the door of opportunity to the Senate, so that
with the co-operation of honourable members
on both sides of this house it may discharge
to the full its duty to the people of our country." That was his desire, and that is my
desire today.
Hon. M. Gratan O'Leary: Honourable senators, I had intended to ask leave to adjourn
the debate, but if it is the wish of the house
and there is no objection I shall proceed. I
shall try to be brief.
First, Mr. Speaker, I must join with others
in extending to you the very just praise and
felicitations which are yours on assuming the
high office you now occupy.
I should like to say a few words of more
than formal appreciation of the speeches we
heard on Friday last in the moving and
seconding of the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne. Especially would I
like to express my appreciation of the speech
delivered by Senator Lazarus Phillips. I think
it was the finest speech of its kind that I have
heard since coming to this house. It had what

September 18, 1968

Mr. Gladstone once called "measure"; it had
tolerance; it had understanding; and it had
even a touch of wit and humour. We often
hear suggestions about how this Senate could
be improved, could be made more effective
and more meaningful. I suggest, honourable
senators, that one way of doing that would be
to send here more men of the heart, intellect
and conscience of Senator Lazarus Phillips.
Hon. Sena±ors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary (Carleton): No matter
how we tinker constitutionally with this
house, no matter how we change its rules and
procedures, in the last resort the good of this
house and the character of this house will be
determined by those who compose its
membership.
I had intended to deal immediately with
the Speech from the Throne, but our new and
distinguished Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Martin), although he spoke for
more than an hour-and I listened to him
with close attention and great interest, as I
always do-devoted exactly ten of those 60
minutes to discussing the Speech from the
Throne. That is understandable; I think
it explains the skill in debate which has
achieved for him the high position he has
occupied in the parliamentary life of this
country for the last 40 years.
I remember reading a court case heard in
England some years ago in which Lord Birkenhead, then F. E. Smith, was appearing. He
listened to his opponent, a very distinguished
counsel, presenting his case in a speech which
lasted two hours. When his opponent sat
down, Lord Birkenhead rose and said, "My
Lord, following the example of my learned
friend, I will submit the case without argument." I think that is what rather influenced
the Leader of the Government today. Like the
Speech from the Throne, he submitted the
case without argument.
Before I come to the Speech from the
Throne I should like to deal briefly with the
two subjects with which the Leader of the
Governement dealt, namely, foreign policy
and the Senate. I entirely agree with himand I have said it before in this chamber
-that any real, meaningful improvement in
this house should have its origin in the house
itself, should come from those sitting here
who know and understand more about the
Senate's real functions and needs.
I remember many years ago, a very distinguished parliamentarian,
a very great
Canadian, the honourable Clifford Sifton,

September 18, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

speaking on the role of the Senate, said that
the real function of the Senate should not be
the protection of minorities, not protection
against the executive, not a second look at
the work of the House of Commons, but protection of the public interest from the growing power of the bureaucracy. I agree with
that.
Honourable senators, we hear much in this
country and in other parliamentary countries
about the disturbing power, the disturbing
growth of power of the Prime Minister. I
subscribe to that: I do not think many of our
people realize that the Prime Minister of
Canada today wields as much if not more
power than the President of the United States,
who is subject to checks and balances. The
real Government of Canada today is not with
the House of Comnimons, not with the executive and not in this Senate: the real Government of Canada today is carried on from the
office of the Prime Minister and the office of
the Privy Council. I could name ten bureaucrats, and each of them having more power
than any member of this chamber or any
member of the other place, and far more
power in the Government of Canada than any
member of the cabinet.
The question is, how do we check that
growing power? The genius of free British
institutions, the genius of a free parliamentary society, is in countervailing forces.
Thus, we have, in justice, the prosecution
and the defence; in Parliament, we have the
Executive and the Opposition. But, honourable senators, there is no countervailing power
against the pretensions of the bureaucracy.
How does the average cabinet minister know
that he is getting the right advice? How does
the cabinet know that it is getting the right
advice?
What the cabinet needs is a devil's advocate, an organization of its own, to check the
advice and the policies submitted to it by the
bureaucracy. I am not saying these men are
dishonest, I am not saying they are incompetent, I am not saying they are not good
Canadians; but these men are human, they
are not infallible. So, there should exist in the
cabinet or near the cabinet or in the office of
the Prime Minister, some countervailing
check on the pretensions and the power of the
bureaucracy. Unless this be so, unless this
comes, not only the power of the executive,
not only the power of the cabinet but the
power of Parliament itself will steadily
diminish.
It is true also that the Opposition in Parliament, in the other place and here, should

have at its disposal research facilities to
check the policies and the programs of the
executive, no matter whence they come.
I know that in recent years, in recent
weeks or days, the Prime Minister has suggested that the Government provide the Opposition with research facilities. That is a step
in the right direction, but it is not what is
needed. The Opposition must never accept
research facilities as a favour from the Government. Those facilities should be given to
the Opposition by Parliament itself, by an act
of Parliament, just as the Leader of the Opposition is given his salary by an act of Parliament. Those powers should be given by
Parliament, to Parliament, to reconstruct and
strengthen the structure of Parliament itself.
They should not be a gift from any government, not some government turning over a lot
of young bureaucrats beholden to it, to tell
the Opposition what is wrong or right about
this or some other thing. This facility for
research by the Opposition should be given
by Parliament, by terms of reference set up
by Parliament, and it should be under the
control of Parliament, for Parliament's own
safety.
Honourable senators, I believe the Senate
could play a much more effective role than it
is playing today. After all, how is the Government of this country carried on? I venture
to say that 75 per cent of all the administrative acts taken by the Government are taken
by order in council. How many of those
orders in council are examined by this Senate? Do we take a second look at them? Do
we take any look at all at them? How much
examination do we give to delegated authority, to the acts of bureaux and commissions
and so on, to the acts of people who are
dealing directly with civil liberties, dealing
with individuals, who can curtail and abuse
their power, who can abuse the rights of the
citizen? This house is supposed to protect
minorities-and in this case the public is a
minority, it is a minority in the case of government, in the case of bureaucrats, in the
case of boards, bureaux and commissions.
This house should and could perform a meaningful service, by taking a look at the orders
and the records of those boards. I submit to
you that in no other way will we get meaningful parliamentary and democratic government in this land. I would like to pursue this
further and I shall take occasion later to
do so.
Honourable senators, I should like to say a
few words on the reference by the honourable

SENATE DEBATES

Leader of the Government to foreign affairs.
My complaint about foreign affairs is that the
Parliament of Canada is not given adequate
information about the conduct of foreign
affairs. A few years ago I complained when
Senator Connolly (Ottawa West), who had
been our distinguished leader, came to this
house and, with a proper show of pride, told
us that we were proposing to send troops to
Cyprus. The impression he gave to us then
-if not directly, indirectly-was that this
would be for a period of three months or
perhaps six months. For nearly four years our
troops have been in Cyprus, at a cost of some
$11 million to the Canadian treasury and at a
cost last year of $3,500,000. Does any person
in this nation believe that peace in Europe, or
peace between Turkey and Greece, was kept
by that force of 800 Canadians? To believe so
would be absolute nonsense. Even today,
when even Archbishop Makarios says that
these troops are no longer needed, we are
going to reduce the force only by 25 per cent.
I submit to you that this has never been a
United Nations' force: it has been a fraud on
the people of this country and on the world to
call it a U.N. force. Honourable senators, I
object strenuously to the word of U Thant
being offered to this country as the word of
the Holy Ghost. I object to this and, what is
more, I would like to ask the Government
why are we intervening in the domestic
affairs of Rhodesia. Why did the Security
Council intervene in the affairs of Rhodesia,
contrary-according to a great authority, no
less than the former Secretary of State of the
United States, Mr. Dean Acheson-to its
charter and a betrayal of all that the United
Nations should be about.
We go on blindly accepting anything which
comes to us from Whitehall or Downing
Street. If Mr. Wilson said tomorrow that a
thing is right about Rhodesia, we say it is
right; if he says we should impose sanctions,
we impose sanctions.
I submit again that this little country has
no right to interfere in the domestic affairs of
other countries.
I know there are people in this nation
who go about proudly asserting that we are
a middle power, that we are this or that, and
-in this respect we have caught some of the
fervour of our American neighbours-that we
are the "Mr. Fixit," to go all over the world
supervising the behaviour of human beings
here, there and everywhere. No nation on
earth today has that power or that right or
that capacity, as we have seen in Vietnam.

September 18, 1968

Not even our rich, powerful Americans are
able to supervise and control human behaviour
all over the earth.
But I get back, honourable senators, to my
contention. The distinguished leader of the
house today said that we must take more
active interest in foreign affairs. Well, we
cannot take that active, effective interest in
foreign affairs unless somebody in his position
tells us more of what those affairs are about.
I recall, two years ago, going with the
Canada-United
States
Interparliamentary
group to Washington. Before we went there
we were briefed by some gentlemen from the
Department of External Affairs. They were
good. They were intelligent. They briefed us
on NATO. But, honourable senators, it was
not until we reached Washington and not
until we actually sat across from the American members of that group that we were told
how many submarines Russia had placed in
the Mediterranean during the last year. They
gave us the exact figures. They did not have
every document marked "security". They did
not have every document marked "restricted
information". They had been supplied with
everything and they gave us information we
could not get here, even if we asked for it.
I submit that you are not going to get our
people to take an active, informed interest in
foreign affairs unless we have more frankness, more candour and more good sense
from our Department of External Affairs.
This is true of the Senate, and I believe, sir,
that when you come, as you indicate, not to
liquidate the Senate but to sit down with us
to try to improve it, you, with your great
wealth of information about foreign affairs,
should insist on these things.
We should bring these young men before
the External Relations Committee and compel
them to give us the information we want. We
should not have them say to us, "Oh, this is
restricted information," and walk out. This is
not the way it should be. This is not the way
to get your people to take a responsible interest in external affairs, which, after all, are
only an extension to the rest of the world of
domestic policy. There is nothing mysterious
about foreign affairs.
Surely there is more to external relations
than Cadillac cars and cocktail parties here,
there and everywhere all over the world. This
is what I object to. This is not a secret society. This is not something above or beyond the
rest of the populace. We are not aborigines.
We are Canadian citizens who are paying the
salaries of these gentlemen, and they should
be more responsible to us.

September 18, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Now, sir, having said that, and I would like
to say more, I want to come to the Speech
from the Throne. I noticed that my friend the
Leader of the Government devoted very little
time to the Speech frorn the Throne. I can
understand this. I remember that during the
course of the summer the Prime Minister
admonished his colleagues very sternly, saying, "You must not leak out what is going on
in the cabinet." Now, sir, when I read the
Speech from the Throne I wondered why he
should have admonished them so sternly,
because nothing was going on in the cabinet.
Is this a Speech from the Throne? This, sir,
is not what a Speech from the Throne should
be. A Speech from the Throne traditionally,
almost down through the centuries, has been
an indication of a government program to be
submitted to the Parliament. This, sir, is not
a program. This is a yawn. There is nothing
here. There is nothing of reality for real people or for the problems of real people in a
real world. There is nothing here but a cascade of cliches, a procession of decayed
platitudes.
Some objection was taken recently in the
other place to the fact that the Speech from
the Throne did not mention the name of Her
Majesty the Queen. Honourable senators, I
submit to you that that was not the chief
grievance of the Queen. Her chief grievance
was that this anaemic English, this collection
of platitudes, should be put into the mouth of
her representative. And I do believe that His
Excellency the Governor General has a valid
claim against whoever it was who wrote that
speech.
I said it was a "yawn". Sir, it is more than
that. This is an apologia for doing nothing. It
is an apology for impotence; more than that,
it is a political pamphlet. It is a political
pamphlet and a party pamphlet which never
should have been put into the mouth of the
Queen.
Go over Speeches from the Throne in the
past-not only here but in England. My distinguished and brilliant colleague, I. Norman
Smith of The Journal, did that the other day.
He went over Speeches from the Throne for
100 years past and found that never-never
in England, never here-either under Conservative governments or Liberal governments, did they use the Speech from the
Throne as it has been used on this occasion.
Politics! Politics all the way through.
Let me read you, for example, some of the
things which the speech said-and, incidentally, I advise all of you to read "Why is a

Throne Speech?" in this afternoon's Journal.
Let me read you this:
For its part, Parliament can be assured
that the federal Government will contribute fully and assume leadership wherever
it can properly do so.
Does the Queen say this? Is she telling us that
her ministers in Ottawa are going to assume
proper leadership here, there and the other
place? But listen to this:
We have taken and are taking effective
strides toward economic conservation...
The Queen is telling us this-to the extent of
three thousand words? Do you know how
long the British Speech from the Throne was
last year and the year before? One thousand
two hundred words and one thousand three
hundred words, respectively. They indicated
what they were going to do and let it go at
that. The defence of it or praise of it was to
come late-although it did not come this afternoon from the distinguished Leader of the
Government. He made no attempt to defend
this speech, and I venture to say he had
nothing to do with the writing of it. At least I
have too much respect for him in his mastery
of the English language to think that the
anaemic English of that document should
have been written by him.
I say, sir, that, if we cannot elect cabinet
ministers who can write better English than
that, then we are in a bad way.
All summer long Canadians got up and
read their morning papers expecting some
dramatic announcement-the "new thrust."
The "new era." What did they get? All they
got was a succession of appointments of new
executive assistants for ministers, or new
judges for the citizenship courts.
What were the members of the cabinet
doing? I suspect they must have been listing
to travelogues! Stratford; the northern lights
of the Yukon; Palma, with its beauty in the
sunset; and the magic of the dance floors of
Madrid. This, sir, is the reason. This is the
reason for the poverty and impoverishment of
the Speech from the Throne. There has never
been anything like it in the history of Canada
and I pray to God there shall never be anything like it again. It is a confession of
impoverishment. What is there in this Speech
from the Throne of immediacy or urgency for
the 450,000 Canadians who are unemployed?
I remember, sir, in the old days of a Conservative Government when you were in your
prime and you rose in the House of Commons
every day on the Orders of the Day and said,

DIVORCE
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck, Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Divorce, presented
the committee's first report:
Your committee recommends:
1. That it be granted leave to sit during
adjournments of the Senate, and during
sittings of the Senate.

2. That it also be granted authority to
appoint as many subcommittees as
deemed necessary for the purpose of considering such divorce matters as may be
referred to them by the committee and to
set the quorum thereof, the subcommittee
in each case to report its findings to the
committee.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into
consideration?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck moved that the report be
placed on the Orders of the Day for consideration at the next sitting.
Motion agreed to.

ask the honourable the leader if it is the
intention that the house shall sit on Tuesday

SENATE DEBATES
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of His Excellency the Governor General's speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Honourable Mr. Phillips
(Rigaud), seconded by Honourable Mr. Eudes,
for an address in reply thereto.
Hon. Donald Cameron: Honourable senators, by way of introduction I would first like
to pay my respects to His Honour the Speaker and tell him how delighted I was when I
heard of his appointment to this position. I
have known him for many years, since his
appointment as a Minister of the Crown. I
have always known him to be a man of integrity, one who has done his work with care
and distinction, and I am sure that we are all
very happy to have him among us in this
honoured position in the Senate.
I should also like to extend my compliments to the new Leader of the Government
in the Senate (Hon. Mr. Martin), also a
friend of long standing, and to say that we
wish him well in this chamber and that we
look forward to the leadership be will be able
to give us.
May I also extend my felicitations and
congratulations to the new members of the
Senate who have joined us in this chamber
for the first time. They represent an interesting variety of backgrounds and experience,
and I am sure that this chamber will be
enriched by the contributions they make.
I join with other honourable senators in
commending Senator Phillips and Senator
Eudes on the excellent speeches they made in
moving and seconding the motion for an Address in reply to the Speech from the Throne.
I should like to compliment my friend and
colleague Senator Flynn on his speech in the
debate on the motion for an address. It had
that touch of partisanship that adds piquancy
to any debate but, as we always expect from
him, he was fair and constructive.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Cameron: I should like to compliment the honourable Leader of the Government for two things. The first of these is his
announced intention to have a more meaningful discussion of external affairs in the Senate. Honourable senators will welcome this,
because it is an area in which they, by reason

September 19, 1968

of their background, experience and maturity, can be very helpful.
Secondly, I was very glad to hear Senator
Martin say that he had not become the Leader of the Government in the Senate in order
to preside over its liquidation. Most honourable senators will agree with him when he
says that the Senate can and does play an
effective, if unpublicized, role as the public
forum on matters of interest to all Canadians,
and that it should go much further in this
respect.
The second role of the Senate is an investigatory one. This house bas already performed extremely valuable national service
through its special committees on Finance,
Manpower and Employment, Land Use, Aging, Consumer Credit, and Science Policy.
Had the Cabinet not acted as they did and set
up a special task force to study Canada's
housing problem, we were prepared, and are
still prepared, to go ahead to study the full
question of housing, including such matters as
land acquisition, intergovernmental co-operation and responsibility, finance and technology. However, we shall wait to see what Mr.
Hellyer's task force comes up with, and if we
think there are areas which are still
untouched we can constitute a committee.
Finally, we have before us a motion to
constitute a special committee of the Senate
to study poverty. That is a truly monumental
task, but it is one which the Senate is willing
to undertake, and I look forward to participating on that committee.
Honourable senators, for a few moments I
should like to comment on the excellent
speech made yesterday by my friend and colleague, Senator O'Leary (Carleton). I want to
commend him, and to support his plea for
more information of substance with respect to
Canada's role and responsibility in foreign
affairs. Like most Canadians I have a sickening sense of futility as I watch the tragedy of
Biafra unfolding day by day. While I sympathize with the position the Government is
in-it does not want to risk getting involved
in a war with the Nigerians-it is my view,
nevertheless, that there must be something
more that we could have done in the supplying of food and the generation of sufficient
international pressure to stop the genocide
which is going on in that unhappy land at the
present time.
For years Canada has encouraged selfdetermination, and bas supported the rights
of minorities. Yet, in this case we have let the
legal fiction that we cannot interfere in the

Septernber 19, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

affairs of a Commonwealth partner prevent
any effective action. If the butchers of Nigeria are the kind of Commonwealth partners
we have to live with, then the sooner we
break our ties with that particular member,
the better.
I would like also to join with Senator
O'Leary (Carleton) in what he had to say
about the role of the bureaucrats in relation
to the functioning of a democratie society. He
was absolutely right when he said that many
of the members of Ottawa's so-called Establishment, and a lot of lesser lights who have
not quite reached the inner council of that
self-perpetuating circle, are acting as if they
were the Government rather than the people's
elected representatives, and members of Parliament have long suffered at their hands. It
is true that we have many able and dedicated
men and women in our Public Service, but
along with them there is far too large a number of low-grade time-servers whose productivity is low and whose attitude towards the
people they serve is quite the reverse of master and servant.
Over the years we have built up a vast
self-perpetuating bureaucracy from one end
of this country to the other, and there is a
vast and growing resentment against the faceless men who in their own good time make
decisions which fly in the face of knowledge,
equity and justice, and sometimes in the face
of the statutes of this country.
One of the announcements I was pleased to
hear the Prime Minister make after he
announced his Government was that he
intended to enlarge the Cabinet and provide
its members with elected parliamentary
assistants so that the men who hold the political responsibilities from the people would
make the political decisions affecting the people. What has grown up in Ottawa over the
years has been rule by a group of men who
think they have a divine right to rule.
Hon. Mr. Walker: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Cameron: Some of these people
have on more than one occasion told members
of the Cabinet, not to mention ordinary members of Parliament and senators, what they
could and could not do. Sometimes these civil
servants may have been right and the elected
representatives wrong, but we have in our
democratic way of life a system of checks and
balances whereby if a menber of Parliament
makes mistakes the electorate can deal with
him at the next election, while it is practically impossible to fire a civil servant under .our
present rules. Though I would not like to

revert to a patronage system, it is my judgment that we have gone too far in providing
built-in security for the incompetent and the
would-be little Hitlers.
While I am on the subject, let me say that
when we passed the act providing for collective bargaining in the Public Service some 18
months ago I opposed then, and will oppose
today, the inclusion in the legislation of the
right to strike in the Public Service. We must
go further than that and deny the right to
strike, except under the most carefully prescribed conditions, in any of the essential
public services. We have had enough of the
anarchy of the longshoremen, the seaway
workers, the postal workers, the Air Canada
mechanics and the grain handlers. At the
same time, the Parliament of Canada has a
responsibility to see that equity and justice
are done to these men. We must be concerned
with setting up machinery to make sure that
they do get equity and justice, but the establishment of that kind of machinery will be
the subject of another discussion at another
time.
However, again we come back to the faceless men who run Canada, the men who for
years ignored the legitimate grievances of the
postal workers until they were goaded to
strike out of sheer frustration. I live in a
company town, or I should say in a government town. When I say "company town",
you know the kind of authoritarian rule
I am equating it with. It is no accident
that the citizens of my government town refer
to the administrative headquarters of the government there as "the Kremlin," because that
description fits all too aptly.
Here I do not want to criticize the local
administrators who are on the job, because if
they were given the power and if the citizens
were given some responsibility for their own
welfare, much of the antagonism towards the
Government would be abated; but no, all of
the decisions have to be made in Ottawa-by
people 2,000 miles away.
What is true of my town is true of all of
those people who have to deal with that particular segment of our so-called public servants. As a matter of fact, one of the most
useful things the Senate could do would be to
set up a committee to examine the whole
structure, organization, authority and productivity of the public service. When all of the
main decisions have to be made in Ottawaby people living 2,000 miles away-we find

SENATE DEBATES

ourselves in the position where public servants are, if not making the law, at least interpreting it in the way they see fit, regardless
of whether or not their decisions adversely
affect the lives of the people. What is true of
my town is true for all of the people who
have to deal with that particular segment of
our public service.
Let us not be under any illusions that this
is the situation particularly peculiar to the
federal service. The same tendency to
authoritarian rule is present in the provincial
civil service-as a voluminous correspondence
over the treatment of the settlers in the land
being flooded under the Columbia River
Treaty can testify.
The time is long overdue for the appointment of an effective ombudsman-perhaps
not one, but many-to protect the rights of
the people. As a matter of fact, the appointment of a Senate committee such as I suggest
is long overdue.
Honourable senators, my next remarks deal
with something of concern to all Canadians,
the student revoit and its implications for
Canada. For the next few moments I would
like to turn my attention to one of the many
problems facing the people of Canada in conmon with those of other countries, namely,
the Student Revolt.
As we pick up our papers we see the headlines: Newfie High School Students on Strike;
Students Evicted from the Sorbonne; Students Occupy Columbia University; Students
Riot at Berkeley; Students insist on Right to
Appoint Dean of Arts at U.B.C.; Students
Threaten to Burn Down Universities; and in
the Financial Post of September 14-Campus
Revoit, McGill Leaders Analyze Causes; and
in today's news broadcast-Army Occupies
University of Mexico. And so it goes on.
I have the Financial Post story on McGill,
and I am sorry to say that it suffers some
weakness of condensation. It may not be fair
to the authors, but from what I have read in
that report there is nothing new and the solutions are not adequately put forward.
From what I have said it is evident that the
student unrest is practically universal and it
might be well to examine, if we can, some of
the causes of this unrest. In trying to find
some answers which might be at the basis of
this climate of unrest we may start with the
following points.
First: the idealism and enthusiasm which is
typical of youth during the high school and
university period finds it hard to adapt to the

September 19, 1968

realities of a world in which conditions are
far from ideal.
Second: the student sees around him pockets
of squalor and misery in every community
whether it be urban or rural, but particularly
in the former. He sees unemployment and
undernourishment in a country which should
have neither. He sees and talks and reads
about the affluent society and he sees so many
thousands of people whom the "affluence" has
passed by.
Third: on the international scene he sees
Canada and other countries standing helplessly by as a country which five short years
ago was held up as a model of democracy in
black Africa, Nigeria, trying to exterminate a
race of 14 million people, the Ibos. At the
same time he knows that the Nigerian Government is being supplied with arms to carry
out the extermination project by those two
pillars of international probity, the United
Kingdom and the U.S.S.R. He is aware of the
continuing horror of Vietnam. All of these
things, regardless of what justifications may
be made for them, make a mockery of our
protestations of Christian idealism. He sees
the continuing battle between management
and labour in which a few men, whether it be
on the side of management or on the side of
labour, by their actions and decisions can tie
up and adversely affect the welfare of a
nation of 20 million people.
Therefore, when you see the picture from
the student's eye-view it is small wonder that
he becomes disillusioned with the results of
our democratic society whose roots are supposed to be nurtured in the halls of learning.
Saying this is not to justify or condone the
extremism of many of the irresponsible and
even dangerous advocates of student power,
one of the most meaningless phrases in the
lexicon of modern journalese.
One may well ask, why should there be
revoit on the Canadian campuses and how
long will it continue? There are some who
think this will be a passing phrase which
might fade out in a few weeks or months. I
think that those who feel this way are wishful
thinkers. The student revolt is only one
aspect of a growing and universal demand for
change in directions, purposes and directives
of our society. But, to confine the discussions to the university campuses themselves,
what are the justifications for the student
disillusionment, if any? They might be
summed up as follows:
The appointment by provincial governments to the boards of governors of people

September 19, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

who, regardless of their own individual integrity and professional competence, are, in
general, dedicated to the preservation of the
status quo in a time when the status quo
thinking is obviously not good enough.
In a television address the other day, Mr.
Loney, President elect of the Canadian Union
of Students, referring specifically to the
Board of Governors of one of Canada's newest universities, Simon Fraser, said: "Who are
the Board of Governors who are setting the
policies and running this institution?" And
he answered himself by saying: "A collection
of lawyers and businessmen who know nothing about education." The fact that some of
these lawyers and businessmen have been
very successful in their own professions does
not count with Mr. Loney. In the same
speech, the same Mr. Loney went on to say,
"We will take over the Administration Building;"-here he was referring to Simon Fraser
-"we will occupy the building, we will close
it down."
At the recent meeting of the Canadian
Union of Students at the University of
Guelph, the current President of the Union,
Mr. Warrian, of the Ryerson Institute in
Toronto, stated publicly: "Student power will
take over the universities; we will wreck
them or we will burn them down."
Now, these are the officially elected
representatives of Canadian university students. What these people represent is not
legitimate social change, but anarchy. These
people have moved in on the campuses of our
universities as a well organized, well disciplined and thoroughly indoctrinated revolutionary group. To those of us who know university students, we know that these people do
not represent the thinking of the average student, nor the majority of university students.
They are a dissonant and revolutionary
minority who have been able to achieve their
positions of power by a dedicated and ruthless utilization of the commando techniques
common to revolutionists everywhere. These
are the people who would run our
universities.
One might very well ask, what qualifications have Mr. Loney or Mr. Warrian, or
those members of the student body and the
faculty who think and act like them, to determine what the curriculum of a university
must be? What qualifications are required to
teach in a university? One might ask them,
what are their qualifications to raise the
funds necessary to operate multi-million dollar businesses? What qualifications have they
to administer the expenditure of these funds

and what qualifications have they to select
the deans and presidents of the universities?
The answer is obvious.
Here I want to say a word or two about the
situation on university faculties. Because of
the explosion in university enrolments in the
past five years, university administrators
have been desperate to get the staff necessary
to man the classrooms. As one university
professor I know well said to me not long
ago: "After advertising for staff I get the
application and then I finally get to see the
man when he is sitting across the desk from
me, and I reach over and touch him and, if
he is warm, we hire him."
The result is that university administrations have searched far and wide but have
been unable to find enough faculty members
with the qualifications of personality, integrity, training and ability to communicate, the
qualifications that are necessary to do an
effective job. The result is that in many classrooms today we have people teaching who
have the most minimal qualifications for their
responsibilities. This is especially true in
those undisciplined disciplines of sociology,
social psychology and some of the arts. These
are the areas whence come "the intellectual
hippies" of our universities-the people who
come to their classrooms in filthy, turtlenecked sweaters, tattered, sloppy and dirty
clothes. These are the faculty members who
along with the student power activists are
encouraging the confrontation with the
administrations. These are the people who,
having no pride in themselves, cannot be
expected to inspire pride in their students.
These are the people who are undermining
standards of conduct and morality on our
university campuses and in our communities.
And here I would ask the privilege of putting on the record, as an example of what
these people stand for, an article which originated in the United States from an American
professor of English, has had wide circulation
on Canadian campuses and is being included
in the indoctrination information being sent
out by the students' councils of at least some
of our leading Canadian universities. To my
knowledge it was distributed at the University of British Columbia where I have a daughter as a student, and at the University of
Western Ontario where my friend Norman
Campbell of the Ottawa Citizen has a daughter enrolled. Moreover, I have it on the authority of one of my colleagues, Senator Sullivan, who is on the Board of Governors of

SENATE DEBATES
the University of Toronto, that it was circulated there. I am confident that it is circulating on many other campuses as well.
This article, which is entitled "The Student
As Nigger", was reprinted in The U.B.C., the
official publication of the Students' Council of
the University of British Columbia. It is
important to note, however, that this document is being printed and distributed under
authority of the Canadian Union of Students,
the official national organization representing
the 252,700 full-time and the 113,000 part-time
students of our Canadian universities.
In asking that this be put on the record I
do so with some misgivings, because it is
probably the worst piece of writing in a
moral sense that has ever gone into a Senate
Hansard. My justification for asking that it be
put on the record is that few people realize
the quality and the standards of the people
who have succeeded in being elected as the
official spokesmen of the 365,000 students
enrolled in our universities this year.
I am not sure, Mr. Speaker, just how this
article should be handled. It is a rather
shocking document, and it may be that you
would like to appoint a committee to review
it before it is included in Hansard, but the
reason that I ask that it be included in our
official record is that it is endorsed by the
officers or officials of the 365,000 Canadian
university students today. It is being included
in the literature being sent out to welcome
students to the campus and to give them a
feeling of being a part of the campus; but I
am sure from my knowledge of students that
it does not represent the feeling of typical
Canadian students, and I am certain it does
not represent the mores and desires of the
Canadian people. I think it will come as a
shock to a lot of people to realize that this is
the kind of material, in effect subversive
material, that is being distributed today-and
when I use the word "subversive" I am not
speaking of it in an idealogical sense. We
cannot dismiss this kind of suppurating sore
in our body politic as something that is
confined to a few neurotie and anarchistic
individuals and which will in time dry up
and disappear. We must carefully examine
the bases of complaint against both faculties
and administrations.
What are the complaints? They are:
1. That the student is treated as a "nigger",
that he is segregated as on a reserve, and that
he has no rights and no opportunity of
self-expression.

September 19, 1968

2. That the relation between faculty and
student is that of master and slave.
3. That faculty members are authoritarian;
than they are divorced from reality; that they
are incompetent; that they are cringing cowards afraid to face economic, political and
moral issues; that they are content to teach
by rote material that is often outdated, irrelevant and immaterial, and that they even do
this badly.
4. That the university has not defined its
goals and purposes for education. Education
for what?
5. That university administrators and
boards of governors are incompetent dullards
who have no knowledge of where they are
going or how to get there.
6. That there is either no or too few student
representation on boards of governors, university senates or teaching faculties.
There is much more, of course, but the
foregoing enumeration of points in the main
represent the major criticisms made by the
student activists and faculty representatives.
Let us take some of these points in order
and see what the answers might be. First,
that the student is treated as a "nigger", that
he is segregated as on a reservation and that
he has no rights and no opportunity for
self-expression.
This is just utter nonsense, particularly on
Canadian campuses. Indeed, this is a carryover from the racially tense American campuses. The student, by virtue of the fact that
he has earned admission to an academic cornmunity, has rights and opportunities if he has
the wit and the energy to use them. Every
university administration has made provision
for countless organizations under student government to cater to the extra-curricular needs
and interests of all students. Every university
has made provision for its student body to
publish its own newspaper. They have done
so, and in many cases these papers have gone
so far as to interpret freedom as licence. They
have their debating societies and parliamentary forums in which they can discuss any
subject they wish, even to that of abolishing
universities or condemning faculties. The students have these rights and freedoms now,
but where they have fallen down is through
sheer inertia or lack of interest. Go to the
average university student association meeting
and see how many students are there. It is a
small percentage, and that is why the wellorganized boys take over. Students have not
been willing to participate. If students had
overcome their inertia and had been willing

September 19, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

to participate, I am sure many of the socalled "elected" spokesmen of Canadian university students would not be the official
spokesmen today.
In many universities today the students do
have representation on the faculty councils,
on the senate and even on the board of governors, albeit this is a new venture in many
universities.
The second point was that of the master
and slave relationship. While there may be a
few academics today who possess this attitude, their numbers are so small as to be
insignificant. In the main this is just emotional and inflammatory garbage.
Third, that faculty members are authoritarian; that they are divorced from
reality; that they are incompetent; that they
are cringing cowards afraid to face economic,
political and moral issues; that they are content to teach by rote material that is often
outdated, immaterial and irrelevant.
Like all generalizations, this has a grain of
truth in it. Some university professors are
authoritarian, not always because they want
to be for the sake of authoritarianism, but
because they have a respect for themselves
and the discipline they are teaching and they
insist that the student not waste his and other
people's time.
Some professors are divorced from reality
because they are trying to perpetuate the
ancient tradition that the university is a cloistered retreat for scholars sheltered from the
storms of a turbulent world. The university
should be a retreat for scholars, where men
of intelligence and depth of understanding
should have the opportunity to examine the
goals of education and how they may be translated into effective reality. But where some
faculty members make a mistake is that they
ignore their responsibility to communicate
with their students and with society. And the
public at large is in part responsible for this.
We have rightly been putting an increasing
emphasis on research, and this is vitally
important in our technological and rapidly
changing society. But in some cases we have
our priorities inverted. Instead of the main
emphasis being on research and then teaching, it should be the other way round. Our
first responsibility should be on teaching and
communicating, always remembering that
communication to be effective must be a twoway street, and then research-and it should
be emphasized that properly integrated and
planned research is the element that can
make teaching vital and alive.

Yes, there are some incompetents on university faculties as there are in other professions. We make no apology for them, but the
public itself would be the first to scream if
we closed the classrooms and did not provide
the opportunity for their sons and daughters
to go to school.
If we must make a choice, it is probably
better to risk employing a few incompetents
in order that our students may be exposed to
the disciplines and intellectual challenges
involved rather than deprive them of the
opportunity of attending university at all.
That some university professors are intellectual and moral cowards, is also true. Too
many of them are not prepared to stand up
and be counted on the great issues of our day.
Too many are too security-conscious to be
willing to risk their comfort and security, and
in this respect they are fairly typical of the
society of which they are a part.
That they teach by rote material that is out
of date, immaterial and irrelevant, is also
true of some-possibly too many-and there
is no question but that university teaching
methods could stand a lot of overhauling
today. In fairness I must say that this process
is constantly going on and it is exercising
some of the most stimulating minds in the
educational world at the present time.
Fourth, university goals and purposes:
Here we can get into a long and often fruitless discussion but it may be that our universities should carefully study, assess and
decide what the goals should be in the kind
of world we are living in today. These are
philosophical concepts but there is a need to
communicate them to our citizens and taxpayers so that they know what those goals
are. Not long ago I was present at a meeting
at the University of Saskatchewan where
much time was spent in discussion as to
whether there was a philosophical basis for
science or a scientific basis for philosophy. So
you can see where we are going there.
Fifth, that university administrators and
boards of governors are incompetent dullards
who do not know where they are going or
how to get there. To begin with, the great
majority of the membership on university
boards of governors are university graduates*
and professional men elected or appointed to
these positions because of their knowledge
of their own particular disciplines. Many of
them have not one degree but several
degrees. Others are usually leaders from
labour, management, the churches and the
community at large.

have developed a combination of myopia
and tunnel-vision.
They have made research into an academie religion and have branded the colleagues who devote the major portion of
their time and energies to undergraduate
teaching, as some kind of amiable
hereties.
Of course we need research scientists
in our universisites, or we shall never
learn to compete in this hyper-sophisticated world of ours, but we also need,
and must recognize, the virtues of the
man of broad vision and wisdom and
understanding of his fellowmen, and
particularly of the neophytes in the academie community who look to him for
guidance. The situation is serious in the
natural sciences where the objective
seems to be to have no undergraduate
courses, and only a few Ph.D. candidates
and Post-doctoral students under one's
wing. Utopia is, of course, achieved in
the research professorship with no students at all, unlimited research grants,
laboratory space, and technicians, and
travel grants to attend international
conferences.
It is even more serious when scholars
in the social sciences and the humanities
become imbued with this attitude and
completely forsake the world of students
and of teaching. I know this point of
view is open to dispute, and I know that
many great philosophers and even some
scientists have been recluses, but let me
remind you that Jesus, Socrates, Sir
Isaac Newton, and Albert Einstein were
in constant communication with their fellows while their greatest work was being
done. You may remember the Greek
myth which tells of the battle between
Hercules and Antaeus, the giant son of
Gaea (the earth). So long as Antaeus kept
in touch with mother earth, or kept his
foot on the ground as we might say, he
was invincible, but as soon as he lost
touch his strength deserted him and he
was overcome by Hercules. I cannot help
feeling that when our professors lose
touch with their students they become
not only lesser men, but lesser scientists
and scholars. The secret, of course, is in
keeping one's balance properly, as the
white knight said to Alice, and we of the
older generation in the universities must
never forget it.
29234-5

Honourable senators, that is the conclusion
of my address. Once again, I ask for your
consent to have included as an appendix this
document entitled, "The Student as Nigger."
DOCUMENT PRINTED AS APPENDIXPRIVILEGE

[Later:]
Hon. Mr. Cameron: Mr. Speaker I rise on a
question of privilege. I need direction as to
whether I may have this document printed as
an appendix to today's proceedings. I did not
read from the document at all, but I should
like to include it as supplementary material
because I think much of it is important and
relevant to the debate.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: What purpose would it
serve?
Hon. Mr. Cameron: I believe it would enable many people to understand how serious
the situation is, and to know the standing of
those acting as spokesmen for these Canadian
students today.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, the document in question was not read
by Senator Cameron when he had the floor.
In my opinion, to follow his proposal would
be in principle against the strict rules of this
house. However, there are different ways of
examining the problem. I could reserve my
judgment until I have had an opportunity to
read the document. On the other hand,
honourable senators are masters of their own
rules, and if they agree that leave should be
given to Senator Cameron to include this
document in our record, it could appear as an
appendix to Hansard.
Before making a final decision I should like
to hear from other honourable senators.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Mr. Speaker, this
question has arisen many times, and I think
it has been the custom that when a senator
believes it would be a public advantage to
put something on the record we have almost
always accommodated him. There is nothing
in the rules to prevent us from doing so. The
honourable senator who made the request on
this occasion is a responsible senator who
knows thoroughly the subject he has discussed, and he asked during his address for
the privilege of placing this material on the
record. I remember voicing my opinion at the
time that it was all right for him to do so and
I submit to you, sir, and to the house, that
there is no earthly reason why we should not
accommodate him in this way.

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, I
have no objection to that course being followed on this occasion. However, I would
point out that in the past we have only reluctantly followed this practice, and if it should
become unduly frequent, I reserve the right
to raise objection. For the time being, and in
the present case, I am in agreement.
Hon. Mr. Cameron: I would be quite happy
to adopt your suggestion, Mr. Speaker, that
you read the document and then make a
decision.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: We might as well decide to
do it now rather than leave the responsibility
with the Speaker.
The Hon. the Speaker: Leave has been
asked by Senator Cameron that the document
to which be referred should appear as an
appendix to Hansard. Is it the pleasure of
honourable senators that this be done?
Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable senators, I do not think the document should
appear as an appendix. It should appear in
Senator Cameron's speech in the appropriate
place, as if he had read it.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, I think the normal course ought to be
followed, that the material appear as an
appendix to Hansard. I do not think it makes
very much difference, but since it was not a
part of Senator Cameron's speech it should
not be in the corpus of his remarks. Since he
says that the document is germane to the
point he was discussing during his speech, I
think he is entitled to ask that this be done.
Obviously, honourable senators are unanimously agreed that this should be done, but
to follow Senator Macdonald's (Cape Breton)
suggestion of incorporating it in the speech
might create a very bad precedent. I think we
would be wise to adopt the precedent of having such material included as an appendix.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed that, by
leave of honourable senators, this document
shall appear as an appendix to Hansard?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
The Hon. the Speaker: It is so ordered.

the unavoidable absence for some time of
Senator Argue.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, may
I just point out what I am sure Senator
Lamontagne forgot to mention, that the unavoidable absence of Senator Argue is due to
the very serious illness of his wife.
Motion agreed to.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE
CONTINUED
Having reverted to the Orders of the Day:
The Senate resumed consideration of His
Excellency the Governor General's speech at
the opening of the session, and the motion of
Honourable Mr. Phillips (Rigaud), seconded
by Honourable Mr. Eudes, for an address in
reply thereto.
Hon. Frank C. Welch: Honourable senators,
I wish to congratulate all those who have
received appointments to this chamber during
the last few weeks. I am looking forward to
being able to meet them all personally.
It is good to be back again after the summer vacation and to renew old friendships.
Now that the pomp and splendor of the opening of the Twenty-Eighth Parliament is over
and written into the history of Canada, Parliament is once again down to the business of
governing this great nation and doing its best
to solve or to try to solve the problems facing
Canada at this time, the beginning of the
second century of Confederation.
Speaking of problems, in the past months
they have not lessened but, in my opinion,

September 19, 1968

BENATE DEBATES

have increased. As His Excellency the Governor General said in his opening remarks on
Thursday, September 12:
Across the land there are great expectations of what this Parliament will
produce.
This, in my view, is perhaps the only statement which really made any sense, as, in the
final analysis, the Speech told us very little
that we did not already know.
I must admit that I was considerably disillusioned by the Speech from the Throne, as
many of the propositions are holdovers from
the last session. In short, there is nothing new
in it for Canadians. It leaves the public in the
same disillusioned state of mind.
During his campaign, the Prime Minister
led the public to believe that he had all the
answers, if only he were elected. Some days
ago he made the statement that he was "no
Santa Claus." Canadians are not looking for a
Santa Claus; they only want an opportunity
to make a living, in the promised "just
society."
Many aspects of the Throne Speech are
vague, especially those dealing with the just
society, and possibly the Right Honourable
John Diefenbaker had the right answer when
he said, "A just society, just for the Grits!"
Do the dozen or so recent appointments
represent a sample of the just society? I cannot help but dwell on this subject of appointments for a moment, as an extremely large
number of unsuccessful candidates of the
party presently in power have been appointed
to some rather posh positions, some with
salaries less than that of a member of Parliament, and many with higher salaries. I also
note that, among the appointments to official
government positions, no unsuccessful Conservative candidates-many of whom, you
realize, have outstanding qualities and abilities-have been named.
Some rather impressive positions have been
handed out, with equally impressive salaries.
For example, the former member of Parliament for Hamilton West has been appointed
to the Canadian Transportation Commission
at an annual salary of $24,000. The former
member of Parliament for Kootenay East,
who did not run during the last campaign,
has been appointed to the Immigration Appeal Board at a salary of $19,000 per year.
The former Veterans Affairs Minister, who
lost his seat in St. Boniface, has been appointed to the Canadian Pension Commission at a
salary of $18,500 per year. Other defeated and
29234-51

unsuccessful Liberals have received appointments to fairly choice government positions,
and all at substantial salaries. Such appointments, plus their pensions, perhaps make the
statement of the Right Honourable John Diefenbaker, "A just society, just for the Grits",
not too far from the truth.
In view of this I would like to state for the
record, and to be used as a guide for the
future, that any Government in power, regardless of political affiliation, should take
into consideration the services rendered to
the Government and to Canada by any politician, and should reward him according to his
abilities and not his party affiliation. Honourable senators, many of you will agree with
me that even in the Senate, party representation is terribly one-sided, and if Prime Minister Trudeau wishes to show that he is really
sincere in his promise of a just society, he
should demonstrate it by appointing persons
affiliated to the Opposition.
I would like to make a few comments
regarding the proposed increase in postal
rates, as outlined by the Postmaster General,
which will be coming up for debate in this
session of Parliament. I would like to express
the view that the postal strike was unnecessary, and that the blame lies in the lap of the
former Government, firstly, for giving Public
Service employees the right to strike, and,
secondly, because of the laxness of the Prime
Minister in allowing it to continue, as he did.
I know that from my area telegrams were sent
to the Prime Minister by merchants, associations and Boards of Trade, asking him to do
everything possible to end the strike, as it
was seriously affecting the small businessman, more so than the individual. As was
anticipated, all replies were answered in the
Prime Minister's casual way.
With the strike finally settled, it was a
foregone conclusion that the public would
have to pay for salary increases, and before
we know it contract bargaining time will be
here again with workers still demanding
salary increases. Will this again cause postal
rates to go up? Naturally, the Postmaster
General will not cross that bridge until he
comes to it.
The public has no choice if rates increase,
and in all probability might not object if it
means improved services, but the elimination
of a Saturday delivery as suggested by the
Postmaster General does not in my mind
improve services. He has not made it clear
whether this will be the case in small town

SENATE DEBATES
post offices, such as that in my town of Wolfville, or simply in locations with delivery services. If this is so, then I deem it unfair to
those living in cities and in small towns,
because businessmen in small towns depend
as much on Saturday's mail as they do mail
through the week. If operations are to be
increased by this move in all places across
Canada, and not only in the cities, then I am
in favour of it, as over the years the quality
of postal service has not improved to any
marked degree. In many towns the more the
staff the less efficient the service becomes.
Postal increases are a further blow to the
small weekly newspaper publisher who must,
if he wishes to stay in business, pass the
increase on to the public. This, however, may
have its bright side. One newspaper advertising manager suggested to me that since postal
increases have been announced it may
improve newspaper advertising sales as firms
who use fiyers, and get less than 50 per cent
of them into the homes, may turn once again
to the newspapers to bridge the postal gap. I
have very little sympathy, however, for the
direct mail type of advertising with which we
are bombarded daily. This system has become
a nuisance.
If the Government railroads the postal
increase through the Commons by November
simply to cash in on the Christmas mailing,
then there will indeed be no Santa Claus.
When I was home last week a friend said to
me: "If this happens, don't be surprised if
you receive my Christmas card in October,"
and with a laugh he added: "After all, doesn't
the post office always insist that people mail
early."
Honourable senators, if you will permit me
a few further remarks on postal service, I
would ask: What about the mail drivers who
were under contract with the Government to
deliver mail to rural boxes? Why were they
not paid during the mail strike? They should
have been paid, as it was no falt of theirs
that they were out of work.
My final observation is that if the Postmaster General seeks over a two-year period to
change the current deficit into an annual
profit of $8 million to $10 million, and make
the Post Office a more businesslike operation,
I would strongly suggest that something be
done with the deficit incurred by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, thereby saving
some real money.
In the Speech from the Throne I see no
mention of giving any assistance to our forgotten neighbours, the West Indies. We are

September 19, 1968

giving millions of dollars in aid to other countries, but none to the West Indies, the most
deserving place of all. Whatever happened to
the promises of aid to them? I remember that
the former Prime Minister, Mr. Pearson,
when campaigning in the Atlantic provinces
in 1963, said that the Liberals would launch a
mammoth drive along the lines of the Colombo Plan for the Islands. Were these simply
campaign promises? Nothing really has been
done since 1957 when the Diefenbaker government launched a $10 million program for
expansion over a five-year period.
The Caribbean Plan can be best described
in the following editorial appearing in the
issue of the Montreal Star of September 11,
1968:
It is five years since any Caribbean
leader told us off so bluntly as Prime
Minister Shearer of Jamaica did the other
day. Stop the lip service, he said; cut out
the vague platitudes; assume the leadership expected of us in "Canada's sphere
of influence." "The pity is that in the
islands there remains ample ground for
such feeling so long after Prime Minister
Barrow of Barbados charged, "with dismay and despondency," that we had
"failed miserably" in our attitude toward
the emerging people there.
Time after time regional leaders have
told us their eyes are set on Ottawa for
far more than aid... They want freer
trade, particularly a profitable outlook
for the sugar which we buy now at less
than cost and at half the price paid by
the United Kingdom and United States.
And they are still waiting for positive
development of the bright new day in
relationships promised by Canadians at
the Caribbean-Canadian Conference of
1966. Even the Conference has not been
repeated, though it was to be succeeded
by a second within a year.
The editorial continues-and here I will not
quote, but simply cite the highlights-that if
one recalls the 1966 conference, he will
remember that about the only thing to come
out of it was an inter-island broadcasting system for which Ottawa offered to underwrite
most of the capital cost, but not the operating
costs. But Ottawa was surprised because no
one from the islands was happy with the
idea, considering it was not on the program
but just something pulled out of the hat by
Canada's Prime Minister. Honourable senators, we must do something to help these
people by increasing trade.

September 19, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Honourable senators, I know time does not
permit me to comment on everything in the
Throne Speech, but I do feel the Government
made a grave mistake when they put the axe
to the winter works program which so many
of the provinces relied upon. Some locations,
according to the press, are in favour of
scratching the plan, while others want it
kept, but all seem to be unanimous in criticizing the timing and suddenness of it. Its elimination does little to help unemployment
which already is at a high peak. A crosscountry sampling of remarks are as follows:
Gerald Gallagher, business manager of the
International Labor Union's 3,500-member
Toronto local said: "This arbitrary decision
will cause grievous hardship to great numbers of our men across Canada."
The Canadian Federation of Mayors and
Municipalities are demanding the program be
replaced.
Mayor William Adams, of St. John's, Newfoundland, said it will mean a loss to his city
of about $140,000 and some projects in the
planning stages must be scrapped.
The Province of Nova Scotia will try to
continue its own program. In New Brunswick, 17 winter works projects last year paid
workers $459,000 for 26,000 man-hours.
The City of Toronto stands to lose $1,500,000, and has asked the Government for alternatives to keep unemployment down.
Windsor will lose $416,913.00.
And so it goes, and our Prime Minister
calls it a just society, and also calls for every
Canadian to measure up to his capabilities
and opportunities. I ask: How can this be
done under such conditions?
I might also make a brief observation on
the overhaul of the rules of Parliament.
The Throne Speech indicates:
In order that Parliamentary institutions
may retain the confidence of the people,
and in order that they may cope successfully with the vast scope and complexity
of government today, it is essential that
made
for legislative
provision be
machinery that can act speedily... My
Government accords the greatest importance to parliamentary reform-

I have a suspicion that Canada is on the
way to creeping republicanism. I object
strongly to no reference being made in the
Throne Speech to the Queen and the Commonwealth for the first time, I think I am
safe in saying, since Confederation. This
seems to be the gradual decline of symbols
binding us to Britain and the Commonwealth.
An official languages bill has its good points
as well as its bad. It is true that we gain
something by knowing a second language and
I do not wish to cause a tempest in a teapot,
but language is a two-way street, to be used
by both English and French alike. I was told
of a tourist from Quebec arriving in my town
this summer and being highly annoyed
because the residents could not speak his language. Another person once said to me: "I
would like to be able to speak a second language but how can I learn when there is no
one to talk with, and only one radio station in
Moncton to listen to?"
In a way this bill is a mystery to me. Will
it mean that all federal employees are expected to be bilingual? What of the individual
who is unable to learn? In a great many cases
this is so.

Section 10 of the Bilingual and Bicultural
Commission recommendations states:
We recommend that the right of
Canadian parents to have their children
educated in the official language of their
choice be recognized in the educational
systems, and the degree of implementation is to depend on the concentration of
the minority population.
According to this there is a direct violation
of the rights of English-speaking pupils in St.
Leonard, Montreal.
In closing I wish to state that the people of
Canada know no more about the Government
plans now than they did during the election
campaign. There is no mention made of curbing the high cost of living; no mention is
made of economic development or the antipoverty campaign, housing and other matters.
In fact, Canadians are waiting to see what
they have bought with their votes.

Hon. Donald Allan McLean: Honourable
senators, since this is the first time I have
had the privilege in speaking in this or any
I trust that by this the Prime Minister is other parliamentary chamber I humbly ask
not intending to go back to the days of rub- your indulgence.
First let me congratulate you, Mr. Speaker,
ber stamp parliaments, nor to the days of
C. D. Howe who said: "What's a million?" I on your appointment. I should also like to
suppose today this should be updated to: congratulate the new Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Martin), who comes to this
What's a billion?

SENATE DEBATES

chamber from the other house with a world
of experience in public life. I know that
Senator Paul Martin will give this chamber
great leadership; he is a hard worker and an
outstanding statesman.
Let me also congratulate the six new senators who joined this Senate last Thursday,
September 12. J will not attempt to elaborate
on any of these men because I have not the
ability to display the eloquence shown by
Senator John Connolly and others, including
Senator Phillips (Rigaud), who gave such a
powerful performance in moving the Address
in reply to the Speech from the Throne.
I do not intend to list all the important
parts of the Speech from the Throne. After
highlighting the legislative program dealing
initially with the importance of parliamentary
rules and procedures, the Speech refers to
measures to protect farmers and fishermen,
and incentives for oil and gas production, and
it is to this that I wish to refer.
Honourable senators, fisheries is the point I
should like to base my remarks upon, and I
will speak first on the general fishing industry
on the east coast. However, I want to base
most of my remarks on the herring fisheries
in the Bay of Fundy, from Trinity Ledge at
the mouth of the Bay of Fundy and all the
way up the shores and islands of the Bay of
Fundy. Although I have been associated with
the fishing industry for nearly forty years, I
often have the feeling that I know as much
now about the fishing industry as I did when
I first started.
In view of the knowledge we appear to
have regarding most of the supplies of food,
it seems amazing that even now scientists still
have few definite answers to the problems
arising from the growth of population, and
particularly methods of conservation required
for all types of fish.
The most important nutrition that we have
today and will have in the future is the supply of good quality protein, or, in practice,
animal protein. As our knowledge of nutriton
goes, there are two fundamental principles of
diet which stand out, and these are the
importance of, first, a well-mixed diet and,
second, of animal protein and plant oils.
There is no question or argument that fish
In its many forms is perhaps one of the most
valuable foods from the point of view of good
protein. This makes the present situation in
which our fisheries are placed most difficult
to understand. Unlike many other industries,
we have been divorced from government
assistance for many years, yet here we are in

September 19, 1968

the last two years with several sections of the
industry at our doorstep in Ottawa crying out
for subsidies and other financial props. There
has, of course, been a rapid expansion of the
fishing capabilities due to encouragement of
the building of larger and more efficient fishcatching vessels.
Unfortunately, the other traditional fishing
nations had also been encouraging their
fishermen to go out and catch more fish, with
the United States being the original market
for fish blocks to be further processed into
fish sticks and fish portions. This was the
classie example of overproduction with a
limited market. As a result, there was a collapse on pricing and other marketing problems, and much of the industry is in financial
distress at the present time.
As is the case in situations such as this, we
have the usual cry for more studies to be
made to tell industry where they went wrong.
On the other hand, we have Parkinson's
Law again proving itself, whereby even
though the industry is searching for more
efficient methods to cut its costs and increase
its returns to survive, the budget of our Department of Fisheries has doubled in the last
few years to over $50 million for 1968-69.
Obviously a cold, hard look has to be taken
at the direction in which this department is
heading. No doubt many of its divisions are
performing necessary functions, but it would
appear that some positive direction must be
taken to stimulate demand at the consumer
level.
There is no question that the average
housewife on the North American continent
remains uneducated when it comes to her
knowledge of the use of fish. There has been
a barrier built up against our products over
the years which has to be cleared away
before the marketing problems can be solved.
The industry is fragmented by the vast number of products turned out, and it is impossible to expect the individual sections of the
industry to have any success at all in what
would have to be a large public relations and
advertising program.
Again, the cost structure of selling fish is
such that it is extremely difficult to build any
substantial amounts of promotional advertising as bas been done in some industries. The
Canadian industry may even have to go further afield, into the United States. This could
mean approaching the promotional program
in that country on an international level
whereby it might well be barred by the other

September 19, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

larger countries marketing fish, such as Iceland and Norway.
Honourable senators, perhaps the most
important problem facing our fishing industry
is conservation, and here again the problems
are many and varied. In the remainder of the
time allotted to me, I will deal with the herring fisheries, mostly in the Bay of Fundy
area. I did not want to create any wrong
impressions regarding the herring fisheries,
other than the Bay of Fundy areas. I want to
explain briefly the difference that I mean
when I am talking about herring and sardines. The sardine is a small young herring
which is caught from the age of one year up
to four years, when the herring reaches the
age of maturity and the first year of
spawning.
The early history of Canadian herring
fisheries is not well documented, but some of
it can be inferred from the history of other
fisheries that used herring for bait. The early
colonists undoubtedly used some herring for
food, but they probably used great quantities
in the catching of cod for the salted cod
export trade. American vessels fishing for
herring in Canadian waters towards the end
of the 18th century and in the early part of
the 19th century caught herring in the Gulf of
St. Lawrence and transported it to Maine and
Massachusetts for bait and some for food.
However, both the bait and the food markets
in the United States declined drastically.
Fishing for herring in the Bay of Fundy
goes back beyond the earliest visits of European fishermen about 450 years ago. The Indians had simple forms of weirs and also
caught herrings by torching, that is, using a
light. The weir fishery as we know it today
started about 1820, but prior to and during
the development of the weir fishery, large
quantities of herring were taken by gill nets
on the spawning grounds around Grand
Manan Island. There has been reference made
where there were as many as 120 vessels
being congregated at Southern Head, Grand
Manan, engaged in gill netting of the spawning herring which were either salted or
smoked for edible foods..
After their introduction, the number of
weirs in the Bay of Fundy increased steadily.
In 1849 there were 55 weirs at Grand Manan,
Campobello and Deer Island. By 1880 there
were 142 weirs. In 1933 there were 293 weirs
and in recent years they went up considerably to over 400 in this area. These weirs were
operated annually from the months of May
until October. From 1935 until 1958 the weirs
declined to 267, and in the year 1967 they

further declined to 208. This is, to the sardine
industry, a very serious situation. Without the
weir fishermen it would be impossible for the
sardine industry to survive. In the Bay of
Fundy we have two types of herring fishery.
We have the weir fishery, which is a stationary so-called trap that is built off the shore
and owing to heavy winds through fall and
winter these weirs cannot operate.
I would strongly advise that the Department of Fisheries of our Canadian Government make a feasibility study of this weir
fishing, and that there could be some form of
assistance given them in years of failure. I
would not recommend a free grant, but some
form of loan that could be paid back in years
of good fishing.
The other type of herring fishery in the
Bay of Fundy is called the purse seiners. This
mobile fishery moves about and finds the
schools of fish and circles the herring
between dark and daylight. These purse seiners do not operate in the daylight hours. In
the summer months the fleets of purse seiners
work on the large schools of herring that
come in on the shore to spawn.
The herring is the only member of the fish
family that deliberately lays its eggs on the
seabed and for this purpose selects areas
where the bottom is firm. The eggs sink to
the bottom and stick in layers or clumps to
sand and clay, seaweed, stones or other
objects on which they chance to settle. The
eggs are 1.0 to 1.4 millimetres in diameter
and each female herring deposits from 20,000
to 100,000 eggs at one spawning. Fertilizing
takes place before the eggs reach the seabed.
On the Atlantic coast herring spawning takes
place during spring, summer and autumn,
depending on the locality and the herring
stock that occupies it.
The egg mortality is undoubtedly not as
heavy for Atlantic herring as it is for its
Pacific relative. These are the types of fisheries that I feel should have some conservation,
some period of protection. As these large
spawn herring are caught and reduced to fish
meal and oil before they have an opportunity
to spawn, or hatch their eggs, what chance of
survival has the sardine industry in the Bay
of Fundy area?
There always has been a tendency to
under-emphasize the importance of this industry to the area and its people, so I feel it is
important that some understanding be given
to those who are employed, and also to the
population of the whole area which is
dependent on the sardine industry. The fish

SENATE DEBATES
processing industry in general and the sardine industry specifically play a very important role in the economy of southern New
Brunswick. The east coast sardine fishery,
for the main part, is centered in the Bay of
Fundy and in and around the Passamaquoddy
area of Charlotte County and is the second
largest canned-fish industry in Canada. With
ten operating plants in Charlotte County,
annual production runs well over 1,250,000
cases per year, of 100 cans per case. As a
result of this production, the direct outlay for
fish and manufacturing wages would run to
over $8,500,000 per annum. Added to that,
would be the cost of cans, which are manufactured in the local area, plus a substantial
quantity of other New Brunswick products
used in the process. Additional investment of
many millions of dollars has been made in
weirs, seines, boats, canneries and other
equipment. At the height of the season,
employees in the canning industry alone
amount to over 2,500 people.
According ta statistics, there has been
fishing for sardines in the waters of the Bay
of Fundy for over 100 years. During this period, there have been years of plenty and years
of scarcity, but up until now, no one has yet
been able to make any prediction as to the
volume of catch available or the areas in
which they could be caught. This uncertainty
of the supply has always been of grave concern to the industry as well as to the fishermen of the area.
This current increase in the herring fishery
of the Bay of Fundy is naturally of great
interest to the industry. I view with grave
concern the increase in the use of herring for
direct reduction into fish meal and oil without
the thought of controls or restrictions. This
concern is related ta the question of what
effect this uncontrolled fishery will have on
the supply of sardine-size herring. This interest in herring for reduction is obviously
sparked first of all by heavy Government
subsidization of boats, plants and machinery,
with additional tax concessions, and also by
the present market situation for herring meal.
It should be pointed out that one ton of
herring or sardines bought for canning purposes will contribute approximately $100 to
the economy of the area in direct wages and
payments to fishermen. The same amount of
fish, if purchased for reduction into fish meal
and oil, would contribute $23 ta the economy.
One must remember that fish canning
remains a very high labour content industry,
whereas fish meal can be produced almost
entirely mechanically.

September 19, 1968

I mention these points, not to reflect
unfavourably towards those concerned with
the fish reduction industry, but only to point
out some significant points concerning the
canning industry.
The fish meal fishery in the area of southwest Nova Scotia is based on the inshore
migration of mature herring which results in
their spawning sometime during the months
of July, August, September and October. It is
reasonable to assume that the sardines that
maintain the sardine business originate from
the eggs left by these mature herring.
The fishing effort has steadily increased
during the past few years. The herring landings in the Bay of Fundy in 1963 totalled
161,000,000 pounds. Landings increased in
1964 by 15 per cent and again in 1965, when
the increase was a phenomenal 38 per cent. It
is of increasing concern to the people that
this steady increase cannot continue without
seriously affecting the herring population.
Age and length characteristics prepared by
the Department of Fisheries on the herring
caught for reduction in southwest Nova Scotia
during the past few years show a marked
trend toward young fish being caught. In
1962, the results showed that 31.4 per cent of
the fish caught were in the four-year-old class
or first-year spawners. Since that time the
quantity of four-year-old fish caught has
increased ta 37 per cent in 1963 and to 55.3
per cent in 1966. The percentage of herring
caught in the five- to eight-year class
decreased from 40.2 per cent in 1962 to 28.1
per cent in 1967; 1965 figures were net available when this report was written. These are
very alarming figures and would indicate the
age of the school is becoming younger, which
points possibly ta an over-fishing condition.
At the present time there is a great deal of
incentive for anyone with a limited amount of
capital ta establish direct reduction plants,
mainly at Government expense, with the
anticipation of quick and attractive monetary
profit. It is, therefore, the direct responsibility of the federal Government of Canada to
ensure that any such'endeavours do not have
a direct bearing on loss of supplies to industry already established and existing on its
own capital contributions from earned income
over the years.
The trend has been the same in other world
fish meal areas established in recent years.
Both Peru and South Africa have been forced
to take belated conservation measures and, in
each case, solely for the continued existence

September 19, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

of the fish meal industry itself rather than, as
could well happen here, to eliminate a threat
to long-established industry with a large
investment in physical and human assets. In
point of fact, on the Canadian Pacific coast,
the reduction industry has established safeguards to ensure the supply of herring.
I submit that the fishery of southwest Nova
Scotia and the Bay of Fundy requires a complete evaluation to make possible the maintenance of a maximum sustained catch from
the fisheries which will support the existing
sardine industry as well as the fish reduction
industry. Any conservation or management
measures will consist of restricting present
catches in some way in order to ensure better
catches in the future.
I submit that action by the federal Department of Fisheries is required immediately to
provide important research into the herring
populations and habits in order to give the
information needed to formulate recommended levels of fishing effort. Following this, we
require legislation and action to control
fishing and catches at the recommended
levels.
It is wise for us to remember that action
may have to be taken before absolute certainty of the state of the stocks is known; otherwise, events may have gone too far. There is
rarely any such thing as painless conservation
and almost always there is immediate sacrifice to be made to achieve the long-term gain.
If this immediate loss is small, then all parties
are less affected. Therefore, action should be
taken early.
I submit that the following general conservation methods should be considered:
1. Protection of herring for a short period
before they spawn.
2. Protection of spawning areas and spawning beds from the fishery, especially the
trawler fleet.
3. A limit on the quantity of mature herring taken from* the water to ensure ample
population.
4. A limit on the size of the fish taken for
reduction.
It has been said that herring is an excellent
fish that would have a great fuss made over it
if it were expensive. Demand, therefore, lies
in areas where there is a great demand for
protein. But production costs must be kept
extremely low to make up for the high cost of
transportation and lack of economic ability to
pay by the underdeveloped areas concerned
outside of Canada.
29234-6

I do not see where we can treat the Bay of
Fundy fisheries any different from any of the
experienced
that have
fisheries
other
overfishing without conservation. We can look
to the British Columbia coast at this time
where the Department of Fisheries has found
it necessary to curtail fishing for a period of
time. Of course, it is unfair for us to compare
the east coast and west coast fisheries. The
west coast fishery is very rich compared to
the east coast. They have the salmon which
comes in great abundance with a great monetary return to the fisherman. They have the
halibut, whereas the greatest abundance of
fisheries on the east coast have the herring.
The richest return to the fisherman on the
east coast would be the lobster, but that is no
comparison to the great salmon of the west
coast.
The sardine industry in the Bay of Fundy
suffers, not from a selling program but from
the production difficulty in obtaining sufficient suitable fish for packing. The encouragement, therefore, of any additional form of
industry, which will tend to decrease sources
of supply, can only lead to the eventual
decline of an industry which has built up its
reputation around the whole world over the
past 100 years.
I must again appeal to the Department of
Fisheries to establish immediate and extensive facilities for proper research into fishing
for herring to ensure proper conservation
by: (1) Protection of herring for a short period before they spawn; (2) protection of
spawning areas and spawning beds from the
fishery, especially the trawler fleet; (3) a limit
on the quantity of mature herring taken from
the water to ensure ample population; (4) a
limit on the size of the fish taken for reduction; and (5) a feasibility study by the Department of Fisheries of the Canadian Government of weir fishing, and the consideration of some form of assistance in the years of
failure-not a free grant but some form of a
loan to be paid back in years of good fishing.
To put it bluntly, in the Bay of Fundy a
short-term view for a "quick dollar" could
well prove disastrous, over the long haul, to
fishermen of this area and the land workers
dependent on their skills.

September 19, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

not only for attendance and speaking arrangements in the chamber, but also in committee.
Before him there was the Honourable W. H.
Taylor, who was here so long and knew Parliament so well. I want to pay a special tribute of affection and of respect to him.
Honourable senators, I think one cannot
really understand the climate and the purpose
of the Senate unless one understands the
work of its committees. I, and many honourable senators, have always said that there are
in this house not only good committees; there
are great committees. They are great, not
only because of the members we appoint to
them, but also because of their chairmen.
I wonder if there is a more competent
chairman, a man with a better background in
the fields of banking and commerce, than the
present chairman of the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce, the honourable
Senator Salter A. Hayden. He has been chairman of that committee for many years. Indeed, he had the confidence of our friends
opposite when they came to office, to the
extent that they nominated him, through the
late honourable Senator Brooks, to continue
in that capacity.
Another of our great committees is the
Standing Committee on Transport and Communications. All of us are indebted, first of
all, to Senator Hugessen for the many services he rendered that committee. He was one
of the great parliamentarians Canada developed in its first hundred years, and is now,
unhappily for us but happily for himself,
retired. He was succeeded by Senator Leonard, who is doing a more than competent job.
I have already referred to the work of the
Standing Committee on Finance, and to the
initiative taken by Senator Leonard and to
the work done by Senator Deschatelets.
I mention our great friend Senator Roebuck
and the indefatigable work that he has done,
particularly in the Standing Committee on Divorce. I suppose, in a sense, the work of that
committee is his monument here, and will be
for many years to come. However, one should
not forget that despite his preoccupation with
the problems of that committee, Senator Roebuck was assiduous at the meetings of many
other committees that he had an opportunity
to attend. He is one of the busiest men in the
Senate, and he also happens to be 90 years
young.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
2923A-61

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I go
back to the Standing Committee on Immigration and Labour, particularly when the late
Senator John Hnatyshyn was its chairman,
and I recall the work he did. On the infrequent occasions that bills were referred to his
committee, they were dealt with despatch. He
presided over the meetings of that committee
with great ability.
Senator Croll has been the chairman of a
number of special committees, sometimes
joint and sometimes of the Senate alone. In
every case, the committees that were set up
over which he presided-particularly the Special Committee of the Senate on Aging and
the Special Joint Committee on Consumer
Credit and Cost of Living-were, first of all,
initiatives that were taken by him in this
house and supported by its members.
Secondly, they were initiatives that were
listened to by the Government and resulted
in legislation.
The same can be said of the Special Committee of the Senate on Land Use, which he
did not originate, but which resulted, in the
days of the Diefenbaker Government, in the
beginning of the ARDA program.
Honourable senators, I was delighted yesterday to hear Senator Martin talk about the
prospects for stepping up the activities of the
Standing Committee on External Relations,
presided over so well and with such
enthusiasm by our learned friend from Winnipeg, Senator Thorvaldson.
Honourable senators, I do not think I am
opening the door to the Privy Council when I
tell you this. I have always been most grateful to Senator Thorvaldson for the initiatives
that he has taken in connection with that
committee, despite the difficulties of getting
quorums and lack of time for the work of this
committee. He was always elated when our
new Leader of the Government was able to
come, as the minister responsible, to speak to
the committee and to explain policy.
I want to tell honourable senators something-and I repeat, I do not think I am
opening the door of the Privy Council even a
crack. I could never tell Senator Thorvaldson
this. One of the problems I had with my
colleague, the then Secretary of State for External Affairs, was that of trying to persuade
him to allow Canadian ambassadors and
foreign representatives, when they returned
to Canada from a tour of duty, to come
before our External Relations Committee,
not to explain Canadian policy abroadthat is the prerogative of the Minister-

SENATE DEBATES
but to speak about conditions in these
foreign countries, and of Canadian approaches
to the problems of those peoples. I think it
would be of immense help if that kind of
thing could be done. I did not have very much
luck.
I think there is a great capacity for dealing
with foreign affairs in this house, and there is
a great body of information available to the
Senate from those honourable senators who
have participated in the work of international
organizations designed for parliamentarians.
So, I do hope, in telling you the story, I can
say to the new Leader of the Government in
the Senate that I hope he has more success
with the new Secretary of State for External
Affairs than his immediate predecessor as
Leader of the Government had with the former Secretary of State for External Affairs.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): As I
have said, I think there is a great capacity
here for performing a great deal of work, and
the new leader has indicated that he hopes
this will be done. However, I think there is
one thing we should realize. There are certain
limitations on the inquiry side of the work
that the Senate can do. After all, this is
primarily a legislative body, one which deals
with the law, with new legislation, sometimes
initiating it, sometimes reviewing it as it
comes to us from below. The more legislation
we can initiate the better off Parliament will
be, the better off the House of Commons will
be, the better off the country will be, because
the public business will be attended to more
expeditiously.
There are limitations set upon the amount
of work that can be done at one time. We must
remember that in this house, at most, we
have 102 members. In the other place they
have 265-at least two-and-a-half times the
number we have here. So, they can man more
committees.
Moreover, we are asked from time to time
to join with the House of Commons in providing members for joint committees of the
two houses. This is time consuming. For
instance, in the case of the special joint committee which dealt with the Canada Pension
Plan, the committee sat for a whole month
when Parliament was in recess, fortunately. I
say that, because it could not have sat while
Parliament was sitting, for there was so much
to be done with regard to that bill.
I think of the House of Lords, and I had
the privilege just a week ago of talking to
Lord Shackleton, its relatively new leader.

September 19, 1968

From what I hear and read in the press,
changes are being introduced in the procedures of that House, and they have a great
interest in the kind of work that we do. But I
could not help but say to him: "What a fortunate position the House of Lords is in,
because you can call upon up to 1,100 people
to work for you, if they apply for the writ of
summons. You have an average of about 500
attending a session of Parliament. You have
an average of from 200 to 300 attending every
sitting of the house. The most we have is
102."
This lack of manpower within the Senate
creates a problem for the leader. It creates a
problem for the chairmen of the committees.
It creates a problem because of the amount of
work which can be done. I do not think we
should be overreaching ourselves. I think we
should be realistic as we approach this business of more work for the Senate. I am all for
that. We have done a great deal more work
here in the last ten years than was ever done
by the Senate before. The press does not talk
about it. It does not appear in the public
print because we do not make the declamatory kind of speech here. The party line does
not run down the middle of this chamber as
clearly marked as it does in the other place.
We are not as excitable, and we are not as
excited.
I have made acknowledgments to certain
people who were of great assistance to me in
the course of the years of my leadership, and
I would be most remiss indeed if I did not
mention four others. First of all, there was
Senator Brooks, the Leader of the Opposition
during most of my time as Leader of the
Government, and a finer gentleman and a
more co-operative colleague one could not
expect to have.
Senator Flynn, whom I have known for so
long, and Senator Choquette, his deputy, who
was a classmate of mine, I thank from the
bottom of my heart for the kind co-operation
they gave me.
I include in these thanks the silver-tongued
senator from Sydney, the whip on the other
side, Senator John M. Macdonald.
I should like to tell a story about Senator
Macdonald (Cape Breton). It being a Thursday afternoon, one is allowed to do this. I
forget in which year this was-it was at the
time of either the 1962 or 1963 election
-Senator
Macdonald had heard that I had
seen the Holy Father, and he said to me: "I
understand he gave you a rosary; in fact, he
gave you many. Would you give me one?" I

September 19, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

replied: "John, nothing would give me more
pleasure than to do this." It so happened that
I sent him the rosary on the day after the
election was called. I had previously exacted
a promise from him that he would say the
first of these rosaries for me and for my
intention. I was quite dismayed about a week
later when he wrote me-in the meantime,
the election had been called for April 8-saying: "I am saving the rosary to say my first
prayers on it on April 9."
Honourable senators, to all my colleagues,
regardless of party, I say that I shall treasure
the memory of the years of my leadership
here as long as I live. I know they were not
without their problems, and at times not
without their crises, and at times, indeed, not
without their criticisms of my own performance. But, what I can never forget is the
kindness, the generosity, the companionship,
and the co-operation that I have had from
honourable senators on both sides of this
house. I can say with complete frankness, and
with no simulated humility, that I did not
deserve the honour that came to me at the
hands of a great Canadian, the Right Honourable Lester B. Pearson, when he appointed
me to the leadership of this bouse. I feel-and
I say this without reservation-that of all the
parliamentary posts after the prime ministership itself that of leader of this august house
is the highest a Canadian can hold.
Honourable senators, since I am making a
speech in the debate on the motion for an
Address in Reply to the Speech from the
Throne I had better mention the Speech-and
I am aware that Senator O'Leary (Carleton)
has already spoken! However, the Speech
from the Throne allows no limitation on
debate. Traditionally, it is wide-ranging. I am
not really too much upset by what Senator
O'Leary (Carleton) said yesterday in his
strictures of the Government, and about the
fact that the Speech did not contain concrete
proposals.
I have before me here a copy of the Montreal Star of Friday, September 13, 1968-a
lucky kind of day, if I may say so-which
contains a copy of the Speech itself, and next
to it a column headed: "47 bills ready for
Parliament". We expect Her Majesty and Her
Majesty's representative to do a great many
things, and I am sure some of them at times
are irksome. But to have put these 47 items
into the Speech would have made it very
tedious. I would not bore the Senate by reading this list. It is simply a list of legislation to
come-legislation that is ready.

Frankly, I am quite satisfied and content
that the Speech from the Throne should give
the general lines of policy and what the Government proposes to do. I do not think there
is any need to spell out the details of the
legislation. They will unfold themselves at the
appropriate times. As long as the Speech contains a statement of principles and policies
-and, believe me, the debate will not be very
specific in either this house or the other
place-then it is certainly better than the
Speeches drafted under the old practice of
having them contain a list of bills.
If the Government is aware of national
problems, and if it discusses them in a general way in the Speech from the Throne, then I
think that that, generally speaking, is what a
government is required to do. Ultimately the
government will never be judged by the people on what is in the Speech from the
Throne, whether it be read at the opening or
closing of a session or a Parliament. It will be
judged on its performances in respect of the
policies it pursues. It will be judged on the
results of the legislative programs that it
enacts, and upon its administrative action.
I rather think that this Government now
has a mandate to go ahead in a bold,
imaginative and progressive way to keep this
country on an even keel; to make it expand
and develop as perhaps no other country in
the world has a capability of doing.
I was most impressed by what the honourable mover of this motion, Senator Phillips
(Rigaud), had to say in his mighty, maiden
effort. It may have been his maiden speech in
this chamber, but it was born of a wide
experience and the background of a great
career in the law and in business in the Province of Quebec.
I was delighted too-as I am to see him
this afternoon-with what my old friend, and
a very experienced parliamentarian, Senator
Raymond Eudes, had to say in seconding the
motion.
Honourable senators, I congratulate the
Government upon its achievement at the polls
in June. Naturally, as a member of the party
which succeeded, I am pleased at its success.
But for all Canada, and indeed abroad, the
great achievement of the electoral process of
1968 is the existence in this country, for the
first time since 1962, of a majority in the
House of Commons for the government in
office. I think there is, a result of that, a
sense of stability, a sense of security, now
flowing through the national life. It has
replaced a sense of insecurity which prevailed

SENATE DEBATES
in the years when minority government was
in office. I say this is good for Canada at
home; it is good indeed for Canada abroad.
Honourable senators, I would make the statements I have just made whether the Progressive Conservatives won the election or not.
Stable government, majority government, is
the best way for Parliament to function.
I am sure honourable senators will not
accuse me of hypocrisy if I say one other
thing about the election, and I say it sincerely. I deeply regret the failure of many fine
parliamentarians, members of the Opposition
party, at the polls in June. Political success
and political life is always a tenuous thing.
There is a built-in hazard in the democratic
process. Our system of parliamentary government runs idcally when there are two main
parties in the House of Commons. That
house is a better place if there is a real,
experienced debating strength on both the
Government benches and the Opposition
benches. Moreover, a strong Opposition creates
a real alternative to a government, and one
never knows when that alternative will have
to be resorted to in days of the type in which
we live.
Far be it from me to mount the hustings on
behalf of a party to which I have never given
allegiance. I am enough of an historian to say
that the Conservative party is an historic
party in this country; it is of the political
fabric of this land; it has a fine record of
achievement and of service to Canada under
its various leaders in the various times in
which it held office. It has indeed lost some of
the people it needs very greatly, that Parliament needs very greatly, that the nation
needs very greatly. I know it must and will
re-group. Honourable senators, I hope for our
country's sake that it will re-group.
I know whereof I speak, because in 1958
the fortunes of the Liberal party were at perhaps their lowest ebb in history. I should like
this afternoon to pay a tribute to the courage
of the new leader of the Liberal party at that
time, the Right Honourable Lester B. Pearson. He faced a situation that no politician
would ever relish facing. He was not only a
new leader but he had a new party to rebuild. He had a duty to the party and a duty
to Parliament to do this. He had a duty to his
country to do it and he did it. His success was
remarkable, even though in the years during
which he held office he never once had a
majority in the House of Commons.

September 19, 1968

Perhaps I can claim to have had some
small part to play in that process, and I
should like to couple with that the name of
another of our colleagues who helped mightily in the process. I hesitate to single anyone
out, but Senater Davey worked with me at
the National Liberal Federation in those days
and made a contribution to Canadian public
life that was very great indeed.
That work involved personal sacrifice but it
had its rewards. I speak not of the rewards of
office. They came. As I used to say to my
friend Senator Norman Lambert, when he
was alive, to me the reward was satisfaction
in helping to restore the position of a party
which had done great things for this country,
a party in the principles and policies of which
I believed.
Honourable senators, I conclude by speaking to our new leader. I wish him success and
satisfaction in his new responsibilities. But
my best wish for him is that he shall have the
co-operation, kindness and assistance from
his colleagues that I was so fortunate to have
in the five years of my leadership.
On motion of Honourable Mr. O'Leary
(Antigonish-Guysborough), debate adjourned.

SENATE DEBATES

September 19, 1968

APPENDIX

(See p. 65.)
THE STUDENT AS NIGGER
Students are niggers. When you get that
straight, our schools begin to make sense. It's
more important, though, to understand why
they're niggers. If we follow that question
seriously, it will lead us past the zone of
academic bullshit, where dedicated teachers
pass their knowledge on to a new generation,
and into the nitty-gritty of human needs and
hangups. From there we can go on to consider
whether it might ever be possible for students
to come up from slavery.
First, look at the role students play in what
we like to call education. At Cal State where
I teach, the students have separate and unequal dining facilities. If I bring a student into
the faculty dining room, my colleagues get
uncomfortable, as though there were a bad
smell. If I eat in the student cafeteria, I
become known as the educational equivalent
of a "nigger-lover". In at least one building
there are even rest rooms which students may
not use. Also there is an unwritten law barring student-faculty lovemaking. Fortunately,
this anti-miscegenation law, like its Southern
counterpart, is not 100 per cent effective.
CHOOSE HOMECOMING QUEEN
Students at Cal State are politically disenfranchised. They are in an academic Lowndes
County. Most of them can vote in national
elections-their average age is about 26-but
they have no voice in the decisions which
affect their academic lives. The students are,
it is true, allowed to have a toy government
of their own. It is a government run, for the
most part, by Uncle Toms, concerned principally with trivia. The faculty and administrators decide what courses will be offered; the
students get to choose their own Homecoming
Queen. Occasionally, when student leaders
get uppity and rebellious, they're either
ignored, put off with trivial concessions, or
maneuvered expertly out of position.
A student at Cal State is expected to know
his place. He calls a faculty member "Sir" or
"Doctor" or "Professor" and he smiles and
shuffles some as he stands outside the professor's office waiting for permission to enter.
The faculty tell him what courses to take (in
my department, English, even electives have
to be approved by a faculty member); they
tell him what to read, what to write, and,
frequently, where to set the margins on his

typewriter. They tell him what's true and
what isn't. Some teachers insist that they
encourage dissent but they're almost always
lieing and every student knows it. Tell The
Man what he wants to hear or he'll fail you.
When a teacher says "jump" students jump.
I know of one professor who refused to take
up class time for exams and required students to show up for tests at 6:30 in the
morning. And they did, by God! Another, at
exam time, provides answer cards to be filled
out-each one enclosed in a paper bag with a
hole cut in the top to see through. Students
stick their writing hands in the bags while
taking the test. The teacher isn't a provo; I
wish he were. He does it to prevent cheating.
Another colleague once caught a student
reading during one of his lectures and threw
her book against the wall. Still another lectures his students into a stupor and then
screams at them in rage when they fall
asleep.
CLASS IS NOT DISMISSED!
During the first meeting of a class, one girl
got up to leave after about ten minutes had
gone by. The teacher rushed over, grabbed
her by the arm, saying vThis class is not
dismissed!" and led her back to her seat. On
the same day another teacher began by
informing his class that he does not like
beards, mustaches, long hair on boys, or capri
pants on girls, and will not tolerate any of
that in his class. The class, incidentally, consisted mostly of high-school teachers.
Even more discouraging than this Auschwitz approach to education is the fact that the
students take it. They haven't gone through
twelve years of public school for nothing.
They've learned one thing and perhaps only
one thing during those twelve years. They've
forgotten their algebra. They're hopelessly
vague about chemistry and physics. They've
grown to fear and resent literature. They
write like they've been lobotomized. But,
Jesus, can they follow orders! Freshmen come
up to me with an essay and ask if I want it
folded and whether their name should be in
the upper right hand corner. And I want to
cry and kiss them and caress their poor, tortured heads.
Students don't ask that orders make sense.
They give up expecting things to make sense

September 19, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

long before they leave elementary school.
Things are true because the teacher says
they're true. At a very early age we all learn
to accept "two truths," as did certain medieval churchmen. Outside of class, things are
true to your tongue, your finger, your stomach, your heart. Inside class, things are true
by reason of authority. And that's just fine
because you don't care anyway. Miss
Wiedemeyer tells you a noun is a person,
place or thing. So let it be. You don't give a
rat's ass; she doesn't give a rat's ass.
SIRENS AND A RATTLE OF BULLETS

The important thing is to please lier. Back
in kindergarten, you found out that teachers
only love children who stand in nice straight
lines. And that's where it's been at ever since.
Nothing changes except to get worse. School
becomes more and more obviously a prison.
Last year I spoke to a student assembly at
Manual Arts High School and then couldn't
get out of the goddam school. I mean there
was no way out. Locked doors. High fences.
One of the inmates was trying to make it
over a fence when he saw me coming and
froze in panic. For a moment, I expected
sirens, a rattle of bullets, and him clawing the
fence.
Then there's the infamous "code of dress".
In some high schools, if your skirt looks too
short, you have to kneel before the principal,
in a brief allegory of fellatio. If the hem
doesn't reach the floor, you go home to change
while he, presumably, jacks off. Boys in high
school can't be too sloppy and they can't be
too sharp. You'd think the school board would
be delighted to see all the spades trooping to
school in pointy shoes, suits, ties and stingy
brims. Uh-uh. They're too visible.
What school amounts to, then, for white
and black kids alike, is a 12 year course in
how to be slaves. What else could explain
what I see in a freshman class? They've got
that slave mentality: obliging and ingratiating
on the surface but hostile and resistent
underneath. Like black slaves, students vary
in their awareness of what's going on. Some
recognize their own put-on for what it is and
even let their rebellion break through to the
surface now and then. Others-including most
of the "good students" have been more deeply
brainwashed. They swallow the bullshit with
greedy mouths. They honest-to-God believe in
grades, in busy work, in general education
requirements. They're like those old greyheaded houseniggers you can still find in the
South who don't see what all the fuss is about
because Mr. Charlie "treats us real good".

THEY CHEAT A LOT

College entrance requirements tend to
favor the Toms and screen out the rebels. Not
entirely, of course. Some students at Cal State
are expert con artists who know perfectly
well what's happening. They want a degree
and spend their years on the old plantation
alternately laughing and cursing as they play
the game. If their egos are strong enough,
they cheat a lot. And of course, even the Toms
are angry down deep somewhere. But it
comes out in passive rather than active
aggression. They're unexplainably thick-witted and subject to frequent spells of laziness.
They misread simple questions. They spend
their nights mechanically outlining history
chapters while meticulously failing to comprehend a word of what's in front of them.
The saddest cases among both black slaves
and student slaves are the ones who have so
thoroughly introjected their masters' values
that their anger is all turned inward. At Cal
State these are the kids for whom every low
grade is torture, who stammer and shake
when they speak to a professor. They go
through an emotional crisis every time
they're called upon during class. You can
recognize them easily at finals time. Their
faces are festooned with fresh pimples; their
bowels boil audibly across the room. If there
really is a Last Judgment, then the parents
and teachers who created these wrecks are
going to burn in hell.
So students are niggers. It's time to find out
why, and to do this, we have to take a long
look at Mr. Charlie.
The teachers I know best are college
professors. Outside the classroom and taken
as a group, their most striking characteristic
is timidity. They're short on balls. Just look
at their working conditions. At a time when
even migrant workers have begun to fight
and win, college professors are still afraid to
make more than a token effort to improve
their pitiful economic status. In California
state colleges the faculties are screwed
regularly and vigorously by the governor and
legislature and yet they still won't offer any
solid resistance. They lie flat on their stomachs with their pants down, mumbling
catchphrases like "professional dignity" and
"meaningful dialogue".
THEY COPPED OUT

Professors were no different when I was an
undergraduate at UCLA during the McCarthy
era; it was like a cattle stampede as they

SENATE DEBATES

rushed to cop out. And in more recent years I
found that my being arrested in sit-ins
brought from my colleagues not so much
approval or condemnation as open-mouthed
astonishment: "You could lose your job!"
Now of course, there's the Vietnamese war.
It gets some opposition from a few teachers.
Some support it. But a vast number of professors who know perfectly well what's happening, are copping out again. And in the high
schools you can forget it. Stillness reigns.
I'm not sure why teachers are so chickenshit. It could be that academie training itself
forces a split between thought and action. It
might also be that the tenured security of a
teaching job attracts timid persons who are
unsure of themselves and need weapons and
other external trappings of authority.
At any rate, teachers are short on balls.
And, as Judy Epstein has eloquently pointed
out, the classroom offers an artifici'al and
protected environment in which they can
exercise their will to power.
Your neighbors may drive a better car; gas
station attendants may intimidate you, your
wife may dominate you; the state legislature
may shit on you; but in the classroom, by
God, students do what you say-or-else. The
grade is a hell of a weapon. It may not rest
on your hip, potent and rigid like a cop's gun,
but in the long run it's more powerful. At
your personal whim-anytime you chooseyou can keep 35 students up for nights
and have the "pleasure" of seeing them walk
into the classroom pasty-faced and red-eyed
carrying a sheaf of typewritten pages, with a
title page, MLA footnotes and margins set at
15 and 91.
RESPECT FOR AUTHORITY

The general timidity which causes teachers
to make niggers of their students usually
includes a more specific fear-fear of the
students themselves. After all, students are
different, just like black people. You stand
exposed in front of them, knowing that their
interests, their values and their language are
different from yours. To make matters worse
you may suspect that you yourself are not the
most engaging person. What then can protect
you from their ridicule and scorn? Respect
for authority. That's what-it's the policeman's gun again. The white bwana's pith helmet. So you flaunt that authority. You wither
whisperers with a murderous glance. You
crush objectors with erudition and heavy irony. And, worst of all, you make your own

September 19, 1968

attainments seem not accessible but awesomely remote. You conceal your massive ignorance-and parade a slender learning.
Finally, there's the darkest reason of all for
the master-slave approach to education. The
less trained and the less socialized a person
is, the more he constitutes a sexual threat
and the more he will be subjugated by institutions, such as penitentiaries and schools.
Many of us are aware by now of the sexual
neurosis which makes white man so fearful of
integrated schools and neighborhoods, and
which makes castration of Negroes a deeply
entrenched Southern folkway. We should
recognize a similar pattern in education.
There is a kind of castration that goes on in
schools. It begins, before school years, with
parents' first encroachments on their children's free unashamed sexuality and continues right up to the day when they hand you
your doctoral diploma with a bleeding, shriveled pair of testicles stapled to the parchment. It's not that sexuality has no place in
the classroom. You'll find it there but only in
certain perverted, and vitiated forms.
PERVERSION IS INTELLECTUAL

How does sex show up in school? First of
all, there's the sadomasochistic relationship
between teachers and students. That's plenty
sexual although the price of enjoying it is to
be unaware of what's happening. In walks
the student in his Ivy League equivalent of a
motorcycle jacket. In walks the teacher-a
kind of intellectual rough trade-and flogs his
students with grades, tests, sarcasm and snotty superiority until their very brains are
bleeding. In Swinburne's England,
the
whipped school boy frequently grew up to be
a flagellant. With us their perversion is intellectual but it's no less perverse.
Sex also shows up in the classroom as academic subject matter-sanitized and abstracted, thoroughly divorced from feeling. You get
"sex education" now in both high school and
college classes: every one determined not be
embarrassed to be very up-to-date. These are
the classes for which sex, as Feiffer puts it
"can be a beautiful thing if properly administered". And then of course, there's still another depressing manifestation of sex in the
classroom: the "off-color" teacher, who keeps
his class awake with sniggering sexual allusions, obscene titters and academic innuendo.
The sexuality he purveys, it must be admitted, is at least better than none at all.

September 19, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

UNDERNEATH THE PETTI-PANTS

What's missing from kindergarten to graduate school is honest recognition of what's happening turned-on awareness of what's underneath the pettipants, the chinos and the
flannels. It's not that sex needs to be pushed
in school; sex is pushed enough. But we
should let it be, where it is and like it is. I
don't insist that ladies in junior high school
lovingly caress their students' cocks (someday,
maybe); however, it is reasonable to ask that
the ladies don't by example and structures
teach their students to pretend that they
aren't there. As things stand now, students are
psychically castrated or spayed-and for the
very same reason that black men are castrated in Georgia: because they're a threat.
So you can add sexual repression to the list
of causes, along with vanity, fear and will to
power, that turn the teacher into Mr. Charlie.
You might also want to keep in mind that he
was a nigger once himself and has never really
gotten over it. And there are more causes,
some of which are better described in sociological than in psychological terms. Work
them out, it's not hard. But in the mean time
what we've got on our hands is a whole lot of
niggers. And what makes this particularly
grim is that the student has less chance than
the black man of getting out of his bag. Because the student doesn't even know he's in
it. That, more or less, is what's happening in
higher education. And the results are
staggering.
For one thing damn little education takes
place in the schools. How could it? You can't
educate slaves; you can only train them. Or,
to use an uglier and more timely word, you
can only program them.
HANDS IN SOME CLAY

class trying to get out of the academic rut. He
took crafts for the same reason. Great right?
Get your hands in some clay? Make something? Then the teacher announced that a 20
page term paper would be required with
footnotes.
At my school we even grade people on how
they read poetry. That's like grading people on
how they fuck. But we do it. In fact. God
help me, I do it. I'm the Simon Legree of the
poetry plantation. "Tite that iamb! Lift that
spondee!" Even to discuss a good poem in that
environment is potentially dangerous because
the very classroom is contaminated. As hard
as I may try to turn students on to poetry, I
know that the desks, the tests, the IBM cards,
their own attitudes toward school and my
own residue of UCLA method are turning
them off.
MAKE THEM WILLING SLAVES

Another result of student slavery is just as
dangerous-students don't get emancipated
when they graduate. As a matter of fact, we
don't let them graduate until they've demonstrated their willingness-for 16 years-to
remain slaves. And for important jobs, like
teaching, we make them go through more
years just to make sure.
What I'm getting at is that we're all more
or less niggers and slaves, teachers and students alike. This is the fact you have to start
with in trying to understand wider social
phenomena, say, politics, in our country and
in other countries.
Educational oppression is trickier to fight
than racial expression. If you're a black rebel
they can't exile you; they either have to
intimidate you or kill you. But in high school
or college, they can just bounce you out of
the fold. And they do.
Rebel students and renegade faculty members get smothered or shot down with devastating accuracy. In high school, it's not usually the student who gets it; it's more often
the teacher. Others get tired of fighting and
voluntarily leave the system. But dropping
out of college for a rebel, is a little like going
North, for a Negro. You can't really get away
from it so you might as well stay and raise
hell.

I like to folk dance. Like other novices, I've
gone to the Intersection or to the Museum
and laid out good money in order to learn
how to dance. No grades, no prerequisites, no
separate dining rooms, they just turn you on
to dancing. That's education. Now look at
what happens in college. A friend of mine,
Milt, recently finished a folk dance class. For
his final he had to learn things like this: "The
Irish are known for their wit and imagination, qualities reflected in their dances, which
include the jig, the reel and the hornpipe".
And then the teacher graded him A, B, C, D,
or F, while he danced in front of her. That's
ORGANIZE FOR FREEDOM NOW
not education. That's not even training. That's
How do you raise hell? That's another artian abomination on the face of the earth. It's
especially ironic because Milt took that dance cle. But for a start, why not stay with the

84

SENATE DEBATES

analogy? What have black people done? They
have, first of all, faced the fact of their slavery. They've stopped kidding themselves
about an eventual reward in the Great Watermelon Patch in the sky. They've organized.
They've decided to get freedom now, and
they've started taking it.
Students like black people, have immense
unused power. They could theoretically, insist
on participating in their own education. They
could make academic freedom bilateral. They
could teach their teachers to thrive on love
and admiration rather than on fear and
respect, and to lay down their weapons. Students could discover community. And they
could learn to dance by dancing on the IBM
cards. They could make coloring books out of

September 19, 1968

the catalogs and they could put the grading
system in a museum.
They could raze one set of walls and let life
come blowing into the classroom. They could
turn the classroom into a "field of action" as
Peter Marin describes it. And they could
study for the best of all possible reasons
-their own resources.
They could. They have the power. But only
in a very few places, like Berkeley, have they
even begun to think about using it. For students as for black people, the hardest battle
isn't with Mr. Charlie. It's with what Mr.
Charlie has done to your mind.

5. In what ways, if any, will the Tariff
Concessions agreed upon by Canada at
the Kennedy Round Negotiations under
GATT affect all or any of these duties,
tariffs, surcharges and other taxes?
Hon. Paul Martin: The answer to the
honourable senator's inquiry is as follows:
1. In order to avoid any misunderstanding as to the rates of duty currently
payable on imported goods, due consideration must be given to Order in Council
P.C. 1968-816, dated April 25, 1968. The
effect of this Order is to remit duty to the
extent by which it would have been
reduced had the resolutions affecting the
Customs Tariff introduced in the House
of Commons on June 1, 1967, and Novem-

ber 6, 1967, been enacted. The sales tax
payable on the duty being remitted is
also remitted.
Therefore, a transistor radio valued at
$20.00 U.S. funds, imported into Canada
under the conditions mentioned, would

Government for answering my inquiry. The Publication of Statutes Act, the statutes must

SENATE DEBATES

be published in separate volumes, in French
and in English. In the measure before honourable senators, the intention is to enable the
Government to provide that the statutes be
published in some other form.
It is necessary to introduce this bill because
the Revised Statutes of Canada, which will be
published in the course of the coming year,
will be printed in the form recommended by
the Commission for Revision of Statutes. As
mentioned by Senator Connolly (Ottawa
West) when he introduced the previous bill, it
was the intention to provide that the Revised
Statutes be in both languages on the same
page and in the same volume. As the Revised
Statutes will be done in this form, the Government feels it would be desirable to publish
the annual statutes in the same form.
Section 133 of the British North America
Act provides that the laws of Canada shall be
published in both languages; but it does not
provide that they shall be published together,
side by side. As a matter of law, they have
been published in separate volumes. The
intention to publish the two texts in the same
volume-as is proposed in this measurewould ensure that the laws of Canada are
published in their entirety within the same
set.
It will be recalled that the Minister of Justice of that time outlined to the committee the
reasons that the Government had in mind
under this bill. It has been the interpretation
of the courts that both languages have equal
authority and that, in the case of some doubt
arising as to the interpretation of a statute,
that language will prevail which appears to
the court to be the closer to the intention of
Parliament. This being the case, for strictly
legal and constitutional reasons alone, to say
nothing of political and symbolic reasons, it
has been decided by the Government that in
its judgment it would be prudent to make
sure that every edition of the statutes be
printed in both languages, in such a way that
any lawyer, judge or other person who uses
the statutes would have at his hand the complete statutes and not have them only in one
language.
Finally, honourable senators, though there
are good reasons apart altogether from the
practical value of this arrangement, the Government feels strongly that the symbolism
attached to this arrangement is very desirable
in Canada at the present time.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, may I ask a question at this point?

September 24, 1968

When this matter came before us several
days ago I raised a question as to the size of
the book in which the dual languages will
appear, pointing out that if the books are too
wide they will be very inconvenient on the
shelves of the libraries of most of our law
firms-and in the courts, as someone has suggested to me.
There are advantages, of course, in having
the text in both languages before everyone
who reads the statutes. On the other hand,
there are advantages in the old system,
because those who know English will read
only the English, whether or not the French
is before them; and those who know only
French will read the French. One book in
either French or English may be sufficient.
However, the new books will be less convenient for some practitioners but more convenient for others.
The point I raised as to the size of the
new book in relation to its placement on
the shelves of the libraries is very important.
Shelving is usually much too short in every
firm or office that I know of. It is certainly
short in my own office, and I would regret if
the size of the new books were not consistent
with the dimensions of the old books so that
they may occupy the same shelf space.
Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable
senators, I am wholly in favour of the bill, at
least in so far as its principle is concerned,
because I think that having decided to print
the revised statutes in a particular way it is
only logical that the same form should apply
to the annual statutes. As to what that form
is, it should be left to the Governor in Council to decide.
I do have a word to say concerning two
clauses, however. You will notice that the
new subsection 3 provides:
"(3) Copies of the volume or volumes
referred to in subsection (2) shall be
printed by the Queen's Printer, who
shall, as soon after the close of each session as practicable, deliver or send by
post or otherwise, in the most economical
manner, the proper number of copies to"
In my opinion the last part, referring to the
Queen's Printer's sending it in the most
economical manner, should be deleted. The
most economical manner might be a very
slow manner. It might be a case of waiting
until somebody is going to some far distant
region and then asking that person to deliver
it. I do think the officials of the department
should take a look at that section to see if it
could be a little more appropriately drafted.

the bilingual character or the readability of
bills and statutes. Obviously it is desirable
that the bills in the annual statutes be printed
in conformity with the revised statutes. This
explains in some measure the format of the
bills now being introduced in the Senate and
how they are prepared. As honourable senators will have observed, the pages as they
now appear are somewhat larger than they
previously were, but I would add that when
they appear in final form a little space will be
saved by the trimming and binding. I understand that some attempt will be made to
reduce the width of the layout of the statutes
in bilingual form, as I mentioned in reply to
Senator Roebuck last week.
I hope these answers, if not entirely satisfactory to honourable Senator Roebuck, will
indicate to him and to all honourable senators
that we are addressing ourselves to this
question.
Hon. Mr. White: May I ask the honourable
leader whether he could give any indication
of what the cost of the new statutes will be?
By that I mean the cost to the individual
buying them.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I understand there will
be a difference of $1.25 per copy, or approximately 15 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Choqueile: May I ask the honourable leader a question? One statement he
made rather disturbed me.
I understood him to say that if there is a
conflict in interpretation when a statute is
used in court, that the presiding judge will
try to seek and find out the true intention of
the legislature. It had always been my
understanding that if there was such a conflict in interpretation, then because the statutes
were first drafted in the English language,
naturally and necessarily the court would
have to revert and interpret the English-language version. I mention this because a translator is not necessarily a connoisseur of statutory language and it could happen, as I
understand is happening at the present time
only in the Province of Quebec, that you have
Quebec lawyers using to their advantage the
French version, which might not be a correct
translation of the English version. Therefore,
I should like to ask if the authority for what
has been advanced by the Leader of the Government is correct when a judge is faced with
a dilemma of that sort.

September 24, 1968

determine what was the intention of Parliament, and if there is any doubt about one
version as opposed to the other, both versions
are analysed by the court, and it reaches a
determination of the text which it believes
represents most accurately the intention of
Parliament.
This was carefully gone into in committee
last year and there is a reference or dissertation of almost two pages on this subject by
the Minister of Justice. I gather from the
comments made by members of the committee, particularly by lawyers, that there was
no disagreement with this statement of the
rule of interpretation.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Is there not a rule in the
Interpretation Act? I know there is one in
Quebec along the lines the honourable leader
has indicated.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I understand there is. My
impression in that respect is strengthened by
honourable Senator Hayden, who says that
that is the case. He is more familiar with this
than I am.

The Senate resumed from Thursday, September 19, consideration of His Excellency
the Governor General's speech at the opening
of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr.
Phillips (Rigaud), seconded by Hon. Mr.
Eudes, for an address in reply thereto.

Hon. Clement A. O'Leary: Honourable
senators, I want to begin by congratulating
His Honour the Speaker on his appointment,
which I heartily endorse.
I join with my Leader (Hon. Mr. Flynn)
and previous speakers in this debate in welcoming the Honourable Paul Martin to this
chamber, and in his capacity as Leader of the
Government. I wish him the same degree of
success here that has so characterized his long
parliamentary career to date. After the richly
deserved tribute that he paid his predecessor,
Senator John Connolly, I know he will

September 24, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Connolly has stepped down. That he is still
with us in good health, with the same
warmth, charm and wise counsel, is, of
course, compensation in part.
The mover and seconder of the motion for
an Address in reply amply deserve the public
congratulations they have received for their
maiden efforts in this chamber, and I add
mine. Senator Eudes is, of course, a parliamentary veteran. This was very obvious in
his presentation.
My venerable namesake on my left (Hon.
Mr. O'Leary, (Carleton), did such a masterful
job of warmly commending Senator Phillips
(Rigaud) that for fear of distortion I will not
attempt to paraphrase his praise, to signify
my hearty approval. Instead, I simply say,
"Amen."
Most honourable senators who have spoken
thus far in this debate have indicated a wish
that this Upper House might occupy a more
prominent and meaningful role as a parliamentary entity. I am sure that most of us
have read everything of substance that bas
been written on the Senate. On Wednesday
last our Government Leader (Hon. Mr. Martin) quoted at some length from two of the
better recognized authorities, who are not
members of this body, indicating that some of
our critics apparently have not done their
research too well, but, notwithstanding,
improvement is not only possible but very
desirable.
I recognize that of ourselves we can effect
some modifications and procedural changes,
and we can even add to our workload, but to
achieve improvement we must first be invested with the authority to attain those goals
which our better critics advocate, and we
would welcome the opportunity of undertaking that which they advocate. I would hope
that our Government leader and perhaps
some other honourable senators may already
have had a preview of the possibilities for
this authority.
Although not quite akin-at least, it does
embrace the possible workload of the
Senate-I want to congratulate Senator Croll
on the two motions that stand in his name on
the Order Paper. As to his first resolution,
I note that some members of the other place
are advocating a similar type of committee.
When we hear from Senator Croll in support
of this resolution, I know that he will make
his position clear so far as the Senate is
concerned.

His second resolution, for the setting up a
special Senate committee "to investigate and
report upon all aspects of poverty in Canada," as has already been noted by the Government Leader, follows quickly upon the
recommendation in the Fifth Annual Review
of the Economic Council of Canada. Such
action on Senator Croll's part is typical and
commendable. I hope I will have an opportunity to say something further on this
motion when he moves it.
Whether or not I should admit it, I did not
volunteer to speak in this debate. I was drafted-perhaps I should say "conned" into
it-by our affable and disarming Whip. So, I
make no apology if I do not confine myself to
remarks on the Throne Speech itself.
By way of direct reference I will only say
that I, along with a host of other Canadians,
deeply regret that the customary courtesy
was not extended our Queen. I do not attribute motives for the omission, neither do I
care to accept the Prime Minister's explanation for it.
When I came to this chamber from the
other place six years ago, I found it difficult
to disassociate myself from regional and, yes,
even parochial issues. I still do, but of course
I do not apologize for that either. I am not
going into a tirade over the dropping of the
federal winter works program. That subject
was referred to by my seatmate, Senator
Welch, and, as members of our Finance Committee will recall, it was quite thoroughly
discussed at some of the meetings of that
committee. I believe that most senators from
my home province will agree with me that
the contribution of this program to Nova
Scotia was not too significant, although at the
same time we must recognize that in our
Maritime economy any measure that helped
alleviate unemployment did serve a very useful purpose, whether or not our provinces or
municipalities took advantage of it to the
degree that, for example, the Province of
Quebec did.
Education, training and re-training in the
fields where there is a genuine demand
appear to be the long-term answer for providing at least something close to full employment. Danger points are reached, however,
and if this should be the present circumstance, as now appears, perhaps certain types
of crash program should not be looked upon
as too old-fashioned
by our modern
concerned.

SENATE DEBATES
Last week I listened to a local radio news
report which told of the alarm expressed by
the City of Ottawa's Welfare Council over the
fact that they were experiencing a huge deficit in their welfare program. One of the several reasons listed was a statistic to the effect
that in the past two years the city's unemployment figures had risen by 56 per cent.
Consider, too, the 30,000-plus Canadian university students who were unable to find
employment this last summer. And so one
could go on, with a lengthy list of deprivations which resulted. But, enough of statistics.
We know the problem with us is urgent, and
I do believe that the provision of some shortterm solution is as necessary as the long-term
one being promoted by the Department of
Manpower and Immigration.
At this time I do not feel that it would
serve any useful purpose to recall the chaos
which occurred in this program when the federal Government initially took it over in its
entirety, in so far as the processing of
applications and financing were concerned.
If I may offer a more timely criticism, and
one that has not been totally faced as yet, it
is the continuance of training programs in
trades which, if not obsolete, are becoming
close to it, or at least the demand for such
skills is constantly lessening.
Perhaps this criticism is not valid generally, but I do know that it does apply in the
Atlantic region. If I recall correctly, the Economic Council of Canada in its fifth report
made some reference to this point. So perhaps
present or future courses are being planned
to overcome this sort of thing.
On this subject I believe, too, that notwithstanding the arguments of the proponents
of the present program as it exists, there still
remains a void for the young people who just
do not succeed academically and who leave
school for that reason alone. Many of these
who do not have the means, and whose parents
cannot afford to provide for them away
from home at the location of the trade or
technical school, are discriminated against by
the regulations which require that they be out
of school one year, or that they be in the
labour force for a period of three years,
before being eligible for the living allowance.
Surely, some simple test might be devised
whereby it might be determined when academic drop-out is justified and training
before entering the labour force should be
provided.
I am sure that Senator Donald Cameronand I am sorry he is not in his seat at the

September 24, 1968

moment-read some of the news reports on
Friday indicating that Thursday's issue of the
Senate Hansardhad become a best seller. For
this in itself I do not know whether I should
congratulate or criticize Senator Cameron,
because I am fearful that too many thrill
seekers read only the appendix, and did not
even glance at Senator Cameron's brilliant
and knowledgeable exposé of student revolt
in our universities. I do not know whether
there is a better procedure that we might
have followed than that of having the article
"The Student as Nigger" appear in the record
of our proceedings, but upon reflection I
believe that Senator John M. Macdonald's
suggestion to have the document appear as
though it had been read would have overcome this undesirable effect to which I have
referred. Senator John Connolly objected on
the grounds that we might "create a very bad
precedent" by having the document so
appear. Although I realize it is trite for me to
say that all precedents are not necessarily
"very bad," here is an instance, at least to my
mind, where I sincerely believe that by establishing such a precedent we could have
averted the danger of possibly creating a bad
impression.
I shall not transgress the rules of this
chamber further, or offend honourable senators, by criticizing a unanimous decision
already taken. Instead, I want to amplify my
observation that Senator Cameron showed
brilliance and knowledge in his treatment of
the subject of student revolt. I know all
honourable senators will agree with me that
such a subject could not have been more
timely or more urgent; nor is there a better
forum than this house in which to present the
objective and lucid treatise which we were
privileged to hear, and the public is privileged to read.
It is not my intention to attempt to make
possible another best seller today, because I
have no document that I can ask to be
appended to our proceedings. Notwithstanding my remarks about the thrill seekers, I
would hope-and I believe this is so-that
concerned Canadians are aware that the subject of student unrest has been introduced
here by Senator Cameron, and, like myself, I
am sure that they will be interested to note
the reaction of some other honourable senators and hear their views.
Over the weekend I talked with a number
of students, and their parents as well. I know
I need not tell you of the worry and anxiety

September 24, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

of these parents over this very subject. I can
assure you that they were more than heartened by knowing that this chamber has
shown an interest in the problem.
For my part, I can do no better than commend, amplify if possible, and even repeat
some of Senator Cameron's remarks. For
example, after outlining what he felt were
just causes for student unrest, based on their
social and economic perspective of the world
about them, he summarized as follows:
Therefore, when you see the picture
from the student's eye-view it is small
wonder that he becomes disullisioned
with the results of our democratic society
whose roots are supposed to be nurtured
in the halls of learning. Saying this is not
to justify or condone the extremism of
many of the irresponsible and even dangerous advocates of student power, one of
the most meaningless phrases in the lexicon of modern journalese.
Surely these words convey the ultimate in
objectivity by the sympathetic understanding
shown for all students and young people, and
yet they deplore the extremism of the small
minority whose words and actions break faith
with their colleagues, and blemish the reputation of such a large and respected group in
our society-the group which will no doubt
shortly lead this nation in its every endeavour.
Senator Cameron referred to student revolt
as "only one aspect of a growing and universal demand for change in directions, purposes
and directives of our society." Most of us will
recall that even as late as the 1950s students
did not look beyond their own experience.
They accepted what they were taught, and
were not only content to remain within the
niche assigned them but welcomed the fettered security it offered them. In 1957 the
poet Karl Shapiro wrote:
Passivity is the last word we expect to
use to describe a generation of students
but that is the last word that applies to
the American university of the last few
years.
Let us go back to 1940 when students were
a very small minority of the population, and
when they came chiefly from the wealthier
families. The few who worked their way
through college were so intent upon securing
a training for a decent living that they found
no time to interest themselves with other
affairs. But, by 1960, college became the
norm, not the exception; hence, there devel-

oped a broad national student community
which interested itself in areas far beyond the
campus and academic life.
American students' first real involvement
came during the Freedom Rides of 1961,
when many of them went south to observe at
first hand the brutality, prejudice, and hate
existing there. They attempted to help organize the Negroes for voting, and found themselves up against a stone wall because the
system was entrenched and unyielding. They
came quickly to the conclusion that a rather
wide barrier existed between authority and
justice, and they laid the blame squarely on
the shoulders of their elders. So for them,
Berkeley became equated with Mississippi,
and we know the rest of the story to date
participation and leadership in
-student
strikes, boycotts, protests, violence, and destruction-and this was carried forward to the
campuses themselves as a protest against
university administrators.
Senator Cameron bas told us of the efforts
presently being made in many of our Canadian universities to meet the challenge of
change, to welcome representatives of the
student body on faculty councils, on the
senates, and, as a more recent innovation, on
the boards of governors.
This, honourable senators, is the granting
of a right, not a privilege, to participate in a
democratie society, and it should not be interpreted by anyone as a mere compromise gesture. I would suggest that the average
Canadian student-certainly the majority of
our students-recognizes and appreciates his
up-dated status. Their good common sense
and intelligent approach can continue to gain
for them many heretofore denied privileges
as well as rights, and will permit them to
participate as acceptable, responsible citizens.
But what of some of our present-day leaders of the Canadian Union of Students to
whom Senator Cameron referred and whose
words he quoted in part? I too saw and heard
the things to which he referred, as no doubt
many honourable senators did. What has been
the general student reaction to their inflammable words of violence? What went
wrong with the democratic process when
these men were elected to office? Or had they
made known their extremist views prior to
seeking office? If they did not, and they are
now recognized for what they are, is it not
time that the intelligent rank and file of the
Canadian Union of Students mounted a protest in this direction and rid themselves of
such people?

SENATE DEBATES

It is fitting and proper that we who have
an intimate knowledge of the true character
and worth of our students should warn them
of the dangers inherent in such misdirection,
but it is even more desirable that our students
themselves act now on their own behalf. It
should not be necessary to remind them of
this; nevertheless, perhaps I could do no better than quote the words of Senator Edward
Kennedy in his book Decisions for a Decade
published this year:
Violence and disruption are not in
keeping with the intellectual tradition of a
student
generation.
Dissent
should
express more than crude emotionalism;
slogans on buttons are no substitute for
knowledge of issues. As Justice Holmes
said, the true test of a liberal mind is its
passion for facts. More than any other
AmericansAnd here for our purpose we can validly
substitute "Canadians".
-students have the opportunity to meet
this test. They have the time and the
mental energy. They can examine society's defects critically and expose them
temperately.
And then, too, for those who might despair
in their efforts because of their disillusionment with society, I use one further quote
from the same book by Senator Kennedy:
Our system works through tugging and
hauling, the conflict of groups, and the
eventual mediation by elected representatives.
As for the sample of literature that bas
been distributed under the authority of the
Canadian Union of Students, under the guise
of indoctrination information, suffice to say
this only serves as further proof of the intellectual inadequacy of the union's leaders.
Surely any one of them ought to have been
capable of drafting something at least equally
pertinent in substance without resorting to
such immoral punctuation.
Honourable senators, national problems of
poverty, unemployment, inflation, poor bousing, regional disparity and unity are being
aired daily in a variety of forums and on all
communication media. Student revolt receives
scant attention except when ugly incidents
occur. I sincerely hope that this chamber will
render some small service towards helping
resolve this most urgent and disconcerting
national problem.

September 24, 1968

Hon. Chesley W. Carter: Honourable senators, before coming to the substance of my
remarks, I should like first to extend my congratulations to you, Mr. Speaker, on the high
office te which you have been elevated, for
which you are so admirably qualified by your
long parliamentary experience and so many
natural talents.
I should also like to extend felicitations to
the Honourable Paul Martin upon his
appointment as Government Leader in the
Senate. He has carved out for himself a place
in Canadian history, not only as an outstanding parliamentarian but as a world statesman
and diplomat. I am sure all Canadians
are happy that, following a long and brilliant
career in the other place Senator Martin's
vast knowledge, experience and ability will
continue to be available in the service of
Canada as a member of Canada's senior legislative body.
I should also like to pay a tribute to our
former Government leader Senator John Connolly, and to our former Speaker, Senator
Sydney Smith. Both these gentlemen distinguished themselves and added lustre and
honour to this great institution by the
extremely able manner in which they filled
their respective offices. I am personally
indebted to them for many acts of kindness
and friendship, and for the assistance and
helpful advice they gave me on many occasions, particularly during my first year as a
senator. I extend my very best wishes to
them and to their wives, and I trust that they
will remain among us for many years to
come.
I should also like to congratulate all those
who have preceded me in this debate, and in
particular Senator Phillips (Rigaud) and
Senator Eudes, the mover and seconder of the
Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne. Their contributions were both lucid
and timely. I subscribe fully to the points
they emphasized, which I believe are deserving of the greatest consideration. I shall make
further reference to some of them in the
course of my remarks.
The Speech from the Throne may not be a
very exciting document, but it is realistic. Its
theme is "the just society" and it is realistic
because it warns the people of Canada not to
expect any razzle dazzle, such as sixty days
of decision, or action calculated te excite the
daring and challenge the brave, because the
achievement of the just society is a long-term
operation. It simply cannot be achieved
overnight.

September 24, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

The Throne Speech is realistic because it
emphasizes that first things must be put first,
that before branching out into new untrodden
paths, before developing new programs, Parliament must set its hand to two fundamental
tasks: first, the clearing away of urgent legislation left over from previous parliaments;
and, second, the modernization of parliamentary rules and procedures so as to avoid
waste of time by useless talk. In this way
Parliament will be able to deal with its business more efficiently and expeditiously.
Furthermore, the Throne Speech emphasizes that it takes time, energy and resources
to implement new programs. After they have
been blueprinted, their implementation will
of necessity be limited by the resources,
financial and otherwise, available at the time.
Financial resources in turn will depend upon
the rate of increase in productivity achieved
by our economy. It is ridiculous to distribute
wealth before it has been produced, and it is
folly to build a structure of social services too
large for our economy to support. Under our
present economic system, both these roads
lead to economic disaster. Consequently, new
programs will have to be implemented on a
basis of priorities.
As we look out over the world from our
vantage point here in the Senate, the picture
is far from reassuring. First, there is the
problem of maintaining peace. Fighting is still
going on in Vietnam and in Nigeria, while
war threatens to explode at any time in the
Middle East. The recent occupation of Czechoslovakia by Russian troops has again turned
the lock back in Europe and once more
has made it clear beyond any shadow of
doubt that communism is totally incompatible
with the fundamental human rights, liberties
and freedoms which we as free citizens enjoy.
Russia's rape of Czechoslovakia emphasizes
once again that a free society and a communist society cannot possibly co-exist
together indefinitely on the same planet.
Next to the problem of maintaining peace
come the problems of population explosion, of
feeding the starving millions, and assisting
under-developed countries in their fight
against ignorance, poverty and disease. Here
in Canada we have the tremendous problems of achieving national unity and of
eradicating poverty; we have problems of air
and water pollution, inadequate housing,
regional disparity, unemployment, a rising
crime rate, growing disrespect for law and
order, and the campus problem so ably described by Senator Cameron a few days ago.

All these problems are inter-related. We cannot separate the problems at home from the
problems of the world at large. In a sense,
they are all related to the search for a just
society, because justice, like peace and freedom, is indivisible.
It seems to me that, in seeking solutions to
our domestic problems we should approach
them in the context of world problems, so that
we will develop our own just society in such
a manner and by such means as will enable
Canada to make a more meaningful contribution than we have done in the past towards a
just society throughout the whole world.
How can this best be done? The answer to
this question will determine what our national purpose will be and the direction in which
our nation will go.
In seeking solutions to a problem, the realist will first of all assemble and organize all
the available facts related to that problem.
The way he assembles and organizes those
facts, his interpretation of them and the kind
of solution he seeks, will all be determined by
his basic philosophy.
All philosophy-political, economic, religious or social-is derived from certain concepts
of man himself. Atheistic communism is
based on the concept that man is a mere
animal. Intelligent, yes, but still only an animal. The divine spark, to which Senator Phillips (Rigaud) referred in opening this debate,
is denied by the Russian philosophy; consequently, they hold that man has no worth in
himself as an individual being. This concept
of the soulless man makes the state the
supreme authority and leads straight to the
doctrine that only the state can determine
what is right and what is wrong, what is good
and what is evil, so that individual man
acquires worth only in so far as he serves the
state. This accounts for the broken promises,
the lying propaganda, the double dealing, the
cruel tortures, murders and purges so characteristic of communistic society. It is all perfectly consistent with the basic philosophy on
which their society is built and therefore,
from their point of view, perfectly logical.
By contrast, our western democratic society
is based on a concept of man as a created
being-a being endowed with free will and
linked to his Creator by that divine spark, as
Senator Phillips so eloquently emphasized.
From this it follows that there is a higher
authority than the state; that right and wrong
are determined not by the state but by divine
moral law; that man bas individual worth
within hinself as a created being; that he bas

SENATE DEBATES
a conscience to tell him right from wrong,
and that he is therefore responsible to his
Creator for his behaviour and dependent
upon his Creator for help in the solution of
his problems.
From this it follows, also, that man must
shape his society in conformity with moral
law and order; that the state must be bound
by the same moral law as is man himself.
Therefore, the state should be the expression
of moral order as well as of public power;
consequently, the political and economic systems which constitute the state are man's
tools and instruments. They are man's creation, having no life save what he gives them;
they are his servants and not his masters.
Honourable senators, I have dealt with the
basic philosophic differences underlying the
communist society and the free democratic
society, for several reasons.
The first is that there are many writers,
columnists, commentators and professors in
the free world who portray communism solely as an economic system and who would
have us believe that this is the main difference, if not the only difference, between communism and free parliamentary democracy.
Unfortunately, the free world often operates
in a way which lends credence to this proposition. With so many examples of the law of
the jungle operating in our economic system-of free enterprise neglecting to accept
the responsibility which goes with freedom,
of islands of affluence surrounded by oceans
of squalor, of disregard for the legitimate
rights and aspirations of others, of injustices
and inequities, of waste of human and
material resources, of high talking and low
living-it is not difficult for them to find evidence to support their arguments that no
matter what the free democracies may
profess, or to what moral and spiritual values
they may subscribe, in actual practice they
are guided by the same materialistic motives
as communists, so that really the only essential difference lies in their approach to problems of production and distribution.
It is easy to see how young people, particularly students, can be impressed by such arguments, in the light of evidence they see
around them on every side. It is easy to
understand their disillusionment with democracy and our democratic institutions, particularly when they have grown up in a permissive environment which makes no demands
for self-discipline and gives no challenge for
great living.
Nevertheless, the real truth is that communism is based on the philosophy that man

September 24, 19168

is nothing but an animal, whereas our free
democracy is based on the philosophy that
man is the most important thing in the world
because he is created in the image of God. Al
the human rights and freedoms we enjoy
stem from this concept. If this concept is destroyed or discarded, our rights, freedoms,
human liberties, and the institutions that
uphold them, all perish with it.
These two philosophies are as different as
day and night, as different as good and evil.
They can no more exist in harmony together
on this planet than light and darkness.
How can we trust any agreement with the
Russians, knowing that it is worthless,
because it has no moral basis to make it
binding and the Russians are therefore free to
break it without warning whenever it suits
their purpose?
Furthermore, these two philosophies are
locked in deadly war with each other; and,
by means of various kinds of cold war, miniwars and possibly even a major war, this
struggle must go on until only one of them
survives.
My second reason is that the concept of
man as a created being implies the existence
of a Creator. Godless communism flatly
denies the existence of a Creator; and this
proposition is being accepted and preached
more and more in our literature, in our
theatre, in our schools and universities and to
some extent in our churches.
The new emphasis on this doctrine stems
from the tremendous strides made by scientific research, particularly in the field of
molecular biology. All living things are made
up of individual cells, most of which can be
seen under an ordinary microscope. Each
individual cell contains a nucleus, and each
nucleus contains a miraculous substance that
governs the vital process of life in every
plant and animal cell and, in addition, it carries the blueprint of instructions inherited
from generation to generation. The chemical
name of this miraculous substance is dioxyribonucleic acid, commonly called DNA for
short.
In the 1960s, six researchers discovered the
basic structure of this huge, complicated
molecule, and all six received Nobel prizes
for their work. Later on, scientists succeeded
in synthesizing DNA in the laboratory, and,
proceeding from there, other scientists created in the lab a molecule that appeared to
manifest some characteristics of life, similar
to a virus, in that it could assimilate other

September 24. 1968

SENATE DEBATES

protein molecules as food and reproduce itself
by dividing in two.
Coupled with these achievements is the
minuteness of man as compared with the
incomprehensible vastness of the universe
which modern research in astronomy bas
confirmed. We know we live on a planet circling a star 93 million miles away, which we
call the sun. We know we are only one of
many bodies, planets, moons and asteroids,
circling the same sun in what is called the
solar system. We know that our solar system
is a mere speck in a galaxy called the Milky
Way, which contains billions of other solar
systems separated by distances so vast they
are usually measured in light years.
Light travels 186,000 miles a second. A light
year is the distance light travels in 365 days.
The North Star is 300 light years away from
us and some stars are 26,000 light years distant. Our nearest star neighbour in the Milky
Way is 275,000 times farther away from the
sun than is the earth.
But that is only one galaxy: The Milky
Way. Astronomers tell us the universe contains billions of other galaxies, all thousands
of light years apart. By contrast with such
vastness, beyond all human comprehension,
man is a very small speck indeed. No wonder
the psalmist of old cried out:
When I consider thy heavens . . . and

the stars which Thou hast ordained; what
is man, that Thou art mindful of him?
Those who deny a Creator say that man is so
minute that he is insignificant-as indeed he
would be but for the divine spark in him that
we say we believe.
These scientific developments have been
used by Communists and their fellow travellers as evidence in support of their
materialistic philosophy, but one seldom
hears any scientific evidence in support of the
democratic philosophy. To me the very immensity of the universe is proof of a Creator
because all these billions of heavenly bodies
separated by such vast distances are all moving in harmony, in obedience to fixed natural
laws. All the cosmic action taking place in the
universe-old stars exploding, new stars
being born-is proceeding in accordance with
the same natural laws. Furthermore, we know
that the atom, too small to be seen with ordinary microscopes, is nevertheless a solar system in miniature with its nucleus as the star
and its electrons as planets, following exactly
the same laws as the universe as a whole.
29234-7

Whence came these laws? Can order come
out of chaos? Can cosmic order be maintained without the intervention of a divine
intelligence?
There is no proof that the life-like substance produced in the laboratory is in fact
the same kind of phenomenon as that which
we refer to as life. It would take billions of
years to find out whether this lab-created life
would evolve into higher forms such as we
have on this planet. But even if there was
positive proof beyond any shadow of doubt, I,
for one, could not accept it as proof that
there is no Creator.
The schoolboy who embarks on a high
school course in physics immediately comes
face to face with two fundamental truths: one
is the existence of matter and energy; the
other is that, while matter and energy can be
changed in many ways, they can neither be
created nor destroyed. Modern science has
performed many "miracles," but no scientist
yet bas been able to create matter or energy.
The universe is full of matter and energy.
Where did they come from? Can something
come from nothing? No scientist has ever
produced something from nothing. The very
existence of matter and energy is, for me,
sufficient proof of the existence of a Creator.
My third reason for emphasizing basic
philosophy is that it is the framework within
which we must diagnose our problems. Wrong
diagnoses lead to methods that will not work.
Godless Communism, with its concept of soulless man, and other forms of socialism, all
teach that social evils do not flow from man
himself but from impersonal things such as
economic processes and production techniques. Consequently, to cure these social evils
and injustices, they say all that needs to be
done is to change the system.
Furthermore, Communism teaches that man
himself is completely self-sufficient and fully
capable by the power of his intellect to find
the right solutions to his problems.
On the other hand, the democratic concept
of man as a moral and rational being teaches
that social evils and injustices flow not so
much fron the system as from man himself
who operates the system. In other words,
social evils are due mainly to man's moral
failures. This is verified by our own experience. However good a systen may be working, it can be gummed up by man's moral
failings: his selfishness and greed, his suspicion and mistrust, his hate and fear, his pride
and ambition, his bitterness and resentment,
and his lust for power, wealth and prestige.

SENATE DEBATES

To find lasting solutions to our problems,
we must get to their roots, and, if we dig
deep enough below the surface, we find that
at their roots most of our problems are not
social and economic, but are moral.
We know from our parliamentary experience that many of our laws are designed to
prevent people from doing things that they
know are contrary to moral law and therefore
should not be done. Take, for example, tax
evasion and how it affects our national
income. Take the frauds connected with
unemployment insurance claims and other
social programs. Take the unnecessary empire
building that goes on in the Public Service to
satisfy the egos of officials who must keep up
with the Joneses. Consider the millions of
dollars that are lost to our economy through
unnecessary strikes caused either by mutual
suspicion and mistrust on the part of industry
and labour or by other human barriers
between the men who speak for management
and the men who speak for the unions.
But there is no way of legislating morality.
Man's intellect, however fine, is not capable
of solving moral problems. There can be no
intellectual solution to our strained relations
with France or with the Government of Quebec, or for that matter to the whole problem
of national unity. Legislation may help as an
indication of good will or good intentions, but
fundamentally these are affairs of the heart,
not of the head. They cannot be solved on a
basis of who is right, but only on a basis of
what is right. That takes us back to the moral
law and involves a change of heart on the
part of all concerned. Man has found he is not
able to correct his moral failings by the sheer
force of his human intellect or will power. It
can be done only with the aid of a power
higher and greater than himself, and the
foundations of our society are built on the
experience that divine aid is available to anyone who believes in it and is humble enough
to seek it.
I think it was Lord Acton who said that:
To expect a change in human nature
may be an Act of Faith, but to expect a
change in society, without a change in
human nature, is an Act of Lunacy.
The Speech from the Throne is admirably
forthright and honest with the people of
Canada in emphasizing that the Government
cannot bring about great changes overnight
and that what can be done depends upon the
resources available.
We must hope the Government will be
equally forthright and honest in emphasizing

September 24, 1968

the fact that human intellect alone, however
great, by itself is not able fully to comprehend the problems man himself has made,
much less to devise satisfactory solutions
to them.
Dr. and Mrs. Will Durant, in their recent
book, Lessons of History, refer to man's intellect as follows:
We have put too much stress in recent
times on intellect, too little on character;
we have sharpened our wits while weakening our restraints. In my youth I used
to talk about the bondage of tradition;
now, as befits old age, I distrust the fetishism of novelty. We exaggerate the value
of newness in ideas and things. It is so
much easier to be original than wise. The
customs, conventions and beliefs of mankind are the product of the trial-anderror experience of the race through
many centuries; and it is unlikely that
any individual, however intellectually
brilliant, can come in one lifetime to such
breadth of knowledge and depth of
understanding as to sit safely and wisely
in judgment on ancient ways.
Man is wiser than any man. Hence
there is something disagreeably shallow
about sophistication; it suggests cleverness about the part and ignorance of
the whole. Modesty makes wisdom wiser,
as it makes beauty lovelier.
Honourable senators, the trial-and-error
experience of the race through many centuries is that justice cannot be separated from
morality. It cannot and ought not be limited
by dollars and cents. Experience has proved
that true democracy can function only within
a moral framework. Before we can have a
just society, we must first develop a righteous
society and this is a job for all of us and not
merely for the churches and the clergy. These
truths to me are self-evident, but we must
emphasize them over and over again so that
they will not be obscured by the deliberate
efforts being made to conceal them. Otherwise
we are not being honest with our people and
we are not giving them the kind of leadership
equal to the challenge of our times.
Canada has just elected a new government
with an exciting new leader and great things
are expected of them. They must develop
creative ideas. They must decide to break
entirely fresh new trails if they are to generate the dynamism necessary to cope with the
problems that face Canada and the world.
But these fresh new trails and creative
ideas must be the product of our basic

September 24, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

philosophy. Facts must be considered, certainly, particularly the most important fact of
all, from which all the other tenets of our
philosophy stem. But we must also realize
that facts are made by acts, and acts are
borne out of ideas. We must go back to our
ideas and beliefs, redefine them, take a stand
for them and create acts that are borne from
them. Then, and only then, will the facts of
contemporary history change at home and
abroad.
Too often in the past we have sought solutions within the framework of a materialistic
philosophy. This has only compounded our
problems while the hypocrisy of professing
one thing and practising another has disillusioned and alienated our younger generations.
For example, labour and management as
well as government have approached labour
problems on the basis that man is a machine
and that, as such, he competes with other
human machines. But now he finds himself
more and more up against electronic
machines which make man obsolete and
assign him to the scrap heap. Our manpower
retraining programs are designed only to
minimize and delay that obsolescence. Our
retraining programs are based on the premise
that automation is the only cycle man has to
pass through, but in fact the cycle itself is
part of an overall process of elimination. We
now have machines that can replace human
brains as well as human muscles. Economists
forecast that by the year 2000 approximately
75 per cent of the available work force in
Canada will be paid not to work. Where do
we go frorn there? The material concept of
man affords no basis for a solution. Shall we
continue to lead our people along the blind
alleys of the past?
Hardly a day passes without fresh evidence
from some part of the world that it is well
past the eleventh hour for freedom and
democracy. W. H. Wilson, former Deputy
Director of Intelligence in the Canadian
Navy, begins his article in last Saturday's
Ottawa Citizen with the following sentence:
"The probability of nuclear war in this
decade is at the highest point since the dawn
of the Atomic Age"-and he goes on to enumerate points in support of that statement. I
agree with his assessment.
In its reference to poverty, the Throne
Speech states:
It would be cruel and deluding to pretend that there is a simple, all encompassing or effective remedy.
29234-7

99

I submit, honourable senators, that it is
equally cruel and deluding to lead our people
to think it is possible to create a just society
or to find permanent solutions to any of our
problems except within the framework of a
moral philosophy.
I fully realize that the influence of the
apostles of materialism is such that anyone
who talks along these lines runs the risk of
being ridiculed, labelled as an idealist or a
religious fanatic, ignored or written off in
some other way, but compared with what is at
stake, that is really a small price to pay.
I believe the time has come for us to assert
boldly what we believe, and strive to shapeour policy accordingly. I am encouraged int
this by the fearless example of Senator Phillips in his opening speech. He reminded me
of the verse by James Russell Lowell:
Then it is the brave man chooses,
While the coward stands aside,
Till the multitude make virtue
Of the faith they have denied.
Honourable senators, I believe the world is
headed into the most troubled and perilous
times in the history of mankind, and I have
stressed these points for two reasons. First, I
believe that Canada can lead the world into
the paths of peace, justice and prosperity, but
only if as a nation she herself follows the
path of true righteousness inherent in the
philosophy underlying our society; and, second, I am convinced that in no other way can
nuclear war be averted; in no other way can
our economic and social problems be solved,
or can Canada be held together as a nation.
Hon. Josie D. Quart: Honourable senators,
fully realizing that my words of congratulation are repetitious, nevertheless I cannot
deprive myself of the great pleasure of adding my voice to the chorus of deserving
praise extended to the honourable Senator
Deschatelets upon his appointment to preside
over the debates of this chamber.
[Translation]
May I be allowed, Mr. Speaker, to wish you
all kinds of blessings and good health
while fulfilling the duties of your new assignment, and also to assure you of my wholehearted co-operation.

May I also mention it is very delightful
indeed for the feminine element in the Senate
to know that both the honourable Speaker
and the honourable Leader of the Government in the Senate are seconded so graciously

SENATE DEBATES
by two charming and devoted ladies-their
wives of course-in the performance of their
social duties.
I wish to off er to the honourable Senator
Martin my warmest good wishes upon assuming the duties of Leader of the Government
in the Senate. This chamber is most fortunate
in having the guidance of such a distinguished world diplomat and great parliamentarian.
Honourable Senator Martin, I am very sincere in saying that my very best wishes for
you are that you will inherit the admiration,
respect and deep affection which your predecessor, the Honourable John Connolly,
received frorn both sides of this house.
It is encouraging to see our own leader, the
honourable Senator Flynn, and deputy leader,
the honourable Senator Choquette, in fine
health and spirits because their task as defenders of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition-a
small band on this side of the house-is not
an easy one.
To the newly 'appointed senators, may I
add my welcome to what is referred to as the
most exclusive club in Canada. Of course this
august chamber of second sober thought has
been called many other names less complimentary!
I wish wholeheartedly to congratulate the
mover and seconder of the motion for an
Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne, the honourable Senator Lazarus Phillips and the honourable Senator Raymond
Eudes, who made an eloquent and excellent
debut, but then their talents were well known
long before their maiden speeches in this
chamber. They have set a high standard for
our debates.
Honourable senators, there is a definite
advantage in speaking in this debate, for one
is not restricted to the Speech from the
Throne. However, if one dwells on the promise of a "just society," the much discussed
and sometimes controversial "national unity"
comes to mind. For how can a "just society"
become a reality if discrimination of race,
religion or colour-and I should add poverty-are not first eliminated as much as
humanly possible.
I was greatly impressed by the sentiments
contained in the speech of the honourable
Senator Romuald Bourque on November 21
last. I am very happy to see him in the house,
because I have distributed many copies of his
speech to interested people. I quote just one
paragraph from it:

Sepfember 24, 1968

My dream has always been that one
day Canada would be a truly great and
united country; that its differences would
be resolved in a spirit of reason and
friendly understanding; and that my
country would provide an example to the
world of millions of people of different
ethnic backgrounds, different religions,
different colours and races, all living
together in peace and harmony, united by
their love for a common country which
they have all helped to build, and with
all their energies directed towards the
creation of a better world.
Senator Bourque calls it his dream-and a
wonderful dream it is.
Along similar Unes, I call these sentiments
and objectives my everlasting crusade for
national unity, which I have entitled "Outstretched Hands from Sea to Sea," and I join
with Senator Bourque in hoping his dream
and my crusade will succeed before we pass
on to the great beyond.
These days in most Christian churches
prayers are being offered for church unity,
and as Christians we are striving to overcome
our differences, and rightly so, but what
about Canadian national unity? As Christians
we are taught to do unto others as we would
have thern do unto us. Also Christians are
taught to love their neighbour. Well, if the
true Christians would just stop to think about
these two lessons, would we have the division
which now exists between Canada's two
founding races? Are we being hypocritical by
pretending to pay lip service to the cause of
national unity, without really meaning a word
of these high-sounding phrases concerning
loving our neighbour and doing unto him as
we would have him do unto us? Think about
it-and then stand up to your convictions as
Christians. Then the Christian philosophy will
have a marked influence on the outcome for a
strong and united Canada.
My crusade "Outstretched Hands from Sea
to Sea" was chosen to make us more conscious of our present problems in Canada and
the rumblings of separatism. So I decided to
stand up and be counted and to help dispel
the panic and fear of separation which, in my
opinion, is greatly exaggerated.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Quart: My optimism may be a
"Pollyanna" attitude, but I find it helps to
mesmerize yourself and forget your worries
for a time by indulging in constructive think-

September 24. 1968

SENATE DEBATES

ing and acting. But the time has come when
moderate members of the two founding peoples must speak out clearly and in a spirit of
compromise to counteract the viewpoints of
the extremists. The refusal of voices of reason
to express their opinions is bringing Confederation dangerously close to the breaking
point.
I believe that women could play an important role in the cause of national unity, to
achieve a country where bigotry and misunderstanding will be reduced to a minimum, a
country where common sense tolerance will
condition our viewpoint. In mentioning
women's role in my crusade I do not wish to
exclude men-heaven forbid!-for I am all
for teamwork with men. But God must surely
have known what He was doing when He
entrusted women with the super job of taking
little boys and girls and training them to
become men and women. And this is when
mothers and teachers can stamp out bigotry
of race, creed or colour, during the child's
formative years.
Now, stop for a moment and think of Canada as a family and you women as the homemakers. Then, I suggest that the woman citizen should apply her gifted homemaker talents
to every consideration of national unity.
Just as she is capable of fully understanding
that different members of her own family
have different personalities and aspirations,
so also should she grasp and fully understand
the legitimate right of the English- and
French-speaking members of our Canadian
family to have different personalities and
ideals. In her own family a mother accepts
these different personalities as a natural,
human pattern of behaviour, even if somewhat tiresome. Yet were she to use the same
yardstick on our national family, much of the
confusion and distrust would shrink to the
really insignificant place it should occupy in
any family.
We must first realize and accept that
Confederation is an offspring of a "shotgun
wedding" a hundred years ago. It was a marriage of convenience, if you like, but a real,
honest-to-goodness contract wherein both
partners promised to live together and build
a good country for their children. The bickering and controversy now taking place can be
compared to a marital row in which two of
the biggest single issues at stake are human
pride and lack of understanding.
French-speaking separatists-yes, and English-speaking separatists too-are fanning
the flame into a great conflagration, or, in

other words, into a battle royal which, if
unchecked, can only end in sorrowful divorce
for both parties, and because it was a marriage of convenience to begin with, its foundations are more easily shaken. But, I submit,
honourable senators, that if a woman citizen
cares about her country, home and offspring,
she will not want this marriage to break up,
if only to avoid the ravages and scars of any
broken marriage, which in this case means
the breakup of Confederation.
If one member of her Canadian family feels
that circumstance bas given him the short
end of the stick, a dedicated woman will
assess his complaint within the framework of
her human nature. She will not insist that the
French-speaking child be a carbon copy of his
English-speaking brother. She will help
spread the word that his diversity, his different culture and talents can be an exciting
contribution, something that the family can
boast about. She can help convince him that
he, in turn, bas nothing to fear from his
English-speaking Canadian brother whose
own particular talents complement his.
Together, the family can make a name for
itself as it did gloriously when its members
got together last year to build Expo. Neither
could have done it on his own. It might have
been a fair, but it would never have been
the greatest, most beautiful exhibition the
world has ever seen. This is what can happen
when a family pulls together.
As in every family, there is a certain
amount of jealousy; but, there again, the
homemaker, the woman citizen, can keep it
under control. She can make a bigot look
very ugly when he spreads his poison. If
someone English says, "I can't stand those
French Canadians from the Province of Quebec," or should a French person say, "Je
déteste ces maudits anglais," she can get him
to stop generalizing and to name the
individuals he cannot stand. Obviously, if the
reply is that he cannot stand all French
Canadians, or the French Canadian says that
he cannot stand tous les Canadiens anglais,
then we can size up the measure of the man
or woman and truly label them bigots.
The truth is that there are very fine people
on both sides of the language controversy,
and neither side has a monopoly on vice or
virtue but let us stop the bigots of both sides
from influencing the fine people. Our silence
gives them wings, but our courage in showing
them up for what they are, bigots, would be a
patriotic act of valour for the Canada we all
love.

We have to accept first the two-language

September 24, 1968

(Translation]
Honourable senators, I was deeply interested in reading the speech made by Hon.
Lazarus Phillips, who moved the address in
reply to the Speech from the Throne, and
that made by Honourable Raymond Eudes,
who seconded the motion. Both these honourable senators are to be congratulated on their
able and eloquent presentation which proved
interesting to us. Being both newly appointed
to the Senate, their reputation has preceded
them, and I am convinced that it is not the
last interesting speeches we will hear from
them.
May I be permitted to tell our Speaker of
the preceding legislature, the Honourable Sydney J. Smith, that his talents were very much
appreciated and we hope that he and his wife
will enjoy a well deserved rest.
To our new Speaker, Honourable Jean-Paul
Deschatelets, P.C., we extend our most cordial
welcome. Considering his young age, I am
sure be will be able to fulfil his duties with
dignity and savoir-faire. He has indeed
achieved a successful career as lawyer, member of Parliament and minister, senator and
now Speaker of the Senate.
Our new Leader, Honourable Paul Martin,
P.C., formerly a minister of the cabinet and
until recently Secretary of State for External
Affairs is a brilliant personality. While discharging his duties in his many important
responsibilities in Canada and abroad, during
some thirty years in the House of Commons,
he has honoured his fellow Canadians. We
welcome this wise man who undoubtedly will
direct the proceedings of this Chamber with
tact and dignity.
To the Honourable John J. Connolly who,
because of ill health had to resign the leadership of this Chamber which through his talents
he conducted with distinction, we wish him improvement in his health so that he may, during many years to come, participate in our
discussions.
We extend to Honourable Jacques Flynn,
P.C., the popular Leader of the Opposition,
our most sincere wishes for success in the
task he is accomplishing with tact and vigour.
To his Deputy Leader, the Honourable
Lionel Choquette, we offer our most sincere
wishes of good health and happiness. It is

fact in our national home, and although, in
fact it does present problems, there is no use
in complaining that it is too bad we do not
all speak the same language. This complaint
leads only down a blind alley, at the end
of which is a tower of Babel.
The historical fact remains that Canada is
the home of the world's two great cultures,
and if we could but dare to rise to the exciting challenge Canada could be unique in
North America. I am realistic enough to know
that all Canadians cannot be bilingual, but
always remember that every additional language we acquire is additional culture.
However, there is nothing to stop us from
being goodwill ambassadors of bilingualism in
Canada. This bilingual image of Canada on
the world stage could give us character and a
reputation of a country of bonne entente in
action. Naturally, all this will take time,
patience and tolerance, but is not this what
goes into the building of any good family
worth its name?
Furthermore, I sincerely believe that if
there is such a thing as a woman's contribution to national unity, then let ber be
a woman citizen; let ber be the heart of
the national family; let ber patiently settle
national family squabbles, but above all let
ber take the trouble to make our national
family keenly aware of its potential for greatness.
Canada is an inspiring young country. It
has been good to many. It bas been good to
us all. Let us count our blessings, and minimize our problems, but let us get all together
to make Confederation work. Like a good
mother with adopted children of other races
and cultures, Canada wants ber many ethnic
groups to share with her two founding races,
English and French, the advantages as well
as the responsibilities of full and equal citizenship in the future development of Canada.
Honourable senators, in gratitude for past
and present blessings, and with prayerful
hopes for the future, as we have taken our
first step into our second century, let our
prayers be those of thanksgiving and optimism
that Canadians will successfully meet the
challenges and opportunities of the next hundred years.

power. This is true, let me say, on both sides
of the fence; the breeders of distrust and the
fomenters of hatred are not all to be found in
one province or one region of Canada, nor do
they all speak the same tongue. Nor are
French- or English-speaking recruits for
organized campaigns of recrimination difficult
to find.
In addition to being useful to the promoters
of disunity, history has also preached a poor
lesson to those of us who think Canada is
worth preserving. It bas taught us, badly I
think, that what seem to be serious troubles
will almost always, if left alone, go away. We
have become experts in the practice of
sweeping our difficulties under the rug.
Unfortunately the rug has become threadbare
and the difficulties are now showing through.
We can no longer hide them from ourselves,
and at least one overseas guest has made sure
that we cannot even hide them from the rest
of the world. The time bas obviously arrived
when we must do something about the situation which keeps us in constant and aggravating turmoil. There are so many other worthwhile objectives which should be engaging
our attention. As a young and enlightened
nation we should be contributing so much of
value to a disturbed and disturbing world.
On the surface at least we are at last beginning to act in our own national interests. The
report of the Bilingual and Bicultural Commission tells us little that in our hearts we
did not already know, but it provides the
basis for political action. The conference of
the premiers in Toronto last November
revealed an understanding of the problem, if
not a program for its solution, which many of
us had felt was lacking at provincial levels.
Canadians in high places have demonstrated
during the past few weeks and months an
unsuspected willingness to compromise and to
unbend a little in their long-established
attitudes.
This is all to the good. But amidst all the
changes of heart and the public utterances of
goodwill a few well-considered warnings
should have been heard. With justifiable caution the leaders of some provinces and the
representatives of some regions in the
Canadian Parliament have said: "We understand the situation and we see the need, but
we do not know just how well this is going to
go down at home."
Who knows what the effects of the last
five years or so, or charges and countercharges, heated demands and hot denials,

September 24, 1968

angry insults and bitter retorts have had on
the grassroots? Do the people in the cities and
towns and down on the farm believe what
they read in their newspapers and see and
hear on television or radio? If they do, what
must be their impressions of their fellow
Canadians who live far away and talk in
another tongue and whose spokesmen seem to
be so unreasonable and so demanding? How
many of the people in English-speaking Canada are asking in all honesty, "What does Quebec want?" And how many French Canadians
whose ancestors came here three hundred and
more years ago are saying, "Why must we go
on always feeling like foreigners in the greater part of our native land?"
The problem today is not to persuade the
politicians that something must be done but
to persuade the people of Canada, all the
people, that they must do much more than
just accept necessary changes, that they must
accept them in the fullness of their hearts.
Unfortunately, we cannot legislate friendship
and understanding any more than we can
legislate happiness. Regard for one's fellows
must come from within. No law on earth can
make me understand or like someone who
speaks another tongue. I can be prevented by
law from interfering with his right to use that
tongue but nothing can compel me to give
him that right willingly except my own belief
that he will be a better friend and a stauncher ally because he has it.
The same fact prevails throughout all our
daily life. It is easy to pass a law that every
company in Quebec must have a general
manager whose mother tongue is French. It is
impossible to compel the company's shareholders to give that same French-speaking
manager their confidence and the powers he
should enjoy unless they are convinced be
can exercise those powers in the best company interests.
Laws cannot work without consent of the
governed. I will go further and say that laws
cannot work without the moral support and
agreement of the governed. If French- and
English-speaking Canadians are to live
together in harmony it will only be because
the people of both ethnic groups believe in
the importance of such harmony and are willing participants in creating it. The job that is
facing us, therefore, is not merely one of
legislating for the future peace, security and
happiness of Canada, but one of persuading
all our fellow Canadians, of whatever origin,
that the measures we are proposing are just
and reasonable and, above all, desirable.

September 24. 1968

SENATE DEBATES

This is a task which we in Canada have
long neglected. Twenty-seven years ago an
article appeared in Liberty magazine under
the title "What is French Canada Thinking?"
The article was remarkably prophetic. Much
of what was written there is now being said
from the platform, in the press and on radio
and television today.
In the midst of reporting what he believed
to be French Canadian thinking at the time,
the author paused to suggest that the reason
why French Canadians were sa discontented
was that over the years "English Canada had
failed to conduct a publie relations program
in French Canada." In other words, English
Canada had never told its story to French
Canadians and, he might have added, French
Canadians had never told their story to
English Canadians.
The results of that failure are now apparent. Canadians of the two language groups
are so uninformed about the true nature of
each other that they might as well be living
on different planets.
Separated linguistically and geographically,
French- and English-speaking Canadians seldom meet outside the two major cities in
Quebec. English Canadian school children
have few opportunities to play or study with
children of their own age who speak French.
The very subjects which are taught in our
schools keep them apart. Is it any wonder
that when they become adults they are either
suspicious or totally unaware of each other's
existence?

Many Canadians are, I am sure, already
dedicating themselves to this task. One small
group with which I am acquainted has
already launched its own program towards
this end. Under the auspices of Inside Canada
Public Relations, professionals in this field,
living and working in Vacouver, Calgary,
Regina, Winnipeg, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal
and Halifax, have undertaken to apply to this
Canadian problem the same techniques which
during the war were used to inform Canadians about this country's war efforts and to
promote the sale of Victory Bonds and War
Savings Certificates and which in 1967 were
used to promote the Canadian Centennial and
Expo' 67.
They will encourage the pairing of "pen
pals" in French and English Canada, student
and athletic exchanges, addresses to service
clubs and women's organizations, distribution
of basic interpretative literature to Canadian
homes and constant widespread communication between English and French Canada.
We have heard much about the need for a
dialogue between representatives of our two
ethnic families. At high levels, this dialogue
is now seemingly for the first time well under
way. The greater need is for millions of
individual communications between the ordinary people whose hearts as well as minds
must be dedicated to creating a Canadian
unity that truly binds the two nations which
together created the Canadian Confederation
one hundred and one years ago.
Honourable senators, it is my intention to
work with the construction gang and not with
the wrecking crew, and I invite all Canadians
to do likewise so that we may build a strong
and united Canada.

Such ignorance is not excusable even when
it exists between peoples of two different
countries in this rapidly shrinking modern
world. It is unpardonable in Canada, which
prides itself upon being a civilized and internationally minded country.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE
CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from earlier this day
consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session, and the motion of Honourable Mr. Phillips (Rigaud), seconded by Honourable Mr.
Eudes, for an address in reply thereto.
Hon. F. Elsie Inman: Honourable senators,
first, Mr. Speaker, I wish to congratulate you
on your appointment to the Speaker's Chair. I
am sure we were all pleased to hear that you
were called to this high position and we hope
you will enjoy your tenure as our Speaker.
It gives me pleasure also to congratulate
and welcome the new Leader of the Government, the Honourable Paul Martin. I know
that the honourable senator will give to this
chamber excellent leadership. He brings with
him, as we all know, an unparalleled career
in the other place.
We are glad to see the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Flynn, with us again, and also
his deputy, Senator Choquette.
I wish to congratulate the mover and
seconder of the address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne for their excellent and
interesting addresses. We hope to hear them
speak often in this Senate.
May I extend a very warm welcome to the
new senators who have joined this chamber
since we last met. I know they will make a
great contribution to our deliberations here.
We are happy to see our former leader
with us and looking so well. We always
regard him with affection and respect. We
hope our former Speaker, Senator Sydney
Smith, will soon return to this chamber fully
restored to health.
During the coming season we all look forward to the implementation of the many
pieces of legislation mentioned in the Speech
from the Throne. We are, of course, aware
that the good housekeeper cleans up the
kitchen before preparing the next meal.
We are living in a period of rapid change,
and the developments now taking place can
have deep and lasting effects on our lives and
the lives of those who will follow us. We have

September 24, 1968

today as our Prime Minister a man who may
be destined to become one of Canada's greatest leaders. He is young enough to have
idealistic dreams, yet old enough to realize
that it is not always possible to make the
dreams of youth come true, but he has the
courage and conviction to try. Mr. Trudeau
says he will attempt to get the country moving. We feel that the course he will chart will
be a wise one, and that it will result in a
united and productive country with a high
rate of growth in the national economy.
The Speech from the Throne promises
legislation to protect and aid our producers.
This is especially welcome to the fishermen,
farmers and tourist promoters in my
province.
The economic challenges facing Canada at
this time in its history require outstanding
leadership. The world does not stand still,
and we have problems. Trade, for example, is
one of them that is of political importance to
Canada. There are no easy answers to these
problems. But someone has said that there is
no such thing as a difficult problem; there are
only difficult people. Perhaps we have some
of both.
There is need for much greater industrial
expansion in this country, especially in the
Atlantic provinces, in order to provide
employment for steadily increasing labour
forces. The need is urgent here because
unemployment in this region is consistently
higher than in other provinces of Canada.
Provincial governments already do a great
deal by way of providing assistance to industry, but there is a definite limit to what the
provincial governments of the Atlantic provinces can do to attract new industry. It is
essential, therefore, that the federal Government should co-operate and assist in the
financing of an economic development plan
for the Atlantic provinces. Programs have
already been undertaken and progress is
being made and we hope that these programs
will be continued. For instance, in my Province of Prince Edward Island, frozen food
plants are operating successfully. In Nova
Scotia the fish processing industry is expanding, and in New Brunswick the expansion of
small industries is advancing. These programs
must be enlarged and kept moving. Newfoundland also has developed large industries.
I would like to speak for a short time about
our smallest province, Prince Edward Island,
giving you some details concerning our people, its attractions and resources.

September 24, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

The scenery is not startling in the sense of
the grandeur of the mighty Rocky Mountains.
How could it be when the elevation is only
300 feet? Nevertheless, it is so quietly beautiful that pictures of it linger in the memory of
those who have had the good fortune to visit
the Island. Our population is about 105,000-made up of Acadian French, Scottish,
English and Irish, who all live and work
together in unity and peace. Prince Edward
Islanders are independent by nature; they are
not afraid to initiate something new in their
lives. The first airmail service was initiated in
Prince Edward Island. The first official airmail flight was made between Truro and
Charlottetown in 1919. Prohibition was born
there. I might say, parenthetically, that we
are not too proud of that one, for it ushered
in the rum-running era, a story in itself.
The first automobile to be run in America
was built in this small province, and the first
under-water telegraph cable in America was
laid between Prince Edward Island and New
Brunswick. The first Canadian ship to sail to
New Zealand was built in this island province
and there are many other firsts.
Important
in our
Canadian natural
resources are the rich and fertile lands of
Prince Edward Island, which produce magnificent crops, and the water surrounding it,
which provides our people with an abundant
harvest of fish each year.
Here I would like to say a word with
regard to our vacant farms. We have on the
Island about 2,500 vacant farms. Some of
these will be added to present operations.
Some will be bought up by outside interests
and will be used as pasture land for beef
cattle. But I know from speaking to our
young people that many of them would like
to stay in the business of farming, if they had
the capital to start out on their own. We are
all aware that it can take up to $50,000,
according to size, to equip a farm. That
includes, of course, machinery and stock.
There is a solution for these fertile farms
that are lying dormant. I would suggest that
since we are able to give so much money,
interest free and for long terms, to foreign
countries-and this is good and I believe in
it-why not assist some of our own young
men and women by giving them long-term and
interest free loans. This would give them a
start and provide an incentive to work the
land, and this in turn would increase production and employment. Farming is a good life.
It means food, shelter, and a satisfying way
of life for those who like the freedom of the
great outdoors.
29234-81

We have going at present a novel adult
education and activity program initiated by
the Islanders themselves. They decided to
work through community schools. This has
resulted in a return to the old-time community spirit and the improvement of local social
and economic conditions. In its first three
years of operation it achieved an enrolment
of more than 3,000 persons in the rural districts. Discussion periods are an important
part of the program, and the groups consist
mainly of farmers and their wives and other
adult members of their familles. Each week
they have a guest speaker: a veterinarian, an
income tax consultant, someone from the Department of Agriculture, a member of the
teaching or medical profession, and at times a
member of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police.
In the final analysis, social contact through
these community schools was placed on top of
the list of accomplishments. Go to any of
these schools and you will find the students
learning all sorts of things, including conversational French and public speaking.
I would like to speak at this time on several points of special interest. The Island combines the pioneer days with modern times.
Farming, one of our main industries, is carried on still, in a very few places using the
old methods, but more and more farms are
being enlarged and modernized with the use
of modern and more efficient equipment.
Fishing is another important industry with
some Islanders and we are very fortunate in
having a gond supply of different varieties of
fish. Lobster fishing brings the highest income
to fishermen and in a good season such a
fisherman can average $4,000 to $5,000 for the
two-month season.
Another branch of this industry recently
undertaken is the processing of queen crab.
This is a very delicious fish. Shortly before I
came back to Ottawa I made a tour of one of
the operations and saw the work being done.
The manager of this plant told me that they
are shipping quantities of queen crab to other
countries, including Great Britain where it is
very popular. They are hoping this will develop into a major industry.
Scallop fishing is very productive and is a
financial success. Tuna fishing has become
quite popular among the tourists who have
the money to indulge in this sport. Just last
Sunday an 849-pound tuna was landed at
North Lake, and others were taken earlier.
This season a man was brought to Prince

SENATE DEBATES
Edward Island, with his boat and necessary
equipment, to teach any of our fishermen who
might be interested the methods of tuna
fishing and the handling of boats used in this
sport.
Tobacco growing is another industry which
is becoming popular on the Island, especially
in the southern part of Kings County, where
the climate and soil are particularly adapted
to tobacco growing. Each year the acreage for
this crop is increasing and many more people
are becoming interested in going into this
very satisfactory branch of agriculture.
Tourism is fast becoming our greatest
income-producing industry and will soon be
considered ahead of agriculture and fishing.
Our governments are giving us a great deal
of assistance in this business. We have more
paved roads in our province per capita than
any other province in Canada. There is a
saying on Prince Edward Island that "If you
can move it, give it a pension. If you can't
move it, pave it." By the number of paved
roads, and others in process of being paved,
it looks as though we do not move and pension as much as we pave.
Our historical sites are being marked with
cairns and plaques, and in one instance the
site of Point de Roma is being excavated
prior to its being restored. It will be another
of our tourist attractions when completed.
Point de Roma is just across the river from
my own home, and I was able to sit on my
veranda this summer and watch the work
being done. On several occasions I also visited the scene and watched the operations. It
was really marvellous to look down 20 feet
and see stonework and brickwork which
looked as though it had been constructed only
the week before. One realizes the time and
labour that must have gone into this project.
Many artifacts have been uncovered and will
be preserved in the fort when it is restored.
So far, though, no gold, silver or jewels have
been recovered.
With your indulgence, I would like to give
you a short history of this site. In 1731 Count
de Roma was given, by King Louis XV of
France, a grant of land in the eastern section
of the Island, at a point drained by three
rivers now known as the Brudenell, Montague and Cardigan. Here he laid out a model
community with great cellars, store houses, a
bakery, ice house, and a residence for himself, with dwellings close by for the fishermen, labourers, seamen and traders. Here de
Roma lived and planned and dreamed of a

September 24, 1968

future of progress and happiness for the settiers of his little kingdom.
This dream was soon over. In 1745, one
week before the fall of Louisburg, a ship was
sighted, and armed men from New England
came ashore. The whole settlement was
sacked and everything of value carried away,
and what remained was burned to the
ground. Count de Roma and some of his followers escaped through the woods to the
north of the Island. Others were either carried away or killed. Thus was written, in
anguish and heartbreak, one of the most
pathetie stories in our Island history.
The Woodleigh replicas at Burlington, on
the estate of Colonel Johnson and his son,
which I have mentioned on previous occasions in this chamber, are a real "must" for
visitors to our Island. There is nothing like it
anywhere in the world, and replicas are being
added all the time. I have mentioned many
before, but to mention a few there is Dunvegan Castle, large enough to live in, containing
replicas of furnishings found in the original
Dunvegan Castle in the Isle of Skye. There is
Glamis Castle, York Minster, Penn Manor
House, the Mill on the Floss, complete with
the large waterwheel, Shakespeare's birthplace, Ann Hathaway's cottage, and many
others. At present the Tower of London is
being reproduced, and it will have 13 towers
when finished. So far five towers have been
completed, one of which contains replicas of
the crown and the crown jewels. Also can be
seen here a replica of one of the first Rolls
Royce cars, brought over from England, and
a building is now being constructed to house
this ancient vehicle.
Another new project which opened this
past year, and which is of much interest to
tourists, is the Acadian Pioneer Village located at Mount Carmel in Prince County. This is
a real showplace, and provides a tourist
attraction which no one coming to our province should miss. The village consists of cabins which were constructed completely of logs
by the people living agound Mount Carmel.
All the cabins contain authentic early 19th
century furniture, cooking utensils, hunting
rifles, dishes and other relics that were kept
over the years by the people of the surrounding area. A log church was built, and it is a
beautiful piece of craftsmanship. Attractive
knotted wood is used, and the simple designs
of the altar, pews, pillars and other parts of
the church put some of its ornate modern
descendants to shame.
This year we had the greatest influx of
tourists in the history of our province.

September 24, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Although in the past years many motels,
campsites and parks have been developed, it
was practically impossible to transport all the
tourists who came to our shores. The ferries
between New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and
Prince Edward Island were kept running continuously and even then, unfortunately, there
were long waits at the terminals. On one
occasion there was a line-up of cars seven
and a half miles long, and several times I
have seen a line of cars stretching three or
four miles up from the pier waiting for the
ferry.
A large new ferry is to come into service in
October between Tormentine on the New
Brunswick side, and Borden in Prince
Edward Island. This ferry has already been
launched, and it will be a great help in moving people. It will carry, I understand, in the
vicinity of 160 automobiles and 1,000 passengers. As the trip across the Northumberland
Strait takes only three-quarters of an hour,
last summer's traffic problems should not be
repeated.
We have, like every other province, our
problems, economic and otherwise. These, of
course, must be dealt with according to the
facilities available for developing resources in
our province. Many problems are common to
all four Atlantic provinces. However, our
problems in Prince Edward Island in respect
of poverty are not as great as one would
imagine from reading the recent report by
Professor Yves Pepin on conditions in the
province. We have very little, if any, illiteracy, and I feel quite sure that very, very few,
if any, of our people ever go hungry.
Visitors, almost without exception, have
nothing but praise for Prince Edward Island's
vacation land, although one tourist commented that there were not enough girls, not
enough places to drink, and that it was too
quiet. These conditions in the future could, no
doubt, be remedied. I do not mean to convey
to you the idea that Prince Edward Island is
Utopia, but life goes on easily, and we have
time enough to enjoy our own families and
the visitors who come to our shores.
As I mentioned earlier, our greatest need is
transportation. If we are to produce more we
must sell more, and have adequate means of
transporting our produce to our outside
markets. Improvement in our transportation
system is very necessary for the progress and
prosperity of Prince Edward Island. While we
are thankful for this new ferry that is coming
into service, we need others in order to keep
constant communication with the mainland.

These are not days for guessing contests,
but days when knowledge and experience are
very necessary indeed to weigh and consider
most carefully the affairs of our country in
order to give it the best legislation possible.
The problems of each province require
individual study and consideration by those
in authority in order that there be the legislation that will contribute the most to the welfare of our citizens and the development of
our resources-legislation not only for our
own good, but for the ultimate good of our
great heritage, this vast and rich land of
Canada.
Hon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson: Honourable
senators, I should like to say first that it is a
great pleasure to be back in this place after
so long a vacation. I regret the fact that I was
not present at the opening of this session of
Parliament, and consequently I missed hearing the opening speeches of the mover and
seconder of the motion for an Address in
reply to the Speech from the Throne.

mine, and I would say to him: "I have read
your speech, Senator Phillips, as I have that
of your seconder, Senator Eudes. Both of
them were, in my opinion, masterful
performances."
Senator Phillips has had, of course, great
experience in both the law and business, and,
as we all know, Senator Eudes has had a fine
career in the other place. I congratulate both
of these honourable senators most heartily
upon their speeches.
Honourable senators, the reason I was
away is that with two other honourable
senators I attended the annual conference of
the Interparliamentary Union held in Lima,
Peru. I can say that we had a very pleasant
time there, and I expect that we will in due
course have something to say to the house
about the international problems that were
discussed at that conference.
I should like now, to congratulate you, Mr.
Speaker, upon your appointment to your high
office. When you arrived in this chamber
some years ago you were welcomed by everyone here as a person who had had much
experience in both private and public life,.
and as one who, as a minister of the Crown,
had made for himself a reputation for great
ability.
Everything that we thought of you then,
sir, has been borne out by our experience of
you in the Senate, first as a member, then as
Deputy Leader of the Government and later

SENATE DEBATES
as Chairman of the important Committee on
Finance. Everyone in this house wishes you
well and will, I am sure, give you every
co-operation which is due to your high post.
I also wish to add my congratulations along
with others to the honourable Senator Paul
Martin, who has now assumed the leadership
of the Government in this chamber. We are
all aware of his record as a public figure in
this country, first as a Member of Parliament,
then as Minister of the Department of Health
and Welfare and later as Secretary of State
for External Affairs. We are also, of course,
'well aware of his multifarious duties over the
years in the field of international affairs. In
my view the post of Leader of the Government in the Senate is of the highest in regard
to honour, responsibility and prestige that can
be conferred upon a Member of Parliament in
Canada.
I would like to say a word or two about the
retired leader on the other side, the Honourable John J. Connolly. Perhaps our friend is
getting pretty tired of hearing these accolades
from everyone in the house, nevertheless I
must add mine to those of others. I am sure
that he himself will confirm that he received
the ultimate in co-operation from the Opposition in the Senate-if I may call it that-during his term of office, as well as from his own
party.

such, nevertheless, it has been changed enormously from what it was.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): It has
evolved.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: These changes were

of course made to meet new attitudes and
new conditions of life throughout the world.
Although I am personally persuaded in
regard to the Senate of Canada that its roots
are too deep and its functions are too important for any thought of its elimination from
our system of government, nevertheless, after
100 years of operation with only one constitutional change during all that time-I refer of
course to the amendment to the British North
America Act regarding the retirement of
senators at age 75-the time may now have
come when we should take a good look at this
institution and ask if there are other improvements which can be made in the interest of
a more effective Parliament of Canada.
Indeed, such a reassessment has often been
made in the past.
I have thought it rather amusing from time
to time to listen to certain persons, mainly
from far corners of the other place, making
glib statements to the effect that the Senate
should be abolished; but seldom of late have I
heard specific reasons given for this point of
view. Indeed, I have discovered that most of
them are men who have given no great

SENATE DEBATES

The importance attached to this body by
the Fathers of Confederation is explained in
part by the fact that, of the fourteen days
devoted to the Confederation Debates at Quebec in October 1864, six of them were spent
on the nature, functions and method of selection of the Canadian Senate.
Before proceeding further, I would like to
say I am personally persuaded that, as
long as Canada maintains a form of government based on the British system of parliamentary government, so long will the Senate
survive in substantially its present form. Only
should we decide to change to a congressional, republican or some other type of government would it be appropriate to tinker with
the Senate by way of constitutional
amendment.
In regard to the use of the word "tinker," I
want to acknowledge that I took it from my
friend Senator Roebuck, who used it in an
article which was published, I think, in
Maclean's magazine many years ago.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Honourable senators, I would like to give very briefly some of
the reasons for this point of view in regard to
the Senate. Also, apart from the speech of the
honourable Leader concerning the Senate,
another reason which prompts me to make
these remarks about it is the statement concerning the Upper House, in the document
entitled "Federalism For the Future," to
which the honourable Leader referred at page
46 of our Hansard in his speech on Wednesday last.
That statement certainly contemplates a
study of the role and the powers and possibly
the method of appointment in regard to the
Senate and perhaps other matters concerning
it.
Let me repeat the first paragraph of that
statement, as made by the honourable leader,
and taken from this document, which I quote
from page 46 of our Hansard. This is quoted
merely for the purpose of refreshing the
memory of honourable senators. It says:
It might well be reconstituted-

111

flect better than it does now the regional
interests of our country.
In my view, it is, of course, always appropriate to give thought to a change in the role
and functions of public institutions, seeking
their improvement. It is just as appropriate
for the Senate itself as for the other place, to
seek changes in its own rules for the purpose
of self-improvement. Indeed, I need not
remind you that only a few days ago in this
house there was a motion for the appointment
of our own committee to consider the rules of
the Senate.
In all the writings by responsible persons
on the Canadian Senate, commencing with
the work of Sir George Ross entitled The
Senate of Canada, in 1914, then Professor
Mackay's book The Unreformed Senate of
Canada, 1926, and the somewhat revised edition of 1963, and then Professor Kunz's book
The Modern Senate of Canada, 1963, together
with various writings in learned journals, in
the speeches and writings of some great parliamentary leaders of the past, including
Senators Meighen and Dandurand-in all of
these the view consistently taken has been
that in the British parliamentary system a
second chamber is an essential and integral
part of the democratic process.
Secondly, despite criticism in some quarters that it is a reflection on our democracy
that the Senate should be appointive rather
than elective, nevertheless, the fact is that no
one can point to any occasion when the
Senate of Canada acted as a deterrent to freedom in our type of parliamentary democracy.
In fact, we and others know very well that
Canadian democracy is as free as any in the
world.
Furthermore, it has been consistently pointed out that our particular system of parliamentary and cabinet government would not
lend itself to two elective chambers, one in
competition with the other, as it would to two
chambers working in a co-operative fashion,
one being an appointive Upper House.
I think also that it is generally recognized,
more so in a federal system of parliamentary
government than in an unitary system, that
an upper house such as we have is basic to
the proper functioning of a federal system.

That is, the Senateso as to enable it to play a new role in
representing the federal character of our

SENATE DEBATES
but would he have any special views to
express on this point in connection with the
elective Senate of Australia, which has certain constitutional restrictions placed upon it
but is nonetheless elective.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Well, I do not think
I had better enter into a discussion of that,
one reason being that in my talk tonight I am
trying to be very brief. I am trying to make a
few points extremely briefly. I might say,
however, that it bas been pointed out from
time to time that, in the British Commonwealth, New Zealand is perhaps the only
country in the Commonwealth that is unicameral rather than bicameral. It might be an
answer to the argument that a bicameral system is more functional than any other in a
federal state, to point out that New Zealand is
a unitary state; but it should be said that
that country is not federal in character. It is a
unitary state, and, consequently, I say that is
one of the reasons why New Zealand bas
been able to get along pretty well with a
unicameral parliamentary system.
But my point is that in a federal system a
bicameral parliament is absolutely essential
and there are special reasons for it being so,
namely, the very fact of the federal nature of
that system.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Otiawa Wesi): Hear,
hear.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: And that is one of
the reasons why I say that there are many
arguments against the Upper House in this
country being an elective chamber. Moreover,
those arguments have been made time after
time during the last 100 years, and I know of
no great body of opinion at the moment
which suggests or bas suggested during the
last 20, 30 or 40 years that the Senate should
be an elective body. There have been arguments over the years in regard to it, but
those arguments have never had any great
body of public opinion behind them so far as
I have been able to determine.
It may be truc that over the last hundred years the Senate has not been overly
extended in acting out its function of a protector of regional and sectional rights. But
who can say that the strains and stresses of a
federal system such as we have in Canada
would not have resulted in collapse on many
occasions were it not for the sobering influence of an appointive second chamber.
One vital criticism over the years bas been,
as we all know, that the Senate should
become "modern" in the same way as the

September 24, 1968

courts and some other institutions have been
modernized; namely, that the term of membership should not be for life. That criticism
has now been remedied through a constitutional amendment, and at least it can now be
said that public opinion bas been appeased in
so far as this criticism was valid. I refer, of
course, to the recent constitutional amendment providing for the retirement of senators
at age 75.
I have two or three additional matters to
discuss on the question of Senate change-I
do not like to use the word "reform"-but
these can all, if need be, be achieved without
constitutional amendment. The first is with
reference to standing committees of the
Senate. I would say, first, that the extraordinary success that bas attended the work of
some of our specially appointed committeesand I now refer to such committees as that
which was responsible for the ARDA program and to two or three special committees
that have been chaired by Senator Croll and
others in the last few years-has been that
their members have been selected on the
basis of persons who were, first, knowledgeable in regard to the subject under review and
they were available; that is to say, they were
able to attend meetings with such regularity
that the problem of securing a quorum at all
times was not a deterrent.
I believe there should be a general review
by ourselves of this subject matter with a
view to all committees being composed, to as
large an extent as possible, of persons especially qualified or interested in the subject
matter of each committee.
As an example of what I mean, I do not
believe that the Standing Committee on
External Relations can become as vital a committee as desired by the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Martin) without its
membership being based on a method of
selection of senators who are intensely
interested in foreign affairs and are available
to attend perhaps lengthy committee meetings
on every working weekday.
This is not a new matter. At the instance of
Senator Wishart Robertson, much attention
was given to the question of committee work
in the Senate in 1951. A very complete discussion of this problem is contained in Dr.
Kunz's book in his chapter entitled "The
Committee System of the Senate", commencing at page 233 of that work.
I believe this problem might well be reconsidered now, especially in the light of the
much faster transport to and from Ottawa

Sepitember 24, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

today, and hence the changed pattern in
regard to attendance of senators here, at least
from the point of view of travel time.
Another perennial criticism of the workings
of the Senate has been the tendency of its
weekly sessions to last only from Tuesday
evening till Thursday afternoon. If all the
work of the Senate and its committees can be
done effectively during these brief periods,
well and good. I do know that it is most
difficult to conduct the work of some committees effectively under these circumstances.
Also, I am sure that I step on no one's toes
when I say that no person should, in a day
and age when Canada has become one of the
world's great powers in population and
wealth, accept a summons here unless that
person is willing and able to spend a great
deal of time in Ottawa during sessions of
Parliament. The Senate should not be a
hobby.
There have been times when senators have
complained bitterly of lack of work and,
hence, the necessity for long recesses of the
Senate, but that was at times when Canada
was younger and smaller as a country than
now. Also it was an era before the Senate
assumed its present importance as an agent to
conduct inquiries into various national problems. In fact, we have been very modest in
our failure to advertise the fact that in this
regard, during the last 20 years, the Senate
has assumed a new role by the appointment
of special committees to inquire into various
national problems, some of which would
otherwise have required the enormous
expense of royal commissions. I think that
each of us knows the great expense of royal
commissions today, and this alone could be
the subject of another speech.
I come now to the severest criticism of the
Senate, and one that could become, and
which perhaps at times has been, the greatest
deterrent to the effective performance of its
functions, namely, partisanship, both in
appointments to it and in its workings. Please
do not think that this is a criticism of anyone
here, because if it were, such would apply to
myself and my own colleagues, in exactly the
same way as to others. Also, as you all know,
this problem is not an invention of my own,
but it has been the subject of discussion and
debate for more than 100 years. The Confederation Debates show most clearly the desire
to construct an Upper House which would be,
and remain, largely non-partisan. It certainly
was the hope of the Fathers that such a condition would be achieved.

Professor R. A. Mackay bas this to say on
page 156 of the revised edition of his book
The Unreformed Senate of Canada:
In the first edition of this book I said:
"The most serious objection to the system
of appointments is that it has failed to
give to the members of the Senate the
character of independence of party ties."
I noted that while party lines were more
fluid than in the Commons, and that
while the Senate rarely stood out against
the Government of the day, it justified its
existence as a checking chamber only
when the majority of its members were
of the opposite party to the majority in
the Commons. At other times it was
quiescent. On reconsideration, I am disposed on the whole to agree generally
with these conclusions about the Senate
as it then was (1926).
However, as I am sure we all know, two of
the all-time great leaders in the Senate, Senators Raoul Dandurand and Arthur Meighen,
did all in their power to eliminate a partisan
spirit in the Senate.
I think one of the more interesting quotes
that I have heard was the reported exchange
between Dandurand and Meighen upon the
latter's appointment to the Senate as Leader
of the Government. Meighen is reported as
saying, "Here is my opponent. I hope I am
worthy of your steel." To which Dandurand
replied, "My friend, you are wrong on two
counts. I am not your opponent, and I am not
worthy of your steel." But the fact is that
these two great men were unanimous in the
view, and did everything in their power to
eliminate partisanship in the Senate.
As a corollary to this aspect of the workings of the Senate, it seems to be the
unanimous view of most writers on this subject that one of the great dangers to this body
as an institution would be for it to become
too one-sided or lop-sided as between the two
major political parties in Canada. One Prime
Minister, Mr. St. Laurent, recognized this
problem very clearly, and we are all aware of
the steps that he then took-or did not takein order to keep the Senate in reasonable
balance from a political point of view. I want
to say this, that Mr. St. Laurent was, and is,
a very wise man.
I should like at this point to refer to a
most excellent work entitled Confederation at
the Crossroads by Mr. E. Russell Hopkins,
the Law Clerk of the Senate. I have not
read this book completely. . .

SENATE DEBATES

Our new leader will find here a spirit of
co-operation and a devotion as well as a
unanimous desire to serve the best interests
of Canada.
Congratulations are extended to all the new
senators who will now offer their abilities
and their judgment to the cause of a growing
Canada which we all want ever stronger,
more united and interdependent.
Finally, I shall pause, through respect, to
meditate with you about those that have departed forever, and as a token of gratitude
on behalf of those who have taken leave of
the Senate following remarkable careers. Our
wishes of a long and interesting life are
extended to them.
Mr. Speaker, may I be permitted to congratulate the honourable Senator Lazarus
Phillips and the honourable Senator Raymond
Eudes for their part in moving and seconding
the address. Their ability, their knowledge,
their advice and their judgment so highly
noticed on this occasion are proof that the
Senate of Canada has been remarkably fortunate with their appointment.
[English]
The Senate has valuable legislative and
administrative functions. Amongst the most
important are the protection of the rights of
the minorities and the protection of rights of
the provinces. In my view any consideration
of reforms in the Senate must not lose sight
of these important duties. The honourable
Leader of the Government gave us his views
on possible reforms that the Senate can make
within itself.
Last year, on the invitation of honourable
Senator John J. Connolly, the then Leader
of the Government, many senators submitted
recommendations for internal reforms of the
Senate. It would be good, I believe, to
analyze these again. I believe that the streamlining of the Senate's functions and procedures is constructive and would no doubt,
if intelligently reviewed, add new forces to
our Government. I was most pleased to
hear the hope expressed by the Leader of
the Government in the Senate (Hon. Mr.
Martin) that the Committee on External Relations could be re-inforced and used as a
forum for discussion, as a vehicle to air
views, to make recommendations or implement foreign policies. There is not a better
qualified body in Parliament to do this. In
the two years I have been in the Senate, I
have found that there is here wisdom, pru-

dence, experience, and knowledge in so many
different professional, labour, executive and
business fields. There is an historie role for
all of us to play here this year.
I agree we can ourselves streamline the
Senate to a considerable extent. We can
assume new roles in dealing with federalprovincial problems. We can expedite the
passage of many bills which can be better prepared, discussed and acted upon by a nonelected body of legislators, before being
recommended to the House of Commons.
Honourable senators, we should welcome
the opportunity to be able to work on these
possibilities of reform and thus add to the
benefits deriving from this chamber. What
a great and promising challenge for al of us!
The respect and consideration acquired in
all parts of the world by Canada is the evidence of its past wisdom in its relationship
with all nations. Much of this consideration in
the last few years has been won through the
good offices of our present Leader of the Government in the Senate.
In turn, it has also helped us achieve many
economic goals, the amplification of which is
now needed to create the proper balance of
trade and expand our Canadian prosperity.
It was my privilege in the last three or four
years to travel extensively in many of the
countries in Europe, Asia and Africa. Recently I visited Yugoslavia, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Everywhere I went I felt profoundly and justly proud to be a Canadian.
The high consideration, the perceivable
esteem and the prominent respect that was
extended everywhere made me realize once
again how very fortunate we Canadians have
been, and are still, in our relationship with
our far and near neighbours in this now small
world of ours.
Many people have said to me that they
envied the freedom of Canada. I, for one,
more than before, believe that we, with all
our drawbacks, problems and shortcomings
are-and, I hope, will continue to be-the
freest and most enfranchised nation on the
face of this earth. I believe that the existence
of the Senate, independent as it is of elections, prudent and reserved in its evaluations,
contributed to assuring this to be the freest of
nations on earth.
I explained to many that in my view Canada was not a nation made up of a majority
and minorities, that it was truthfully a nation
of many minorities, living together in this
young and great land of ours, sharing

SENATE DEBATES

vigorously and equally in its challenges, its
opportunities and its aci.ievements. I added
that I was convinced that this disparity
strengthened this young country, made it
more viable and energetic and, more than
anything else, would more and more contribute to its eventual practical unity and
strength.
Honourable senators, in the Speech from
the Throne mention was made of poverty.
Well, poverty has been a basic problem and a
challenge for every nation at any time
through history, from the very start of the
world.
Who are the poor in Canada? Of course,
the materially poor, those who are underprivileged and impoverished, and badly fed,
clothed and housed, are certainly to be found
in Canada as everywhere else.
Thankfully, there are proportionately fewer
of them in this country than in most, but the
situation can still be considerably improved.
We have a human and conscientious duty to
obliterate all of it that we can. There is no
shame for Canadians to admit that such a
problem exists in their midst. There would be
shame for all of us if, having the resources,
the means, and the vehicles to expunge
pauperism and privation, as we evidently
have, we did not act.
It is highly commendable for the 28th Parliament to face this problem and to let Canada's conscience speak up through its Parliament. To preserve the dignity of all involved,
the erasing of Canadian poverty must be
accomplished by the creation of work for
those who are able to work and by assuring
better education for all. We find throughout
the world that wherever there is less work
and limited education-and they go together-there is more poverty. It has been this
way throughout history.
In the last decade or so the rate of growth
of our income in Canada has not been as
large as in ten other countries of this world.
This is not a satisfactory trend for Canadians.
This, moreover, happens to coincide with the
increasing number of the have-nots.
I repeat that the remedy for our Canadian
poverty is, as anywhere else, regular work
for all those who can work. Once obtained
and assured, this will enable every Canadian
to look at his fellow Canadians with dignity
and without the despicable feeling of owing
improved conditions to hand-outs, welfare,
give-aways or favours.
Canada needs to export manufactured and
other products to create the necessary num-

September 24, 1968

ber of jobs. It can only do so if it can produce
at a cost that will allow it to compete with
other trading nations. There is really no
choice. Unless our productivity is good
enough, there can be little hope of realizing
our goals on a continuing basis. This must
be realized fully and at once by both labour
and management. Whenever necessary, proper and daring measures must be implemented
by our Government.
Here again, history should teach us a lesson.
What happened to the formerly greatest trading nation on earth, Great Britain? And why?
What were the factors that gradualiy, since
World War I, destroyed its trade and the
advantageous position it had held? The steady
erosion of its competitive position created the
situation that led to the "dole," an execrable
and demoralizing system of help for the
needy, which in turn led to a great many
other major problems which are even now
being faced. We do not want this to happen in
Canada. We would fail in our duty if we did
not face directly, and now, the vital issue. Oui
employers and employees would also fail in
their duties if they did not face the same
vital issue.
Recent statistics show a widening of the
gap between the haves and have-nots. This is
happening at the same time as our labour
force has been outstripping the number of
available jobs, although our export trade is
said to be good and recently improving. This
gap must be closed as quickly as possible.
This whole situation can be rectified effectively only by providing new markets for Canadian goods thereby ensuring more work for
more Canadians.
There can then be more stimulation internally by supporting other campaigns for
housing and furthering developments in mining, industries and other fields through incentives, if necessary. Competitive pricing only
will really give it to us. Streamlined, the
Senate can help develop far-sightedness in
policies in this field. We can help to provide
this stimulation by looking into the future of
Canada, beyond election time, not being ourselves elected, and acting accordingly. We can
do what must be done, even though it may at
times appear to hurt a little, to assure the
productivity that will give Canadians continued prosperity and diminish rapidly and
surely poverty in our midst. We can do this
without using painful, artificial, expensive
and temporary means. Moreover, such
increased productivity will help to provide
more revenues for the Government.

SENATE DEBATES

We can and should inquire into the causes
of unrest, violence and revolt among students or others in Canada. It is to be noted that
where such turmoil prevails in the world it is
in countries that have made the claim of having better education, better culture and having the best institutions of learning. Why? It
has become a duty to find out. Our Senate
could make this type of inquiry for the
benefit of Canada.
The Speech from the Throne mentions that
.. it would be useful to have available to all
governments an institute where long-term
research and thinking can be carried out into
governmental matters of all kinds." During
the 27th Parliament, the Senate formed a
Special Committee on Science Policy of the
Government. Without reporting on the activities of this committee, it may be stated that a
large number of scientists and researchers,
from our different government agencies and
from those of other countries and from institutions of learning from near and far, presented papers and briefs which have stirred
our deep interest in the future of science in
all fields in Canada. Many now believe our
government agencies have been stimulated by
the inquiries of this committee. Some have
started already to do something about it.
There is much more to be accomplished and
although I feel we have no time to lose, I
believe it would be fruitful to await the farreaching recommendations that are, I believe,
sure to come from this important committee
before legislating on this basic issue.
It was good economics to state in the
Speech from the Throne that "-Government
spending by all level of government cannot
increase faster than productivity". A good
guideline was thus established for the Canadian people and for its Government.
The Government is logical and economically sound in stating that if Canadian productivity is to become internationally competitive, the Government cannot undertake to
increase spending faster than productivity
without hurting production that creates jobs,
and without raising taxes and, I believe,
thereby contributing to some form of infiationary trends.
But with the Government conscious of
these guidelines and these limitations, and
orienting its policies for higher Canadian productivity, the stage is being set for great
strides of progress to be made in Canada. I

believe the Senate will now play an important part in this.
Honourable senators, possibly there are a
few more points I would have wished to
make. However, I believe these can be made
on some other occasion in the near future.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, as I
understand that Senator Stanbury is about to
move the adjournment of the debate, I wonder if I could say, as one who has been here
all day, as have you all, that I am sure the
Canadian people, had they had the opportunity to be here today, would have been greatly
impressed by the high quality of the speeches
we have heard.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Stanbury, debate
adjourned.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators,
before the motion for adjournment is put,
may I ask that Items 3, 4 and 5 stand.
I understand that about six more honourable senators have put their names on the list
to take part in the debate on the address in
reply to the Speech from the Throne. I mention this, not because I wish to discourage
others from taking part in the debate. On the
contrary, I encourage others to take part,
particularly the newer senators. However, I
should think that if this list is the one that
is to stand, we would perhaps finish the
debate on Thursday. In that event we would
proceed, as far as we could, with Items 3,
4 and 5.

reported that the committee had considered
Bill S-2, to amend the Publication of Statutes
Act, and had directed that the bill be reported with the following amendments:
1. Strike out clause 1 and substitute
therefor the following:

the Acts referred to in subsection (1)
shall be printed by the Queen's Printer,
who shall, as soon after the close of each
session as practicable, deliver or send by
post or otherwise the proper number of
copies to' "

therefor:
'11. The Statutes shall be printed in
the English and French languages in such
form, on such paper and in such type and
shall be bound in such manner as the
Governor in Council may prescribe by
regulation.' "
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into
consideration?

September 25, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Mr. Hayden: With leave of the Senate,
I move that this report be adopted now.
Honourable senators, the amendments
made in committee were made after serious
consideration, and I think I should give a
brief explanation of their effect and the need
for them.
I would prefer to deal first with section 2
of the bill in the form in which it was presented in the Senate and came before the committee. It authorized the Governor in Council
by regulation to deal with the printing of the
statutes in the English and French languages
in such form, on such paper and in such type
and to be bound in such manner as those
regulations might prescribe.
That authority was preceded by the words
"subject to this section".
Moving to subsections 2 and 3 of section 2,
legislative direction is given, for instance, as
to the manner in which the marginal notes
would be recorded. It appeared to us that this
is part of the administrative function and it is
also part of the scope of the authority we
have given to the Governor in Council by
regulation to deal with the form and the manner in which the statute should be printed.
If I may direct your attention that there is
nothing in the amendment before us which
specifically says that the English and French
languages shall appear on each page of each
statute. This is a matter which the Governor
in Council will deal with later by regulation,
and we thought that there should be a flexibility to deal with these and other administrative problems which may arise in this new
area of printing of statutes. The authority
should be broader, and there should not be
any directives or limitations that are administrative in character which may be dealt with
by regulation.
Therefore, we decided to strike out subsection 2, which deals with the marginal note.
As to subsection 3, which provides that the
statutes of each session shal be bound, if
practicable and convenient, in one volume,
we felt that this was an administrative matter. My usual complaint in connection with
regulations has been that it is an attempt to
legislate by way of regulation; this time it
would appear that they are trying to
administer by legislation. Therefore, we felt
that subsection 3 should be struck out.
To summarize, the second amendment in
the report today deals with section 2. We
have struck out subsections 2 and 3, removed

from what was subsection 1 the words "subject to this section". As presented to you in
this report, the section reads as follows:
11. The Statutes shall be printed in the
English and French languages in such
form, on such paper and in such type and
shall be bound in such manner as the
Governor in Council may prescribe by
regulation.
We feel that is a broad authority; it is flexible, and it covers every "form" of the printing operation.
Having given that explanation, I move to
the amendment to section 1 of the bill. Section 1 amends subsection 3 of section 10 presently in the Publication of Statutes Act,
which is the part that goes into very considerable detail as to how the Queen's Printer
shall carry on in the course of printing the
statutes.
May I read the part of the section which
clause 1 of the bill repealed, and to which the
committee added something. Subsection 3 of
section 10 of the act read:
3. Copies of the volume or volumes
referred to in subsection (2) shall be
printed, in the English and French languages respectively, by the Queen's
Printer, who shall, as soon after the close
of each session as is practicable, deliver
or send by post or otherwise, in the most
economical manner, the proper number
of copies of the volume or volumes, in
either or both languages as he is directed,
to . . .
That was struck out, and clause 1, as it
appears in the bill, takes its place. We have
disturbed that language only by one amendment which we made by striking out the
words "in the most economical manner". We
felt that it was really flogging economy a
little too far, to suggest that those charged
with the responsibility of administration
should be so directed. Under the scheme as we
now have it, by clause 2 of the bill, the Governor in Council is the person who lays out by
regulation the administration. Therefore, we
must assume that in doing so the officials will
be actuated administratively by the desire to
spend money wisely. If they demonstrate that
they are not able to do that and prove themselves to be bad managers, the matter can be
brought before the Joint Committee on Printing and inquired into, as to whether they
have been spending money wisely or not.
We decided this wording was an unnecessary intrusion and involved a failure to recognize what is real management and what is

SENATE DEBATES
administration. One must assume that the
people who are charged with administration
are capable, until they demonstrate otherwise.
If that happens, we may give them some
legislative direction.
Honourable senators, we went on and discovered another problem. We found that,
having given the Governor in Council the
authority by regulation to prescribe the form
in which the printing shall be done, there
might very well be a conflict in subsection 2
of section 10 of this Publication of Statutes
Act, which is a very old act.
Section 10 provides for the printing of the
annual statutes in two parts, Part I and Part
II, and it prescribes what shall be in Part I,
and other matters. The Governor in Council
determines what is in the public interest for
inclusion in the Statutes of Canada, in proclamations, orders in council, and other publications. It even carries forward one item that
has not much application now, namely, such
acts of the parliaments of the United Kingdom as he may think should be printed.
The only possible publication of that kind
that I can see now would be if a request went
forward from Canada to the Imperial Parliament in respect of an amendment to the
B.N.A. Act, and such Imperial Statute might
be included in our statutes. We did not see it
to be our purpose to study the Publication of
Statutes Act in its entirety, because we would
find some anachronisms and other things outmoded now. That work would be for another
time. But where there appears to be conflict
as between the act and the amendments, we
felt that we should do something about it.
The conflict appears in subsection 2 of section 10 of the Act, where it says that the two
Parts of the annual statutes shall be bound
together in one volume unless it is impracticable and inconvenient to do so. In such case
the Queen's Printer may authorize the Parts
to be bound in two or more volumes.
We were not going to leave it up to the
Queens' Printer to make that decision. The
Governor in Council might make regulations
which conceivably would not be the same.
Why should there be two bases of authority?
Our amendment to section 1 of the bill provides for striking out subsection 2 of section
10, and then carries on as was provided
already in the bill when it was before us,
striking out part of subsection 3. But then we
go on, as I mentioned earlier, and strike out
the additional words in subsection 3 relating
to "in the most economical manner".

September 25, 1968

The view of the committee was unanimous
on these points, not only when we discussed
the matter this morning, but also after taking
time to reflect and coming back to it afler
lunch. The view I think was even stronger at
that time, that while the Publication of Statutes Act is a very old statute, it might well,
in this new approach we are making, be
properly the subject matter of study and
revision. At this time we did not feel that we
should go through the whole act and take the
opportunity for making all necessary corrections. We dealt only with the points that
might impinge on the scope of this bill and
what the legislators were attempting to do
under it, and we were trying to make it as
workable and as flexible as possible.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators,
we are indebted to the Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce for his very lucid and convincing
explanation of the amendments which were
made to this bill in committee. We have now
a much improved bill, and I think the committee did commendable work. I suggest that
we should also give credit to Senator John M.
Macdonald, whose remarks yesterday are
really what instigated the improvement of
this bill.

Report adopted.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Hayden moved that the bill be
placed on the Orders of the Day for third
reading at the next sitting.

SENATE DEBATES
Honourable Senators Phillips (Rigaud) and
Eudes share the gratitude of all honourable
senators for their motion and their addresses.
Senator Phillips and I were sworn into this
chamber on the same day, and he is now my
seatmate. I regard my association with him as
one of my richest experiences in this august
body.
I pause further only to pay tribute to the
Right Honourable Lester B. Pearson, one of
Canada's greatest statesmen and humanitarians. To do him justice, I would need a much
longer speech than that which I propose to
make now, so I will satisfy myself for the
time being by expressing my own gratitude,
as a Canadian, for his continuing lifetime of
service to Canada and to mankind.
If I were to attempt to summarize the
remarks I would like to make to you today, I
would probably do it by asking the question,
"What is happening?" That is the question
which has flown to the lips of every one of
us, as we have seen developing the hippies
and the yippies, the civil rights marchers, the
anti-Vietnam protestors, black power, student
unrest, revolution and counter-revolution.
Canadian students meet to plan strategy.
Demonstrators march outside the Democratic
convention in Chicago. Civil rights workers
organize a march of the poor on Washington.
What is happening? There is a common
thread that runs through all these events, a
thread of disenchantment of the new generation with the institutions, the social mores
and values which have been acceptable to us,
the preceding generations.
My generation's attitudes were established
during the thirties and forties, while we were
adapting to the traumatic experiences of
depression and war. Both tragedies required
the acceptance by our society of regulation
and discipline, if we were to overcome want
and to prevent defeat. But in the course of
that acceptance we rationalized some very
strange attitudes. In the depression we condoned intolerance to save the white man's
job. During the war we condoned killing
because of the threat posed to the whole
world by the Nazis. In politics, because there
were no real answers, we sought safety in
nebulous language. In society we heaped
honour on the industrial and commercial leaders who were the source of jobs, of munitions and endowments, and they became governors of our universities, whether or not
they had any understanding of the educational process.

September 25, 1968

During the fifties an apathy developed as
people realized that the dangers of war and
depression were behind them and as they
saw the advent of the affluent society. There
was apathy about everything, except affluence. Everybody wanted two cars, a television set, a better house, a swimming pool.
But those who cared about religion or politics
or the human values of tolerance and virtue
became fewer and fewer.
The new generation of war babies, who
came of age in the sixties, found themselves
entering a world they could not understand.
They could not understand why universities
were run by an establishment which their
security-conscious parents had found so
necessary. They could not grasp the rationale
which led to members of the human race
killing each other, especially where there was
no threat to a homeland. There was no
acceptable explanation for the proposition
that the black man was somehow inferior to
the white, or that peoples of different culture
and language should vary in their entitlement
to common human rights. And they could not
understand why their political leaders could
not speak to them in direct and simple terms.
The young people were expected to conform to the old standards, but they rebelled.
They said, "This is a phoney world. I cannot
accept the standards of my parents. I have
the right to think out my own standards. I
have the right to develop my own relationships and to help my fellow beings establish
the individualism and the human dignity they
seek."
Some of the things which have been done
in the name of outrage have been outrageous.
The assaults, the burnings, the lootings appall
us. The addiction of some hippies to drugs
and filth and indolence nauseates us. But
these are only the extreme manifestations of
the legitimate struggle of the new generation
to find standards which are as effective for
them in an era of uncertainty as were the
standards of the previous generation in an era
of calamity.
When we ask the question, "What is happening?" it is nearly always accompanied by
a sniff of disapproval. We hear, particularly
in the southern States, the Bible thumpers
saying, "Why cannot these young people
accept the age-old virtues and truths? Why
cannot they be like we were?" The sad fact is
that it is taking this present generation to
pull us back to the age-old truths and virtues.
Their call is for peace, for brotherly love, for
tolerance, for honesty, for human dignity. I
seem to recall another man whose teaching of

September 25, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

these values was cut short by the Cross at the
age of thirty-three.
No, the violence which has accompanied
their actions has not had its source in their
beliefs. The marches of Martin Luther King
were non-violent; but the reaction by the
established generation was not. Always
remember that the militancy of Black Power
came after, not before, the death of Medgar
Evers, the atrocities of Memphis and the
death of John F. Kennedy. But, violence
breeds violence. If the policemen of Chicago,
the sheriffs of Mississippi and the National
Guard in the Watts District of Los Angeles
must wield truncheons, then surely it is not
surprising that the objects of their violence
give vent to their frustrations by responding
in kind.
The trouble is that too often we hide
behind the laws, and forget that law need not
be equated with justice. The law must be
constantly reformed to serve as the tool of
society, not its gaoler. If the lawmakers are
not responsive to the needs of society, and if
society itself has no machinery through which
it can accommodate to progress, then, in a
rapidly changing world, social and political
reforms will be accomplished by violence and
revolution.
Now, I hope that all this does not make you
think I am recommending revolution. What I
am saying is that, unless we understand what
is happening, the constructive potential bursting to be expressed will be subverted by the
organized radicals whose objectives bear no
relationship to democracy. They recognize the
potential for evil. Is our perception to be less
keen in the recognition of the potential for
good? We must find vehicles through which
people can express their hopes and aspirations in a legitimate and constructive way. If
not, our society will head in the same direction as the American society. We too will
suffer unnecessary violence in the name of
justice.
You know, if King George III had not been
so hopelessly stubborn, if he had been willing
to listen, the American Revolution might
never have occurred. If the Czar had shown a
little compassion and understanding, perhaps
the Bolshevik Revolution never would have
happened. It is not the same kind of revolution, nor the same kind of injustice, that we
are looking at today, but those of us who are
middle class middle-aged white Anglo-Saxon
Protestant Canadians are just as smug and
comfortable in our established society as King
George ever was. We are just as reluctant to
see a change in the order of things as the

Czar ever was. Our attitudes are just as bad
as those which are now producing the problems in the United States. When we saw the
French Canadians begin to stir out of their
one hundred years of lethargy and try to
assert the rights they were granted by the
Constitution in 1867, we resented it. We were
happy, when in the recent election, for the
moment at least, it appeared that they had
been persuaded that their aspirations could
be satisfied within Confederation, rather than
in a nation of their own. But have we yet
been prepared to look at the question from
their point of view?
Their forefathers came to Canada three
hundred years ago. They huddled in villages
along the rivers for protection from the Indians, and developed an attachment for family
and village life which has been the foundation for a truly Canadian culture, indigenous
to Canada and arising out of the specific
problems of Canadian pioneer life. They were
relatively satisfied with their family and community life, leaving the larger matters of
provincial and federal considerations to a political elite and to the English-speaking commercial and industrial community. But then
came the technological revolution. They saw
the world on television. They questioned their
traditional attitudes, and saw that they were
far behind as Canadians in Canada.
Let us put ourselves in their shoes. Suppose
we were a conclave of six million Anglo-Saxons living in a corner of a continent overrun
by 200 million Frenchmen, where commerce
and industry were controlled by them. Suppose we could not do business in our own
capital without speaking French. Suppose we
found ourselves members of a French commonwealth, expected to pledge allegiance to
the President of France-especially to the
present incumbent of that office. I suspect we
would be a little defensive, a little jealous of
our own heritage, a little reluctant to be
absorbed, body, soul, language, and culture,
into the seething French mass.
And if we think the problem has gone
away, we are very far wrong. The only way
in which we can make the problem go away
is by helping them feel that they are in fact a
part of the Canadian nation, that we in fact
regard them as our brothers, that they can in
fact go anywhere in Canada, either on a visit
or to live, and feel at home with their
English-speaking Canadian brothers.
We are inclined to have the same supercilious attitude toward the poor people of Canada. A professor from the United States asked
me the other day where he could find some

SENATE DEBATES

slums in Toronto. I told him that I would
have difficulty showing him slums of the kind
that were common in New York or Chicago.
But I had to confess, after reading the report
of the Economic Council, that there was
plenty of evidence that the poor are still with
us, and that all our efforts to provide social
security have merely put a floor under poverty and have never succeeded in attacking
poverty itself.
We are in danger of extending our indifference to the young people of Canada. No one
should be talking about burning universities,
but someone should be talking with youth
about their anxieties and their aspirations.
They are undoubtedly the brightest generation of Canadians yet, and they face Canada's
second century with great expectations. It
was they who crowded 40,000 strong into
Queen's Park in Toronto on the eve of Centennial year. It was they who jammed Nathan
Phillips Square-and, yes, even Yorkville-and sang "Happy Birthday, Dear Canada". It
was they who responded to the offer of a high
school newspaper to provide a series of articles called "Your Canada" by ordering 700,000
copies. It is they who are impatient with the
humbug of our society, and who seek to drag
us by the scruffs of our necks, kicking and
screaming, into our second century, in a
country they know to be capable of an excellence never yet experienced by any nation in
the world.
We have to find a way to listen to them, to
understand them, and to help them. As for
me, I am glad to commit my welfare to this
bright, informed and idealistic generation.
The problem is that all of these groupsthe French, the poor, the young, and indeed
the hundreds of thousands of people all across
Canada who showed such a surge of interest
in public affairs during the recent electionneed some vehicle for the expression of their
hopes and aspirations. Only if we can provide
it will we avoid the demonstrations and the
violence that are generated by the frustrations caused by lack of understanding and
resistance to legitimate change.
It is this fact which escaped the attention
of those who claimed that the Prime Minister
was not talking policy during the election
campaign. It is this fact which still escapes
those who say the Throne Speech is lacking
in particulars.
The Prime Minister was talking hard policy; the only policy which matters right now
to the people of Canada. He makes no oldtime political promises. He off ers no panaceas.

September 25, 1968

He pledges himself and his Government to
work, and work hard, in concert with the
people of Canada to reorganize government
institutions, reappraise our economic and
social positions, and set new goals as we cross
the threshold of our second century.
Our political institutions must have a closer, more direct relationship with the peopleand that is true alike of cabinet, members of
Parliament, senators and political parties.
A few years ago one would have left political parties out of that list. But now they are
able to play their most significant role. The
Mother of Parliaments began 700 years ago,
but there was no real democracy until there
were political parties. The breakthrough came
with the concept of a Loyal Opposition. It
was realized that controversy was constructive, and that you did not have to shoot or
hang or crucify every one who had a different
point of view. So the political party became
the basic unit of democracy. In our society it
has never, until now, become credible as a
basic vehicle of democracy.
Until ten years ago political parties in
Canada were as much of a closed shop as the
Democratic party in the United States
appeared to be in its convention in Chicago,
but in recent years Canadian political parties
have begun to develop into mass parties with
broader and broader participation by the
public. With the interest excited in people
during the recent election we now have an
opportunity, not only to open the doors of the
political parties but to go into the street and
give the people an opportunity to express
their concerns.
Everyone feels himself surrounded by government, much of which he does not understand and to which he has no access. Only
well-run and well-motivated political institutions can set up an effective two-way system
of communications between individual and
government to break down that wall of frustration. This is the kind of institution we
must try to build here in the Senate, in the
House of Commons and in our political parties. My chief concern is that we may not be
equal to that opportunity. If that should be
the case, we will not preserve unity in Canada; our poor will continue in poverty and
worst of all our young people who saw politics as an exciting vehicle of participation during the recent election will become disenchanted and put their faith in demonstrations
and violence.
So that is what must happen in Canada
today. Political institutions must come of age

Septernber 25, 1868

SENATE DEBATES

by throwing their arms wide open and inviting the people of all means and callings to
participate, to involve themselves in their
own political process, to understand each other, and to understand the need for constant
reform to keep our political institutions in
tune with a rapidly changing society.
We are probably the most fortunate people
on this earth, but even we have many problems. Honourable senators, there is no magie
solution to those problems, but the solutions
can be found if we work together, if we do
not entrench our minds in prejudices and outworn values, if we open our minds to legitimate progress, through constructive expression of our own aspirations and recognition of
the aspirations of others.
Hon. Douglas D. Evereil: Honourable senators, I did not intend to take part in the
debate on the Address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne, for there are many better
qualified than I in this chamber to do just
that. However, I feel it encumbent upon me
in all humility, because the speech has engendered so much violent criticism among the
members of the press and certain members of
Parliament, to attempt in some small way to
delineate the favourable aspects of the
speech. What is it that bothers the crities
about this Speech from the Throne? I suggest
to you that what bothers them is that it is a
speech of promise rather than a speech of
promises. This is a new approach that they do
not understand. I wonder what else they
could have expected, for if they are confounded by this speech then they must have
closed their minds to the thrust of Canadian
politics over the last few months. This Government went to the people and it spoke of a
just society and it said, because of its people,
the size of its population, the enormity of its
resources and its geographical position, Canada could attain that just society more likely
than any other nation on earth. That was the
goal they put before the Canadian people, but
what they promised was a long hard road to
that goal, and the people listened, and they
gave this Government a mandate.
Honourable senators, this speech is the first
step in that long hard road for it lays the
foundation for a just society, but it avoids the
cruel and deluding promise that such a society can be achieved overnight.
I would like to examine briefly with you
just how the Speech from the Throne accomplishes this end. First of all it says we must
put our house in order. If any honourable
senator were to assume the control of an

enterprise I am sure he would have in mind
goals for that enterprise. But first he would
make sure that he laid the foundation on
which those goals could be achieved. While it
might be thrilling for a spectator to watch a
climber cross a crevasse without any forethought, a climber is more likely to achieve
the top of the mountain if he has checked his
equipment, his route, and made sure that his
pitons are secure.
How does this speech put our house in
order? First of all, it undertakes to clean up
the backlog of legislation left over from the
last Parliament. Secondly, it undertakes to
reform the rules and procedures of Parliament so that Parliament will be closer to the
people and will be able to proceed at a speed
that is more in conformity with modern society. It undertakes to complete the reorganization of government departments, and most
important it sets the economic base upon
which the just society can be built.
I agree wholeheartedly with the apt metaphor of the dinner table spoken of by Senator
Phillips (Rigaud) in his brilliant speech. A
growing productive base is society's best guarantee that there will be the fair distribution
which is the hallmark of a just society.
But this Speech from the Throne does more
than just lay the base; it actually makes a
start on the just society for it talks of unity,
regional development, international trading,
finance and co-operation. It undertakes to
review external and defence policies and it
attempts to ensure a greater participation of
the people in the workings of government.
I agree with the critics of the speech that it
has weaknesses. If a Speech from the Throne
is a charter of the Government's intentions,
then I would hope that it would be in more
poetic language. I perhaps would have liked
to have seen a more precise definition of the
just society. But if has a palpable strength,
for it tells it as it is and that is
what the people want. The people are tired of
cruel and deluding visions of something that
cannot be attained. In their hearts I believe
that people know what is meant by a just
society. What they really want to see is the
route to that society and, honourable senators, this Speech from the Throne shows them
the way. It is a speech of reality. It is a
speech of promise. And when the undertakings of this speech have been fulfilled it will
give rise to a great Throne Speech, one that
will be great because it will speak of a just
society that is within our immediate grasp.

Hon. Mr. Martin: Not very long ago.

Hon. Mr. Willis: At that time, in his third

year in law school, he evidenced some facets
of what he would be in the future. During his
third year, he took time off to run as a Liberal candidate in a provincial by-election,
against a very formidable opponent who at
that time was the treasurer of Ontario, the
honourable E. A. Dunlop. That contest took
place in the County of Renfrew. My colleague
and friend lost that election, but he showed
the way for statesmanship and the courage
that he had in his mind, and in his body, and
in his soul that, while he was still a student,
he would bear the banner of his party in an
election campaign.
It was not very many years later that he
won a seat in the other place and held it from
1935 until just recently, when he did not contest the seat. I am told by friends of mine and
his in Windsor, that if he did contest that seat

do so. I applaud him wholeheartedly. I
believe he has the high qualities of his predecessor, Mr. J. F. MacNeill; and, if so, this
house has nothing to fear. His actions to date
lead me to say that he is a worthy successor.
I also wish to mention the Honourable Sydney Smith, who was Speaker of this house

SENATE DEBATES

Now, honourable senators, we have had
many speeches on the Speech from the
Throne in the past, and with your permission
I will digress from that subject and speak of
an interparliamentary trip to Washington,
D.C., that I was fortunate enough to go on in
March of this year. The heads of that delegation were supposed to be the Honourable
Sydney Smith, the Speaker of this chamber at
that time, and the Honourable Mr. Lucien
Lamoureux, the Speaker of the other chamber. Unfortunately, Senator Smith was unable
to attend because of ill health, and the Speaker of the other place was unable to attend
because the other place was sitting at the
time. But appointed to head our delegation to
Washington was the honourable Senator Alan
Macnaughton, who did a very admirable job.
I think the congratulations of this house are
due to him for the excellent way in which he
performed his duties.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Willis: Of course, the one man
who is welcomed in Washington, or anywhere
in the United States for that matter, is our
own Senator Grattan O'Leary, because of his
Irish wit and the sparkle in his eye.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Oi±awa West): Hear,
hear.
Hon. Mr. Willis: You were not here when I
spoke about you, Senator Connolly.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Otawa West): You
would not have said those things about me.
Hon. Mr. Willis: The sparkle in his eye
even attracted the mini-skirters. He is a wonderful man to have in a delegation representing Canada. Down there he really is called
"Mr. Canada", and in the opening proceedings when the Secretary of State, Dean Rusk,
was addressing the joint delegation, Senator
Grattan O'Leary's name was mentioned and
everyone wanted him to speak. But in his
usual modesty he declined. However, I must
say that he did not decline all the offers that
were made to him and we all had a very
enjoyable time.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Otawa West): Either
you have said too much or too little on that
point, senator.
Hon. Mr. Willis: I think I have said enough,
and I leave the rest to the imagination,
Senator Connolly.
I do want to outline in brief that this was
the eleventh interparliamentary conference

September 25, 1968

between Canada and the United States. Their
delegation was headed by Senator Aiken of
Vermont, who, I understand from Senator
O'Leary, was offered the nomination for the
Senate in the coming election, by both the
Democrats and the Republicans. I also want
to say that if Grattan O'Leary lived in the
United States he could be elected President
this year by acclamation. Unfortunately, he is
barred because he was born in Gaspé, and I
am not even so sure how his Irish, like that
of Senator Connolly, would go down. But he
is indeed very popular.
We were greeted by the Secretary of State,
Dean Rusk, in the old Supreme Court building. By the way, their buildings are much
older than ours, though they do have a new
Supreme Court building now. At any rate, we
were addressed by Mr. Rusk, and then we
broke into two very important committees,
one on Economics and another on Military
Affairs.
Senator Lang, Senator Macnaughton and I
and some members from the other place were
on the Economics Committee. We had three
very lively sessions, at which we discussed
the economic problems which presented
themselves to us and to the United States of
America. We discussed the wheat agreements,
the automobile agreement which we have,
and everything of an economic nature that
pertained to the interests of both countries.
I might say that our interests are not all
the same. On certain points we differed with
our colleagues down there, but such was the
relationship among us all that it could not
have been more co-operative or more
educational.
The other day the Leader of the Government in the Senate suggested in his speech
that we should have conferences on external
affairs. I say that we should have them on
other subjects as well. The only time a senator here really gets briefed by anyone, by any
Cabinet minister, by any person, or by the
departments, is when he is going on a trip
and participate in some conference. That is
wrong. I think we should run a series of
committees so that every senator would be
briefed on all of the problems and all of the
agreements that we have, particularly with
the United States but including other countries as well.
I think that is what we lack, and, as Senator O'Leary said in his remarks on the Speech
from the Throne, we are subject to bureaucrats to a certain extent up here, and we only
see them on such occasions as when they
come to brief us.

September 25, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

I am not detracting from their importance
or from their ability; I am not detracting
from their standing in the Public Service of
this country. But what I am saying is that I
think they should be made to pay more attention to senators and to explain from time to
time certain of the problems which they have
to face. I do not mean that they should give
away any Government secrets or anything
like that, but we must become more familiar
with certain topics, and I think that is the
only way in which to do so.
I know that Senator Macnaughton, as the
leader of our delegation last March, soon will
table before this house the lengthy report
which I now hold in my hand and which has
been submitted to him and to the chairman
from the other place. I hope each honourable
senator will read it, and not just lift up the
lid of his desk, put it in and forget all about
it. It is a good report.
I must say also that the two public servants
who represented the parliamentary association, Mr. Ian Imrie and Miss Jean Macpherson, did a marvellous job in making arrangements for us. To them we say a welldeserved thank you. I understand that is
what they are doing all the time. It had not
been my pleasure to meet them before being
briefed on this occasion. I think they too
should come before some of the Senate committees from time to time and tell us of their
experiences. They have just come back from
Lima, where they had a vast amount of
experience and I think all honourable senators should have the benefit of that experience.
The evening we arrived in Washington the
entire delegation, both Canadian and American, was received by the Canadian Ambassador, Ambassador Ritchie. After we had
finished our business in Washington, we went
to New Orleans, just to look around, and
there we were welcomed by Dr. R. G. MacNeill and his wife. Dr. MacNeill is Canadian
Consul in New Orleans and is a brother of
John F. MacNeill, our former Clerk in this
house. We were received in grand style, and I
think all our representatives are doing a
grand job there.
I want to come back now to the Speech
from the Throne and in a very few minutes
say something I have long been wanting to
say. I have heard a number of speeches about
Senate reform in the course of this debate on
the Throne Speech. If this Senate needs
reform, it should be reformed from within
the chamber itself. In my view the people
who are responsible for the Senate having a
29234-9

name that is not complimentary at times to
senators are the senators themselves. We
must take the blame. Why should we not
have a publication inserted in the daily
papers across this country setting out the
number of committees which were published
in the Senate Hansard the other day and setting out the names of the committees and the
names of the people serving on those committees. I am asked by people from Toronto, as I
am sure other senators are, "What do you do
down there?" In answer we just shrug our
shoulders. Very few people are aware of the
work done, for example, by Senator Roebuck
in the Divorce Committee, a volume of work
equalled by very few Canadians, and the
more remarkable when one considers his age.
As I say, the people in my area do not know
about the work being done, and I am sure the
same applies in many other areas.
Who is better able to criticize this body
than we ourselves? We do not have to face
the electorate and we do not have to face
constituents. We do not have to be careful
about what we say concerning legislation
because of political considerations; we can
say what we think and what our hearts dictate. This is something we should keep in
mind.
We have no publicity at all; we seldom see
anything about the Senate in the newspapers.
If you pick up the Toronto Globe and Mail or
the Montreal Gazette or any other newspaper,
you will see reports as to what has happened
in the other place, particularly so far as questions and answers are concerned. What mention does one see of the Senate? Another fact
that we should keep in mind is that this is a
quasi nonpartisan body, and that being the
case we are in a better position then anybody
else to reform the Senate ourselves and to let
the people know what the Senate is doing.
What do they know of our committee meetings every morning we are here? What will
they know of the work done by the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce this
morning? Yet that work involved much serious thinking on the part of the wise men who
sit here. Something should be done to get it
across to the public that we do not just come
here, sit in our offices, put our feet on the desk
and smoke a cigar and say, "We have made
our attendance at the Senate", and disappear
for the rest of the day.
Another thing that the people do not know
is that we have a tally here. If we miss 21
days here we are charged $120, $60 of this
being tax-free money. This is not the case in

SENATE DEBATES
the other place, but the people of Canada do
not know that. Of course I should add that if
we are absent through illness we are not
charged this amount. Otherwise, if we lose 21
days of attendance this charge is made. Yet
you see in the newspapers in Toronto and
Montreal and elsewhere that so many members were present in the other place and so
many were absent. It very seldom happens
that a large number of senators is absent
from this chamber. I would add that it is not
because of the penalty alone that senators are
conscientious in their attendance in this
chamber but also because they have a sense
of their duties and their responsibilities.
Honourable senators, I hope I have succeeded in making my points clear. As I have
said, I feel we should have more committee
meetings and that we should encourage public
servants to come and talk to us. Furthermore,
we should keep in mind that we have three
Independent members in this chamber and
with these and the semi- or quasi bipartisan
group we have here, why should we not be
able to reform this institution ourselves and
find some way to make known to the people
of Canada what the Senate is doing, and that
it is composed of honest, sincere men of
integrity who are willing to do the work that
is allotted to them.
Hon. Eric Cook: Honourable senators I
hesitate to thrust myself upon you for the
reason there is little I can contribute to the
excellent debate which we have so far
enjoyed. However, I understand that we are
not pressed for time, so, therefore, my few
remarks will not have the effect of unduly
delaying the Senate.
First, let me extend to His Honour my very
warm congratulations on his appointment as
Speaker. The Senate is indeed fortunate to
obtain the services of our distinguished colleague. As Deputy Leader of the Government
he had already gained our trust and respect,
and I know we all wish him a happy and
pleasant term of office as our Speaker.
We are also most fortunate in the appointment of Hon. Paul Martin as Government Leader. As someone has already
remarked, the loss suffered by the other place
is our gain. His skill as a debater is outstanding indeed, but in addition he has always
demonstrated great leadership qualities. He
has what might be termed a forward-looking
philosophy of life. His leadership as Minister
of National Health and Welfare put that
department of the Government right abreast
if not ahead of most other countries in that

September 25, 1968

field. His work as Secretary of State for
External Affairs confirmed Canada in the
respect of the Western World, and I was indeed
delighted to hear that he hopes, with the cooperation of his colleagues in the Senate, to
carry on his work in the field of foreign
affairs.
Not being in the habit of speaking too
often, I do not think that I have congratulated
Senator Flynn from my place in the Senate,
although, of course, I have shaken his hand
and wished him well. I think so well of Senator Flynn's abilities that I must keep my
fingers crossed should he and my own leader
have occasion for disagreement. In such an
event, I may not be able to hope for Senator
Flynn's being too successful, but, no doubt,
be will acquit himself well with or without
my good wishes.
Finally, may I extend a word of welcome
and goodwill to all new senators. Particularly,
of course, do I welcome my colleague Senator
Petten. Many of you will remember his
father, Senator Ray Petten, who was also a
very good friend of mine. I am sure that, like
his father, the present Senator Petten will be
a well-liked, well-respected and hard-working
member of this chamber.
I want to say a word about our former
Leader, Senator John Connolly, and our former Speaker, Senator Sydney Smith. I was
going to begin by saying that not all changes
are improvements. However, if I say that, His
Honour and the Government Leader will be
vexed, so I will try a somewhat different
approach. I join with all honourable senators
in wishing Senator Smith well, and in thanking him for the kindly and able manner in
which he presided over the Senate while our
Speaker.
I would like to say a special word of thanks
to Senator Connolly for his never-failing
kindness and courtesy, particularly to those
of us who started as "new boys" during his
leadership. The work of the Senate went so
easily and so smoothly under his direction
that few of us realized the great amount of
thought and planning involved in his work,
and few of us always appreciated his great
good humour and tact.
The debate immediately prior to my rising
has been of a high order, and in particular I
do congratulate the mover and seconder, to
both of whom we are indebted for two excellent speeches. I know that we all wish to hear
more from these honourable gentlemen, and
there are many subjects which will come
before the Senate on which they will be able
to make valuable contributions.

September 25, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Honourable senators, in my view the
Speech from the Throne is a statesmanlike
document. Having been successful in an
appeal to the electorate and having a majority Government for the first time since 1958,
the Prime Minister must have been tempted
to jump on his horse and ride off in all directions. I feel sure we are all encouraged by the
fact that the Government has faced up to the
facts. The Speech indicates that the Government is aware that everyone has "great
expectations" as to what this Parliament will
produce. But rather than encourage unfounded expectations, or cause false hopes, the
Speech outlines in sober, matter-of-fact words
the absolute necessity of first completing the
now unfinished work before Parliament, and
then the need to plan for the new programs to
come. However, the work now before Parliament, although not new, is very important
and will have far-reaching consequences.
The improvement of parliamentary rules
and procedures is something the people of
Canada would like to see effected without too
much more delay. Indeed, when one contemplates the many items facing Parliament and,
at the same time, bears in mind the numerous
matters which engage the attention of all
members-some of which are important ones
of principle, in addition to the many minor
details of a more or less housekeeping nature
-it becomes clear that the volume of the
nation's business cannot be handled under
rules and customs in force in previous centuries. Parliament can no longer serve as a
stage on which one or more stars score debating points off their opposite numbers.
If, therefore, the present session can complete all or most of the program outlined in
the Speech from the Throne-including, in
particular, parliamentary reform and the current amendments to the Criminal Code-it
will have served the nation well and will also
have cleared the decks for further reform of
general application.
As I have said before, I was particularly
interested in the able speech made by the
honourable the Leader of the Government,
and do hope the Senate will avail itself of the
opportunity, because of his presence, to take
more interest in foreign affairs.
This has been my conviction for some time.
Indeed, when I reported to the Senate on
January 22 last on the Thirteenth Annual
Conference at Brussels of NATO Parliamentarians, I urged the Senate to take this
29234-9à

course. I closed my remarks at that time by
saying:
Would it not assist in the formation of
a sound public opinion, in the field of
foreign policy, if the External Affairs
Committee of the Senate invited evidence
and opinions on these important matters,
and then made a reasoned and documented report to the Senate? The report of
the committee would then be the subject
matter of a Senate debate.
It seems to me that this chamber might
well perform a worthwhile service if we
devoted more attention to Canada's
foreign policy.
Unfortunately, I was not able to hear the
most informative speech made by the honourable Senator Cameron, but I have read it
with very great interest, and I do congratulate him on the most interesting portion in
which he dealt with the present difficult position in some universities. I agree with his
observations and conclusion in this part of his
speech. However, notwithstanding the very
great respect I have always had for his views,
I cannot agree with some of his observations
on foreign affairs. In part he said:
For years Canada has encouraged selfdetermination, and has supported the
rights of minorities. Yet, in this case we
have let the legal fiction that we cannot
interfere in the affairs of a Commonwealth partner prevent any effective
action.
In my opinion, non-interference in the
affairs of other nations is a cardinal principle
of international law and, therefore, it is not
correct to say that we cannot do so because of
a "legal fiction."
On the other hand, Senator Grattan
O'Leary has a different opinion, and he said:
I submit again that this little country
has no right to interfere in the domestic
affairs of other countries.
I must confess I am more in agreement, in
this instance, with Senator O'Leary than with
Senator Cameron. However, I merely refer to
the remarks of these two distinguished senators to illustrate how easy it would be to have
a really good exchange of views in this chamber. Such an exchange-based on a report
which, in turn, had been prepared after the
Standing Committee on External Relations
had heard witnesses well versed in the problem under discussion-would surely be of
great help in reaching a better understanding,

THE LATE FRANCIS DANIEL
JOHNSON, P.C.
PREMIER OF THE PROVINCE
TRIBUTES

OF QUEBEC

[Translation]

Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, it
is with deep regret that J learned, as we all
did, the news of the premature death of
Premier Daniel Johnson.
The Province of Quebec-and all of Canada-has just lost a great servant. I do not
hesitate to say that all Canadians, and specially those of the Province of Quebec,
regardless of race, creed or political allegiance, mourn his loss.
Daniel Johnson served his province and his
country with great distinction. He devoted a
good part of his life to politics and, in the last
few years, the heavy burden of his responsibilities doubtless contributed to his premature and tragic death which deprives the people of his province of a devoted political
leader.
While fighting tenaciously for the interest
of his province, Mr. Johnson gave great
importance to the preservation of national
unity. Even yesterday, in his press conference, he reaffirmed his faith in the future of
Canada and his desire to sec the rights of
English and French-speaking Canadians guaranteed within the Confederation.
To his wife and his family, I extend the
condolences of my colleagues in the Senate, to
which I add the expression of my own deep
sympathy.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, one can never say it often enough, for it
is the truth: public life is exacting.
In recent years, I often heard that the function of Premier of Quebec had become
extremely difficult and exacting, even more
perhaps than that of Prime Minister of Canada, because of tensions prevailing in Quebec
and problems which that province's government had to face and to solve. Is that why
three Quebec Premiers have died while in
office since 1959?

September 26, 1968

The death of Daniel Johnson affects me
deeply, because we had been friends since
our university days. Already at that time, as
president of the general students association
of the University of Montreal, he gave every
sign that he would have an exceptional political career.
For all Canadians, the circumstances surrounding his death are especially moving. On
the day after his press conference heard
across Canada and which was directed not
only to the people of his province but to the
entire country, he died in Manic. This event
reminds us of the death of Mr. Duplessis at
Schefferville, a locality also situated in northern Quebec where a remarkable development
of tremendous resources is taking place. This
sudden death also reminds us of the abrupt
demise of honourable Paul Sauvé a few
months after Mr. Duplessis' death.
On the political plan, in Quebec as well as
across Canada, the events leading to Mr.
Johnson's death offer some food for thought.
On coming back to his office and resuming
his task after two and half months of convalescing, he was resuming a study of those
problems of a very complex and serious
nature that have been stirring for some
months the public opinion in Quebec and in
Canada.
Those who heard him yesterday on television could see that Daniel Johnson believed in
the future of Canada. They could appreciate
that he was willing to do everything within
his power to hunt for solutions to outstanding
problems and to promote a spirit of understanding sought by all the ethnic groups that
make up our country.
As reported in today's newspapers, he had
given public opinion some reassurance, not
only in Quebec but outside its boundaries. We
were already looking forward to a real
improvement towards realizing the objectives
of the 'bonne entente'.
On the day of his sudden disappearance
from public life, two main qualities of Daniel
Johnson must be recognized: in the first
place, his courage; anybody else under the
circumstances last year would have merely
bowed himself out. He came back without
any hesitation; moreover, his appearance on
TV at the press conference yesterday was an
exceptionally brave deed.
In the second place, I wish to mention his
diplomacy. He succeeded in conciliating
some apparently contradictory views by seeking an honourable compromise for all concerned. He held his own opinions, but let it

Septernber 26. 1968

SENATE DEBATES

never be said that he did not respect the
opinions of other people. He will be remembered as an eminent politician who had a
useful career in his province and in his country. I hope that his memory will enable his
successors to keep Quebec policies on a
course leading toward a joint solution of Quebec and Canadian problems.
On my behalf and in the name of my colleagues, I offer my deepest sympathy to Mrs.
Johnson, whom have I known for a long
time, and to her children.
[English]
Hon. Allisier Grosart: Honourable senators,
when I saw the flag on the Peace Tower at
half mast this morning I had a strange sense
of foreboding, having watched Premier
Daniel Johnson on television last night in
what was probably one of the great moments
of a great career. Little did I dream that it
meant the passing of a friend for, like the
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Flynn), I make bold to say that I had the
privilege of calling Daniel Johnson my friend.
I had not seen as much of him in recent
years as I had in earlier days, but each meeting I had with him reassured me that he
retained his continuing and abiding faith in a
Canadian solution to the riddle of Confederation that occupied his greatest years.
He believed in the concept of a Quebec
nation, but he always insisted to me that even
in English conversation and in this context,
the word nation should be given the French
pronunciation rather than the English. He
used to say to me that the two words are not
the same. It is one of the tragedies of our
time that we cannot get everybody to understand that simple fact. I remember him saying:
"Some day I am going to convince my Englishspeaking Canadian friends that there is nothing whatsoever incongruous in the concept of
a Quebec nation within and part of a Canadian nation."
I first met Premier Daniel Johnson a good
many years ago. He had just returned from a
Commonwealth Parliamentary Association
conference which I believe was held in New
Zealand. He was bubbling with enthusiasm
about what he had seen and heard and
learned from his colleagues about the parliamentary process in other countries. He was
also enthusiastic about a new-found friend.
He said, "I learned more from that man in a
month about the real meaning of democracy,
during the time I spent with him, that in all
the years I spent at school and college." He
was referring to an Opposition member of the

main Canadian branch delegation, now the
Right Honourable J. G. Diefenbaker, for
whom, like so many other Canadians, Dan
Johnson's respect and admiration increased
measurably with the years.
To some, I know there were apparent contradictions in his public political postures, but
he was aware of this, aware, I know, that it
stemmed from a deep inner dilemma, a
dilemma that perhaps can only be understood
by that very small handful of Canadians who
have the unique distinction that he had, of a
deep understanding of the English and the
French culture and a love of the French and
English languages.
I was often amazed at his knowledge of
English literature. I remember one day in my
home he took down from the shelf a copy of
The Pilgrim's Progress. As he opened it and
looked through the pages, and speaking in
that charming bantering way of his, he said:
"The pages of this book have become very
dirty; you must believe in the old Puritan
boast, 'A clean sword and a dirty Bible' ". He
added, "I must read that book again, because
it is one of the greatest books that I have
ever read."
Honourable senators, this morning I took
that volume down again and it fell open, perhaps not altogether by accident, at that wonderful account of the passing of Valiant-forTruth. The words I read there seemed, to me
at least, a fitting epigraph for the passing of
this great Canadian:
My sword I give to him that shall succeed
me in my pilgrimage, and my courage and
skill to him that can get it. My marks and
scars I carry with me, to be a witness for
me that I have fought his battles who now
will be my rewarder.
And John Bunyan's words go on:
When the day that he must go hence was
come, many accompanied him to the riverside, into which as he went he said: 'Death
where is thy sting?' And as he went down
deeper, he said: 'Grave, where is thy victory?' So he passed over, and all the trumpets sounded for him on the other side.
Honourable senators, I predict that as the
years go on, the trumpets will sound for
Daniel Johnson again, on this side. They will
sound more loudly, as Canadians come to
understand him and to understand the tremendous contribution that he made to the
preservation of our unity.
He was willing to be misunderstood, to be
misinterpreted, particularly by those who had

SENATE DEBATES

September 26, 1968

not his political skill, his mental and physical
courage to grapple honestly, yet realistically,
with this great problem. He said that lie was
prepared to be judged by the end result.
Honourable senators, if the end result of his
labours is, as I believe it will be the preservation of the union, then surely the name of
Daniel Johnson will be rewarded a very
special place among those who in time will be
called the saviours of Confederation.
I join with others in expressing to the
members of his family my deep sense of sympathy and shock. We all know what his passing means to Canadians and to Canada, but
only those who knew the love of this lovable
man for his family will understand how great
is the loss to them.

the breadth of his vision and the truly patriotic attachment which he held for the Dominion of Canada, the people of his country and,
particularly, for the province to which he
belonged. He was, as Senator Grosart has
intimated, in a difficult position because he
had a highly nervous and intense population
with which to deal. They were roused, as I
think they should be, and we should understand it, about the situation in which they are
now placed.
I was delighted with the attitude of the
man as he attempted very quietly indeed to
pour oil on the troubled waters, to instill the
idea of moderation into the words of those
who are indeed not very moderate. He was a
true Canadian patriot and I think a very
capable, moderate, highly intelligent and brilHon. W. M. Benidickson: Honourable sena- liant patriot. It may be a long time before we

at this untimely time.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I too would like to say a word on this
occasion, although I have not prepared
remarks so eloquent or so timely as my colleague across the floor, Senator Grosart.
I knew Daniel Johnson a good many years
ago. I met him on that occasion which Senator Grosart has mentioned, the assembly of
the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association
in New Zealand in 1950. I was chairman of
that convention and I had an opportunity to
listen to Mr. Johnson on several occasions.
Even better, so far as our friendship was
concerned, he and I on at least one occasion,
and possibly two, addressed the people of
New Zealand on radio. I was impressed, and
I still am, with his qualities of mind and
heart and kindness of thought as lie told the
people of our sister dominion the advantages
of a democratic government. We formed a
friendship at that time and it never ceased.
As I listened to him last night I was again
impressed with the kindness of his thought,

[Translation]
Hon.

Maurice

Lamontagne:

Honourable

senators, a few years ago I read a novel
by Hugi McLennan on the two solitudes
which exist, or have been in existence for
some time, in the province of Quebec
between the English Canadians and the
French Canadians. Personally, after having
devoted several years to the study of the
French Canadian society, I also thought that I
had discovered a second dimension to those
two solitudes and that is why, during these
last few years, I have regretted deeply the
increasing gap which developed within the
French Canadian society itself, between the
so-called elite and the French Canadian people. If we go back to the years 1820, to the
Papineau years and later, we notice that several French-Canadian leaders have made an
honest attempt I am sure, at exploiting the
feelings of the French-Canadian people without a clear understanding of their long term

September 26, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

interests. We can see that the French Canadian elite worried much too much rather about
the problems of their class and their group,
than about the long-term interests of
Quebecers.
Honourable senators, you may be thinking
that these considerations have little to do
with the tribute we are paying today to a
famous man, the late Daniel Johnson. Yet I
feel that he was one of our political leaders,
on the provincial level, who attempted
through his moderation to fill that gap, to
conquer that solitude which had developed
through the years, I might even say through
the centuries, and certainly in the last few
years between the elite and the Quebec people. At the time when the intellectuals, or at
least some elements of that intellectual group,
were attempting, perhaps with too much
enthusiasm, perhaps also too late, to fall in
step with France, the French-Canadian people
had long since had the good, or perhaps the
bad fortune, to adjust itself to the pace of
America.
While I was listening to the honourable
Leader of the Opposition praise the two
qualities of Daniel Johnson which he mentioned, I decided to emphasize in particular
his great quality of moderation, the realistic
outlook which he kept concerning French
Canada and the average French Canadian,
whose spokesman he became, particular in
the last few years, in order to serve their
long range interests.
I wish to offer my most sincere sympathy
to Mrs. Johnson and to her children.

to ask him why we are adjourning until 3

Hon. Mr. Martin: There are a few more
honourable senators who wish to speak in

Does my honourable friend have in mind
the possibility that the funeral of the late
Premier Johnson will be taking place on
Tuesday?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I do not know whether
that is the case. It is supposed to be
announced later this afternoon. My concern is
whether there are any bills that we can consider on Tuesday.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Yes, there are three bills.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It is my understanding
that the explanations by the sponsors will not
be long, and I am sure the bills can be dealt
with by this side on Wednesday. I am suggesting that in the circumstances it would be
sufficient for us to meet at 8 o'clock Tuesday
evening.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, I
have given some consideration to this. I have
discussed it with a number of my colleagues,
particularly the Whip on this side. That we
should adjourn until 3 o'clock on Tuesday
afternoon seems to be the best judgment. It
seems to me that we shall have a long enough

high position of Government Leader in the
Senate, and Senator Deschatelets on his elevation to the Speaker's Chair. I wish them
well in the discharge of their duties for which
they are so eminently qualified. They succeed
Senator John J. Connolly and Senator Sydney
Smith, respectively, both of whom served the
Senate wholeheartedly and brought increased
honour to it. Consequently, all members of
this chamber are grateful to them, not only
for the excellent performance of their duties
of office but also for their warmth of friendship which we shall continue to enjoy on a
more unofficial basis.
Because of my ancestral background, I wish
at this time to give public credit and convey
appreciation in particular to Senator Martin
and Senator Connolly (Ottawa West) for their
efforts to become trilingual. Both are perfectly bilingual in the two official languages. Both

October 1, 1968

have participated in conventions and national
celebrations of Ukrainian Canadians, at which
they have displayed a scholarly knowledge of
Ukrainian history and cultural contributions
to Canada and have spoken several sentences
in the Ukrainian language.
Despite our political differences both have
encouraged me in my work, as have many
other honourable senators in this chamber. As
I have done in the past, I am always ready to
co-operate and work with all men dedicated
to the principles of democracy, liberty, justice, equality and brotherhood in the building
of a better Canada.
We are all aware that in addition to English
and French there are many other languages
spoken in Canada. Rarely do we hear some of
these mother tongues of Canadians spoken in
Parliament.
Having been requested by several senators,
permit me to recite in Ukrainian-a language
now taught in the high schools of the three
prairie provinces-a popular verse by the
great poet Taras Shevchenko, whose statue
stands in front of the Legislative Building of
Manitoba. This literary gem, which can easily
be memorized by any Canadian, is very
applicable to our multi-cultural society:
Uchitesya, braty moyi, Dumayte, chytate;
I chuzhodo nauchaytesh, Svoho ne tsuraytesh.
This is the translation in English:
Learn, my brethren,
Think and read;
Study other cultures,
Do not deny your own.
Here is my French version of this verse:
Apprenez, mes frères,
Pensez et lisez,
Étudiez les autres cultures,
Ne niez pas la vôtre.
The speeches of the two new members,
Senator Lazarus Phillips and Senator Raymond Eudes, the mover and seconder of the
motion for an Address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne, were of the high calibre, in
substance and presentation, that has become
traditional in this chamber. They show promise of better things to come.
I was impressed by the fact that Senator
Phillips was proud of his Jewish origin.
Indeed, he is a very worthy representative of
a leading ethnic group that bas contributed
greatly to the many-sided development of
Canada, thus helping to improve the material
and spiritual welfare of all Canadians and the

October 1, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

stature of Canada abroad. I find myself in full
agreement with his statements that:
in the pluralistic mosaic of Canada the
aspirations and ambitions of all Canadians must be placed on an equal footing.
And that the inspiring word "Canadian" must
mean:
...
the

sum total of the rights, privileges,

duties and obligations which every citizen
of this country enjoys and shares equally,
from sea to sea, regardless of his ethnic
origin or religion.
I am sure that Senator Phillips is aware that
this has not been fully achieved, and that he
will find sympathetie support in the Senate
for the realization of this high ideal.
Honourable senators, the Speech from the
Throne that opened the twenty-eighth Parliament of Canada vaguely referred to the
objectives of a just society, in which there
would be: "the righting of wrongs and...the
opening of opportunities long denied."
The Government, following the recommendations of the report of the Royal Commission
on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, plans to
introduce an Official Languages Act as one
phase of constitutional reform. Many of these
wrongs, injustices and denied opportunities
are suffered by members of our minority ethnic and cultural groups. Something must be
done to improve the situation, or it may lead
to undesired repercussions and harm to our
country.
I would like to draw the attention of the
members of this bouse, and, indeed, of Parliament, to some of the conclusions reached
by the 1968 International Conference of
Christians and Jews, held at York University
in Toronto during the first week of September
this year. There were some 200 participants,
preponderantly from the United States and
Canada. Among them were professors, clergy,
social workers, politicians, educators, lawyers, judges and people from various walks
of life, of various origins, colours, classes and
creeds, including myself. They conferred for
five days in commissions dealing with the
theme,
"Overcoming
the
Barriers
to
Communication".
The commission on Ethnic Groups and
Value Systems came out with some rather
startling observations, which could be useful
to us in helping to find solutions for some of

our problems in Canada. I read from their
report:
The current problem between racial
and religious groups takes the form of a
power struggle which unless resolved will
have serious consequences for western
society.
Canadians, who at the outset felt their
country's situation to be far different and
far less troubled than that of the U.S.A.,
later agreed that, indeed, both countries
faced similar problems stemming from
similar causes. It was felt that perhaps
Canada still had time to learn and benefit
from the experience of the U.S.A.
Causes of group conflict were identified
clearly as (1) Racism and ethnocentrism
on the part of the majority group, in
western society. This majority has
zealously maintained one set of value systems as superior. All others they denigrate. The second reason for conflict
which in many cases is caused by the
first, is the struggle between the havenots and the haves-the powerless and
the powerful. As a result of society's failure in these two areas tensions between
the generations have been polarized and
nourished. Thus the first two conflicts
have helped to create yet another power
struggle.
While legislation is vital, it is only a
partial solution to the problem. Laws;
which set standards for the behaviour of
institutions and individuals toward those
in minority groups are indeed necessary.
Pending a change in attitudes, the enactment of such legislation can afford the
protection of the minority groups' rights.
It can also serve as an educational tool to
bring about the desired attitude changes.
While minority ethnic and racial
groups have made sustained attempts to
communicate over a long period of time,
it is clear that the majority has failed to
listen and act. Thus tensions exploded
into violence. While this violence and its
consequences are deplored, it must be
recognized that their extreme means of
communication in the U.S., and the threat
of it in Canada, did finally result in the
beginning of change...
Moreover, white youth leadership is
aligning itself with non-whites out of
what they see as a spiritual affinity. Like
the non-white because of what they feel
to be society's inability or unwillingness

SENATE DEBATES
to deal with grave moral issues, some
youth are attempting to change the society, others go as far as to reject it.
Given this set of circumstances, the
dominant groups in white western society
have but two choices.
One is repression-total repression.
This is hardly a viable or moral solution.
The other is sharing-total sharing of
power and its products. This would mean
moral, religious, intellectual power; economic, political and social power.
The commission considered that there were
three vital interests of special importance to
minority groups: (1) minority rights (including the right to preserve and promote certain
distinctive traits or patterns of behaviour
which pose no threat to the common good);
(2) economic security; and (3) a greater measure of "participatory dernocracy."
It is significant that the commission reject,d the "melting-pot theory" of assimilation,
wnich many felt led to the present disturbances in the United States, and approved the
Canadian concept of integration.
Ethnic groups create the multi-cultural
pluralist society of our age ... They are
one dominant mosaic within the state.
Their diversity need not divide, but rather must enrich society. Only out of diversity will come the new unity of peoples.
But all ethnic groups require the inspiration and guidance of a public and social
philosophy of their vision of the new
society. Their aspiration is not only to
survive and flourish with their values,
religious and cultural, intact, but also to
offer them to the society as a whole for
acceptance and even exchange. This is
the challenge and constant dynamie in
society today rather than the religious
confrontations of a century ago.
The commission urged the gradual creation
of the new society based on the principles of
distributive and social justice. It could bu
achieved much faster if the spirit of goodwill
and understanding motivated all the groups
in the society. Here is how the strategy of
attitude was defined:
All ethnic and oppressed minorities
recognize that it is critical to bring about
an effective change in the attitudes of
majority groups. This is the factor, psychological and mental, that calls for reprocessing and programming. Minority
groups in our society cannot get through

October 1, 1968

these obstacles to awareness of this social
and economic predicament. Violence is a
protest against this obtuseness of the
dominant groups. The majority powers
need to acquire a genuine openness of
mind and heart, greater awareness, sensitivity and humility. These are primary
goals that must be striven for with every
available, effective resource.
This year, the twentieth anniversary of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights by
the United Nations is being marked by
rededication to that ideal for the peoples of
the world. The Canadian Citizenship Council
in 1964 declared that "the maintenance of
human rights should be the basic objective of
the citizens of Canada."
A list of our rights as Canadians would be
long, providing proof of our freedom. In his
essay "Belief and Action" Viscount Samuel
bas set a standard. The man who is fully free
is one who lives in an independent country,
in a democratic state, in a society adhering to
laws of equality with a minimum of restrictions, in an economic system providing latitude for secure livelihood and assured comfort and full opportunity to rise by merit. The
state in democratic terms exists for the
benefit of the state, as is practised in
totalitarian countries.
In Canada we possess the right to belong to
and support the religion of our choice, the
political party of our choice, to speak our
minds and to assemble and organize ourselves. In our pluralistic society this would
appear to provide a guarantee of full freedom.
Individuals seem to be protected against the
tyranny of the state. Society, however, has a
duty toward the individual in that it must
provide new opportunities for self-development, encourage
scientific research
and
extend education to improve material and
human welfare by making the best use of
human and natural resources for the benefit
and happiness of all citizens.
Democracy bas always been faced with the
problem of synthesizing legislated law and
freedom, and adapting law to meet changing
circumstances.
The broad
principles
of
democracy are synonymous with the ideals of
the good life and the just society which have
been enunciated thus:
1. All human beings have absolute worth
regardless of race, religion or material
possessions.
2. Reason and conscience are essential
guides to human behaviour.

October 1, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

3. Human beings possess fundamental
equalities which must be respected.
4. Freedom, limited only by moral responsibility and social justice, must be forthcoming
to all human beings.
All Canadians are involved in the process
of change. Life is becoming more and more
complex, to which our citizens of necessity
must adapt themselves. The only safeguard of
individual and group rights is a sound and
vigilant public opinion which can be implemented by conscientious leaders, inspired by
the highest ideals of democracy stated above.
of
Conference
The Federal-Provincial
February of this year has initiated the
process of constitutional reform in Canada. A
new bill of rights to supplement the one of
1960 has been proposed, as well as other not
clearly defined constitutional changes. Here is
where public opinion can and will play an
important part. Our leaders and citizens must
be conscious of one important fact that
majorities, because of their dominant position
in our society, usually do not feel the need
for constitutional reform. The corollary is also
true, that minorities without status, without
power and without effective voice feel that
their rights should be protected by the
Constitution.
An excellent essay on human rights, published in "The Royal Bank of Canada Monthly Letter," January, 1968, refers to the rights
of minorities in the following manner:
What is needed in applying the rules of
human rights is that in addition to the
principle of majority rule there should be
recognition by every group in society of
the legitimacy of minority group interest,
provided, as Sidney Hook wrote in The
Hero in History 'the group in question
accepts the methods of free inquiry and
democratic decision as principles of negotiating conflicts of interest'.
Majorities should be generous and
gracious. They can spoil their goodness if,
while admitting that it takes all sorts of
people to make a world, they say it as
though they find it a regrettable thing.
On the other hand, minorities should
beware lest insistence upon rights should
become a hammer by which affection is
beaten to death.
The fundamental cause of group and
class conflict is the attitude of superiority
on the part of one group or class toward
another. It is essential that minorities be
encouraged to take part in the common

life of the community, whatever customs
and cultures they wish to preserve among
themselves, and that they be welcomed
warmly by the majority.
Honourable senators, in my maiden speech,
delivered in this chamber on March 3, 1964, I
employed statistics and history to bring out
the fact that Canada was a multicultural
rather than a bicultural society and that the
ethnic groups of non-British, non-French origin formed almost one-third of the population, which desired recognition of their rights
as partners, who have contributed and are
constantly contributing to the building of a
better Canada. In the five years that I have
been serving in the Senate I have maintained
communication with the leaders, the leading
organizations and the piess of most of the
ethnic groups, including the Indians. During
this time, these ethnic groups of the third
element have found various means of cooperation in order to have a stronger voice in
the affairs of their country.
There are mary sceptics, not only in the
British and French groups but also in the
other ethnic groups, who believe that a united voice and action of the third element is
impossible and even undesirable. Such people
do not take into consideration that the organizations and spokesmen of the ethnic groups
were given the opportunity to express their
views to the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism in its hearings
across the country.
From the many reports that I have read, I
have come to the conclusion that there is
fairly unanimous opinion that Canada should
be bilingual in some form; that our country is
not bicultural but in reality multicultural;
that official recognition should be given to
multiculturalism by permitting non-official
languages and cultural subjects to be taught
in the public and secondary schools and in
the universities, wherever there would be
sufficient numbers to maintain such classes;
that the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation
should sponsor regular programs on the
national radio and television networks, presenting the contributions of our ethnic groups,
which would promote better understanding of
our cultural heritage; that ethnic groups
should receive more representation in go vernmental bodies and national institutions, and
should not be discriminated against La the
federal, provincial and municipal governments and services.

SENATE DEBATES
These Canadian ethnic groups are greatly
concerned about many developments and
recent Government statements and actions.
They are rarely, if at all, consulted. Yet they
feel that they are an integral part of society
and should be consulted in matters where
their fate is involved. They want to see justice done in the proposed "just society", in
which they do not want to be second-class
citizens.
To make it possible for the ethnie groups to
make their views known, for the Government
and Parliament to communicate with them, to
prevent tensions and conflicts and to maintain
unity in Canada, I have taken the initiative to
convene a Thinkers' Conference on Minority
Rights, to meet in Toronto, towards the end of
November, prior to the Federal-Provincial
Conference on the Constitution. A Senate
Committee of Patrons, (unofficial), was established last March, consisting of myself as
chairman; Senator Norman A. M. MacKenzie,
former President of the University of British
Columbia, former President of the Canadian
Centenary Council and Professor of Internatonal Law; Senator Maurice Lamontagne, former Secretary of State; Senator David Croll,
first Jewish Cabinet Minister (Ontario) and
Senator in Canada; Senator James Gladstone,
first Indian Senator in Canada. I am happy
that other senators have volunteered to assist.
Several prominent institutions have consented to become patrons of this conference,
namely, the Canadian Citizenship Branch,
Department of the Secretary of State, the
Canadian Citizenship Council, the Canadian
Folk Arts Council, the Canadian Council of
Christians and Jews, and the Canadian Ethnie
Press Federation. The Royal Commission on
Bilingualism and Biculturalism has offered its
co-operation.
The actual preparation of the conference is
in the hands of a committee of prominent
citizens in Toronto. Experts from various
parts of Canada have agreed to present position papers on important topies in both
official languages. The conference will study
minority rights in relation to possible changes
in the Constitution, the desirability of establishing a council as an advisory body to the
governments, and the feasibility of convening
a national assembly of the ethnie groups.
Most of the central and leading organizations
of the ethnie groups have written that they
will participate.
In my opinion this can prove to be an
important conference, which will have a
bearing on future developments in Canada,
particularly in establishing and perpetuating

October 1, 1968

good relations among all the elements of our
population, thus helping to make Canada a
better place for all in which to live. The
Senate, as a protector of the rights of minorities, can derive some satisfaction from its
contribution to the cause of Canadian unity.
[Translation]
Honourable
senators,
French-Canadian
newspapers have recently published a number of articles, some favourable and others
sceptical, concerning the ethnie groups conference. I wish to reassure all French Canadians that the ethnie groups generally respect
their struggles to maintain and preserve their
identity and their culture. Discussions during
the conference will take place in English and
in French. Only with mutual respect, understanding and co-operation will we be able to
build together a better Canada for ourselves
and our children.
[English]
Hon. Norman McL. Paterson: Honourable
senators, first of all, I would like to congratulate our honourable Speaker and at this time
tell him how much we appreciate his lucid
and careful explanation of the Estimates last
year, when he presented the Appropriation
Bills in the Senate on behalf of the
Government.
Also, I take the liberty of joining with
those who congratulated the mover and
seconder of the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne. At this time I also
congratulate the new senators and wish them
happiness and satisfaction in their new
labours.
Honourable senators what I am about to
say may seem very tiresome, coming after the
brilliant speeches we have heard, but my
remarks concern the most important industry
in Canada.
As I am the oldest member in years of
membership
of
the
Winnipeg
Grain
Exchange, and perhaps the oldest in age as
well, I would like to tell you a little about the
Exchange. I do so because of the misunderstanding which is prevalent, especially in the
case of two ministers in the other place, the
Minister of Labour and the Minister of
Agriculture, both of whom made statements
blaming the recent strike on the Winnipeg
Grain Exchange. After my remarks. I think
you will see that the Grain Exchange had no
part in it and cannot be blamed for the strike.
The Winnipeg Grain Exchange occupies a
building built by the Traders' Building
Association, to which it moved from Princess
Street in 1907. At that time it was the largest

October 1, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

building in the British Empire, it became
second only by the erection of an addition to
the Sun Life Building in Montreal, I believe.
The Winnipeg Grain Exchange is owned by
the Traders' Building Association Limited, a
joint stock company subscribed for by grainmen. Those men have all passed on, but the
building is still owned by the Traders' Building Association, who rent rooms to the
members of the Winnipeg Grain Exchange.
The members of the Winnipeg Grain
Exchange are composed of representatives of
linseed mills, flour mills, brewers, maltsters,
shipping companies, railroads, telegraph companies, and many others outside Winnipeg
who use the facilities. The facilities are really
about the best that can be had.
On several occasions in recent years the
Winnipeg Grain Exchange has been accused
of certain things, and investigations have
been made. In nearly every case, the investigation has proven that the Exchange performs a service second to none in the world.
Through its facilities it is in constant and
immediate touch with London. New York,
Paris, Chicago and all the markets of the
world, and it is constantly aware of the
demand and supply and the growing conditions of other crops.
The Winnipeg Grain Exchange has been
accused at times of being a gambling hell. Of
course you can gamble there. You can gamble
on the stock exchange; you can gamble at
horse races; you can gamble when you pay
taxes in Montreal. I think there are people
here who will agree with me, that the greatest gambler in Canada is the producer of
grain. He bets his whole summer's work
against grasshoppers, chince bugs, cutworms,
rust, smut, too little rain, too much rain,
early frost, and a host of other things. And
yet, while he is a gambler, he is the most
important economic man we have in Canada.
I would like to tell you something about the
elevator situation at the head of the lakes.
There are 23 grain elevators operating and
one obsolete. The total capacity is 104 million
bushels. Of those elevators, 15 are owned by
producers of grain, comprised as follows:
three by the United Grain Growers Grain
Company, four by the Manitoba Co-operative
Wheat Pool, and eight by the Saskatchewan
Crop Wheat Pool. The other eight elevators
are owned by private companies.
The co-operative pools do not pay income
taxes. The Grain Growers' Grain Company
does pay income taxes. The remaining eight

elevators belonging to non-co-operative companies, or private owners, do pay taxes.
The total capacity at the producer-owned
elevators is 66 million bushels. The total
capacity at the privately-owned elevators is
38 million bushels.
Just a word about the elevator business.
When one considers that their capacity is 104
million bushels, but finds the statistics showing stocks at the head of the lakes at 90
million bushels, which it was during the
strike, it may raise some question; but it is
easy to explain why they were congested.
For instance, most elevators are built of
round, cement tanks with a capacity of about
20,000 to 50,000 bushels each. In the interstices between the tanks, which are called
star bins, they run probably 5,000 to 15,000
bushels. When I first went into the grain business, all the box cars had a carrying capacity
of 40,000 pounds, or 750 bushels of wheat.
Today the carrying capacity is 120,000 pounds
with space for 2,000 bushels, and, if necessary,
an overload of 500 bushels.
When a car arrives at the head of the lakes
it is binned with the same kind of grain, but,
for example, if a car arrives with one northern mixed with heated, which is prevalent
because of some poor storage facilities in the
West, it must be kept separate until like
grades arrive. Therefore, when put in a bin
by itself, it usually occupies more space than
needed; and when one considers the variety
of grades, all the way down from one northern, two northern, three northern, four, five,
six and feed, of wheat alone, and then considers the various grades of wheat, oats, barley, rye, flaxseed and rapeseed, you will
understand what a difficult time is had in
using all the space economically, and some
wonderful "conniving" is probably done.
In my day the elevators were practically all
run by Scotsmen from the Isle of Skye, the
names mostly MacKinnons, MacKays and
MacDonalds, and they drove the inspectors
almost out of their minds by talking Gaelic,
and I imagine they still do. However, the
strike is over and the congestion is somewhat
relieved, although there were 22 million
bushels in cars waiting.
Now for the strike. The average wage paid
in 1967 was $2.56 per hour. The union
demanded an increase of $1.25 or, in other
words, practically a 50 per cent increase.
Honourable senators will remember what a
furor was created when the Seaway workers
were granted an increase of 30 per cent. To
grant this demand would mean a daily wage
of $30 per eight-hour day, plus time and a

SENATE DEBATES

With them I join in the welcome that has
been extended to some of our new colleagues.
I wish to assure them that if my experience is
any guide and if they have the will to work,
they will find here many opportunities for
service. While they may not get a great deal
of public recognition-many of us here, I
think, have ceased to seek that-they will get
the inner satisfaction of knowing that a summons to this place can be a call to important
public service.
I join in the expressions of regret for those
who have left us. They were our colleagues
and our friends, and we would all agree that
in our associations with them we found
enrichment for our own lives.
I wish once again to pay my respects to my
own leader, Senator Flynn. He was our
unanimous choice when Senator Brooks
stepped down. For that reason, and for others
that are unfortunate but I am sure are temporary, he is not likely to add to his vote of
confidence numerically in the near future, but
I can assure him be bas done so in many
other respects.
I would perhaps have made some rather
general remarks on the motion before us and
on the speech to which it refers; however, I
thought Senator Everett in his speech the
other day pretty well summed up my own
reaction, and I think he spoke from inside
information. One of his remarks was that the
speech lacked poetry. I agree with him. I am
sure Senator Everett in anticipation sighed
with Shakespeare's chorusO for a Muse of fire, that would
ascend
The brightest heaven of invention,A kingdom for a stage, princes to act,
And monarchs to behold the swelling
scene!
Such at least was the general expectation
but all we got was some rather dull prose, I
thought, explaining why on that particular
occasion the Muse was still out to lunch.
There is hope for the future. The great significance of the speech, as Senator Everett
said, was that it very definitely left the way
open for a better one the next time, to which
I think we can all say a fond amen.
A particular matter with which I would
like to deal today comes from a reference in
the Speech from the Throne to what was
called "a thorough review of our external and
defence policies." This is the subject to which

the leader has particularly invited us in the
Senate to turn our attention. The speech said:
Canada's contribution to NATO, relations
with Peking, with Latin America and
with Europe are being studied currently.
Reviews of our relations with other areas
will be undertaken later and, as conclusions are reached, Parliament will be
invited to consider them.
I am going to suggest, honourable senators,
that one of these other regions which has
been temporarily put aside in this planning,
namely the Caribbean, should have a new
Canadian political initiative now, not later. I
suggest that this is an area where we need for
the time being no more studies. The time has
come for action-political action. I have
attempted to bring myself up to date with the
situation, and I would have to say that there
is enough paper in the studies prepared in
our own Department of External Affairs to
cover the whole of the islands of the Caribbean from the Bahamas in the north to Trinidad in the south and from the Caymans in
the east to the Barbados in the far west.
I do not deprecate research before action; I
do not criticize these studies. Many of them
are excellent, particularly those prepared in
the Department of External Affairs, and the
Department of Trade and Commerce, and
many of them were called for specifically by
the present leader of this house in his former
capacity. But what I have noticed in going
through these papers and in listening to and
reading speeches is that nobody seems to
want to mention the kind of political initiative from Canada that I have reason to
believe our friends in the Caribbean, particularly in some of the smaller islands, many of
which are on the verge of becoming new
nations, would welcome from Canada today.
I am not going to suggest that I am an
expert in Canadian-Caribbean relations-far
from it. I say that because I recall that the
Leader of the Government in his former
capacity, sometimes, and probably with very
good reason, became apprehensive about the
tendency of some Canadian parliamentarians
to rush in to external affairs where the angels
of the department feared to tread, and perhaps with good reason, because they are publie servants, not public policymakers.
However, in this particular region in which
I am interested they still fear to tread. For
that reason I nake no apology today for
associating myself with the not inconsiderable
number of Canadian parliamentarians who
think that the time has come for more, rather

SENATE DEBATES
than less, rushing in by parliamentarians to
this particular field of public policy.
A start has been made. Mr. James Walker,
M..P, who is Parliamentary Secretary to the
Prime Minister and the Chairman of the
Commonwealth Parliamentary Association,
proposed a motion, which was accepted quite
recently, that there be formed a CanadianCaribbean Committee of Parliamentarians in
Canada. He made the motion at a conference
here in Ottawa, which was attended by 15
Caribbean parliamentarians, including three
premiers and a number of Canadian parliamentarians. I was glad to see that among
them were Senator John Connolly and Senator Kinley, whose interest in this area is well
known. There were also economic experts,
including Mrs. Kari Levitt the co-author of
perhaps the most objective recent study on
Canadian-Caribbean Commonwealth relations
entitled, Canada-West Indies Economic Relations, which was sponsored by the Canadian
Trade Committee of the Private Planning
Association of Canada, and published by the
Centre for Developing Area Studies at McGill
University. I shall refer to that book as I go
along.
Mr. Walker's motion was enthusiastically
received, I would say, certainly by Caribbeans and, as far as I could see, by all the
Canadians present.
In what T have to say today, honourable
senators, I am not speaking to that committee. I should perhaps say I am not speaking
for any of our Caribbean friends who were at
that conference. As I say, some were premiers and other ministers of governments. None
of them is aware that I am going to make the
suggestions I am making today and, except in
a very broad way, I did not discuss this
specifically with them.
I repeat, I am no expert, but I hope that
my remarks will be found to be reasonably
well informed. I have been on most of the
islands, by no means always as a mere tourist.
On one occasion not too long ago I spent two
very exciting weeks as one of four outside
observers at a regional conference in the
Caribbean attended by representatives of all
the governments. As I said, I have spoken to
many premiers, chief ministers, ministers,
members of Parliament and some officials in
the Caribbean, and I read as widely as I
could, both before and after these visits.
Furthermore, a couple of weeks ago-and
this is my excuse for my absence in the early
days of this session-I travelled across Canada with these 15 Caribbeans, including the

October 1, 1968

premiers from Antigua, Grenada and St. Kitts.
They were guests of the Canadian branch
of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, which arranged not only for the tour
and for the reception in various provinces,
but also for some very useful discussions held
in these buildings at which, I think, they and
Canadians were fortunate in having the
attendance of the Honourable Mitchell Sharp,
the Honourable Jean-Luc Pepin, and Mr.
Maurice Strong then Director-General of
External Aid. I believe his branch is now
known as the Canadian International Development Agency.
The occasion was perhaps in itself a bit of
rushing in, by amateur politicians, into this
very delicate area. Some called it "Operation
Channel 2." The thought, as I understand it,
was to provide a second channel of communication between parliamentarians of the Caribbean and parliamentarians in Canada, to augment, but in no way to by-pass or supplant
the official and diplomatic channels, on
whom, of course, the major responsibility for
these matters lies.
Our friends were received by the provinces
to which the C.P.A. was able to direct their
tour, officially by representatives of the governments of Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and
British Columbia; by mayors of some of our
leading cities; by Lieutenant-GovernorsHon. Mr. Burchill: Did they come down to
the Maritimes?
Hon. Mr. Grosari: They did not. And in
reply to that question I may digress to say
that the most serious criticism made of the
arrangements, particularly by Maritimers,
was that the tour did not include the Maritimes. Of course, the criticism was based on
the fact that our traditional relationships with
the Caribbeans have been historically centred
in the Maritimes.
It is not for me to say what was the reason
for this, except to say that if the funds had
been available and they had had the time, the
tour would certainly have included the Maritimes. The visitors were consulted in advance
as to where they would like to go and, whereas I would not wish to put the blame in any
way on them, the consensus decision, as I
understand it, was for them to be in Quebec,
Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia.
There was a particular reason why they
should go west, namely, that towards the end
of the tour there were meetings in Vancouver
and Victoria of the Canadian Region Conference of the Commonwealth Parliamentary

October 1, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Association. The Canadian region consists of
the branch attached to this Parliament and
the branches attached to the other ten legislatures. It was thought desirable, for the first
time in history, to have a substantial group of
parliamentarians from the Caribbean region
attend a conference of the Canadian region,
or area, as it is variously called.
I hope that will be an answer, even if not a
completely satisfactory one, to the senator
from the Maritime provinces.
Hon. Mr. Holleit: The Atlantic provinces!
Hon. Mr. Grosari: I am corrected by Senator Hollett, who asks me to call them the
Atlantic provinces. I have often wondered
why, because personally I do not see any
great difference between "Maritime" and "Atlantic." I do not think there is any possibility
of any confusion, although they might be
identified with that other maritime area, British Columbia, and it is not for me to say
whether they would like that comparison.
Honourable senators, I was describing very
briefiy the tours and receptions that the gentlemen of the Caribbean enjoyed while they
were here. I was about to say that the highlight of their visit, was the very warm and
gracious reception given by the Prime Minister. It had many advantages for them, and for
a few of us it had a particular advantage in
that from then on they stopped asking some
of us what had happened in the not so merry
months of May, June and July. Having met
to
they seemed
Minister,
the Prime
understand.
I mentioned that there were some firsts
achieved during this visit. It was the first
invitation of its kind to Caribbean parliamentarians, the first attendance at a Canadian
regional meeting of Caribbean parliamentarians, and it was the first time that an unofficial group such as this from the Caribbean
had had the opportunity of confrontation with
Canadian ministers. I must say that those
confrontations were open to parliamentarians
but not to the press, for the very obvious
reason that on both sides there was a wish to
have a free and frank discussion-and that
certainly took place.
From talking to the Caribbean parliamentarians I think I can safely say that they
were very satisfied and highly delighted with
the frankness shown by the ministers and
Mr. Strong.
The thesis I have suggested is that something more than all of this is long overdue in
Canada-Caribbean relations. I should like to

emphasize that, unless you have been down
there recently, it is a little difficult to understand their terrifie drive towards nationhood,
which is impelling the activities and actions
of these young nations. Of course, not all of
them are emerging nations. Jamaica, Trinidad
and Tobago, and Guyana are sovereign
nations, and Barbados is also recently a sovereign nation. In addition, there are the socalled Little Seven, a string of islands in the
Eastern Caribbean, five of which are associate
states with the United Kingdom. There are
other places in the Commonwealth Caribbean
which are officially described as dependencies
of the United Kingdom-British Honduras,
the Cayman, Turks, and Caicos Islands, the
British Virgins, and the Bahamas.
I should say that the way has been well
paved in the last few years for the kind of
political initiative that I am going to suggest. It has been paved not merely by good
intentions-although there have been many of
those on both sides-but by definite action,
for which, at the risk of flattering him unduly, I must say some credit must be given to
the honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Martin). I would specifically mention the Canada-Caribbean Conference that
was held here in Ottawa in 1966, attended by
the heads of government of the Caribbean
and Canada, and in which Senator Martin
was a prime mover. It was on Senator Martin's initiative particularly over the last few
years that Canadian aid to the Caribbean has
risen from a very modest start in 1958 of $10
million spread over five years, to its present
comparatively high level of $22 million. It is
fair to say that Senator Martin was a strong
advocate of this, and, in his position of authority, a prime mover in bringing it about.
Today the per capita Canadian aid to the
Caribbean is higher than that to other areas.
It was under the direction of Senator Martin also that further conferences, following
the 1966 conference, took place. There was a
trade conference in St. Lucia, and others.
I mention these in order to indicate that
there is a strong base upon which to build
something bigger and better in our relationships. It may be asked why Canada should
take any special initiative in the Caribbean.
Perhaps I can suggest a few reasons.
The first is, and I think honourable senators will agree, that every document, every
book, every study, and every speech written
or made about the Caribbean by Canadians
speaks of our historic ties, our special relationships, and our neighbourliness with these

SENATE DEBATES
islands of the Caribbean. But it seems to me
that when we come down to assistance, we
treat every specific suggestion in exactly the
same way as we would treat a suggestion
vis-à-vis any other part of the world. I suggest that we do have a special relationship,
and if we really regard these young nations
and these islands of the Caribbean as our
neighbours, then the attitude we should be
taking to them is that of a neighbour.
When a neighbour asks you to mind his dog
you may very well say to yourself: Well, the
dog is going to damage some of the nice
flowers in my garden; it may bark and keep
me awake at night, it may cause me various
problems, but my neighbour has asked me, so
I shall look after his dog. But, if somebody
from away down the street whom you do not
know asks you to mind his dog, then quite
properly, your attitude is different.
With respect to this special obligation
which I submit Canada has to the Caribbean,
I can do no better than quote from the objective study that I mentioned earlier, a study of
the Private Planning Association of Canada. I
read from page 13:
It can be argued, however, that Canada, as one of the rich nations of the
world, has an important role to play in
assisting developing regions such as the
West Indies. It will be shown that Canada has more trading and investment interests in the Caribbean than in any other
part of the underdeveloped world. And it
can be further argued that because of the
relatively small size of the West Indies,
Canada may appropriately focus on their
development problems, since these may
be more manageable than those of other
countries. In other words, the main basis
for future Canadian-West Indian relations
must be seen to lie in the economic
arrangements that might be employed by
a developed nation to further the process
of growth in less developed countries.
The emphasis there, of course, is on the
smallness of this area as compared to the size
of Canada, its neighbour. To my way of
thinking, this, more than anything else, is the
justification for some very special and bold
political initiative at the moment.
I have mentioned that many of these
nations are on the verge of independence. It
seems to me there is an opportunity of Canada associating itself in a very important way
with these nations. We may have various
ideas as to what that association should be. I
can perhaps do no better in that matter than

October 1, 1968

to quote from a paper presented by Premier
Robert Bradshaw of St. Kitts at the conference here which I spoke of a moment ago. He
asked the question:
Of what possible use could Caribbean
Commonwealth friendship be to Canada
in political terms? I myself answer this
question by referring to the fact that, so
far, Caribbean Commonwealth countries
have four votes in the United Nations
where Canada has been one of the foremost and genuine standard bearers of
peace among nations. Those four votes
could be of use to Canada in her crusade
of peace. What is more: those four votes
could very easily become nine were the
British Government to adopt the dark
suggestion of a conservative member,
recently in the Commons House at Westminster, to end the association with the
Associated States of the West Indies, of
which there are five, in which case those
States would most likely each become
Sovereign.
He went on to say:
To the extent, therefore, that Canada
might in ber growing power and
greatness, wish to create a little sphere of
influence of ber own, it seems that the
Commonwealth Caribbean was the most
likely and fruitful area to try to cultivate;
and why not?
I interject here that in talking this over
with my friend and mentor, the honourable
Senator O'Leary (Carleton), he reminded me
that Premier Shearer of Jamaica had warned
against the use of the word "influence,"
because perhaps it has sinister connotations
from the past. It might be better to use the
word "interest." The Premier continues:
Don't they all speak English, do their
parliaments not spring from the same
source although some of the islands, at
least, had legislatures before Canada, and
don't their political ideas run so closely
together as to generate the suggestion
that the West Indies should have become
provinces of Canada?
Caribbean-Canada political relationships are developing along parallel, if not
intersecting lines of mutual respect, and
the time may well have come for them to
be formalized into a treaty bearing in
mind that Canada has not yet joined the
O.A.S.

October 1, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

A third, and I think a very important reason, is the threat of communism. I hope no one
will suggest, at least no one who is unaware
of the facts, that this is an exaggeration. It is
a fear which is foremost in the best minds of
those islands. They are close to Cuba and
they are close to Guyana, which is at the
moment perhaps at a crossroads between
communism and democracy. We all know
what the fertile ground of communism ispoverty, national frustrations and the impact
of the widening gap between the developed
and developing nations. I suggest, honourable
senators, that Canada should not stand by
and let this happen. It can happen but, much
more important, it can be prevented and now
is the time for us to make sure it is
prevented.
You will remember the American initiative
in relation to Cuba. We may not all agree
with what happened there, but this is a very
different situation. Here is an opportunity for
peaceful intervention, peaceful assistance,
peaceful initiative, to prevent the same thing
happening in some of these islands and some
of these mainland territories, that has happened in Cuba.
Another reason is that we can afford well
this kind of neighbourliness. In a general way
I have directed my remarks to the whole of
the Commonwealth Caribbean, but my particular concern is the smaller economically
undeveloped areas, because I think it can be
properly said that independent nations, by
and large have reached the economic take-off
point-Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and
Guyana and, in spite of some very serious
problems, Barbados. The total population that
I am talking about, and what can constitute in
the not-too-distant future ten nations, is about
half a million people. Perhaps if we take in
the mainland dependencies we might add
another 120,000. The total budget expenditures of all of thern put together is about $80
million to $90 million. Those are West Indies
dollars, if my arithmetic is correct. Surely
this suggests what a tremendous opportunity
is there, and surely it suggests that we can
afford to do something more in this area than
we are doing and certainly much more comparatively than we are doing in the rest of
the world.
Finaily, I would say that another important
reason is the will of Canadians generally for
greater participation of Canada in the future
of these islands. Canadians go down there in
large numbers for business and pleasure. My
own experience is that whenever I talk to a
Canadian who has been there he seems a

little mystified about this lack of Canadian
initiative. I am not being critical of anyone in
the past, because anyone who has studied the
history of this whole matter is aware that
there are very good reasons why we may not
have been able to move politically earlier
than today. I refer to the negotiations, the
long negotiations, leading up to the formation
of the West Indies Federation which fortunately did not prove viable. When it broke up
there was another long period of uncertainty
when there was a suggestion that another
federation might be formed of some of the
other territories. That has not come about.
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators,
perhaps my honourable friend will permit me
to ask a question arising out of what I think
is a very constructive and important speech.
The honourable senator speaks of the time
having arrived when there might be a
Canadian political initiative. I would be very
grateful if he would expand on the desire on
the part of the group of seven or eight for
such an initiative.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: I thank the honourable
Leader of the Government for his remarks.
This is perhaps the most important question
that can be asked about this situation. I find
myself a little embarrassed because, as I have
said, I spent a good deal of time recently
with some who are heads of government in
the Caribbean. I quoted Premier Bradshaw,
for example. I do not want to put those whom
I was associated with recently in the position
of having endorsed this, having approved or
suggested it. I think no one is better qualified
than the honourable Leader of the Government to appreciate my position in that
respect.
If I may go back over a period of time,
over other meetings that I have had in the
Caribbean, I would say my answer would be
"Yes, an approach from Canada would be
welcomed."
My personal belief is that there would be a
response to a specific suggestion, and perhaps
I could make it now. This specific suggestion
is that, in consultation with the United Kingdom, in consultation with our friends in the
Commonwealth Caribbean, we ask thern if
they would like to become associated in status
with Canada rather than with the United
Kingdom. In doing this, I make no reflection
whatsoever on the association they have had
with the United Kingdom. I perhaps need go
no further than that. Al honourable senators
know the historic reasons for it.

SENATE DEBATES
Perhaps the major difficulty that the U.K.
faces in this matter is-and I will be frankthat no matter what the U.K. does, the
suggestion will always be made that it is
merely giving back some small part of what
it took out of those islands. That may be true,
but it just does not make the association easier from the point of view of the U.K., and
certainly not from the point of view of the
beneficiaries in the Caribbean.
The U.K. accepts the responsibilities, as the
Leader of the Government well knows, for
balancing the budget of certain of those countries. Some are balancing their budgets and
some are not. The U.K. gives grants, as Canada does, but it also gives special grants, based
on the practice in earlier "colonial" days, if I
may call them so. Britain is accepting the
responsibility of carrying on many of those
grants.
If some of those emergent nations were to
turn to Canada, it is my own belief that this
would not be regarded as an affront by the
authorities in the United Kingdom. In fact, I
think the U.K. would welcome it. I may say
also that, whatever this involves, it does not
involve anything like some earlier suggestions. I remember thirty years ago hearing a
suggestion made by Lord Wellington, when
he was Governor General, that the Caribbean
Islands should become a province of Canada.
There were many impracticabilities in any
such suggestion, but associate status, associate
statehood, has very few. To be specific, the
immigration problem, in view of our own
desire to protect our employment situation,
does not arise; certainly it does not arise in
the arrangements for their associate statehood
with the United Kingdom.
It would not immediately involve the problem of extending old age pensions, family
allowances and unemployment insurance,
because those would not be immediately inherent in the concept of an associate state.
It is not really for me to try to spell this
out. I am merely saying, in answer to the
question put by the Leader of the Government, that I believe that this is the kind of
political initiative that can be taken by Canada. I do not think it is the kind of initiative
that you can take on the front pages of the
newspapers but it is an initiative that could
be and should be explored.
I have no doubt that the Leader of the
Government is presently thinking: Does he
know whether it has been explored or not? I
plead informed ignorance on that point.

October 1, 1968

In that connection, naturally, I should say
that if the offer of associate statehood were to
be made, the immediate response would be:
"What is the quid pro quo; what do you
offer?" My suggestion would be that we offer
a massive infusion of aid. As I have said, the
present amount is $22 million, the highest per
capita of any of our aid programs, but it is
still a very small proportion of our total aid$22 million out of $350 million. I am not suggesting that we should withdraw aid from
any other area. Eighty per cent of its goes to
India and Pakistan at the moment. But the
Leader of the Government, in his former
capacity, was the person who announced that
it was Canadian policy to reach a target of
one per cent of the gross national product,
market value, as our total aid in the 1970s.
This leaves much scope for far more than all
the money that would be required for the
existing development plans of the Caribbean,
without cutting a single cent of aid to any
other country. In fact, a massive infusion of
Canadian aid could be made without adding a
cent to the present projected increase in our
aid and actually without cutting back on any
other country.
What is the amount required? I have seen
the figure of 10 per cent cited as the present
percentage of the total development aid needed in the Commonwealth Caribbean supplied
by the present Canadian contribution. It
might be 15 per cent. Again, may I quote the
Private Planning book, which says quite
clearly that our present volume of total aid in
the Caribbean is not adequate. On page 107, it
says:
Thus the current rate of Canadian aid to
the region, although far more generous
than it was in the past, is hardly commensurate with Canada's political and economic relationship with the West Indies
as reflected in ber share of West Indian
commodity trade and in the extent of
Canadian private investments.
The latter figure is, I believe, about $500
million.

Canadians are the bankers of these islands.
We are rapidly becoming the main tourist
operators in those islands. These are new
developments, new reasons why Canada
should have a new kind of interest in its own

future policy with regard to the islands.
When one mentions aid, there are always
those who say: "One cannot keep handing it
out forever." I am not suggesting that we do
so. Again, as the Leader of the Government
well knows, the whole philosophy of our aid

October 1. 1968

SENATE DEBATES

is to help those nations to reach that take-off
point, which some of them have reached. We
have the great lesson of the Marshall Plan
which brought stricken countries back to the
take-off point where they generated their own
economic steam. Indeed, one of our provinces
the other day borrowed $40 million from
West Germany. This has happened already in
the present external aid programs of the
developing countries. For a while during the
last decade, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago
had rates of productivity growth that were
among the highest in the world. It has slackened off now but they did reach that takeoff point largely through the infusion of aid.
One needs to mention only Puerto Rico to
indicate what this kind of political initiative
can do for a country in this area.
There are a few other specifics. I think we
should untie our aid to the Caribbean. Honourable senators will be familiar with that
term. Tied aid means, in effect, that we do not
transfer money; we transfer resources, manpower, material and other forms of assistance. It bas many disadvantages to the recipients which I will not go into at the moment.
Perhaps one of the best statements that exist
on that whole matter, if honourable senators
care to read it, is that of the Leader of the
Government in the "Blaustein Lectures at
Columbia" about two years ago, where he
acknowledged the desirability of untying aid
and also explained very well the reasons why
heretofore we have not untied aid.
I think it can be argued that the time has
not yet come when Canada can untie its aid
to all countries, but, again having in mind a
special relationship to our neighbours in the
Caribbean, I suggest that we could and
should untie our aid there, still keeping it, of
course, under certain necessary controls. I
think it is part of the quid pro quo that we
should offer some unilateral-not reciprocaltrade concessions. I will not go into the details,
because others are much better informed
than I am on that subject. But I believe that
one of the important results of a relationship
of associate statehood would be a much greater possibility of doing this effectively, having
in mind our other obligations under GATT.
It is suggested that we take over certain of
the U.K. grants-not the multilateral grants
or bilateral grants in aid, but the specific
budget balancing payments made by the U.K.
at the present time.
Finally, if I interpret my experience correctly, one of the things they are most
interested in would be the establishment of a

marketing agency in Canada. It is very hard
for us to realize the lack of staff, the lack of
professional skills, the lack of know-how that
exists in a country of merely 100,000 people,
where the premier has to look at the national
budget before he decides to take a trip to
Ottawa or to London. One can then understand the problems that they have in trying to
mount any kind of a marketing campaign in
Canada.
I have some familiarity with the tremendous costs that can be associated with the
introduction of a new product. It is completely beyond the financial capabilities of these
islands-the smaller islands-either individually or collectively, to tackle this problem.
They would welcome any suggestion from the
Canadian Government that it is prepared
to help in this and in many other matters in
which they desperately need help.
Honourable senators, I thank you for your
attention and for the time you have given me.
I hope that I may have offered a suggestion
that in the short run and in the long run will
redound to the credit of our Caribbean
friends and Canada.
Hon. Walter M. Aseline: Honourable senators, I had no intention until a short time ago
of taking part in this debate, but, after listening to the fine speech delivered by the honourable Senator Paterson, I think it is my duty
to bring to the attention of the Senate a very
serious situation that has developed in the
Prairie Provinces with respect to the marketing and storage of the 1968 crop of wheat.
Before saying anything on that subject,
however, I wish to join with other honourable senators who have so eloquently praised
our former Speaker, our new Speaker, our
former Leader of the Government in the
Senate, our distinguished new Leader, our
Leader on this side of the house, the mover
and seconder of the address and all who have
spoken in that regard.
'Honourable senators will probably remember that in the year 1966 the Prairie Provinces had the largest wheat crop ever produced: 900 million bushels. There was no
market for such a large crop, with the result
that when the elevators at the head of the
lakes, on the Pacific coast, at Churchill and in
other parts of Canada were filled, the farmers
had to store the balance on their farms. To
help them do so the Government of the day
changed the income tax regulations to provide for accelerated depreciation in cases
where farmers were obliged to build new
storage bins and granaries on their farms in

SENATE DEBATES
order to store the surplus of the grain they
could not deliver.
Those provisions provided for a depreciation of some 30 per cent a year until the
whole of the value of the new storage facilities had been wiped out. That was of great
assistance to the farmers, for they were able
to store their grain safely and in a very dry
condition. But that legislation has expired.
In 1967 we had another heavy wheat crop500 million or more bushels. But the markets
for that grain and for the 1966 surplus that
was carried over on the farms and in the
elevators was such that a great portion of the
1967 crop had also to be stored on the farm.
Well, we now have in Saskatchewan,
Manitoba and Alberta another fine crop. Last
spring those provinces sowed approximately
29 million acres of land to wheat, and there is
presently being harvested, admittedly very
slowly because of the inclement weather,
about 540 million bushels.
Most farmers have 1966 wheat on hand;
most farmers have also 1967 wheat on hand;
and they will have to store most of this year's
crop, if they are going to keep it safely. As
the quota last year for the 1967 crop was only
six bushels per specified acre, if a farmer had
a crop of 20 bushels to the acre, a great deal of
that grain had to remain on the farm because
it could not be marketed.
The situation in the Prairie Provinces at
the present moment is very serious. When I
came down to Ottawa on the train I was
surprised to see that the greater part of the
crops in Manitoba were floating around in the
water. It had rained there from the middle of
July until the llth or 12th of September, and
it has rained many times since, with the
result that a great deal of the grain is still
standing or in swath ready to be combined
when conditions dry up. This situation applies
to a lesser degree in Saskatchewan and
Alberta. For instance, I have grain on the
ground that has been swathed since about
September 20. The inclement weather has
prevented it being threshed. It has rained on
and off ever since September 20. Today,
however, I received good news; the weather
has improved and we will probably be able to
save most of that wheat, but it will not be
No. 1 wheat.

October 1. 1968

corrected in that respect. Where I mentioned
September 20, I should have said August.
Some honourable senators may not know
that if wheat is dry when it is threshed and is
put in a dry place it will keep almost indefinitely. I am told that grain taken out of the
tomb of King Tut in Egypt after 2,000 years
was sown in a field and it germinated and
produced a crop. Now, I doubt that very
much, but it illustrates the fact that if grain
is dry when it is threshed and is kept in a
dry place it will keep almost indefinitely. And
if we have a good place to store this grain
that we are about to thresh now and keep it
dry, eventually we will be able to sell it.
However, as Senator Paterson said, the grade
is low. During 1966 and 1967, we grew nothing but No. 1 wheat in my part of Saskatchewan, but this year most of the grain will
grade 3, 4 or lower.
I notice by the Saskatoon Daily Star recently that 1968 wheat is weighing only from 44
to 59 pounds to the bushel, whereas No. 1
wheat sometimes weighs as high as 64 or 65
pounds to the bushel. That is the present
situation, and it is a very serious one indeed.
Most farmers have been able to store perhaps two crops on their own land. They have
built storage over the years and they are
more or less prepared for a situation of this
kind, but not for what has happened in 1968.
They are unable to store this grain. It just
would not do to mix it with a No. 1 grain
because farmers who store this year's grain
with last year's crop run the risk of ruining
both.
I have here a statement, by Dr. R. N. Sinha, an insect ecologist with the Canada
Department of Agriculture's Research Station,
who says that this year's crop is heavily
infested with field mold. This will stimulate
reproduction of rusty grain, beatles and grain
mites. He also says there is a very real danger of widespread heating and outbreaks of
insects and mites.
Some years ago when we had a crop something like this and there was a danger of
heating we had to go to the bin every three
or four days and put a rod down to see if it
was heating; if the rod was hot when we took
it out, we had to take the grain out of the
bin, turn it over and put it back in again in

Now many farmers are asking the Governsaid September 20. Does he mean August 20,

farm by the farmer. Others are asking for
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I meant the latter part new legislation similar to what we had in
of August and September. I am glad to be 1966, whereby a farmer can build a granary

October 1, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

of a permanent nature. I say permanent as
opposed to temporary, because a temporary
bin would be no good at all. If he put
the grain into a temporary granary, before he
could take it out again and get it into the
elevators it would be spoiled. Therefore, permanent granaries should be built, and the
farmers that I have been speaking to want
legislation to the effect that they can depreciate the cost of these new granaries at a greater rate than five or 10 per cent, as they are
presently allowed under the Income Tax Act.
They want to be able to depreciate them fully
within two or three years. This is known as
accelerated depreciation.
I bring these matters to the attention of
honourable senators and to the attention of
the Government in the hope that some legislation of this kind will be passed in order to
take care of this serious situation.
Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable senators, it is not my intention to speak at any
length this afternoon, but there are one or
two matters which have not been dealt with
so far that I would like to bring to your
attention.
May I at the outset, Mr. Speaker, extend to
you my congratulations on your appointment?
I am sure that by now you feel that these
congratulations are perhaps just a formality,
but I can assure you that all of us who have
offered them have offered them most sincerely. We are sure that you, in the high office
you now hold, will live up to the high traditions established by your illustrious predecessors. In my view the Speakers of this
house have rendered great service to the
Senate, and I might add that not the least of
these was your immediate predecessor.
It is not my intention to extend congratulations to all, but I would like to say that
both the Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Martin) and the Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Flynn) are entitled to our congratulations. I remember that when I first
came here Senator Aseltine was Government
Leader, and I have always been grateful to
him for his great kindness, consideration and
courtesy to me. I might also say that I have
always had the most pleasant relations with
the leaders of both sides of this bouse. I also
want to mention particularly Senator Arthur
Beaubien, the Liberal Whip, who is a gentleman in the real sense of the word and one
who is always most considerate and courteous
to all of us. I am pleased that he bas such an
able assistant and I am sure that he too will
render valuable service in this chamber. In

fact, I believe that it is because of the work
of these two men, especially, that the business of the Senate has gone so smoothly over
the years.
Honourable senators, I want now to say a
word about the Veterans' Land Act. As you
all know, this legislation was first enacted in
1942, and it was passed in order to assist
veterans to obtain land for various purposes,
and almost al veteran are eligible under this
act for various loans.
The booklet issued by the Minister of Veterans Aff airs mentions this:
Under Parts I and III of the Act,
qualified veterans may obtain financial
assistance (repayable loans) to settle on
the land as:
1. Full-time farmers or
2. Part-time farmers (small holders); or
3. Commercial fishermen.
Part I also provides for non-repayable
conditional grants to assist qualified veterans to settle on Crown lands and to
Indian veterans to settle on Indian
Reserves.
When the act was passed in 1942 there was
no time limit, for example, as to when a
veteran could apply. The act has been amended from time to time, but I am only interested in the amendments which have set a time
limit, because back in 1959 the amending
statute stated:
No veteran is eligible to participate in
the benefits of this Part who is not certified by the Director to be qualified to
participate in the benefits of this Act
within a period of fifteen years after the
30th day of September, 1947, or the date
of his discharge, whichever is the later.
That would bring it up to 1962, when veterans could qualify for loans under this act.
In 1962 the act was further amended, to
this effect:
No veteran is eligible to participate in
the benefits of this Part who is not certified by the Director to be qualified to
participate in the benefits of this Act on
or before the 31st day of October, 1968.
So, if no further amendment is made at the
end of this month, a person is no longer
eligible.
I should say here that a person must get a
certificate that he is qualified. In other words,
the director of the Veterans' Land Act will

SENATE DEBATES
issue a certificate, when applied for by a veteran, to say that he is qualified for a loan
under Part I of the act, and it is that participation part which is terminating at the end of
this month. This does not mean to say that
the whole operation is to cease then. So long
as a veteran obtains a certificate of qualification, then he has until 1974 to obtain his
actual loan.
This act has been very beneficial; it has
been of great assistance to veterans. I should
also say here that it has been well administered. Those in charge of it have shown sympathetic consideration of the veteran. I think
everyone who has had anything to do with it
will agree with that statement, because not
only do they carry out the mechanical side of
the operation, as it were, but they are always
willing to give advice and assistance in any
way they can to the veteran.
I would like to quote briefly from the
Annual Report of the Department of Veterans
Affairs for 1967-1968. At page 42 it states:
The total of loans approved for 9,900
veterans during 1967-68 was 22 per cent
greater than in the previous year, representing an investment of public funds of
more than $102 million. Since the inception of operations under the act, the total
amount of financial assistance approved
for the settlement of veterans exceeds
$890 million. At March 31, 1968, there
were over 55,200 active accounts under
administration, approximately 2,800 more
than on the same date last year.
And this is why:
Many more veterans than expected
made application for qualification in
advance of the October 31, 1968, deadline.
Close to 40,000 were qualified, or 250 per
cent more than in 1966-67.
Reflecting the substantial increase in
qualification certificates issued during the
year, the number of veterans qualified
but not yet settled rose to more than
70,000 at March 31, 1968. It is expected
the total will approximate 100,000 by the
October 31, 1968, deadline.

October 1, 1968

year, more and more veterans are applying
for qualification. I do know this, that so many
more have applied not only for qualification
but for loans under the act, that the amount
of money voted by Parliament has run out,
and many applications cannot be processed
until more money is made available.
So, honourable senators, I believe the need
is still there and, since it is, that the act
should be further extended. I might say that
at its annual convention last summer the
Canadian Legion passed a resolution asking
for such an extension, and I see no reason
why it should not be granted.
As I said before, the operation is not to
cease. The only thing that will happen will be
that after the deadline the director will not
be able to issue certificates of qualification to
veterans. Actually, I think it would be a simple matter to amend the bill to extend the
deadline. There is to come before Parliament
an amendment to the Veterans' Land Act,
there being a resolution on the Order Paper
in the House of Commons to that effect. That
amendment has to do only with interest rates,
and it would be a simple matter to make the
other amendment at the same time. I ask the
Leader of the Government to bring this to the
attention of his colleagues in the other place,
so that the deadline can be extended, say,
until 1974.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I will do that.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: While I am talking
about veterans, I would like to say a word
about the War Veterans Allowance Act. This
too has been of great benefit to veterans
over the years. The report from which I have
already quoted has this to say:
The purpose of the War Veterans
Allowance Act is to provide allowances
for those otherwise qualified veterans
who, because of age or infirmity, are no
longer able to make their way in the
employment field. It also provides allowances to their widows and orphans. Originally passed in 1930, the act is now in its
38th year of operation.

Honourable senators, to me these figures They go on to talk of the great benefits which
prove conclusively that this act should again the War Veterans Allowance Act has brought
be amended, so as to extend the deadline to veterans, but my belief is that there are
until which time veterans can apply for certain restrictions placed on those who can

qualify under this act and I should like to see
I do not know the figures as of now, but I those restrictions removed so that any veteranticipate they are over the 100,000 mark, an is eligible for assistance under the act. A
because as it is becoming more generally person who bas served in a theatre of war

SENATE DEBATES

October 1, 1968

understand why a member of the Canadian
Army, for example, who served in Canada
only because he was not sent anywhere else,
should be ineligible for assistance under
this act.
Honourable senators, it is important that as
time goes on we recall to our minds the
sacrifices made by those men and women who
served in the Armed Forces during the various wars in which we were engaged, because
I think that as younger people grow up they
might tend to forget that these people deserve
special consideration. I am asking that that
special consideration be given to them.
Honourable senators, I thank you for your
kind attention.

SENATE DEBATES

PRIVATE BILL
BRITISH NORTHWESTERN INSURANCE COMPANY-SECOND READING
Hon. Hariland de M. Molson moved the
second reading of Bill S-9, respecting British
Northwestern Insurance Company.
He said: Honourable senators, I find myself
once more in a faintly embarrassing position
in moving second reading of this bill. It is
embarrassing in that I find that I am doing
something tonight which I have done only too
often in this chamber, namely, asking you to
listen to the explanation of a bill which you
have previously heard.
If any proof is needed that reform of the
practices in the other place is necessary, we
have it in the fact that we in this chamber
have so often had to repeat the full procedure
in dealing with a bill; that is, through the
three reading stages, the examination in
detail in our committee and, of course, all the
ancillary effort required of our staff, Hansard
reporters, the Queen's Printer, and others.
In dealing with Bill S-9, I refer honourable
senators to page 175 of Hansard of June 13,
1967, when I explained it at some length. On
this occasion I will be brief; however, I trust
that I will give you all the information which
you will require.
The petitioning company is asking for
power to do two things: first, to change its
name, and, second, to increase its capital.
The British Northwestern Insurance Company is a company which is owned by the
Eagle Star group of insurance companies of
England; very well known, of high reputation, and very large. The parent company,
The Eagle Star Insurance Company of London, England, is presently licensed to carry
on the business of general reinsurance in
Canada. It now wishes to consolidate the
Canadian operations, which have been divided in the past years, between itself and three
other companies. British Northwestern has
already taken over the operations of two of
the other companies, the British Crown Assurance Corporation Limited, and the Security
National Insurance Company. The portfolios
of both of these companies have been
absorbed into the company we are considering, British Northwestern Insurance Company. Al these companies have been engaged in
general insurance, and the process which has
been taking place is merely that of consolidating or tidying up the operations in
Canada.

Naturally, the parent company would like
to have, for the company in which its Canadian operations are now consolidated, a name
which is known all over the world, and which
bears a relationship to the parent company.
For this purpose, this bill now requests authority to change the name of the British
Northwestern Insurance Company to that of
the Eagle Star Insurance Company of Canada
with, of course, the French version of the
name Eagle Star Compagnie d'Assurance du
Canada.
As its operations will now be considerably
greater because of the fact that it bas
absorbed the portfolio of the other companies
mentioned. There is also the second purpose
of the bill, under clause 4, which requests
that the capital stock of the company be
increased. It will now be $5 million divided
into 125,000 shares of $40 each.
If it is your pleasure, honourable senators,
to give second reading to this bill now, I
would propose to refer it then to the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Honourable Mr. Molson, bill
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
NORTH ATLANTIC ASSEMBLY
COMMITTEE MEETINGS AT BRUSSELS-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

Pursuant to Order earlier this dayOn the inquiry of Honourable Mr. Lang:
That he will call the attention of the
Senate to the Standing and Preparatory
Committee Meetings of the North Atlantic Assembly, held at Brussels, Belgium,
20th May to 24th May, 1968, and in particular to the discussions and proceedings
of the Meetings and the participation
therein of the delegation from Canada.
Hon. Daniel A. Lang: Honourable senators, I
would like to report that, with my colleague
the honourable Senator Willis, I attended at
meetings of the Standing and Preparatory
Committee of the North Atlantic Assembly in
Brussels from May 20 to May 24. As honourable senators are aware, the North Atlantic
Assembly is the renamed NATO Parliamentary Association and carries on the same
functions as heretofore.

SENATE DEBATES
This evening I would like to report to you
something of the nature and extent of the
deliberations carried on in Brussels, and particularly of the coloration lent to those deliberations by the shocking events which have
transpired in Europe since that time.
Underlying the discussions at the meetings
of last May was a very present realization
that the 20th anniversary of the signing of the
North Atlantic Treaty was rapidly approaching. In fact, as honourable senators know, the
treaty was signed on April 4, 1949, and was
ratified August 24 of that year. This 20th
anniversary is of rather considerable significance because of the possible implications of
Article 13 of the treaty. Under that article it
is provided that, after the treaty has been in
force for 20 years, any party may cease to be
a party after giving notice of its denunciation
of the treaty and within one year after such
notice. In other words, after August of next
year, any one of the countries who are parties
to that treaty may give one year's notice of
its intention to withdraw from the alliance.
I think because of the provisions of that
article honourable senators will realize the
significance of some of the events, discussions
and speculations that are going on at the
present time. It should be very clearly
understood, however, that the treaty at its
inception was, as it still is, intended to be a
treaty of unlimited duration. But nevertheless
the right of withdrawal after the 20-year
period is provided for and this, of necessity,
has given rise to thoughts of reappraisal by
the parties to that treaty, particularly in the
light of the experience of the world through
the past 20 years.
It was on March 5, 1945, in a speech at
Fulton, Missouri, that Sir Winston Churchill
first raised the alarm of the Western world.
His famous "iron curtain" speech shocked the
Western world from its post-war lethargy
into a first realization of the terrors of the
rising tide of Russian imperialism.
Following this, the alliance, under the
North Atlantic Treaty, came into being for
the purposes as set out in its preamble, namely, to safeguard the freedom, common heritage, and civilization of all their peoples
founded on the principles of democracy,
individual liberty and the rule of law.
Honourable senators, this objective was
achieved by NATO and through its military
organization. The potential Soviet aggressor
bas been deterred for 20 years. By achieving
and maintaining a balance of forces between
East and West, peace for that period has been

October 1, 1968

secured. If once a first shot had been
exchanged between these balancing powers,
NATO would have failed. But, honourable
senators, no shot has been fired, and, without
qualification, I should say that the alliance is
the outstanding political-military success of
the post-war years.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lang: Now, once again, memories
are growing dim, and Munich, the pact which
was signed 30 years ago yesterday, is only a
vague lesson in history. Like the circumstances after the last war that gave rise to
NATO, Munich is a mere unexperienced
piece of history to the millions of the postwar generation. This younger generation
never having known war, and fed by the
propaganda of the communist organization
throughout the world and indeed encouraged
by the so-called leftist intellectual thought,
picture NATO as an anachronistic, aggressive, militaristic organization standing in the
way of ultimate peaceful solutions. These
thought forms query the cost of NATO to its
members, and the moneys spent on NATO
are recited as moneys spent as an alternative
to aid to underveloped countries of the world.
Canada's role in NATO is classified as subservient, an obsession, irrelevant and precluding
the development of purely Canadian foreign
policy initiatives. I think offtimes if we
scratch beneath the surface of some of these
criticisms we will find that they overlay with
a thin veneer a latent anti-Americanism. J
think that offtimes at best they represent a
utopian view of what may be accomplished
by a purely nationalistic idealism, an altruism
freed from the trammels of international
security commitments and military expenditures.
This crescendo of propaganda and criticism
that has been arising over the role of the
alliance bas both mindfully and unmindfully
been working towards creating a climate
under which denunciation of the treaty might
be brought about by some of its members in
1969 under Article XIII.
Honourable senators, again as you are
aware, in March 1966 de Gaulle decided to
withdraw France from NATO's integrated
military activities and requested the removal
from French soil of allied forces bases and
military installations. Thus in furtherance of
the glory of France did de Gaulle escalate the
effect of NATO's detractors. Narrow, backward-looking competitive nationalism again
raises its head in Europe and could as so

October 1, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

often it has in the past prove to be the curse
and scourage of that continent and the world.
As NATO stands in the way of Soviet
strategy to divide the West and play off one
faction against the other, so also does NATO
stand in the way of de Gaulle's ambitions to
dominate a European power bloc which
would exclude Great Britain, the United
States and, incidentally, Canada. In furtherance of this objective, how readily are
understood his veto on Great Britain's entry
into the Common Market, his attacks on the
United States dollar and even his intolerable
intervention in the internal affairs of our own
country. De Gaulle would be delighted to see
NATO downgraded to that of an ineffectual
police force in Europe, with the United States
and Canada excluded from its councils while
we supply France with ail the fissionable
material required to build her into a nuclear
superpower dominating Europe and holding
the balance of power between the U.S.S.R.
and the U.S.A. Honourable senators, no
secure peace can be found in this global village of ours while one of its natives holds
visions of a second Austerlitz.
In the context of these events, in 1966 the
Minister of Foreign Affairs for Belgium
proposed a broad analysis by the NATO
Alliance in the light of international events
transpiring since the signing of the Treaty.
This study resulted in what we now know as
the Harmel Report and, in essence, its conclusions are as follows-and I know that their
validity warrants their quotation:
The Atlantic Alliance today has two
main functions. Its first function is to
maintain adequate military strength and
political solidarity to deter aggression
and other forms of pressure and to
defend the territory of member countries
if aggression should occur. Since its
inception the Alliance has successfully
fulfilled this task. But the possibility of a
crisis cannot be excluded as long as the
central political issues in Europe, first
and foremost the German question
remain unsolved. Moreover the situation
of instability and uncertainty still precludes a balanced reduction of military
forces. Under these conditions the Allies
will maintain as necessary a suitable
military capability to assure the balance
of forces thereby creating a climate of
stability, security and confidence.
In this climate the Alliance can carry
out its second function, to pursue the
search for progress toward a more stable
29234-11

relationship in which the underlying
political issues can be solved. Military
security and a policy of detente are not
contradictory but complementary. Collective defence is a stabilizing factor in
world politics. It is a necessary condition
for effective policies directed towards a
greater relaxation of tensions. The way to
peace and stability in Europe rests in
particular on the use of the Alliance constructively in the interests of detente.
The participation of the U.S.S.R. and the
U.S.A. will be necessary to achieve a settlement of the political problems of
Europe.
Honourable senators, the Harmel Report
received the approval of all the ministers of
foreign affairs of the NATO countries, including that of France, in December, 1967. The
stress laid by the Harmel Report on the furtherance of detente with the Warsaw Pact
countries was lent great credence by the continually broadening trade and cultural contacts opening up between East and West
between the years 1965 and 1967 and, further,
by the signs of liberation being hopefully
seen in Rumania, Yugoslavia and, particularly, Czechoslovakia.
Last May hope was riding high that a
balanced force reduction of arms between the
NATO and Warsaw pact countries might
come about-and I stress "balanced force
reduction," as opposed to a unilateral reduction by members of the alliance alone. It was
in this atmosphere that the political, military
and economic committees of the North Atlantic Assembly met in May last. In brief, some
of the highlights of the matters discussed I
would just refer to as headings, to give you
an idea of the scope of the activities of the
committees.
There was discussion, for instance, regarding the possibility of developing a parliamentary dialogue with the Warsaw Pact countries
and their parliamentarians. Ways and means
of heightening the then atmosphere of detente
were discussed at considerable length. The
question of Greece and its position in NATO
while under the subjugation of a military
junta was under active discussion, with opinions expressed both ways. The development
of a nuclear force in Europe under a federal
control was discussed, as were the problems
concerning, and the necessity for, the entry of
the United Kingdom into the European Common Market.
The balance of payments problems, then
persisting and quite acute, in the United

SENATE DEBATES

Kingdom and the United States were discussed in papers of some length, as indeed
also was the rise of protectionist forces resulting from those balance of payments problems.
Finally-and I should say that this has
always been a concern of the Assemblythere was discussion on the failure of member
countries to meet the commitments they had
given with respect to aid to underdeveloped
nations.
I shall not mention these topics further,
because I feel that at this point it is important to underscore the fact that at the time
there was a growing and very real concern
prevalent in all of the discussions with respect to a new threat-not a portent of Czechoslovakia-but in the Mediterranean.
Honourable senators, put quite simply,
NATO has confronted force with force in
Central Europe, and this strategy has been
one hundred per cent successful, but out of
the devastating defeat of Arab aggression in
the Middle East last year by Israel, Russia,
rather than suffering a humiliating loss of
face as the technical architect of that aggression, has emerged in the Mediterranean as
the tactical victor. Russia is turning the
southern fiank of NATO. There this historically continental land force is emerging as a
maritime power second only to that of the
United States. With the Suez Canal blocked,
the Bosphorus rivals the Straits of Gibraltar
as access to domination of the Mediterranean.
Where does this leave Italy, Greece and Turkey, which are absolutely dependent upon
seaborne supply through the Mediterranean?
Morocco and Syria are now ideologically
infiltrated by communism. Egypt has about
250 jet fighters and 90 new bombers. About
3,000 Soviet officers are in Egypt to train the
Egyptian armed forces. Above all, full-scale
Soviet fleets are now established in the Mediterranean with bases in Alexandria, Port
Said, and the Syrian port of Latakia. In
Algeria the abandoned French naval base of
Mers-il-kebir is subject to Soviet overtures,
as, indeed, is Malta, recently vacated by
Great Britain.
The avowed purpose of these naval forces
in the Mediterranean is to drive the United
States Sixth Fleet from that sea.
How will NATO respond to this threat?
The Russians are watching with great
interest.
What even greater catastrophic events have
transpired since May? The brutal smothering
by Russia and her Warsaw Pact allies of
Czechoslovakia's moves towards liberation

October 1, 1968

needs no underscoring. Like Churchill's Fulton
speech, and even more dramatically, it has
ripped away the civilized mask with which
the Soviets were fooling an increasing number of the gullible academics and many of the
new generation. The sacrifice of the brave
Czech nation is again, as at Munich, the
redemptive price for our own lack of
vigilance.
The Russian military occupation of Czechoslovakia was accomplished with an alacrity and precision which astounded western
observers. Imagine if it had been East
Germany rather than Czechoslovakia this
time and NATO had been downgraded or dissolved. Would a West Germany freed of its
NATO controls stood still? Can anyone imagine a more classical inception for a nuclear
Armageddon? What a small price we, in
Canada, pay to play an even small part in
helping to deter our ultimate destruction.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lang: Honourable senators we
cannot forget that over us will fiy nuclear
missiles directed against the United States
and over us will be exploded nuclear missiles
American

intercepted
are
which
Anti-I.C.B.M.'s.
Our stake in world politics is as vital to us
as to any other nation in the world.
Now, honourable senators, I do not wish to
bore you, but I know that you are probably
as concerned as I have been in the past few
weeks by reading the press and reading reports of events that are transpiring daily,
momentous events which receive rather scant
notice and are out of perspective in the reports we receive. For instance, one of them
that I picked up the other day in the Toronto
Star had the headline:
DeGaulle tells Bonn he won't help NATO
in face of Czech crisis-his visit came
just hours after France vetoed a West
German plan to allow Britain into the
Common Market-for the third time.
Ten days ago the Toronto Telegram reported the National President of the Voice of
Women as saying:
Canada should reduce its commitments to
NATO despite Soviet invasion of Czechoslavakia. By remaining in NATO and
stepping up military commitments Canada would help accelerate the arms race.

October 1, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

On September 24 the Montreal Gazette
said:
The $14 million reduction in the 1969-70
defence budget under the revised spending estimates tabled in the Commons
Wednesday (last week) is being achieved
by administrative cuts in all commands
of the armed forces except Ottawa headquarters, and a $1 million cut to $15,300,000 in mutual aid for Canada's NATO
partners.
We have heard statements by prominent
political men with respect to the reappraisal
of our NATO role and always the undertone
has carried that such an appraisal would be
to downgrade that role.
Another headline in the Montreal Gazette:
Canada's position still big concern
to NATO allies. Mr. Sharp made it clear
that the Canadian review of NATO commitments inspired the representation
(from the Secretary General of NATO)
and that these were directed specifically
and appropriately to Canada as the only
country with such a review in progress.
Honourable senators, at the risk of being
tedious, on my way to Ottawa today I read in
the Toronto Telegram this account which I
think in a rather pithy way summarizes the
situation today:
Soviet moves in the Middle East and
Mediterranean are seen as part of a vast
plan to establish Russia as the unchallenged master of eastern Europe and
parts of the Middle East, in the expectation that the U.S. government will still
hesitate to take any counter-action, tied
up as it is in Vietnam and with the forthcoming presidential elections.
Warning signs include the strengthening of the Soviet fleet in the Mediterranean-raised to 48 vessels, including
the arrival of a Russian aircraft carrier
-the use of the powerful naval harbor of
Mers-el-Kebir, built by the French but
now abandoned to the Algerian republic
which is increasing its co-operation with
Moscow; more Soviet military aid to
Egypt; Moscow's harsh warning to Israel,
and the round trip to the Communist
capitals of Eastern Europe of the Soviet
commander-in-chief
Marshal
Yakoubovski.
29234-11J

The French were impressed last week
with what West German Chancellor Kiesinger told them about his fears of coming Russian aggression, with Russian divisions in Czechoslovakia now standing
close to the borders of Bavaria.
The Israeli government, without too
much hope, has been pressing the French
government for delivery of the Mirage
planes suspended by France after the sixday war last year. So far Israeli Foreign
Minister Eban has not shaken the French
attitude of strict "neutrality."
"In Europe the post-war period is definitely behind us," a diplomat commented
this week. "We have entered a new prewar era."
Honourable senators, these pronouncements
will continue to create grave concern among
those of our people who see the world as it
really is, one very small interdependent
whole. They are of concern to those who realize that only in maintenance of alliances both
militarily and economic can the Western
world work towards peace. Perhaps, to put
some matters in perspective, it would be useful, if I could mention a few cost factors
involved. The revised Estimates tabled in the
House of Commons last week removed $13,637,000 from the defence budget, leaving the
total at $1,715,954,000.
I think the important point regarding this
$1,750,000,000 total is that only $150 million is
represented by the cost to us of maintaining
10,000 men in Europe under NATO. That is
8.6 per cent of our total defence expenditure.
In other words, the cost of maintaining our
one mechanized infantry brigade and six
strike reconnaissance squadrons in Europe
amounts, in round figures, to less than 10 per
cent of our total defence budget. Under these
circumstances, if Canada wants to maintain
more or less its present posture in world
affairs and its present relationship with the
United States, then it is already at the minimum of what must be done in the military
field abroad. On the other hand, we have the
alternative of withdrawal, losing whatever
influence we may now have, particularly in
maintaining a U.S. commitment in Europe
and in the process becoming a gigantic Sweden or Iceland in a politic-military sense.
Already our defence expenditures as a percentage of our G.N.P. have dropped from 9
per cent in 1953 to 4 per cent in 1965, at that
date lower than any other NATO country
except Belgium, Denmark, and Luxembourg.

SENATE DEBATES
We are at the bare minimum now in the
world as it is today.
Honourable senators I would like to deal
briefly with a point which causes me, and I
am sure you, great concern. I am convinced
that to regard our NATO commitment as an
alternate to aid to underdeveloped countries,
is the grossest form of sophistry. Regarding
our international target of 1 per cent of the
G.N.P., we fell short in 1967, reaching only .44
per cent.
Honourable senators, you can see further
that if we switched our total NATO expenditure into aid, we would increase it by the
merest fraction in terrns of our gross national
product, while our target must be-and we
should strive towards it-an increase of 5.6
per cent, to reach our 1 per cent target. I
hope that some of these comparisons will help
to put these matters in perspective.
Honourable senators, I have some conclusions that I would like to outline to you
briefly. I must say that they are only personal
conclusions-conclusions of a relatively uninformed person, but J put them before you for
what they are worth.
Honourable senators, it is my opinion that,
without question, France's foreign policy is
inimical to the best interests of the western
powers, including Canada. Canada should
bend every effort to influence that foreign
policy, little though it may be, and perhaps
waiting patiently for a change in government
over there. Our efforts should be directed
towards the return of France to full membership in the NATO Alliance. Our efforts should
be to assist in overcoming France's veto of
the United Kingdom's entry into the common
market-all directed towards the maintenance
of a strong united European alliance, dominated neither by France, the U.S.A. nor West
Germany.
Ionourable senators, if by any chance we
can develop leverage to these ends, through
our control over sale to France of fissionable
materials-plutonium and uranium-let us
not hesitate to use that leverage to the full.
Secondly, I am convinced that the United
States does not want to dominate the Mediterranean with its Sixth Fleet, but peace in
that troubled part of the world is unlikely to
be maintained through the United Nations
today. Joint national naval efforts can create
stability without the political stigma attached
to operations by one of the super powers
alone. The United States has suggested the
constitution of a NATO Mediterranean fleet,
perhaps based on Malta. Canada should support this concept. We, and I apply this also to

October 1, 1968

Great Britain, can lend little real naval might
to such a force but sometimes the balance in
decisions of this nature is so delicate that
often a positive position by a minor power
can turn the tide.
I might say, in this connection, that Russia
may be a net importer of oil by 1973. Perhaps
some of her aspirations in the Middle East in
this light may be understandable and I think
that if legitimate they must be met. However,
domination of the Mediterranean for purely
imperialistic reasons could spell the end of
the effectiveness of the alliance by simply
turning its southern flank quickly, with the
most dangerous consequences to all of us in
the western world, but particularly to Israel,
Turkey, Italy and Greece.
A NATO presence is a weapon in the battle
for the minds of men and nowhere is such a
battle now being waged more vigorously than
in the Middle East.
Honourable senators, thirdly, I think a
reappraisal by Canada of the role of NATO is
timely, but such a reappraisal must be coldblooded and realistic and with a clear
appreciation of the implications of the events
in Czechoslovakia. We are still part of a very
interdependent western world and to detach
ourselves therefrom is to deny ourselves a
place at its councils and to relegate ourselves
to relative politico-military obscurity.
A re-affirmation at this time of our clear
intention to be and remain a full partner in
the alliance would dispel the doubts now
entertained by our allies and give NATO a
new impetus quite out of proportion to our
relative contribution. In my opinion, this
should be done now by this Government.
Honourable senators, it may very well be
that the military apparatus of our NATO
forces is obsolete or inadequate, or that maximum utilization of our role is not being realized. Such possibilities should ba the subject
matter of reappraisal; but let no one tell us
that Canada can perform its function as a
member of the alliance by utilizing only
troops stationed in Canada and available for
transport to Europe. I submit we could not or
would not get them on the spot in time. The
rapid deployment of 200,000 Russian troops
into Czechoslovakia confirms this. The fact is
that it is the actual physical presence of
troops in Europe that maintains the morale of
the people there and deters the making of an
aggressive decision by Russia, an aggressive
decision that would gamble on the mutual
avoidance of nuclear weapons.

October 1, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Finally, honourable senators, I fail to
understand why Canada's full commitment to
NATO should in any wise inhibit her initiatives for independent policies in other fields.
As I said earlier, the argument that NATO
and aid are alternatives is spurious in view of
the relative cost factors. A strong NATO,
with our participation, far from lessening the
chances of detente with the Warsaw Pact
countries and an ultimate balanced reduction
of forces, in fact creates the conditions under
which that is most likely to come about.
Mutual respect and confidence may take a
long time in coming, but it will never come if
the west exhibits disunity, equivocation and
lack of resolve. Such merely confirms the
views of the west held by many communist
countries and encourages their hopes. From
strength alone can we bargain successfully.
Honourable senators, in closing, I would
say to you that peace, with its connotation of
finality and its overtone of the everlasting,
we may never again see on this little space
ship earth. But liberty and the absence of war
we likely can maintain by constantly, continually and perhaps indefinitely striving and
paying for it. Honourable senators, I think it
is worth it.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Holleit: Honourable senators, in
view of the excellent speech we have heard
from a senator for whom we all have the
greatest admiration, I do not know if there is
need to ask this question, but I would ask it
so that his answer will be known: Is he in
agreement with the recent sale of fissionable
material to France?
Hon. Mr. Lang: Honourable senators, all I
know is what I have read in the newspapers.
From the account given this morning of the
details of the contract, I would say it imposes
a limitation on the use of that plutonium to
peaceful purposes. That is consistent with the
policy which the Canadian Government has
pursued with France in connection with the
sale of atomic material up to date.
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, I
had not intended to take part in this discussion at this time but as a member of the
Government I feel I should make a few
observations.
First of all, I wish to join in the commendation already extended to Senator Lang for
his careful and responsible statement. His
speech this evening is a good justification for

meetings of members of parliamentary bodies
from countries which belong to NATO. The
preparatory meeting of the North Atlantic
Assembly was designed to give members of
Parliament in the 15 NATO countries the
opportunity to learn of developments in the
NATO alliance.
We have had from Senator Lang tonight a
good demonstration of the value of these ad
hoc arrangements to enable parliamentary
bodies to get better information about the
workings of NATO. I very warmly congratulate Senator Lang on an outstanding speech.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Martin: As he said, the meeting
which he attended last May preceded the
serious events in Czechoslovakia a few
months ago. I had something to say when I
first spoke in this bouse two weeks ago about
the implications of the invasion by the Soviet
Union of Czechoslovakia, an invasion which
was clearly contrary to international law and
the charter of the United Nations. It was an
event of great significance for the NATO
alliance. I think the members of the alliance
comported themselves wisely and prudently
in the situation. They were concerned, as we
all must be concerned, about any exacerbation of a situation that could engulf our
world. This does not mean to say that the
ambassadors of the 15 countries at the NATO
council were not engaged in serious consideration of what the invasion of Czechoslovakia meant; it does not mean that the governments of the 15 countries were not equally
industrious in assessing the implications of
the invasion. We may assume that these
assessments were made by the NATO council
and by the individual governments. In fact,
this matter will continue to engage the NATO
council and the NATO governments, and particularly will they be concerned about any
possible repetition of these events in other
countries-not that any repetition is apparent
or, so far as I know, intended. But these are
matters that obviously must be of concern to
NATO and to all the countries concerned.
It is important that there should be the
widest public discussion in Canada of our
membership in the alliance. That discussion is under way. Article 13, as we have
been reminded, provides that in 1969, after 20
years of NATO's existence as an alliance, any
member state in the alliance may give notice
of intention to withdraw from the organization.

SENATE DEBATES

There is no indication whatsoever, and no
reason for believing, that that is the course
which Canada will follow simply because
Canada is now engaged in a program of reappraisal. I am sure that honourable senators
will understand that I can go no further
tonight than to say that we are engaged in a
reappraisal of our NATO obligations. The
Prime Minister said the other day that there
was no intention to avoid our commitments,
but that does not preclude us from examining
the nature of our military commitment. It
does not preclude us from determining in
what way we can make our greatest contribution to an alliance which we believe has
served an essential purpose, that of maintaining peace in Europe, by providing the stability
without which it might not have been possible
to maintain peace in Europe.
No one should doubt the value of NATO.
What we have to understand is that NATO
came into being 20 years ago, at a time when
a large portion of our population was not contemporary with it and which is not now as
freshly aware of its meaning as those of us
who were adults at the time it became a commitment for Canada and the 14 other countries.
Certainly, Canada's association with NATO
from the beginning has been an intimate one.
I well remember sitting behind the then
Secretary of State for External Affairs, Mr.
St. Laurent, in the first committee of the
United Nations when we joined our voice
with others in declaring that the military
arrangements in the United Nations were
such as to make it necessary, in the interests
of our security, for like-minded nations to
provide a defensive mechanism, not then
available to them under the Charter of the
United Nations. In this declaration Mr. St.
Laurent was giving expression to his support
of the formation of a defence alliance of
Western nations to protect certain powers
against the armed might of the Soviet Union.
Article 43 of the charter of the United
Nations was intended to provide that body
with the necessary machinery for a common
defence and a common security. Because of
the intransigence at that time of the Soviet
Union, we had open to us seemingly no other
option but to form a defensive alliance, as
indeed one was formed. Canada from the
beginning was one of the early participants
and one of the originators of that alliance.
I think it should be clear that France has
not withdrawn from the alliance. France has
decided not to share in the integrated force

October 1, 1968

structure. France does not accept the concept
of an integrated command, but she continues
to be a member of the alliance and has
affirmed her commitment with regard to article 5 of the treaty, which provides an
arrangement to assist any partner country
who may be the victim of an aggressor. In this
connection it is important to note in passing
that General de Gaulle said two days ago,
following his discussions with Chancellor
Kiesinger, that France did not propose to sit
by if there was an aggression by the Soviet
Union against West Germany.
My strong view is that, while France does
not support the integrated force structure
or the integrated command arrangement, nevertheless, it is not likely to leave the alliance.
And there are reasons for this conclusion. We have the observation of General de
Gaulle only the other day in Bonn, that any
undue insistence on the part of any Common
Market country for the inclusion of the United Kingdom in the Common Market could
very well cause France to give second
thoughts to what she would do in the twentieth year. My belief, as I say, is that there
are many reasons why France will continue
in the alliance. But it is for each country to
determine whether it is prepared to accept
certain military commitments at a certain level. It is up to each country to determine in
accordance with its sovereign power what it
proposes to do by way of giving notice in the
twentieth year.
I would not want now to anticipate what
will be the position of Canada. I would
not want my words to be construed as meaning anything other than that all we are doing
now is to engage in a process of reappraisal
of our position-not only with regard to
NATO but with regard to many other aspects
of our foreign policy. Any Foreign Office
must be continually engaged in making an
assessment of its foreign policy. This applies
to NATO as well as to other areas of foreign
policy. We are now engaged in that appraisal,
and when the assessment has been completed,
the Government will be in a position to make
known its views.
Honourable Senator Lang referred to the
Harmel Study, named after the present
Foreign Minister of Belgium. In 1965 Canada
proposed to the Council of Foreign Ministers
of NATO that the time had come when there
should be an examination of the state of the
alliance. I had the responsibility of stating the
Canadian case, anticipating somewhat the
very kind of examination now under way in
Canada. After the intervention of General de

October 1, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Gaulle in April 1965, when he called for the
withdrawal of American and Canadian forces
in France, and the decision of the French
Government no longer to participate in the
integrated force structure and common command arrangements, we decided this study
should not be proceeded with until we had a
better appreciation of what the French action
meant.
However, in 1966, with our support, the
Government of Belgium called upon the
NATO foreign ministers to engage in a study
of the state of the alliance. As Senator Lang
has pointed out, the result of that study was
to give emphasis to the importance of a common military contribution and to recognize
the political importance of trying to
bring about an easing in the tension that prevailed between East and West; in other
words, to try and promote detente between
the Soviet Union and the Western powers.
The emphasis was shifted from the military
to the political, not that there was a failure to
recognize the importance of the former, but
rather that there was a recognition of the
growing importance of trying to move
towards some arrangement with the Warsaw
Pact powers, with a view ultimately to reaching a stage of mutual disengagement in
Europe itself, something that many of us
believe could happen in spite of Czechoslovakia, perhaps if the war in Vietnam came
to an end.
In any event in 1966 ai 15 countries,
including France, resolved that they would
give added emphasis to this political role.
They encouraged bilateral relations between
NATO countries and the Soviet Union and
other Eastern European countries. It was pursuant to that that the Government of Canada
decided that I as Secretary of State for External Affairs in the fall of that year should visit
Poland and Moscow with a view to trying
to improve our respective relations and
promote detente generally. Most of the
foreign ministers of the NATO countries that
year, either before or immediately thereafter,
exchanged similar visits with the Soviet
Union, Poland and other Eastern European
countries. In the case of Canada these visits
were confined to the two countries, the Soviet
Union for obvious reasons and Poland
because she shared with Canada and India
the responsibility of membership on the
International Control Commission in Vietnam.
I am sure the prudent view is that notwithstanding the situation in Czechoslovakia,

grave as that event is-and I think that is the
adjective to use-we must recognize the ultimate danger to our world unless we reach a
period when the evolution of the detente
reaches its maturity. If there is no hope of
that ever happening-and I am not one who
shares that view-then of course there is no
hope for our world. I do not believe that we
can take that defeatist position.
I agree fully with what Senator Lang has
said; collective defence is a stabilizing force
and Canada is strongly committed to the
principle of collective security. The principle
of collective security is basic to the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization. Collective
security is basic to the concept of the alliance,
the phrase which General de Gaulle prefers,
and collective security is basic to the concept
of the United Nations. It is one of the cardinal principles of Canadian foreign policy to
give support to the principle of collective
security.
If we are now making an assessment of our
position with regard to some of these collective security arrangements, there need be no
final conclusions drawn. That, as I said a
moment ago, is an understandable, sensible
arrangement for any government to make,
whether it be a new government or one that
has been in office for some time. Even governments that are in office for continuous periods are continually reassessing their positions
in many areas of foreign policy. We are not
only assessing our position in NATO, we are
examining our position with regard to our
relations with mainland China, and with
regard to the position of that country as a
potential member of the United Nations, not
because we share the ideological bent of
mainland China but because we realize that
in the interdependent world in which we live,
if peace is ever going to be attained, we have
to take into account the existence in that
world of all the states who compose it.
We had a visit the other day from the
Secretary-General of NATO, Mr. Manlio
Brosio. No far-reaching conclusions should be
drawn from that visit. He did not come here
because we were engaged in a reappraisal of
our position in NATO. This was an annual
visit, one he makes to each of the 15 countries, affording himself as well as the government receiving him an opportunity to
exchange views with regard to problems that
have to be faced in common by the members
of the alliance.
I agree fully with what Senator Lang said,
that it is not wise to equate our military

SENATE DEBATES
commitment to NATO to the obligation that
faces Canada and other donor countries with
respect to obligations we have to assist the
underdeveloped nations of the world. Whether we are in NATO or whether we have
heavy military expenditures, that does not
relieve us of our obligation at this particular
time in human history to give assistance
bilaterally and multilaterally to the underdeveloped nations of the world. While there
may have been reductions in our military
expenditures, our assistance and the increase
in that assistance to underdeveloped countries
have not been dependent upon the reductions
which have taken place during the last five
years.
If we increased our military expenditures
on NATO, that would not relieve us, in my
judgment or in the judgment of the Government, of our obligation to share with the
other countries in the OECD to help the
nations in Latin America, in Asia and in
Africa to reach more comparable standards of
living, in order to remove the occasion of
conflict, to remove the indirect causes, at
least, of localized conflict. So, I agree that our
NATO commitments are not an alternative to
foreign aid, even though that is often put
forward as the reason why we should make
military reductions.
I am sure that Senator Lang did not mean
that we should urge the return of France to
NATO. France has not left NATO; France
continues to support the alliance. Its foreign
minister continues to participate in the discussions of foreign ministers and of the
representatives of the 15 countries that are in
continuous session. I, for one, would regard
as a tragedy if France, notwithstanding the
fact she does not share our view of the value
of the integrated force structure, were to go
one step further and remove herself completely from participation in the alliance.
So, I agree, honourable senators, with most
of what Senator Lang bas said, and said so
well. If it were not for the fact we are now
engaged in a reassessment, I would go even
further, but, as a member of a Government
engaged in this re-examination, I can go no
further than I have tonight.
There is no intention of Canada avoiding its
commitments. We are simply engaged now in
re-examining our position, in terms of expenditure, in terms of other foreign policy
implications. I would hope that there would
be a general recognition in Canada of the
value of the kind of discussion which bas

October 1. 1968

been initiated by Senator Lang-a discussion
that took place during the course of the election, a discussion that is taking place now in
the academic community and elsewhere in
our country, and is now somewhat under cover, naturally, within the cabinet itself; but an
assessment there that does not warrant some
of the conclusions that have been drawn from
the fact that we are making this assessment.
I have long been a believer, as honourable
senators are generally, in the charter of the
United Nations. As a younger man, I was a
believer in the League of Nations. I am a firm
believer in the principle of collective security.
The world in which we live is one that I am
sure underscores the strength of the principle
of collective security. We did not join NATO
because we thought it was going to be a permanent organization. We helped create it
because we felt the United Nations at that
time was not strong enough on the military
side to guarantee our security. We long for
the day when the United Nations will become
strong enough to make it unnecessary for
these regional arrangements to exist-regional military arrangements which, by the way,
come within the permissive authority given to
those arrangements by the charter of the
United Nations.
I thank Senator Lang for initiating this discussion. As I said earlier, I hope that in this
chamber we will have many opportunities to
review these matters. The fact that our agenda is not so heavily charged imposes a special
responsibility on us, as I think it does on no
other body in Canada, to discuss these matters, to discuss them as we see them.
Every honourable senator in this chamber,
with the exception of myself as Government
spokesman, bas an unfettered freedom to discuss these matters as though he were outside
the precincts of Parliament. It is out of discussion that the democratic process portrays
itself as a mighty instrument. It is because I
believe that firmly that I welcome the discussion which Senator Lang initiated this
evening.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, I
move the adjournment of the debate.
Hon. Mr. Aird: Honourable senatorsHon. Mr. Flynn: If the honourable Senator
Aird wishes to speak, I am willing to yield.
Hon. Mr. Aird: I wish to move the adjournment of the debate.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: That makes three on
the same side.

SENATE DEBATES

The Hon. the Speaker: It is moved by the
honourable Senator Flynn, seconded by the
honourable Senator Aird, that this debate be
adjourned until the next sitting. Is it your
pleasure, honourable senators, that this
motion be adopted?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
CANADIAN OVERSEAS TELECOMMUNICATION CORPORATION ACT

BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING
Hon. Leopold Langlois moved the second
reading of Bill S-5, to amend the Canadian
Corporation
Telecommunication
Overseas
Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
simple enough, as it proposes three amendments which one could categorize as of a
housekeeping nature.
When the Canadian Overseas Telecommunication Corporation expropriated the assets of the Canadian Marconi Company in
1950, as it was empowered to do under the
terms of the C.O.T.C. Act, included in those
assets were the antenna and the H.F. radio
equipment used to provide telephone service
between Canada and Newfoundland which,
until Newfoundland became the tenth province, had been an overseas or external service. It was not practical to omit from the
total expropriation this single item and,
accordingly, Bill C-12, introduced in the
House of Commons in 1949 and assented to on
November 25, of that year, providing for the
establishment of Canadian Overseas Telecommunication Corporation, specifically included
the rights to operate between Canada and
Newfoundland.
Under this authority the Corporation continued to provide the service through the
limited facilities then available, but it
immediately planned to provide for substantial expansion to meet the growing demand
for telephone service between Newfoundland
and the mainland of Canada.
Eventually, however, it was decided that
the Newfoundland service should more properly be in the hands of a domestic carrier,
and, after some lengthy negotiations with
Canadian National Telecommunications, the
Corporation transferred the operations to the
former, effective January 1, 1966, and leased
to C.N.T. for 15 years some 48 circuits in the
short Grosses Roches-Corner Brook segment
of the transatlantic telephone cable, CANTAT. These circuits were in excess of the
29234-12

number then capable of being provided on
the longer transatlantie section between
Oban, Scotland and Corner Brook, Newfoundland, and were, therefore, specially
provided by the Corporation for telephone
purposes between Newfoundland and the
mainland.
In view of this transfer of responsibility for
the service to Canadian National Telecommunications, there is no longer any need to
provide for it in the Canadian Overseas Telecommunication Act, and so the appropriate
amendments in clauses 1 and 2 of the bill are
being proposed.
With respect to the third proposed amendment, the original clause 3, being subsection 2
of section 8 of the act, imposed very restrictive limits on the board of directors of the
Corporation with respect to placing contracts,
entering into agreements, disposal of assets,
and so on. At the time of writing the act
these were perhaps reasonable enough, but
with the changing values over the past 18
years, and the fact that the Corporation has
made such important progress in overseas
telecommunications in the national interest,
the originally authorized capital of $4,500,000
has been greatly exceeded to provide for the
introduction of considerably expanded and
modern equipment, including new multichannel cables across the Atlantic and the
Pacific, a share in the global satellite system,
and so forth. The limitation of $50,000 on
spending by the directors without prior
approval of the Governor in Council is completely outmoded, too restrictive, and wasteful of time, involving as it does considerable
and unnecessary time and paper work by the
Corporation, the Department of Transport,
and the Treasury Board. Much time and labour will be saved by increasing the amounts
which the board of directors may approve
without reference.
Honourable senators, these proposed amendments to the Canadian Overseas Telecommunication Act are recommended for your
consideration and approval.
Hon. Donald Smith: Honourable senators, I
cannot let this opportunity pass to make some
personal observations in respect of one phase
of the operations of the Canadian Overseas
Telecommunication Corporation, the subject
of this bill.
The honourable sponsor of this bill, Senator
Langlois, made a passing reference to the
participation by this Crown corporation, the
Canadian Overseas Telecommunication Corporation, in the global satellite system.

SENATE DEBATES
However, I think most of us would be
interested to learn that the first Canadian
earth satellite station was finished several
years ago at a location about ten miles from
my home town of Liverpool, Nova Scotia. It
was, by the way, the subject of some rather
critical comment by the Auditor General a
year or so ago when he included it in his
many references to sloppy budgeting by Government departments. He referred to the fact
that the actual cost of this earth satellite station far exceeded the original estimate. I am
sure that if he or his staff had been down
there during construction days, and had
talked with those who developed this particular project, they would have realized that this
was one project the cost of which no company
could have controlled. It was completely
experimental.
As a matter of fact, when the first phase of
this earth satellite station was constructed it
was called "Earth Satellite Station (Experimental)". The Government and the C.O.T.C.
had decided some time previously to go ahead
with this earth satellite station so that Canada
could participate in a meaningful way in
what all the experts in the field regarded as a
great opportunity for expanding communications around the world. It was estimated that
the cost would be in the vicinity of $6 million
or $7 million. I think that figure rose to close
to $10 million before completion.
I am sure that the Auditor General, and all
honourable senators, will be pleased to learn,
as I was pleased to learn some time ago, that
this enterprise, which was entered into with
the support of Treasury Board at that time,
has been a complete success in every way,
shape and form.
In the first place, it is no longer referred to
as an experimental earth satellite station. It is
a truly commercial station, and has been for
the last year or so. I am informed that it is
making the usual profit which has accrued to
all other operations of this well-run Crown
corporation.
As honourable senators can see, I have no
prepared statement on this subject. I did not
know that it was going to be raised tonight.
But I take this opportunity of telling the
house that the scientific and technical personnel who came into our community in that
part of Nova Scotia have proved to be a
valuable addition to the life of that general
area. Not only have they brought their wisdom in their technical fields, but they have
brought a willingness and a real desire to
participate in all the affairs of the community

October 1, 1968

in churches, service clubs, charitable organizations, youth movements and other endeavours. We welcome that very much, and for
that reason I am glad that this area was
chosen for the erection of this earth satellite
station.
The employment that was provided for our
local tradesmen and craftsmen was of great
importance. The construction of the station
provided a significant amount of employment
at reasonably good wages, and it has been
worthwhile from that standpoint. It has also
provided an outlet for the skills of the local
people, in allowing them to participate with
more highly trained technical people in the
maintenance and operation of this station.
There is presently under construction a
unit of this station which is going to cost
quite a large sum of money, although it will
probably be much less than the cost of the
original station. The first station bas been an
entire success, and the second station is
required because of the increased load of
communications material in various forms
that is flowing through that station and on to
the communications network of this whole
continent.
I would say to those honourable senators
who some day may be visitors to that particular area of Nova Scotia that as they go along
the main highway from Halifax, and get close
to the town of Liverpool, they will see in the
distance a rather eerie sight. That is the shining film on the inflated sphere which houses
the antenna used in tracking the signals from
the satellite which at certain stated periods of
the day passes overhead. Visitors are welcomed at the site. There are window slots
provided at the car park, through which one
may look into the sphere and see what is
going on. One gets a rather uncomfortable
feeling as he looks into a world of fantasy.
Another addition, that is now found to be
necessary, is the construction of a cable that
will lead from the station down to the shore
line and across the water to make a connection to a similar satellite station located in the
interior of the State of Maine.
This whole operation has been such a huge
success that someone in a public place should
have an opportunity, as I have had tonight, to
congratulate those scientists and technicians
who have made Canada's participation in the
new world of communications so effective,
and in an area of which I am generally very
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

October 1, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators,
we are indebted to the sponsor of this bill
(Hon. Mr. Langlois) for his clear explanation
and also to Senator Smith (Queens-Shelburne)
for telling us something of the excellent job
which Canadian Overseas Telecommunications Corporation is doing.
This bill has two purposes, as has been
explained by the sponsor. The first one is
very interesting, because it suggests that after
nearly twenty years in Confederation, Newfoundland, upon the adoption of this bill, will
be considered as part of Canada in the field
of telecommunication services. It is about
time such an event happened, and I am sure
all honourable senators share this view.
The second amendment would place in
the Governor in Council's power the regulation concerning the limits under which the
corporation will be acting in its spending and
in the acquisition of real and personal property. At present the act provides that:
Unless the approval of the Governor in
Council is first obtained, the Corporation
shall not
(a) enter into an agreement involving
expenditure in excess of fifty thousand
dollars;
(b) enter into for a period exceeding
three years any agreement or lease that
involves an expenditure in any year of
more than five thousand dollars; or
(c) acquire any real or personal property, the cost of acquisition of which
exceeds the sum of fifty thousand
dollars . . .

Perhaps the sponsor of the bill will move
that it be referred to a standing committee,
where I hope we will be able to get the
required information, and if it is found not to
be satisfactory we would wish to move an
amendment.
The Hon. the Speaker: May I inform the
honourable senators that if the mover
(Honourable Mr. Langlois) speaks now it will
have the effect of closing the debate.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators,
the Leader of the Opposition has pointed to
the apparent delay of 20 years in introducing
this legislation, and has wrongly related the
proposed amendments to the entry of Newfoundland into Confederation.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Not at all.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: As I explained in my
opening remarks, this measure is the result of
a change in the communication system
between Canada and Newfoundland, and it
was only in January 1966.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I spoke with tongue in
cheek, but you did not see it.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: It was only 1966 that
the change took place in the operations which
were up to that time performed by the
Canadian Overseas Telecommunications Corporation, and which are now performed by
the Canadian National Telecommunications.
As regards the reference of this bill to a
committee, I must inform my honourable
friends now that it is my intention to propose
that this bill be referred to the Standing
Committee on Transport and Communications.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

The purpose of this amendment is not too
clear to me. After all, it simply will transpose
into regulations the principles which are
embodied in the law. We are not exactly in
the field of technical matters. We have a corporation which is doing a very definite job,
which has precise responsibilities, and I do

SECOND

READING

Hon. Leopold Langlois moved the second
reading of Bill C-108, for granting to Her
Majesty certain sums of money for the public
service for the financial year ending 31st
March, 1969.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is a
simple one indeed. It merely seeks authority
for expenditures already contained in the
Revised Estimates tabled in this chamber
yesterday, and which were referred to the
Standing Committee on Finance.

October 2, 1968

This bill will provide, in respect of the
Revised Estimates for 1968-69; (a) ninetwelfths of all items to be voted in those
estimates, or a total amount of $4,852,052,274.75; (b) an additional two-twelfths of the
following special items: Energy, Mines and
Resources, Vote No. 60; Finance, Vote No. 30;
Legislation, Vote 15; Public Works, Vote Nos.
25 and 30; Secretary of State, Vote No. 2;
Transport, Votes 15, 25 and 90; Treasury
Board, Vote 25; Loans, Investments and
Advances, Votes L35 and L125. These votes,
which are more specifically described in
Schedule A of the bill, total $35,666,416.67.
And (c) an additional one-twelfth of special
items as follows: Agriculture, Vote 15; Energy, Mines and Resources, Vote 75; Indian
Affairs and Northern Development, Vote 34;
National Defence, Votes 20 and 50; Privy
Council, Vote 15; Regional Development, Vote
25; Secretary of State, Votes 1 and 65; and
Transport, Vote 5. These votes, which are
specifically detailed in Schedule B of the bill,
total $6,681,409.50.
The grand total of these items is $4,894,400,100.92, from which must be deducted the
amounts already authorized by Appropriation
Act No. 2, assented to on March 28 last in
respect of the Main Estimates referred to in
the act and amounting to $1,118,202,797.17,
leaving a net amount provided in the present
bill of $3,776,197,303.75.
Honourable
senators,
the
proportions
requested in this bill are intended to provide
for all necessary requirements of the Public
Service up to December 31 next. In no
instance is the total amount as shown in the
revised estimates for 1968-69 being released
by this bill. This bill was prepared in so far
as possible in the form with which honourable senators have become familiar over the
past several years, but some change has been
required this year as a consequence of the
revision of the original Estimates. The former
appropriation act released supply on the basis
of the amounts shown in the Estimates. Those
Estimates have been replaced by the Revised
Estimates, and cannot be used as the basis for
further supply.
This bill, therefore, bas been drafted in the
manner which will relate previously authorized supply, as well as the additional supply
requested for June to December, to the
Revised Estimates which were tabled in the
other chamber on September 25, last Wednesday, and in this chamber yesterday.
I wish now, honourable senators, to give
the usual assurance that the passing of this
bill will in no way prejudice the rights and

Honourable senators, what I intended to

say is that the Senate, however, has a very

SENATE DEBATES

clear responsibility to scrutinize the spending
of public funds and the financial policies of
the Government, and I suggest that generally
we can do that better in the Standing Committee on Finance than in this chamber. For
this reason I will restrict myself to dealing
generally with some aspects of the fiscal policies of the Government concerning the present fiscal year 1968-69.
The sponsor of the bill has indicated that,
excluding the Supplementary
Estimates
which may be submitted to Parliament before
the end of the present fiscal year, the total
budget expenditures at this time in accordance with the Revised Estimates presented to
Parliament will reach the sum of $10,670,000,000, or roughly $10.7 billion. It is quite
likely that once all the Supplementary Estimates have been submitted to Parliament the
total expenditures of the year 1968-69 will
reach close to $10.8 billion, and may be more.
I suggest that it is interesting to compare
this figure with the first Estimates. If I
understood the honourable senator correctly
he said that he did not have this figure. I
think it was $10.3 billion.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I am sorry to interrupt
my honourable friend, and I apologize for my
mistake. I was looking at the wrong column a
moment ago when I was attempting to answer his question. The total amount is to be
found on page 6c on the right-hand side of
the first column. The total is $10,284,732,032.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: That is roughly the figure
that I have just indicated about $15 million
less. This is a difference of close to $400 million. It will certainly reach this figure when
we have all the Supplementary Estimates.
I think it was in November 1967 that the
former Minister of Finance, Mr. Sharp, forecast a deficit of approximately $40 millionroughly a balanced budget. After having a
deficit of approximately $800 million for the
previous year, the threat of inflation prompted the Government to do everything possible
to balance its budget, and it was in this perspective and because of this threat of inflation
that Mr. Sharp was hoping to balance the
budget or face only a relatively minor deficit
of $40 million, plus an indefinite amount for
medicare and for the deficit of Expo 67. In
any event, roughly, it was the aim of the
Minister of Finance and of the Government to
balance its budget.
It is interesting to recall what happened in
March of this year when the Government
found itself in a very serious financial crisis.

October 2, 1968

One also remembers that this crisis was in
part at least the result of a vote in the other
place. The Government was defeated-it
never admitted it, but it was defeated!
Hon. Mr. Martin: It lost the vote.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It asked for a second vote
to see if some persons had changed their
minds, and luckily for the Government at
that time some had. One remembers that on
the first vote on the tax bill all opposition
parties had voted one way and the Government supporters were alone; whereas, when
that famous vote of confidence was called,
some members of two opposition parties had
changed their minds. We will probably never
find out why.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Perhaps I could see the
honourable gentleman privately.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It was my intention to see
the honourable Leader, to give him whatever
information I had myself.
Hon. Mr. Walker: He should know.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Under those now memora-

ble circumstances the Minister of Finance, to
seek support from the public and the financial
world, announced a reduction of $75 million
in the amount of the original Estimates, reducing the total expenditures to $10,225,000,000
from what had been forecast in November
1967. Then we know what happened-the
Government had a change in its leadership,
and an election was called.
During the election the Government had to
borrow $100 million on the United States
market. One knows that during an election
campaign it is a very dangerous thing for a
government to be caught in a financial crisis.
I remember, for instance, what happened in
1962, when the Government of that day had
to peg the dollar, and the way that situation
was exploited by the party which is now at
the head of the administration. Under those
circumstances, to be on the safe side, the
Government reassured the financial world, by
submitting to the Exchange and Securities
Commission a prospectus in which it assured
all concerned, and especially those who would
purchase those bonds, that in no way would
the figure of $10,225,000,000 be exceeded in
the expenditures for the 1968-69 fiscal year.
This prospectus was signed by ministers of
the Government-I do not know if they are
still acting in the same capacities, but some of
them must still be in the Government. For
instance, the Minister of Finance was then

October 2, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

not been able to explain why it could not
forecast more accurately the cost of these
shared programs.
I can understand a Government, and especially a Liberal Government, during an election campaign-and one which came after
their having been in office with only a minority of the seats in the other place-juggling
with figures and trying to hide or take the
benefit of the doubt in every respect possible
in so far as its financial problems and policies
were concerned. But that is something of the
past. The present Government has a majority
now in the other place, and it should change
its way of dealing with fiscal matters as far
as the public of Canada is concerned, and, I
would say, as far as the rest of the world is
concerned. It should agree that frankness,
honesty, realism and responsibility are qualities which should guide it in the field of fiscal
matters in the future.
Since we are caught with the situation as it
is, I hope that when the next budget is presented, that in so far as estimates, revenues

The first question which comes to mind is
that, since these assurances were given that
we would not exceed this amount of $10,225,000,000, how can the Government explain that
the amount is now up to almost $10,700,000,000 in the expenditures for the current year?
I would hope that explanations have been
given to the Exchange and Securities Commission. Otherwise, I would suggest that the
reputation of Canada is being smeared.
We made representations, when we sold
bonds for $100 million, that we would keep
our expenditures down to the figure indicated
by the Honourable Mr. Sharp in March 1968,
that is, $10,225,000,000; and now we say we
are going to spend-not counting the Supplementary Estimates which certainly will come
along-$10,670,000,000.
Of course, the election is now water over

rate, we on this side of the house.

SENATE DEBATES
will try to get it right away so that I can
answer his question later today, if possible.
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, I
am sure we were all impressed with the
efficient way in which Senator Langlois introduced this matter. He might look up the exact
reference, where the expenditure is to be
located. It would likely be under the National
Defence item. However, perhaps I may deal
directly with the question.
It is a fact that when the Cyprus force
was established in March 1964 the United
Nations was not in possession of sufficient
funds to implement the decision of the Security Council to establish the force in Cyprus.
It was felt by Canada, and this was approved
by both Houses of Parliament, that notwithstanding the inadequacy of financial arrangements at the disposal of the United Nations,
this country, dedicated to the principle of
peacekeeping, must do everything that it
could to see that the dangerous situation on
the Mediterranean flank of NATO did not
deteriorate.
When we were asked by the Secretary General of the United Nations to contribute to the
United Nations force we said we would. We
said that we were prepared to bear our share
of the cost of our forces. A voluntary fund
was set up, contributed to mainly by the
United Kingdom, the United States and West
Germany, to assist other countries who did
not agree to meet their operating military
expenses in Cyprus. This applied to the forces
of Ireland, Sweden, Finland and Denmark.
We agreed, as I say, to bear the cost of the
operation of our forces. I cannot offhand give
what the figures are, but I should think that
the total cost contributed by Canada to date
would be in the neighbourhood of $14 million.
This does not represent a net expenditure,
however, because the pay and allowances of
Canada's contingent in the United Nations
force would have been payable to the personnel of that force wherever they served. We
did have other expenses in addition to the
normal allocations for pay and allowances.
Such additional expenses would include the
airlift to transport the forces, and special
food and logistics arrangements in Cyprus.
The Government felt at that time that if we
did not undertake to bear this responsibility,
there would be no peace force in Cyprus.
And, if honourable senators will recall the
circumstances that attended at that time, I
think, it will be admitted that our contribution was a valid and justifiable one. As the

October 2. 1968

person who had the responsibility of recommending this policy to the Government, I can
say with conviction and confidence that I am
sure that Canada took the right course.
It is regrettable that the United Nations
should be without funds for these purposes,
but that is the fact. But are we to dodge our
responsibilities in respect of peacekeeping
simply because certain countries in the United Nations are unwilling to bear their share
of the cost, which I think is implicit in the
commitment all countries took when they
signed the Charter at San Francisco?
Three years ago the Government made
known to the United Nations that Canada was
not willing to bear certain expenses. Among
those was Canada's contribution to the headquarters' staff in Cyprus where Canadian
personnel serve. That cost is now met, so far
as Canada is concerned, by the voluntary
fund. Then we indicated that in order to
effect as much saving as possible, and without
defeating the purpose of the force, there
might be a reduction in the total complement
of the force itself. By this I mean the United
Nations force made up of the different countries. Parliament authorized that a maximum
of 1,200 military personnel could serve in the
Cyprus operation, pursuant to the resolution
passed. We were able later to reduce our
force close to 700 personnel. As a further
retrenchment the force is to be reduced again.
I would hope that the statements by Archbishop Makarios made recently in Scandinavia and the talks that are taking place
between the foreign ministers of Greece and
Turkey augur for the possibility soon of a
solution to this problem. This might mean the
withdrawal of the force as a whole. But it is a
fact that we are the one country which
agreed to assume the major portion of its cost
of operation. It was an act taken by Canada
in support of the concept of peacekeeping.
There is no reason to apologize on behalf of
the Canadian people and their Government
and their Parliament for the decision in a
situation
which
certainly
would
have
deteriorated.
Hon. Mr. White: I thank the honourable
Leader for his information. I have a few
other matters that I would like to ask him
about.
Did I understand him to say that Canada
was the only nation supplying troops for the
peacekeeping force that paid all its own
expenses? Could the honourable Leader tell
me if there are any countries which supplied
personnel to the peacekeeping force that had

October 2, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

all their expenses paid by the United
Nations?
Further, the honourable leader mentioned
that there was no fund in 1963 or 1964 out of
which these expenses could have been paid,
but that there was what he called the voluntary fund. Now, has there been no effort by
the United Nations since 1963 to put this
peacekeeping operation, and others of the
kind, on some better basis than merely a
voluntary fund?
Hon. Mr. Martin: With regard to the first
question, it is a fact that we are the only
country that has paid its way. The other
countries received assistance, not from the
United Nations as such but from a voluntary
fund, the contributors to which I have
already mentioned.
I should add that the voluntary fund has
been replenished year by year. This year,
however, the fund is at a low level. The
Secretary-General, I think on Monday last,
announced in New York that the fund had
reached a disproportionate level, and on that
account apart altogether from whether or not
a final solution to the situation in Cyprus is to
be realized, the force would have to be withdrawn because there was insufficient funds.
In that way he was probably directing an
appeal to the contributors, notably the United
States, Great Britain and West Germany.
It is a fact that at this time the United
Nations is not in funds to enable it to meet
the Cyprus peacekeeping operation. The reason for this arises out of the difference of
opinion which prevails between the Soviet
Union on the one hand and certain Western
powers on the other regarding the obligations
of members of the organization to contribute
to an accepted scale of payments for the
Cyprus operation.
The Soviet Union contends that the General
Assembly of the United Nations has no authority to establish a United Nations police
force; it argues that only the Security Council, of which it is one of the permanent
members, has the authority to establish such
a force. Canada, the United States, Britain
and other countries take the position that the
primary responsibility for the establishment
of a force rests with the Security Coundil, but
that in the absence of action by the Security
Council the General Assembly has a residual
authority. Because of this difference the Soviet Union, certain of the unaligned nations,
and most of the communist block in the United Nations, have refused to make contributions to the funds of the United Nations for

carrying out these operations. It is regrettable, but that is the fact.
If a peacekeeping operation were required
tomorrow in Asia, for example, and the United Nations were called upon to supply a
peacekeeping force, there are no funds available for that purpose. Some ad hoc arrangements would have to be made. It is because
of this situation that Canada decided, having
regard to the role it is playing in these matters, that she must take the initiative, which
she did take on her own.
I do not know exactly what the total of our
contributions would amount to at this stage,
but it must be in the area of $20 million. At
any rate, it has been a heavy expenditure,
but I would think that this kind of expenditure would be supported by the Canadian
people, particularly having in mind that as a
result we may have restrained the possibility
of a serious conflict.
Hon. Mr. White: The Government Leader
has referred to the statement by U Thant. I
have here a clipping from the Montreal Gazette of Monday last, in which he states that
the deficit on the Cyprus operation is approximately $13,586,000. Then he goes on to say
that the force might have to be recalled. It
would be rather interesting to know what the
various countries are doing to make up that
deficit.
I would also like to ask the honourable the
Leader of the Government if his attention has
been drawn to an article which appeared in
the Toronto Globe Magazine of December 10,
1966, which is a review of a book written by
a native of Sweden, Major-General Carl Von
Horn.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Yes.
Hon. Mr. White: This is a most biting and
bitter attack on the United Nations and on
how the operation of peacekeeping forces is
being carried out. I would not think that an
attack of this nature could be lightly brushed
aside. It was written by a distinguished soldier who took over from our own Major-General Burns in Egypt and Israel. He also
served on various other peacekeeping forces.
While I would hesitate to put on the record of
this house the actual words he has used in
describing the civilians in the United Nations,
who have nothing to do with the peacekeeping
force, nevertheless, I for one would be much
interested in having the comment of the leader on this article, and in learning whether or

service in bringing these matters to our attention, that the moment this book was issuedand it was preceded by a press statement by
General van Horn-we did communicate with
the United Nations-I spoke to the Secretary
General myself about it, and the greatest of
care was taken in examining the charges, all
of which, I can assure my honourable friend,
were not supported by the facts.
Hon. Mr. White: How were the charges
investigated?
Hon. Mr. Martin: They were investigated
by the Secretariat, under Mr. Ralph Bunche,
who, as my honourable friend knows, has had
a long and distinguished career at the United
Nations, for which he won the Nobel Peace
Prize. With regard to the charges of smuggling by nationals of certain of the contributing forces, it is true that there was
this kind of operation on the part of some
individuals.
Hon. Mr. White: He is not referring to soldiers; he is referring to civilians. His article
gives the greatest praise to the troops of all
the countries. He makes no charge against
any soldier, but is referring one hundred per
cent to the United Nations' civilian officials.
Hon. Mr. Martin: These charges were
investigated, and it was found that there was
no basis in fact for them. It went on to say
that there were also charges, some of which
were justified, against the conduct of particular individuals in the military forces. I am
happy to say that, to the best of my knowledge, this does not in any way apply to
Canadian personnel.
Hon. Mr. White: Would the honourable
leader know if anyone took any legal action
against the man who wrote this book?
Hon. Mr. Martin: I cannot say whether any
legal action has been taken. I suppose the
only way would be by resort to the courts in
the particular country.
Hon. M. Gratian O'Leary: In view of the
honourable leader's admission that so far as
peacekeeping operations are concerned the
United Nations is bankrupt, and in view of
the Secretary General's statement this week
that bankruptcy is likely to continue or
grow worse, do we, the Government of
Canada, propose to keep our troops in Cyprus
at a cost of more than $3,500,000, as it was last
year? Do we propose keeping them there,
paying for them ourselves, and perpetuating

the fraud that this is a United Nations'
operation?
Hon. Mr. Martin: I will not, in any sense,
agree with the last observation of the distinguished honourable senator. The Security
Council renews the force for a period of three
or six months. The present term will expire, I
think, on December 26 this year. If there is
no solution to the situation in Cyprus, my
judgment would be that the Security Council
will recommend a three- or six-month renewal of the force.
The policy of the Canadian Government
will be, in the event of such a decision by the
Council, to decide, as it has decided on each
occasion, whether or not it should renew the
mandate for further Canadian participation.
I said earlier that I was hopeful that we
were nearer a solution now to the situation in
Cyprus than at any time since March, 1963.
In any event, there will be reductions in the
force. We are approaching the stage when I
would hope that the operation there could be,
not para-military, but possibly more in the
nature of some policing action, which would
require a minimum number of soldiers or
policemen.
The situation is not satisfactory. It is not
Canada's fault, it is not the fault of any western power, that the United Nations is not in
funds. It is due to a serious constitutional
argument between the Soviet Union on the
one hand, and the western powers on the
other, as to the rights of the General Assembly in the matter of the establishment of
peacekeeping forces. But I have no hesitation
in saying-and I believe I speak for the Government in this-that it would be far better
for a country like Canada, and other countries, to expend such amounts out of their
treasury in the pursuit of the objective of
maintaining peace in a particular area, than
later, as a result of an expansion of conflict in
that area, to be called upon to spend amounts
of money far beyond the relatively trifling
amounts which Canada and these other countries are now spending on behalf of the
maintenance of peace.
We have participated in every peacekeeping operation of the United Nations-in India,
in Kashmir, in Lebanon, and in the Sinai
Desert, to mention a number of situations.
In addition, we have for over 11 years
served on difficult assignments on the International Control Commission in Vietnam,
Laos and Cambodia. This represents a contribution by this country to the pursuit of peace.
It deserves our continuing support.

into a great deal of trouble.
I want to express my satisfaction at hearing
the suggestion that our men will soon be coming home, to raise familles, I hope, and to
play their part as citizens of Canada.
There is another comment I wish to make.
I am sure that I voice the opinions of all my
colleagues when I say that this chamber is
fortunate in having, as the Leader of the
Government, Senator Martin, with his very
wide personal knowledge of foreign aff airs
and parliamentary procedures. The rapidity
with which our new leader has caught the
spirit of this hive is remarkable. He plays his
part with skill and ability in our debates, the
character of which is so different from those
in the other place. He is a real addition to our
fighting force. I am amazed at his offhand and
personal knowledge of these complicated matters upon which he has been questioned. I am
sure I speak for all honourable senators when
I say that the work of this chamber has been
greatly enhanced by our new member.
Hon. Allister Grosar: Honourable senators,
over the last few years we have developed a
procedure that has been regarded by most
honourable senators as a useful attempt to
discharge the responsibilities that the honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Flynn) spoke of in respect of appropriation
bills and other bills calling for the expenditure of public funds. That procedure is the
reference of such bills to the Standing Committee on Finance under the chairmanship of
Senator Leonard, and later under the honourable senator who is now the honourable the
Speaker.
We developed a method of dealing with
financial matters that enabled us to say that
we had done a reasonable job in scrutinizing
the suggested expenditures put before us. But
we are in a position today where we are
being asked to pass a bill calling for the
expenditure of about $3,700,000,000, without
giving it any scrutiny whatever. We have
spent some time discussing one item which
represents $3 million, which is less than onetenth of one per cent of the total amount we
are asked to approve.
I do not know what urgency there is in
passing this bill. I hope we are not going to
be asked to dispose of it today, and that the
Leader of the Government will tell us if there
are compelling reasons why we must dispose
of it today. We were told on one occasion not
long ago that if we did not pass a certain bill

the Public Service employees would not be
paid. I accepted that statement at that time,
but later I found out that it was an exaggeration of the truth, if it was the truth at ail. I
would, however, like the assurance of the
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Martin)
that under the circumstances, if such be the
case, we are now in a position where we must
reverse these procedures we have built up
and deal with this very large amount of
money without referring it to our own
Finance Committee. Perhaps he would also
tell us what the plans are as to the meeting of
that Committee.
The bill was tabled yesterday and it is
before us today. In the past when this kind of
objection has been raised we have been told,
"This is just an interim supply bill, and is not
terribly important; we deal with all this in
the main Estimates." Such a statement has
been made by former leaders of the Government in this house, not the present leader.
I wish to point out that this particular bill
is more than just an interim supply bill. It is
a bill which amends at least two acts of the
statutes of Canada. In two places I find that
we are asked to vote moneys, notwithstanding
the provisions of some other act. That can
only mean that if we assent to this bill we are
amending those two acts. I refer to item L35
on page 5, where we were asked to pass a
vote, notwithstanding subsection 5 of the
Indian Act; and Vote 5 in Schedule B on page
9, where we were asked to pass a vote notwithstanding the Financial Administration
Act, that is intended to regularize procedures
and make it impossible for this sort of thing
to happen.
I hope we are not going to revert to the
casual attitude towards this kind of bill, which
prevailed at one time in this chamber. I give
credit to former leaders of the Government
for the fact that we have made progress and I
would hope there will be an opportunity to
discuss these Estimates fully. We have just
concluded a discussion in which an expenditure of $3 million, which is less than one tenth
of one percent of the $3.7 billion we are asked
to approve, has occupied an hour of our time.
There are many things in this bill and in
the revised Estimates, to which the bill
refers, that require scrutiny, and I believe
there are questions that should be asked that
have not been asked in the other place. I
hope that an opportunity to do so will be
given. It is not an ordinary situation. We are
faced, not with the usual main Estimates, but
with revised main Estimates and we are
asked to look back and in a three-month

Hon. Mr. Holleit: May I ask the sponsor of

On Vote 15-payments to the Canadian
National Railway Company, upon applications
approved by the Minister of Transport made
by the company to the Minister of Finance, to
be applied by the company in payment of the
deficits-could the honourable Senator Langlois give me an idea of the amount of deficits
arising out of the operation of the Canadian
National Railway passenger service in Newfoundland, which I believe it is the intention
of the Government to abandon? Could we
have the amount of the deficits incurred on

Hon. Mr. Martin: Yes.
The Hon. the Speaker: With due respect to
honourable Senator Grosart, I am of the opinion that the point he has raised could not
have been raised on second reading, when we
were discussing the principle of the bill, but
that he has a perfect right to raise this point
of order at this time.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Certainly I will not
quarrel with Your Honour's ruling.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I do not quite understand.
This is because I do not happen to be familiar
with our procedures. Are we dealing now
with this bill on third reading?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: No.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: The question has been put
by His Honour the Speaker as to whether the
Senate is prepared to give leave at this time,
and I understand that honourable Senator
Grosart has said "no". My interpretation is

SENATE DEBATES

that the third reading should take place at the
next sitting, if we are to follow the rules.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, we are presently on a point of order
raised by honourable Senator Grosart.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Your Honour, may I
speak to the point of order? Certainly, I have
no quarrel with your ruling.
My interpretation of the situation was that
we had a motion before us, in effect, in short
form, that we would take the third reading of
the bill now. I suggest that that is a motion,
because under the rules we cannot deal with
any matter unless there is a motion. The
word "now" is the short form, I understand,
of saying "I move the third reading now."
In the normal course of procedure, where a
bill is being referred to a committee, it is at
this point that one would have expected the
hoonurable sponsor of the bill to say "I move
that this bill be referred to a committee." For
that reason, I raise my point of order that it
is not proper to proceed to third reading
when questions are still unanswered.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Certainly, I would tell the
honourable senator that I think his question
should be answered. All I was seeking to
determine was what Order we are on. Familiar as I am with the rules of the other house,
and unfamiliar with the rules here, I am
seeking the indulgence of honourable senators
in asking exactly when I should make a response to the legitimate question the honourable senator has asked. Are we now on third
reading?
Some Hon. Senators: No, no.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Or, are we now consider-

ing the motion for third reading?
The Hon. the Speaker: If the Leader of the
Government would permit me, I shall put the
motion, and if there is discussion on the
motion, and a point of order, I think it would
be appropriate to debate it at that time.
It is moved by the honourable Senator Langlois, seconded by honourable Senator Dessureault, that this bill be now read a third
time.
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to
adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr. Grosart: No.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: On a point of order, may I
try to clarify the situation, Mr. Speaker? You
were seeking unanimous consent of the
Senate to move third reading now, and it is

October 2, 1968

on this very point that the discussion arose.
Senator Grosart said he was prepared to give
leave, if his question was answered.
Of course the Leader of the Government
knows that he can answer a question on third
reading, or he can answer it by letter, or he
can answer it in committee tomorrow. There
are many ways of doing it. But my suggestion
is that since Senator Grosart has not given
leave-and I was not prepared to do so
myself-I do not see why we should give
leave at this time for third reading. It could
very well take place tomorrow. It seems to
me that the bill should be put on the Orders
of the Day for third reading tomorrow.
In the meantime the Leader of the Government can ascertain from Senator Grosart
whether he wants an answer in this chamber
when third reading takes place, or whether
he wants an answer by letter. Perhaps at this
time we should decide whether he wants this
bill to be referred to committee. He can certainly ask the Leader of the Government at
this time whether it is the intention to refer
the bill to committee.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I think the situation has
been clarified. I thank the Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Flynn) for clarifying it
for me. I am sure I was the only one who, for
the reasons I gave a moment ago, required
clarification.
I have no objection to having third reading
tomorrow. I may say that I would hope that
we can have Royal Assent to this bill tomorrow. I am prepared to deal now with the
question which the honourable Senator Grosart has put. It is a fair question. These are
large sums of money. But it should be
recalled that the honourable Senator Langlois
made it perfectly clear that he was prepared
to give the usual undertaking that passing
of this bill does not prejudice the rights and
privileges of honourable senators to criticize
any item in the Estimates when it comes up
for consideration. The usual undertaking is
given that such rights and privileges will be
respected and will not be curtailed or restricted in any way as a result of the passing
of this measure.
It has never been, I understand, the custom
in this house for an interim supply bill to go
to committee. I am advised by the officers of
the Senate that this is the case, and the
records that I have checked confirm it. Now,
it must not be forgotten that what we are
dealing with are not only the Estimates but
the Revised Estimates. The Revised Estimates

October 2, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

constitute a portion only of the total Estimates. The Estimates themselves were before
a committee; they were examined by this
house; they were reported on by the then
Deputy Leader of the bouse, who was Chairman of the Finance Committee. So that all the
main portion of the Estimates have already
been considered by this house in the Finance
Committee. There will be a further opportunity, now that the Estimates are going again to
a committee-not this bill but the Estimates
themselves-for any honourable senator to
deal with any of the items that engages his
interest and attention.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: May I ask the Leader
whether he is prepared to reply to the questions put by Senator Grosart either now, if
third reading is moved, or tonorrow before
third reading is given. This is the only question that remains. We will see whether it
satisfies Senator Grosart or not. If it does, we
will have no further problem.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I appreciate that. I
thought I was answering the question which
concerned Senator Grosart. "Why should we,"
he said, "pass these Estimates without first
having the opportunity to examine them?"
My reply to that is, "But you have had that
opportunity with regard to the substantial
portion of them.' They were considered and
reported in this house last March by the then
Chairman of the Finance Committee, the
Deputy Leader of the bouse.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I know that.
Hon. Mr. Martin: And those Estimates,
together with the Revised Estimates, now will
be considered in the appropriate committees
where there will be an opportunity to further
examine any item of interest.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: I thought he wanted to
inquire about specific points.
Hon. Mr. Bourget: Let him speak for
himself.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Well, if I do, we will be
here until tomorrow, the way we are going.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I assure my honourable
friend that I appreciate the helpful spirit in
which he is approaching this matter, but I
have before me the Minutes of the Proceedings for October 1, which provided for the
following motion:
That the Standing Committee on
Finance be authorized to examine and
report upon the expenditures proposed
by the Estimates and the Revised Estimates laid before Parliament for the
fiscal year ending 31st March, 1969, in
advance of Bills based on the said Estimates and Revised Estimates reaching
the Senate;
That the Committee be empowered to
send for persons. .
And then follows the usual permission and
authority.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: We passed that two days
ago. I know that.
Hon. Mr. Martin: And I thought that was
an answer to the honourable senator. If I
misunderstood him, I will be very glad to
have him elucidate his point.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That does not mean that
he has to wait until the committee decides.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: At this moment, Your
Honour, I am not sure whether I am speaking
to a motion or a point of order.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: It is a point of order.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: The leader is arguing that

Hon. Mr. Martin: I say that I have replied. in the more important sections of the house,
I have said that honourable senators have the perhaps I may explain my position.
The major question I asked was: "What is

Hon. Mr. Flynn: That is not the question. We have been asked to breach our own rules.

SENATE DEBATES
hurry?" I indicated that that was the essence
of my question.

I suggest, as the honourable leader on this
side has said, that that question has not been
answered. I would like the answer. I would
like to know why we have to pass this today
or tomorrow or a week from now or two
weeks from now. This is an essential question. If we are asked to hurry up our affairs
here, then I say, "Why are we asked to hurry?" If there is no hurry, then I am going to
suggest that there is no reason in the world
why these Estimates should not go to the
Finance Committee.
The Leader of the Government has said
that it is not usual to send interim supply
bills to the Finance Committee.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: They have already been
there.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: Just a moment. The Leader of the Government has said we have had
the main Estimates, but what we are faced
with now is a revision of the main Estimates,
so I suggest he is begging his own question.
You say you have passed the Estimates. Now
you come before us and say you are going to
revise them, and I say that the revision and
the so-called benefits to the public of the
revision have been matters of front page
propaganda by the Government for months.
You are saying, "We are revising them."
Well, they are not then the same Estimates
that we discussed in the Finance Committee.
When you revise Estimates, or when you
revise your arithmetic or revise a bill to a
customer, you no longer have the same
things. Your revised bill to a customer is no
longer the same bill.
These are entirely different figures from
those which were before us when we discussed the Estimates. The bill itself makes it
clear.
I am now asking-and this is the essence of
the point I raise-is there any urgency? Are
we going to be placed in a position where, for
example, public servants are not going to be
paid if we do not act immediately? That happened once, completely unnecessarily, owing
entirely to the delays and bad management of
the Government. If we are faced with that
situation, I would like to know it, and I
would like to know why. I believe that is my
right as a senator discharging my responsibility here. That is why these Estimates are
brought here.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.

October 2, 1968

Hon. Mr. Grosari: If any other honourable
senators feel that I am exaggerating the responsibility of the summons that I received
here, then I will not quarrel with them. I am
entitled to say that this is the assessment that
I intend to make of my responsibility here. If
the honourable Whip on the other side feels
that lie should not take that responsibility, I
will not quarrel with him, but I have the
right to assert my own sense of responsibility
in the matter of a bill such as this one.
I again ask, what is the urgency? If there is
no urgency in this matter, why should it not
go before the committee so that we can carry
on this well established principle of having
that kind of examination, because questions
have been asked here that would be asked in
that committee. We have had questions asked
on individual items, so in effect we have gone
into committee of the whole without in any
way regularizing that procedure. I am merely
asking that we return to a procedure that was
a credit to the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I want the honourable

senator to appreciate that I fully understand
his point of view. He has every right to
express himself as his convictions warrant. I
am prepared to wait until tomorrow for third
reading of this bill. In the meantime my
honourable friend will have an opportunity to
read what Senator Langlois and I have said.
We have before us a bill which embodies
substantially the estimates which have
already been studied by this chamber. In
addition there are certain revised estimates
necessitated because the Government has
been operating since March 31 without the
benefit of Pariament. The Estimates constituting this bill include, therefore, substantially
the old estimates already considered, plus
additional ones which are inevitable in the
conduct of government.
It is not the intention to refer this bill to a
committee; it has never been the practice of
the Senate to deal with such a bill in committee, but the Senate is not going to be
denied the opportunity of reinvestigating
what it has already gone into, together with
the Revised Estimates, in the Finance Conmittee, pursuant to the motion I made the
other day and which was accepted by this
house.
I think we would make progress if I
accepted the suggestion of the Leader of the
Opposition and agree to third reading
tomorrow.

October 2, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson: Honourable
senators, I have been concerned about the
question of setting bad precedents in this
house. It is my opinion that this whole discussion in the last little while, although stated to
be on a point of order, was not in fact on a
point of order at all. In my view there is
only one question before this house, namely,
whether the sponsor of the bill has leave to
ask for third reading now. I have not heard
Senator Grosart or anyone else as yet say that
he has not leave.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Oh, yes, I have.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: If so, it is merely
by inference. Nevertheless, it is the right of
any senator to refuse to give leave, and if he
does, the matter stops there. That is the position we find ourselves in now. Leave bas been
refused, and consequently the sponsor of the
bill will have to move for third reading
tomorrow.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators
have expressed their views, and I now put
the question: Is it agreed that this bill be
placed on the Orders of the Day for third
reading at the next sitting of the Senate?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Motion agreed to.
CENSUS AND STATISTICS
MOTION FOR REFERENCE TO COMMITTEEDEBATE ADJOURNED
Hon. Chesley W. Carter, pursuant to notice
moved:
That a committee of the Senate inquire
into and report upon existing legislation
regarding the census and statistics and
upon the administration of such legislation and recommend any changes in such
legislation and administration required to
establish and develop the census and statistics service as a vital and efficient aid
to the good government of Canada and
the advancement of private business in
the public interest.
He said: Honourable senators, I know that
it is generally conceded that statistics is a
very dry subject and I hope you will bear
with me in the remarks that I am about to
make, particularly since we have spent the
whole afternoon on statistics in the form of
an appropriation bill.
I suppose the best way to introduce a subject like this is to start with a definition. I

think it was Stephen Leacock or one of our
Canadian humorists who when asked to
define statistics said that there were three
different kinds of lies: ordinary lies, damn
lies, and statistics. But the generally accepted
definition of statistics is that it is a collection
of numerical data relating to matters that are
important to the state, matters such as population, tax yield, trade value, internal trade,
external trade, mortality from particular
diseases, and total mortality from all causes
together.
My motion merely asks that we take as
complete a look as possible at the whole statistical picture in Canada as far as the collection, compilation and analysis of statistical
data is concerned. Having said that, I hasten
of course to emphasize that my motion should
not be construed in any way as implying
criticism of the Dominion Bureau of Statistics, which over the years has built up a tremendous reputation for its performance, and
I am sure it is generally regarded as the
equal to any in the world. But that does not
necessarily mean that improvement is not
possible. The Dominion Bureau of Statistics is
the federal agency for the collection and compilation of statistics, but it is only one agency
among many, because in addition to the
Bureau of Statistics, practically every government department collects statistics; provincial
governments collect statistics and practically
every large enterprise also keeps statistical
records.
As I have said, the purpose of my motion is
to try to get as complete a picture as possible
of the situation using the Dominion Bureau of
Statistics as a sort of point of departure.
Statistics have been kept from the very
earliest times. We find reference to statistics
in the histories of Egypt, China, Greece and
Rome. In fact no nation can make progress
without some systematic compilation of statistics. The history of Canadian statistics goes
back long before Confederation. It goes back
to New France in 1666. If we omit the Domesday Book compiled by William the Conqueror, which was a one-shot affair, then the systematic and scientific compilation of statistics
in Canada pre-dates Europe by about 90
years, and was about 130 years ahead of our
great neighbour to the south.
The first statistics in New France were
compiled under the direction of Talon, and
dealt with sex, 'age, marital status and occupation of the colonists at that time. It also
contained some information about livestock
and agricultural products. Talon's census was
repeated on a regular basis 14 times before

SENATE DEBATES
the battle of the Plains of Abraham. Prior to
Confederation, statistics were compiled in the
British North American colonies, but these
were mainly registrations of births, marriages
and deaths.
In 1848, when Upper and Lower Canada
united, the Statistical Act was passed, to proprovide for a decennial census. Monthly
bank statements date back to 1856, while
Canadian insurance records date back as far
as 1815.
It was not until Confederation that a systematic plan of gathering statistics was initiated. The British North America Act placed
the compilation of census and statistics under
federal jurisdiction. In 1871 the Dominion
Census Act was passed, under which the 1871
census was taken, and the first report of that
census contained summaries of the results of
all preceding censuses.
In 1876 was passed an act for the regular
collection of criminal statistics. In 1885 the
General Statistics Act was passed, under
which a Statistical Year Book was instituted
on an official basis. Previous to that, the year
book had been in the form of an almanac of
Canada which had been published under private auspices, with official patronage. In 1890
the Labour Statistics Act was passed, but
because of the depression which occurred that
year this particular act was not very effective.
It was not until the 20th century, really,
that the modern era of statistical progress
began. In the year 1900 the Canadian Government Department of Labour set up a new
series of records of information not hitherto
collected. In 1905 the Census Office was
placed on a permanent basis, and the Census
Act, the General Statistics Act and the Criminal Statistics Act were consolidated into a
single statute.
In 1912 Sir George Foster, who at that time
was Minister of Trade and Commerce, set up
a departmental commission to inquire into the
statistical situation in Canada, in a somewhat
similar manner to that proposed in my
motion. As a result of this inquiry under the
direction of the Honourable Sir George Foster, a Domion Statistician was appointed in
1915, and in 1918 there was created a Central
Statistical Office which we know today as the
Dominion Bureau of Statistics.
Between 1915 and 1942 the Dominion Statistician made much progress in co-ordinating
the statistical activities of the provinces with
those of the dominion, to avoid overlapping.
During World War II, statistical services
were greatly enlarged so as to meet post-war

October 2, 1968

needs. Govermnents were taking on new
functions and responsibilities, such as responsibility for employment, social security and
health and welfare programs. This new statistical data was needed for policy making and
planning, as well as for the execution of programs. In addition, there was the growth and
diversity of industry, which also gave rise to
new statistical needs. Further, there was the
requirement for statistical information for the
United Nations, to assist the activities of its
agencies.
Our present act, which is the general Statistics Act, was last revised in 1952-53, and
many changes have taken place in Canada
since then. For example, in 1952 our population was 14 million; it is nearly 21 million
today. In 1952 our Gross National Product
was a little under $24 billion; today it is over
$62 billion. External trade in 1952 was at a
monthly average of $694 million. In 1967 the
monthly average was $1,857 million, and the
monthly average for January to June of this
year was well over $2 billion. In 1952 the
public debt was $17 billion. It was well over
$30 billion in 1967. The interest on the public
debt in 1952 was $432 million, and in 1967 it
was $11 billion. The indications are that
this year it will reach $1.4 billion.
In 1952 our public school enrolment was
2½ million pupils. The most up-to-date
figure I have been able to obtain is for 196465, when the school enrolment was five million-double. The universities had 80,000
undergraduate students in 1952. The latest
figure I have been able to get is for 1965-66, a
total of 206,000; and I presume that today it
would be about 250,000-well over three
times as great. I tried to obtain some comparative figures on crime, but the latest I
could find, in the Year Book for 1967, were
only up to 1964.
I mention these comparisons to show what
tremendous changes have taken place since
the Statisties Act was last revised. We have
moved into the space age; we have automation and cybernetics. In 1952 we had barely
entered the industrial age, and in 1968 we are
in what is being termed the post-industrial
age. It is a totally different world, with totally different problems, and a totally different
Canada with problems that are different not
only in variety but in magnitude-a nation
and a world with different goals and different
concepts.
This brings us to the question as to what
extent we have been able to keep abreast of
the times and abreast of these changes with

October 2, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

regard to statistical information. How adequate are our resources-human, physical,
and financial-to meet the needs of this new
post-industrial era? What changes in priority
and in policy should be made? For example,
the last government committed itself to a war
on poverty, and the present Government is
carrying that forward into a commitment to
regional development. What statistical information is required to evolve a policy of
regional development? What statistical data is
required for the planning and execution of
programs of regional development? What statistical information is required to evolve
yardsticks for the measuring of the effectiveness of rural and regional development
programs?
That brings us to the second question,
which is: How much of this information is
available now, how much is missing, and how
best can this gap be filled?
Then, there is the statistical information
which is being gathered by nearly every federal Government department, by provincial
governments, by industry, and by the universities. To what extent is this information
being exchanged? To what extent is it being
correlated and integrated? What more can be
and
done to improve its integration
correlation?
We need to know also of the gaps that still
exist in the information being gathered by so
many different agencies, and how these gaps
can best be filled. Can they best be filled by
further Government agencies, or is it possible
for some of them to be filled by private agencies? What are our present priorities? What
are the priorities in the present policy of
D.B.S.? What are their limitations? We know
they are limited by the framework of the act
within which they operate, and they are possibly limited by shortages of staff and equipment, and in other ways. I think we need to
know how meaningful are our present statistics. Numerical data is based upon definitions,
and definitions in turn are based on concepts.
Hon. Mr. Everett: Would the honourable
senator permit a question? Does D.B.S. feel it
is under a limitation imposed by the act in
respect to obtaining the data information
required by the modern economy?
Hon. Mr. Carter: I cannot answer that
question outright, but I do know that D.B.S.
is limited at the present time in the amount
and kind of information it can make available
to private industry from government, and to
government from private industry. It has the
information in its records, but in some cases

there is information from industry that governments cannot use, and in other cases there is
government information which industry cannot use. That is one limitation, but I cannot
answer as to how it is limited in the way of
staff, and so on. I have the impression that
the Govemment has been fairly generous in
meeting increases in expenditure that have
been required, but D.B.S. may be limited as
to staff. However, I have no personal knowledge of that.
As I said, definitions are based on concepts,
but as our knowledge increases our concepts
change, and that brings us to the question of
how valid are the present concepts and
definitions on which our present information
is based, and what changes are desirable?
I seem to remember, when I was a member
of the Special Joint Committee on Consumer
Credit, that we were discussing a number of
vegetable products, and a question came up
about tomatoes. Apparently, if you buy
tomatoes loose in a grocery store they are
classified as vegetables, but if you buy them
in a tin they are classified as fruits. It can be
seen what can be done to statistical records if
there are not precise definitions. What happens if one department is operating under
one definition, and another department is
operating under a different definition?
All Government policy, and policy changes,
depend upon sound statistical data. In rapidly
changing times there must be a constant evolution of policy to meet changing conditions.
In these days the Government cannot wait
until the results are apparent. The Government must anticipate results, and to anticipate results it must have very up to date and
accurate information on prevailing trends.
For example, inflation constitutes one of
our biggest problems today, but it is already
too late to act when inflation has become
rampant. What needs to be done is to anticipate inflation, and to have the statistical
information by which it can be ascertained
where inflation is beginning to break out, and
in what sectors of the economy, so that preventive rather than remedial measures can be
taken.
Honourable senators may remember that
about two years ago prices began to soar
drastically. Housewives were up in arms.
They were boycotting supermarkets, and
there was a general outcry for government to
take some sort of action to cut down on inflation. The joint committee to which I
referred earlier was set up, and evidence was
brought before that committee-and it is in
the record for anybody who wants to look it

SENATE DEBATES
up-that although prices had jumped drastically in September the economy of Canada
had actually started on a down turn as far
back as the previous June. So, there is this
tremendous time lag.
We learned also that the statistics available
to government on these kinds of trends are
about six months out of date, while in the
United States the time lag is about six weeks.
In view of the seriousness of inflation I think
it is worth while to investigate this problem
in order to see if something can be done to
reduce the present time lag of about six
months.
I mentioned earlier the time lag in education. The latest information in the Canada
Year Book is that of 1965. It is three years
late. Having regard to the importance of education today, and the amount of money that is
being spent on it, it is my view that we need
more up-to-date information than that which is
available. The same can be said of crime statistics. With the use of computers, this should
be possible.
Having gathered the statistics, the next
point that needs to be considered is statistical
analysis and interpretation. I should like to
know how D.B.S. analyzes statistical data,
and how much analysis is done by its own
staff, by Government departments or Government agencies, and by others, and what are
the priorities. We should inquire also as to
how statistical analysis can be speeded up
and improved.
I mentioned earlier that we are now living
in an age of computers, and it seems to me
that the time has come when a government
should have a computer policy. What is the
best way to make use of computers? What
computers are available now? What is the
capacity of these computers? We are now getting into second and third generation computers which have tremendous capacity,
undreamed of a couple of years ago. What
arrangements exist with other computerowning bodies; for example, government
departments, universities and industry? I
should also like to know what happens in
D.B.S. when one of their computers breaks
down. What alternate arrangements exist?
Finally, I think it would be useful if Canada could get some idea as to what other countries, comparable to Canada, are doing in the
field of statistics. Statistics are basic to our
modern life and there can be no progress at

October 2, 1968

all without them. It has been 15 years since
our Statistics Act was last revised and I
understand the next revision could be
within the next 12 months, and it will probably set the framework for another five or ten
years and possibly longer. It is my opinion
that it would be wise to use this time to pick
the brains of as many people as possible,
particularly people who are knowledgeable in
collecting, compiling and analysing statistical
data. We should use the time to get as many
fresh ideas as possible from professors, economists, statisticians and men in business and
industry, as well as from governments who
also deal in statistical information.
I conclude by emphasizing what I said at
the outset, that this motion is in no way
aimed at the Dominion Bureau of Statistics,
but rather it aims to take a look at the
entire statistical picture in Canada, using
D.B.S. as a point of departure for such an
investigation. We need to look at the framework in which D.B.S. operates, look at its
duties, its responsibilities and the resources at
its command for discharging these duties and
responsibilities. I think we should also try
to see what changes may be desirable in those
duties and responsibilities in the light of
present-day realities. For example, what responsibilities need to be enlarged? What
responsibilities probably could be curtailed
because facilities exist in industry or in universities that are capable of doing the job
quicker and better? ý
These are some of the questions in my
mind which prompted me to put my motion
on the Order Paper, and I hope that you will
see fit to support it. Should the investigation
prove that everything is perfect and nothing
need be done, even then the committee will
have served a useful purpose in establishing
that fact. I therefore request your support for
the motion which I have just moved.
On motion of Honourable

SENATE DEBATES
The Senate, looking more like a working chamber under Government Leader
Paul Martin, completed its Throne
Speech debate yesterday and held a night
sitting to deal with at least one Government bill.
Speech
Traditionally, the Throne
debate can go on indefinitely in the
Upper Chamber. The Senate agreed at
this session to limit the debate to eight
days but completed it instead in seven.
I want to assure the Leader of the Government that we are willing to co-operate with
him in whatever changes he might suggest, or
which the committee to study the rules
of the Senate might suggest, so that we
might eventually deal more efficiently with
the work that comes to this chamber.
In connection with this press clipping, I
want to say that what the leader has indicated as being our program next week is not
different from what has been traditionally the
program of this chamber. In previous years
we may not have appeared as active, but I am
sure that we have been, and I suggest that
the press might give publicity to the statement that the leader has made today as to the
program for next week. If they consult
the records of the Senate they will see this is
nothing more than has been the case for
many years, or at least during the time I
have been here.

who had to make a major change in their
machines on account of the change in the
money.
To that, I replied as follows:
There would be compensation to owners
of vending machines on certain terms and
conditions approved by the Treasury
Board.
Senator Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche)
then made this comment:
I do not think the honourable senator has
answered my question. I want to know
the exact amount to be paid to the vendors as a grant in regard to damage to or
replacement of old machines.

I was not able to answer that because I did
not have the information. I still do not have
the precise amount, but I have obtained further information which I am sure will be of
interest to the honourable senator.
The answer is as follows: On June 3, 1968,
the Minister of Finance announced that the
Government intended to recommend to Parliament the payment of compensation to
vending machine operators for part of the
cost of purchasing new coin selectors to
replace the coin selectors presently in use in
existing vending machines. The compensation
will be equal to one-half of the invoice cost of
a new replacement selector, or of a rebuilt
machine or of an adaptor. Consequently the
payment will vary as between different operHon. Mr. Martin: They were just trying to ators, depending on the price they pay for the

SENATE DEBATES

The position I took yesterday was that I
was not prepared to have our rules set aside,
by leave, when questions I have asked on
second reading had not been answered. It bas
certainly been the custom here to answer the
questions before the debate on the bill at that
particular stage is concluded. I will not pursue that point any further at this time.
Honourable senators, I would like to clear
up the misapprehension that the Finance
Committee, of which I am a member, had
considered and reported on the Estimates
which are the basis of this bill. That was said
yesterday, and it appears in our Hansard.The
fact is that since the Revised Estimates were
published, the Finance Committee, for obvious reasons, has not met.
I hold in my left hand a book about one
inch thick, containing 621 pages, entitled
"Estimates for the Fiscal Year Ending March
31, 1969." I have in my right hand a book of
similar size, containing 603 pages, entitled
"Revised Estimates for the Fiscal Year Ending March 31, 1969". The figures are substantially different in the two books. Otherwise, it
would have been entirely unnecessary and a
waste of public funds to publish the second
volume.
I am quite willing to accept the Government's statement at its face value that this is
a genuine attempt to reduce public expenditures in this particular fiscal year. Whether
that has been achieved or not, is a matter of
opinion. Some figures which were given yesterday indicate that the Government may not
have accomplished that end.
I hope it will not be suggested that because
the Finance Committee has considered the
first book they should not now proceed to
consider the second book, and perhaps
attempt to resolve the difference between
Government programming and Government
performance in this respect. I think it is
essential that this chamber have a report on
this important innovation in the matter of
presenting Estimates to Parliament.
Honourable senators, I believe I am correct
in saying that we had assurances from the
former leader that in general we would not
be asked to pass appropriation bills here until
there had been, where possible, a report from
the Finance Committee. I can assure honourable senators that my only interest in this matter is to do what I can to see that the
progress which was made in our handling of
financial matters in reporting to this chamber,

by the Finance Committee, under the chairmanship of Senator Leonard and his honour
the Speaker, is not thrown into discard.
In this respect I cannot forget that in the
Finance Committee within the last year or so
the then Secretary of the Treasury Board, Dr.
George Davidson, was asked this question:
Has the Senate a function to perform in respect of Estimates and public accounts, in
view of the fact that very often the Estimates
have been before the other bouse, have been
to a committee of the other bouse and then,
perhaps, have been back to a committee of
the whole before coming to the Senate? He
was asked also whether the Senate was just
wasting its time in considering them.
I think all honourable senators will agree
that at that time there was no better
informed man in Canada on the subject of
Estimates than Dr. George Davidson.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: Dr. George Davidson
said in effect that the Senate could and
should perform the useful function of filling
in the very large gaps that have developed
for certain reasons-which I will not criticize-in the parliamentary examination of
Estimates and Public Accounts.
May I just repeat one of the questions I
asked the honourable Leader of the Government yesterday: Will he tell us when it is the
intention to have the Finance Committee
meet to discuss this and other important
matters?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators,
there will be no delay. I hope that we can do
that some time next week. I have been waiting for the return to the chamber of one
senator with whom I would like to discuss
this matter, and I hope we can do so next
week.
Hon. Malcolm Holleit: Honourable senators,
before the bill receives third reading, I would
like to ask the honourable Senator Langlois
again about the deficit in respect of the passenger railway service in Newfoundland.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: You are referring to the
C.N.R. passenger service. The figure was for
the year 1966, and it was $918,000.
Hon. Mr. Hollefl: I do not want to delay the
proceedings in any way, but there is a very
strong rumour that it is the intention of the
Commissioner of Transport, formerly an
honourable Member of Parliament for

SENATE DEBATES
Newfoundland, to get rid of the passenger
railway service in Newfoundland. I noted the
figure of $39,293,000 under Vote 15, where it
says:

Maine, U.S.A.. . . $39,293,000.

I should think that a deficit of less than $1
million on the Canadian National Railway
passenger service in Newfoundland hardly
justifies the decision of the Transport Commissioner to curtail it. And I say the Transport Commissioner-I do not say the Government. I take it the Government will eventually decide what it intends to do, but this man
bas made it known that he intends to make
application to the Government to dispose of
the C.N.R. passenger service in Newfoundland.
I do not believe any Newfoundlander, even
though he may not bo an employee of the
C.N.R., will like the idea very much. At least,
I am a Newfoundlander and I do not like it.
The railway was built there before I was
born. It was put there at great sacrifice to our
people, and throughout the years it bas
served them well. The various other means of
getting around, which we have today, were
not available at that time. We could not fly.
We could not drive motor cars because there
were no roads. Everybody used the railway.
There is a certain amount of sentiment
attached to that railway, even apart from the
idea that our people spent their last cent to
get it through. I admire the spirit of the people who dealt with it at that time.
I hope I am speaking for all of Newfoundland when J say that we hate to see that
service disposed of. I myself have crossed
Newfoundland in the old days when there
was no trans-Canada highway. I did it by
rail. I have been hung up at the Gaff Topsails
by snow storms for periods of time when no
bus could ever get through. How would you

October 3, 1968

like to remain on a bus for 48 or 70 hours on
the Gaff Topsails or anywhere in that area
because of a snow storm? It is bad enough to
be held up in a train, but I hate to think of
buses have to perform the duties or services which were and are performed by the
railway.
I raised the question because I want the
Government to think very carefully and seriously on this matter before deciding to dispose of that railway service. I now ask the
Leader of the Government in this bouse to
give it careful consideration before he joins
in agreement with the Transport Commissioner on his apparent decision.
When J raise this point I am speaking for
myself and not because of a petition or anything of that nature. However, I feel it is a
terrible position te be in to think that Canada-and we are Canadians-would dispose of
that railway.
J noticed in the papers yesterday that the
C.N.R. is going to build a railway somewhere
in the north for the purpose of carrying
petroleum from the northern part of one of
the western provinces, a distance of 51 miles.
On the other hand, 500,000 people in Newfoundland will be done out of a railway
because this man says, "Get rid of the railway. Give them buses." That is his idea.
I hope I have made the matter clear to the
honourable Leader of the Government.
Motion agreed to and bill read third time
and passed.
CUSTOMS ACT
EILL

TO AMEND-SECOND

READING

Hon. Earl A. Hastings moved the second
reading of Bill S-10, to amend the Customs
Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of Bill S-10, being an act to amend the Customs Act, is to grant authority to the department to update and improve procedures
introduced to expedite commercial transactions at Customs and at the same time to
grant legislative authority for certain practices and procedures to the Customs Division
of the department as recommended by the
Public Accounts Committee of the other place
and the Auditor General.
By way of introduction, perhaps I can do
no better than to quote to you from the
Report of the Auditor General to the House
of Commons for the year ending March 31,
1967. In paragraph 118, he says:

October 3, 19688

SENATE DEBATES

Departmental practices which lack
statutory sanction. In last year's Report
(paragraph 105) reference was made to
four practices of the Customs and Excise
Division of the Department of National
Revenue which lacked legislative sanction. These practices relate to:
(a) refunds of customs duties on an
estimated basis;
(b) sales of goods unclaimed at
Customs;
The third one affects the sales tax division,
and
(d) refunds of duty paid on goods diverted to use other than that for which
they were imported.
The Public Accounts Committee in its
Eighth Report 1964-65 recommended that
the practices referred to. . . should receive

statutory sanction and in its Fifth Report
1966-67 the Committee supported the
Audit Office view that the item referred
to in (d) should receive parliamentary
sanction if the practice is to continue.
So, the reason for Bill S-10 is to implement
these recommendations of the Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committee of the
other place, along with updating certain
procedures that have been adopted by the
department.
The bill proposes an amendment in respect
to the sale of goods that the act formerly
required to be destroyed. Under the present
act, unless the department is assured of
receiving enough money covering duty and
other charges, these goods so acquired must
be destroyed. It was felt by the department
that the destruction of goods is considered in
many instances to be wasteful and, indeed
unnecessary, so that we are asked to amend
the act permitting the sale of goods so
acquired by the Crown, whether or not
enough funds are received to cover the three
items, duty, storage and charges.
Legislative sanction is sought to extend the
long-standing practice of paying refunds of
duty as a matter of equity in the case of
goods which under certain conditions would
be exempt or subject to a lower rate of duty
if imported by the ultimate user, but which
were in fact imported at a higher rate. The
amendments permit a refund when the goods
are sold to such a user, thus placing him in
the position he would have been in had he
imported the goods himself. The users
I refer to are educational institutions, scientific laboratories, certain agricultural users,
the mining industry, and others.

There are certain cases in which it has
been found to be administratively impossible
to determine actual quantities of materials on
which to pay refunds and remissions. A
proposed amendment will provide statutory
sanction for the practice in such cases of
refunding or remitting the duty based on
estimated values.
Other amendments proposed extend the
time for establishing entitlement for refunds
of customs duty. This again is based on the
recognition of the demand for the more
efficient handling of imports and the continuing increase of business at ports of entry. The
amendments are proposed in keeping with
modern business requirements to allow greater flexibility in the examination of goods at
port of entry.
An amendment is proposed to provide for
changes as recommended in the Glassco
Commission.
In explaining Bill S-10, honourable senators, the essential purpose of the first three
clauses is to remove the requirement that
goods acquired by the Crown must be destroyed unless the department is assured of
receiving enough revenue to cover duty, storage and other charges.
Clause 10 provides for a uniform method of
sale.
Clauses 4 and 5 provide an amendment to
section 33 of the Customs Act which will permit greater flexibility for the examination of
imported goods at the time of entry into
Canada. A random inspection is authorized
for the purpose of appraisal and verification,
and the inspection can be intensified should
circumstances warrant. The importer or his
agent is present at the time of entry of the
goods; furthermore, this will do away with
the possibility of an importer or his agent
complaining that he was unaware of the
examination.
The deletion from the present act of sections 95, 96 and 97 removes references to
the examination of goods at examining warehouses. The sections now require a collector
to designate a specified number of packages
to be examined and appraised at an examining warehouse. However, examining warehouses are no longer operated on port premises, and the examination of imported
goods, as a routine exercise, has been discontinued. Imported goods are now examined at
sufferance warehouses operated by transportation companies. The responsibiilty for the

SENATE DEBATES
examination and appraisal of goods is delegated by collectors to customs appraisers. The
removal of these sections brings the legislation into harmony with current procedures for
the examination and release of imported
goods.
Clause 6, extends the period to 90 days
rather than the existing 30 days for the filing
of refund claims. At the present time, where
inferiorities or shortages occur on the invoice,
the importer has but 30 days to file his claim.
This amendment will bring the time limit into
line with that applying to all appeals for
refunds, and will allow 90 days whether the
claim be by virtue of inferiority of invoicing
or a reappraisal. All must be done within the
90 days.
Honourable senators, clause 7 is possibly
the most important clause in the bill before
us, and grants authority to the department
for a long-standing practice. The question
regarding the authority for the payment of
refunds of duty on diverted goods was raised
by the Auditor General in his 1964 report. It
was pointed out there was no specific authority in the Customs Act under which the
department might grant refunds in cases
where goods were entered under an item of
the tariff, upon payment of duty at the rate
applicable to such goods, and subsequently
diverted to a use which would have entitled
entry under a different tariff item had they
been so imported. Nevertheless, the department, as a matter of equity, has adopted a
policy of making refunds in such cases, treating the original payment as "duty paid in
error." If the policy is to be continued, in the
view of the Audit Office it should have legislative sanction, which is the purpose of
clause 7.
Clause 8 extends authority to a departmental practice followed in connection with
refunds of customs duties calculated on an
estimated basis. The matter was questioned
by the Auditor General in his 1964 report, in
which he stated:
In order that Canadian airlines may be
in a tax position comparable to foreign
airlines, the Governor in Council, under
authority of section 22 of the Financial
Administration Act, grants remission of
duty, sales and excise taxes paid on parts,
equipment and consumable maintenance
stores for aircraft operating in international service.
The Department of National Revenue
finds it administratively impractical in
some cases to determine actual quantities

October 3, 1968

to which remissions should apply and so
relies on considered estimates in calculating the remissions to be granted.
Refunds of duties and taxes are authorized
in order that Canadian airlines may be competitive in international traffic and in a tax
position comparable to foreign airlines entering Canada in international service. However,
the Auditor General, in questioning this
procedure suggested that it should receive
legislative sanction, notwithstanding the fact
that they were operating under the Financial
Administration Act. Clause 8 provides an
amendment to the act whereby the amount of
remission may be estimated.
With regard to clause 9 in respect to section
113(1) of the act, covering a refund for misdescription of goods, this is seldom used; however, it is thought advisable to extend the time
limit to 90 days, in keeping with the 90-day
period provided in the amendment to other
sections of the act.
Clause 10 provides for the sale of goods by
public tender as well as sale by public auction. It is sometimes found not practical or
feasible to dispose of these goods by public
auction, so, by the amendment authority is
being provided for sale also by public tender.
Authority is also being provided for the
minister to dispose of goods in any way he
sees fit. It will no longer be necessary to
ensure that goods are sold for an amount
which will cover all charges. It will only be
necessary to sell the goods at a price which
will enable the Government to at least recover part of a debt to the Crown. The goods
may be sold by public auction or tender, or
may be disposed of by the minister as he sees
fit; or, as a last resort, destroyed, if that be
the only alternative.
Clause 11 covers an amendment recommended by the Glassco Commission, wherein
the collection of a fee for reproduction and
certification of documents is feasible administratively, provided the fee is sufficient to
cover the cost of the service. Under the present act it is set at 50 cents per document. The
amendment will grant authority to the Governor in Council from time to time to set the
fee for reproducing any item required.
Clause 12, honourable senators, covers the
amendment with respect to the opening and
unpacking of goods under control of Customs,
and is consequential to the amendments
proposed in clauses 4 and 5, with respect to
the inspection of goods while in storage. It

SENATE DEBATES

October 3, 1968

revokes sections 215 to 217, which refer to the
examining warehouse, no longer operated by
the department.
In conclusion, honourable senators, the
purpose of Bill S-10 is to grant authority for
up-dating and improving procedures and practices undertaken by the department and to
grant legislative authority for other practices,
as recommended by the Public Accounts
Committee and the Auditor General.
I recommend the bill to you at this time for
second reading.
(Madawaska-ResFournier
Mr.
Hon.
tigouche): The honourable sponsor uses the
word "goods", which to me has quite a broad
meaning. Does that term include liquor?
Hon. Mr. Hastings: Yes.
Hon.

Mr.

Fournier

(Madawaska-Res-

Hon. Mr. Flynn: If it is good!
Mr.

Fournier

(Madawaska-Res-

tigouche): Even if it is good, at the Customs

liquor is usually destroyed, as you know. I
am asking a serious question. I live alongside
the Customs and see ail sorts of things happening there. The word "goods" seems to
have a wide meaning and could include
almost anything.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It does.
(Madawaska-ResFournier
Mr.
Hon.
figouche): It could include counterfeit money,
narcotics, liquor, tobacco, matches. Those are
items which one is not permitted to bring
across the border, and if one attempts to do
seized and
so, they are immediately
destroyed.
Hon. Mr. Hastings: Section 2(1) (j) states:
"goods" means wares and merchandise or
movable effects of any kind, including
vehicles, horses, cattle and other animais;
So, it means goods, wares and merchandise of
any kind.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, it
may be that by reading the French version of
the bill we have an explanation, because the
word used is "effets", which includes everything. There is no doubt that liquor is included in the word "goods"; it certainly is in te
word "effets".
Honourable senators, we have listened
to the excellent explanation of this bill,
and we are indebted to Senator Hastings.

SUPREME COURT ACT

figouche): Liquor will not be destroyed?
Hon.

It is introduced to tidy up the Customs Act, following recommendations in most
cases, by either the Auditor General or the
Glassco Commission.
This is a bill which, typically, can be dealt
with properly in committee, and I understand
that the sponsor will move that it be referred
to one of our standing committees. Therefore,
I do not see that it is necessary further to
delay second reading of the bill.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

Hon. Lazarus Phillips moved the second
reading of Bill S-8, to amend the Supreme
Court Act.
He said: Honourable senators, I have the
privilege of summarizing before you the various clauses of this extremely important bill.
In so doing I should like to transmit my
sympathies to my fellow lawyers in this house
who practise before the Supreme Court,
because the result of the passing of this bill
will mean a substantial reduction in the number of cases going before the Supreme Court.
But, I know that my fellow lawyers will submit to the demands of patriotism, with a complete disregard for their own interests.
This bill consists of eleven clauses which
contain at least three very important amendments, the remainder of them constituting,
to a certain extent, a tidying-up process.
Before dealing with the subject matter clause
by clause I should like to draw to your attention the three basic amendments that are
being submitted for your consideration in
this bill.
First, it is proposed to amend section 36
in respect of judicial proceedings involving
sums or value in excess of $10,000. Whereas,
there is now a right of appeal to the Supreme
Court of Canada on a question of fact, or a
question of law, or a question of mixed fact
and law, if this amendment is passed there wiil
be a right of appeal to the Supreme Court in
respect of judicial proceedings only on a question of law, and if the amount or value
involved exceeds $10,000. There will be no
appeal in ordinary cases to the Supreme
Court in respect of issues involving a sum in

SENATE DEBATES
excess of $10,000, except where there is a
question of law involved. This involves, as
stated, an amendment to section 36 of the
Supreme Court Act.
Section 39 of the Supreme Court Act covers
the subject matter of per saltum appealsthat is, appeals from judgments of a lower
court in a province, and where the appellate
court in that province is by-passed with consent. In this particular instance the law now
provides for the right of appeal per saltum to
the Supreme Court of Canada where questions of law are involved, and where the
amount involved exceeds $2,000.
This amendment with respect to per saltum
appeals is necessary because when amendments to the Supreme Court Act were introduced in 1956 with respect to section 36,
granting the right of appeal only in cases involving sums or value in excess of $10,000,
whereas it had previously been $2,000 and
over, section 39, involving per saltum appeals,
was overlooked. The necessary amendments
to section 39 were not then made so that it
would conform to the 1956 amendment of
section 36. This is the second important
amendment contained in this bill.
The third important amendment involves
applications to the Supreme Court of Canada
for leave to appeal. As a result of a number
of provisions spread throughout many statutes, there are instances of where one judge of
the Supreme Court may hear an application
for leave to appeal. In practice, three judges
of the Supreme Court usually listen to
applications for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court. The result of this proposed
amendment is that all applications for leave
to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada
shall be heard by three judges, and in cases
concerning certain offences which involve the
death penalty such application will be heard
by five judges.
I have covered three important amendments,
but there is one more, and that is that
there will now be taken away from the Supreme Court of Canada the right to listen ab
initio to applications for writs of habeas corpus. This results from certain amendments
that were heretofore made to the Criminal
Code of Canada, as the result of which appeals are now vested as of right to the Supreme Court of Canada in matters of habeas
corpus.
The present law is, therefore, somewhat
anomalous in the sense that the Supreme
Court of Canada is a court of original jurisdiction in matters of habeas corpus, and is

October 3, 1968

also an appellate court in matters of habeas
corpus. The proposed legislation will clear
away this anomaly.
Honourable senators, the fifth item of
importance is one that I think has a certain
historic significance. At the present time the
rules and procedures of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council are guideposts for
the Supreme Court of Canada. The result of
the proposed amendment in clause 5 is that
those guideposts will be removed entirely,
and the right to introduce or to direct new
rules and regulations is given to the Chief
Justice or, in his absence, to the senior judge
of the Supreme Court.
I assume, honourable senators, that all of
us with an historic sense of the development
of our country during the first one hundred
years of Confederation will find it of interest
to learn that we are dealing here with an
amendment that involves the abrogation of
the rules of the Judicial Committee of the
Privy Council, but this, of course, is a natural
corollary to the political and autonomous evolution of our great country, and an indication
that we feel, with the greatest respect to the
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, that
we have the necessary competence and
experience, based upon our own training, to
handle these matters.
The foregoing are five basic amendments to
the Supreme Court Act. This bill contains
also a number of incidental amendments
which will be of interest only to lawyers,
because they involve proceedings in appeal,
deposits, notices to the registrar, and other
procedural matters. There is, however, one
very interesting amendment which also has
historic
significance
and
that is that
the
practice
of
buying
stamps
in
Supreme Court proceedings will be repealed.
If the amendment is passed, in lieu of the
purchase of stamps, cash will, of course, be
paid. We have here also a certain historic
significance when we think of the Stamp Act
which produced certain results in the 18th
century in the country to the south of us and
I would think that any reminder of, shall we
say, our colonial status many years ago,
w hen the element of stamps played an
important role, will be removed.
Clause 10 brings into play the necessary
amendments to a series of statutes that form
part of the schedule to the amending bill.
These amendments to the varions acts that
you will see therein are necessitated by the
proposed amendments to which I have just
referred.

October 3, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Finally, clause 11, provides that if and
when this bill becomes the law of the
land it will come into force as provided therein. The necessary time must be given in due
course to the members of the legal profession
to accustom themselves to the consequences
resulting from the proposed amendments.
Before I proceed to deal with the specific
clauses-and I shall try to be brief in dealing
with them now that I have given you the
basic outline-I should like to call attention
to a very important point. There will no
doubt arise in the minds of some of the senators the question as to what happens to pending litigation, having regard to the proposed
amendments. In this regard I should like to
point out that there is judicial authority for
the statement that the proposed changes to
which I have just referred and, more particularly, the proposed change to section 36, will
not affect issues presently pending. For the
purposes of the record, the authorities are the
cases of Hyde and Lindsay, 1898, 29 Supreme
Court Reports at page 99, and Fleming and
Atkinson, 1956, Supreme Court Reports, page
761. I thought that this ought to be incorporated in my general introduction, as no
doubt this would be a technical point that
would excite the interest and attention of fellow lawyers and fellow senators in this
chamber.
I now come specifically to the consideration
of the various sections of the law under the
headings to which I have just referred. The
first one is clause 1 which proposes to repeal
section 36 and to replace same so as to provide for an appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada only on a question of law and where
the amount or value exceeds $10,000. The new
section 36 also covers the right of appeal on
proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus or mandamus.
This, therefore, disposes of the first basic
item, clause 1 of the bill; that is, the replacement of the present section 36 of the Supreme
Court Act.
The second important item is clause 2 of
the amending bill and this involves the
amendment to section 39 of the Supreme
Court Act and refers to what we call appeals
per saltum; appeals by jumping over the
lower courts by consent and moving on to the
Supreme Court of Canada. The explanation
given in the copy of the bill before you indicates that as the result of the amendment in
1956 there was human oversight in not bringing an amendment to section 39 in line with
the 1956 amendment of section 36. Therefore
29234-141

it is proposed that in section 39 under clause
2 an amendment will be provided to bring it
into line with section 36. Under section 39 the
right of appeal will lie only on questions of
law and in amounts or value in excess of

$10,000.
We now come to clause 3 of the bill. This
involves the question of a quorum which is
needed to deal with the subject matter of
application for leave to appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada. I draw attention to
the fact that the quorum, to which we
referred in clause 3, is a quorum of judges
necessary to consider the applications for
leave to appeal and not the quorum, obviously, for the hearing of the appeal itself if the
application is granted. The quorum is three. I
do not think that, in giving a general explanation on this bill at this time, I should enumerate the number of statutes where the
right of application for leave to appeal is now
granted to one judge, because it is intended
to eliminate that right and in any event if the
honourable senators are interested that subject matter can be pursued in the study of the
item in more detail before the committee to
which, no doubt, this important bill will be
sent.
Attention is drawn, however, to the very
important item where we are dealing with
offences punishable by death and here in the
best tradition of our country, where the liberty and the life of the individual are involved,
five judges are required to constitute a
quorum.
Clause 3 provides that:
... except

that in the case of an applica-

tion for leave to appeal from a judgment
of a court
(a) quashing a conviction of an offence
punishable by death, or
(b) dismissing an appeal against an
acquittal of an off ence punishable by
death, including an acquittal in respect of
a principal offence where the accused has
been convicted of an offence included in
the principal off ence,
any five judges of the Court constitute a
quorum.
Hon. Mr. Martin: What is the quorum now?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Three.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: In some cases it is only
one.
Hon. Mr. Phillips (Rigaud): The quorum is
five, or will remain five, in cases involving
off ences punishable by death.

SENATE DEBATES
Honourable senators will note, in the explanation to clause 3 of the bill-and here again
I will not stay our deliberations unduly-that
this comes in as a result of certain amendments which were enacted in 1961, more
particularly section 597A of the Criminal
Code. On study, honourable senators will find
that clause 3, proposing this amendment
bringing in a new section 44A, and involving
the repeal of the old section 44A, is for the
purpose of bringing it in line with the amendments to the Criminal Code in 1961 and
more particularly section 597A.

Clause 4 deals with the subject matter to
which I referred in my introductory remarks,
with respect to appeals in habeas corpus proceedings. Here it is proposed to eliminate
entirely from the jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court the initial right to hear, as a court of
record in first instance, habeas corpus
proceedings.
This involves the repeal of sections 57 to 60
of the present act. The rights of appeal of the
subject are well covered in the Criminal Code
and in the law as it presently exists, so that
there is no curtailment or interference in any
way whatsoever with the liberty of the subject and his right to be heard, ultimately, in
grave matters involving habeas corpus and
his liberty, before the Supreme Court of
Canada.
Honourable senators, I think it very important that this be pointed out, because in going
back to the historic rights associated with the
writ of habeas corpus, the first reaction is
one, shall we say, of concern, in noting that
there is a denial of the right of habeas corpus
directly to the Supreme Court of Canada.
Honourable senators will find, upon a study
of the pertinent provisions of the Criminal
Code amendments heretofore passed, that the
repeal of sections 57 to 60 of the Supreme
Court Act need cause us no concern in that
respect.
Honourable senators, if by any chance in
presenting this very important clause for
your consideration I have overlooked anything important in se far as the liberty of the
subject is concerned, the matter may well be
picked up by the law officers of the Crown
and by members of the committee who eventually will be dealing with this important
clause.
Clause 5 is the very interesting clause to
which I referred, that is, about the Judicial
Committee of the Privy Council. It is
proposed that section 63 of the act, which

October 3, 1968

heretofore referred to practices of the Judicial Committee, be repealed, and that section
63 be amended to read as follows:
Proceedings on an appeal shall, when
not otherwise provided for by this act, or
by the act providing for the appeal, or by
the general rules and orders of the
Supreme Court, be in conformity with
any order made, upon application by a
party to the appeal, by the Chief Justice
or, in his absence, by the senior puisne
judge present.
The explanation, which honourable senators have already noted, is that previously the
Supreme Court rules in that respect were to
be as nearly as possible in conformity with
the present practice of the Judicial Committee of Her Majesty's Privy Council. I have
already stated-and I hope I am not too
redundant when I say it again-that I regard
this clause as of particular historic significance in this august chamber, because it
brings back memories of the evolution of our
state, the cessation of rights of appeal to the
Privy Council, and of the associated matters
which corne to mind as citizens and subjects
of this great nation of ours.
Those are the five basic amendments to the
bill that I have dealt with generally and a
little less generally within the last ten or
fifteen minutes.
Honourable senators, I would say, I can
pass over the remaining clauses of the bill
with considerable celerity because, although
they are important to litigants and to those
who regard procedural matters in a court of
law as of vital importance, I do not think the
amendments need detain us unduly at this
stage.
Clause 6 covers the matter of procedures on
appeal, the security that has to be filed, the
notice of security, the service and filing of the
notice of appeal, and, when error is alleged,
what is to be done about it.
The reading of clause 6 and the reasons for
the change are, in my humble opinion, clear;
and I would be but delaying the deliberations
of this chamber by reading the notation
which is already before you.
Honourable senators, I come to clause 7,
which is merely a provision to bring into
harmony certain sections of the Supreme
Court Act pursuant to which the sheriff is
allowed to grant a stay of execution in certain
cases where judgment bas been rendered,

October 3, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

once the appeal has been filed and the security has been deposited, as provided for in the
proposed amendment just discussed.
Clause 9 is of some interest. Under it, section 106 of the act is repealed and the following substituted therefor:
106. All fees payable to the Registrar
under this act shall be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund and the Registrar shall regulate the collection of such
fees.

There will be all sorts of matters coming
before the Supreme Court of Canada in our
day and in the days to follow. Let us hope
that we are sitting in on an historic moment
when we lay the foundations for relieving the
Supreme Court of some of its present tasks,
so enabling it to use its undoubted talents in
a direction where it can be a decisive influence in helping this great country of ours.

Clause 10 is an important one, because in
amending a statute so overwhelmingly important as the Supreme Court Act, it will be
appreciated it affects many statutes in Canada
where there is a right of appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada. The pertinent and
relevant provisions of these acts, because of
Clause 10, are brought into harmony with the
proposed amendments under clauses 1 to 9
inclusive.
The acts I refer to are: the Bankruptcy
Act, the Criminal Code, the Companies'
Creditors Arrangement Act, the Exchequer
Court Act, the National Defence Act, the
National Energy Board Act, the Railway Act,
and the Winding-up Act. Clause 11 is the one
to which I referred, "This Act shall come into
force on a day to be fixed by proclamation."
Honourable senators, I have before me a
partial list of the burdensome amount of
appeals that come to the Supreme Court of
Canada under various pieces of legislation. I
will not read them into the record but they
will be available for the committee hearing. It
is hoped, as I said, that at the beginning of
our second century of political life, having
regard to the fact that in our system of Government the legislative executive and judicial
branches must operate smoothly and efficiently, it is necessary to introduce changes so as
to relieve the justices of some tasks to enable
them to perform the greater ones. The eminent jurists who now grace that court and
who, we hope, will grace that court from
time to time, will be able to use their great
juridical and legal talents in part to deal with
such subject matters as the interpretation of
our jurisdictional disputes in our complex
federal system, and in the clarification of our
basic statutes, constitutional and otherwise.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: Am I correct in understanding that the present complete discretion
given to the Supreme Court to give leave te
appeal to it in any decision of its choice will
continue? If so, does the honourable sponsor
agree that the restriction we now have with
regard to the amount referred to in clauses 1
and 2 of this bill, namely, $10,000, runs contrary to this discretion that will continue?
Furthermore, does he not believe that this
discretion creates a sort of imbalance because
the Supreme Court may go against this trend
of restricting the number of appeals, if it can
give leave in any case of its choice without
having any guidelines as it had in previous
years?

Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators,

This is of historical interest, as bas been

pointed out already.

Hon. Mr. Phillips (Rigaud): I owe honourable senators and the honourable senator who
just spoke an apology. I should have referred
to the fact that the proposed amendment ta
section 36 does not eliminate the court's jurisdiction to deal with questions of fact, or
mixed law and fact, if justice in the particular case requires this te be done. In such
case, leave to appeal could be granted under
section 41 of the Supreme Court Act.
The honourable senator, however, has put
his question to me not only with respect te
the right of the Justices of the Supreme Court
to grant an appeal under section 41 but in
terms of whether it would be likely, because
of the amendments we are proposing, that the
judges of the Supreme Court would be
inclined, even though they have the discretionary power under section 41, to allow an
appeal in matters of mixed fact and law.
Over a period of years the tendency might be
not to allow some of these appeals to be
heard even though the discretion is vested in
them. I would be inclined to express the view

SENATE DEBATES
that with the passage of time the ambit, shall
we say, of vitality of section 41 is likely to be
restricted. But I cannot reach into the minds
or into the judicial deliberations of the eminent Justices of the Supreme Court, nor can I
foresee the future even though I come from a
race of Prophets.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, may I say a few words in connection
with this matter. I have not studied it, as has
the honourable gentleman who bas just sat
down, but I would like to express my
appreciation for the address that he has
delivered to us, the lucid explanation and the
breadth of his knowledge. His understanding
of the basic principles which be bas discussed
in their historic relationship has been most
interesting and most instructive.
This is an exceedingly important bill, and I
hesitate to discuss the details of it without
much further understanding and study of the
text, but there are some observations I would
like to make. One concerns the limitation of
appeal to the sum of $10,000. I suppose there
are some grounds for restricting appeals. We
might have to have two or three courts sitting
if we allowed every one to appeal. But I have
never considered the limitation of appeals to
large sums of money as either just or necessary. It means that this court is restricted to
cases by the rich and excludes the rights of
poor people.
It may be necessary to do that, but, as an
advocate mostly of poor people in the past, I
would like to see the rights of the ordinary
person placed on the same basis as those of
rich people. Not infrequently, honourable
senators, the causes for complaint where
small amounts of money are involved are just
as important from a human standpoint as
those with many thousands of dollars at issue.
At the same time, I would hesitate long and
carefully before amending that particular
clause. I would like more time to think about
it, and I have no doubt that the honourable
gentleman will refer this measure to a committee, where most of us lawyers will assemble with perhaps more knowledge than we
had at the commencement of this debate.
I am rather sorry to see the right of
application to the Supreme Court in matters
of habeas corpus at the original trial, or at
first instance, dispensed with by this bill.
Habeas corpus is an ancient right that has
been developed over the years, chiefly in
Great Britain, and it is something to be interfered with only with great care. It has been

October 3, 1968

set aside in times of stress, such as war
times, but I have always regretted the fact
that it was so set aside. I have thought that in
time of excitement, antipathies and hates,
habeas corpus was more important than in
ordinary times. You will find it in the original
Magna Carta. You will find habeas corpus
referred to in the Bill of Rights. It has been
treasured by Anglo-Saxon people over the
centuries and it is highly respected by anyone
with even a fireside knowledge of law.
Hon. Mr.
denied.

Flynn: But the appeal is

not

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: If I understood my
honourable friend Senator Phillips correctly,
and based on my quick reading of the bill,
the Supreme Court of Canada is not a court
of first instance, but only a court of appeal.
Am I right?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Such a person can appeal
to the Supreme Court.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, but in the past the
Supreme Court has heard applications for
writs of habeas corpus.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It is the same thing.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No. It is a very different
thing. That court was a court of first instance
as well as a court of appeal; and furthermore,
in these applications for writs of habeas corpus
the profession was allowed to shop around,
because if one judge might not give it another
judge might. Finally, people have come all
the way to Ottawa to apply to the Supreme
Court of Canada for a writ of habeas corpus.
If I am right in my understanding, that will
no longer apply, and applications will be restricted to the Court of Appeal of the province or other courts of first instance. Now,
that may be all right, but I look on it with a
question mark, and I am rather sorry to see it
disappear. It has been an extra protection for
the individual.
The abolition of the law stamp seems to me
to be a matter of very small importance. It
may be more convenient to put the money
directly into the till rather than issue stamps,
but I have always thought that the real purpose of the law stamps was to facilitate
bookkeeping. The official is given so many
stamps and he is expected to return so
much money, and the stamps appear on the
documents. I suppose a record in the cash
book will be sufficient. As I say, I do not
consider it to be a matter of very great
importance.

October 3, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

The fact that our Supreme Court of Canada
is now the court of last resort is to me a
matter of pride. It indicates the maturity of
our country. We are no longer dependent on
people across the seas to decide for us the
more important principles of our law. It is a
matter of further pride to me that our court
has risen to the situation and has conducted
itself with confidence, with skill and with
good judgment in these years since it was
made the court of final appeal. That matter
is, I am sure, a source of pride and satisfaction to every Canadian.
In the old days, when I was conducting
more of these arguments than I have done in
recent years, we made applications to the
court for the right to appeal, and they were
heard by all five judges, the full court. Frequently the application for the right to appeal
was turned into the trial, and the whole subject was dealt with in one hearing. Now with
only three judges hearing the appeal-and
that I think has been the practice in recent
years-the only way in which the court can
make a final decision is to refuse the right of
appeal.
My friend the Leader of the Opposition, I
think, suggested that the discretion given in
this new act was very wide, but I think he
will find that in actual practice applications
will be determined in accordance with the
law as it stands. Most of the decisions will
turn on such questions as whether the full
$10,000 is involved, or whether it is entirely a
question of law or one of mixed law and fact,
and not one purely of fact. The decisions will
not be capricious.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Obiter dicta.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I also have a question
in mind as to whether we are wise in restricting the court to questions only of law or
mixed law and fact in which questions of law
are involved. But frequently the rights of the
individual depend on decisions of fact. I do
not like to see the jurisdiction of the court
restricted. However, it does seem to me that
considerable thought has been given to these
amendments. Nevertheless, they justify a
very careful consideration by this chamber,
such as we give in our committees.
I have a final compliment to pay to my
friend Senator Phillips, who has given us
such a wonderful explanation of this bill. His

address was full of knowledge and references
to the basic principles of law. With that one
final compliment to him, that is all I have to
say now.

POVERTY IN CANADA
MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL
COMMITTEE-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. David A. Croll moved, pursuant to
notice:
That a special committee of the Senate
be appointed to investigate and report
upon all aspects of poverty in Canada,
whether urban, rural, regional or otherwise, to define and elucidate the problem
of poverty in Canada, and to recommend
appropriate action to ensure the establishment of a more effective structure of
remedial measures;
That the committee have power to
engage the services of such counsel, staff
and technical advisers as may be necessary for the purpose of the inquiry;
That the committee have power to send
for persons, papers and records, to examine witnesses, and to report from time to
time;
That the committee be authorized to
print such papers and evidence from day
to day as may be ordered by the committee, to sit during sittings and adjournments of the Senate, and to adjourn from
place to place; and
That the committee be composed of
seventeen senators, to be named later.
He said: Honourable senators, the motion
before us did not come out of thin air. From
time to time I have spoken out against the
present welfare system, indicating that it had
broken down and had been a failure, and that
the existing welfare structure is bankrupt in
social purpose. All members of this house
know that the welfare system was born in the
depression to serve in an emergency, and that
it has perpetuated itself.
I have been thinking about this matter for
some time, and assembling material I collected information from departments of government and from outside sources. On March 15
last the Department of National Health and

October 8, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Welfare provided me with the balance of the
material that I required from them, and on
May 2 the then chairman of the Standing
Committee on Finance, our present Speaker,
provided me with answers to lengthy and
involved questions relating to welfare and
poverty. When I glanced through these documents-and they were voluminous-I could
not see daylight. I could not make up my
mind where to start. So, I salved my conscience by saying to myself: Well, poverty has
been here for two thousand years, and a little
longer will not make much difference. I tried
to put it out of my mind. Of course, it did not
go away.
The Fifth Annual Review of the Economie
Council came almost as a sign and a star of
hope, and it also provided guidelines. I think
it is essential reading for every member of
the Senate. In particular, no one should fail
to read chapter six of this document. It is of
the greatest consequence and in it many
things are said.
Who composes the Economic Council of
Canada? Each honourable senator bas on his
desk a copy of the Annual Review of the
Economic Council of Canada. The Council
comprises 25 outstanding men and women,
representative of all walks of life. Wherever
you may turn in a figurative "Who's Who in
Canada", there are people who are members
of the Economic Council. They are the people
who signed this report. One of the most significant things they said was that the guaranteed income should be examined, researched
and studied, and that it is recommended by
many distinguished persons. I would add my
own view that it could help the poor in a
direct fashion. It could treat people as responsible individuals and not as incompetent
wards of the state. It could be an incentive to
people to help themselves, and could cost less
than the present system.
What in particular attracts me, and what I
think bas attracted the Senate, is that the
income test to decide who shall receive assistance from the Government is the same as
that now used to decide who shall pay the
cost of the Government.
In addition, you will notice that they speak
of pilot projects. There are two or three pilot
projects going on in the United States at the
federal level. There is a very interesting pilot
project in the State of New Jersey. They have
taken one thousand low-income families and
are giving them the guaranteed income for a
period of two years. Case works are studying
each case individually. What they want to
know is-whether the guaranteed income is

an incentive or a crutch. That is a question
that we will have to answer to ourselves in
due course.
In addition to that, they commented on the
Canada Assistance Act. That act had a great
potential when it was put on the Statute
books, and I think it still has; but, unfortunately, the interpretations made in various
parts of the country about some people who
work full time and others who work part
time have made the act almost ineffective.
We have not as yet come up with the answer as to what should be done about insufficiency of earnings. A very large proportion of
our poor people are badly served by the welfare program.
There is a growing social policy of low-paid
full-time workers, which is resulting in
voluntary unemployment. We have to face up
to it sooner or later: the right of a low-paid
worker to choose unemployment welfare, or
the modern scales of benefit, rather than a
job at wages inadequate by any standard.
We also have to consider the person who
bas part-time work. Should we permit him to
have a certain exempt wage in order to make
up sufficient to his minimum income?
Honourable senators, I spoke about the
pilot projects which we know are in existence
at the present time-the three in the United
States at the federal level and the one in the
State of New Jersey. I think the most successful one we have found is in Sweden; but
before you vote this committee into existence
you should keep in mind that the committee
will have to go and look at it. It is not good
enough for the deputy minister to go and look
at it: we want the eyes of this committee to
look at it and their minds to appreciate it.
There are also one or two projects in Great
Britain, and some here at home.
Furthermore, we must see how our manpower policies are serving the people. We will
have to hear from the people. We must see
placementand
counselling
our
how
in-employment services are serving the people.
There have been some useful pilot projects in
Canada and more are being undertaken at the
present time. No one claims to have the answers. There is a great deal more that must
be tried and developed.
Honourable senators, I suggest this is a
field that we must thoroughly investigate: we
must try to find out how employment opportunities and training opportunities and moving to new jobs can be brought into the lives
of people who psychologically and often
physically are furthest from them. There are

SENATE DEBATES
Canadians who are below the poverty line.
This we should not and cannot tolerate.
The Economie Council of Canada tells
us we have unilingual, bilingual and multicultural poverty in this country-and you
can take your choice. The country has an
abundance of everything, including poverty.
Honourable senators, notwithstanding all
this, I believe we have the capacity to do
.away with the conditions of poverty. This is a
challenge we could not have avoided. I think
it takes some guts for this Senate to grapple
with this problem, for poverty in varying
degrees has been with the country a very
long time.
Here we will be dealing with left-behind
people who look to Government for a fair
share. The road to a poorless society is
uncharted, and we have to ask ourselves: Do
we build anew or do we build on to institutional structures already accepted? I suppose
the answer is that we will do some of both.
Nevertheless, I point out that money alone
is not going to solve this problem. A poorless
society requires more than a minimum
income. The present provisions for assuring a
minimum income to maintain standards of
living through public assistance and other
selected programs are a hodgepodge of gaps,
inadequacies and inequalities. Many of them
are successful failures-the operation was a
success, but the patient died. The programs
were well-intentioned and directed but the
results were failures.
We have tried to "welfare" and "casework"
the poor out of poverty. We must admit at
this stage that we have failed.
I urge honourable senators to undertake
this study for a particular reason that should
appeal to the country: we are best qualified to
do it. If a royal commission were appointed it
would need a staff-as of course we will need
a staff. On its staff it would have two or three
very capable, well-informed persons who
would know the score on this particular problem. But we in this chamber already have
men with experience, know-how, capacity,
and our committee could be composed of
representatives from every province.
We have more than once indicated that we
care about the people of Canada; we care
about the poor. Moreover, we are not a oneshot affair. We are a continuing body that can
well follow up its recommendations.
I will admit quite frankly that we could not
aave handled the Commission on Bilingualism
.and Biculturalism because it needed some

October 8, 1968

special orientation. We could not have handled the Glassco Commission because an
expertise was required there that we did not
then possess. But we have proved our ability
over the last seven years by our reports of
inquiries and investigations. Sure, these reports were born of boredom and frustration.
But the results were of great significance.
When you consider-and I merely mention
them today-the Report of the Special Committee on Manpower and Employment, the
Report of the Special Committee on Land Use
in Canada, the Report of the Special Committee on Aging, the Report on Consumer
Credit and the great Report on Divorce, you
will realize that we have been busy people
herefor the last seven years.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Whatever happened to
them?
Hon. Mr. Croll: A great deal happened to
them.
Hon. Mr. Choquelle: Yes?
Hon. Mr. Croll: A great deal happened to
every one of these reports. They were not
shelved, not one of them.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Otiawa West): Legislation came out of them.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Of course; and when we
reach committee I will be glad to answer at
length the question concerning what happened to these reports, and I will deal with
each one of them individually. But we have
proved one thing: we in this chamber are not
men and women of the past who want things
of the past.
There are professional belittlers of the
Senate who continue to play, repetitiously, a
cracked record about this body. They do not
know what they are talking about. The
Senate which they condemned does not live
here anymore. It has not been here for about
ten years. The reformation began quietly in
its own way. It is being done from within. In
my view there is nothing wrong with the
Senate that more work and responsibility
could not cure. To date we have never been
tested; our potential has never been totally
used. It is time we stopped apologizing for
the Senate, particularly for the Senate which
no longer exists.
The Economic Council of Canada in its
hard-hitting annual report, which you have
before you, issued an invitation to the Senate.
It might better be called a challenge to
inquire in depth concerning, and to propose

October 8, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

solutions respecting, problems of poverty in
Canada. The exact words of the Economic
Council on pages 136 and 137 should be
reviewed. I quote:
The Senate of Canada might consider
the advisability of creating a committee
to enquire into the problem of poverty in
Canada. An earlier Senate enquiry into
the problems of land use in Canada
helped to bring about the Agricultural
Rehabilitation and Development Act (ARDA) in 1961.
That is part of the answer to Senator Choquette's question, though it is only a small
part.
The inquiry we propose would deal with
all aspects of poverty, urban and rural.
Many excellent witnesses, both Canadian
and foreign, would be available to appear
before the committee, whose work could
also be aided by a small but competent
research staff. The work of such a committee could do much to define and elucidate the problem of poverty in Canada,
and to build public support for more
effective structure of remedial measures.

If this is the spirit of the Senate's wishes,
of course it will be up to the committee to
settle on its most useful lines of work. But
there are some clear pointers and I think we
should all be aware of those even before a
decision is made to establish a committee.
The recent report of the Economic Council
of Canada has articulated the concerns that
have led many of us to want to take the kind
of step that is proposed in this action. The
Economie Council in its analysis has also
confirmed the view of the problem that I
know is held by many other people who have
looked at it most closely. In Canada over
recent years we have been getting most of
our general policies and programs into a
shape which makes possible some solution of
the hard core poverty problem. What we still
lack are effective mechanisms for making the
possible actual in the lives of individual men,
women and children who are trapped in a
vicious circle of poverty-perpetuating circumstances, people who are out of the mainstream of our economic and social progress
and who have no chance of getting into it
unless they receive intensive individual help
on a basis that is available in far too few
cases today.
We cannot get the answers by any small,
narrow investigation. We have to look searchingly and thoroughly at the poverty problem.
Poverty over the years has changed but has
not vanished. Patronizing poverty, as we have
done in the past, will get us nowhere.
The council rendered a public service to
Canada by drawing attention to poverty in
this forthright language:
Poverty in Canada is real. Its numbers
are not in the thousands, but the millions.
There is more of it than our society can
tolerate, more than our economy can
afford, and far more than existing measures and efforts can cope with. Its persistance, at a time when the bulk of
Canadians enjoy one of the highest
standards of living in the world, is a
disgrace.

The present motion is drafted in response to
that challenge, and the language is drawn in
the words of the review which I have just
quoted.
Now, the motion that I have put forward is
deliberately stated in broad terms. I propose
that a committee be formed to investigate and
report upon all aspects of power and poverty
in Canada, and I hope it will not be misunderstood as to the purpose of the wording. It
is to ensure that the committee does not find
itself restricted in carrying out its task. The
spirit in which I am proposing that the committee be established is one of urgency and a
need to get action now.
Obviously the action objective will not be
achieved if the committee regards the investigation of all aspects of poverty as an objective in itself. In that case it would be setting
up an assignment to last many years. We

conclusions.

SENATE DEBATES

It also points out that poverty is not identical with simple income deficiency, although
this is an identifiable thing in respect of
which some relevant statistics are available.
It is also a state of mind which I cannot
stress too strongly.
Recently I read in a book of a man who
had come from a poor home and who had
done very well. He made this statement,
which I thought was worth repeating: "We
were never poor, only broke." In this sense
poverty is always relevant to space, time and
the state of mind.
But to some people it is very real. It was
real to a man whose picture appeared on the
front page of the Ottawa Journal on September 9. He might have been sitting next to me
or to you, a nice, clean, fine-looking man. He
was in a protest march and was carrying a
sign which said "Being poor is Hell". Now it
is difficult enough to be poor without having
to prove it and to admit it, and in the lottery
of life this man has drawn a blank.
Before we get further into the subject, I
need to cover another topic. Public welfare is
a halfway house; it bas become a system of
handouts, a second-rate set of social services
that damages and demeans its recipients, and
the program has become bankrupt. But I do
not accept the specious charges that welfare
lists are packed with bums, deadbeats, con
men and loafers. My question is whether the
welfare programs serve the poor, and effectively assist those who can be redeemed from
poverty. Up to the present time it does in
some way seem to have served the poor, but
not very many welfare recipients have been
rescued from it. The need is for the incentives
which are lacking, the right to earn without
penalty. These are things that must be given

October 8, 1968

We agreed that the welfare system does not
work. That conclusion has been reached by
social workers, academics and administrators,
and is heard across the country. It has been
accepted by economists, businessmen and
politicians. As a replacement for welfare
there bas been increasing attention to an
annual guaranted income, and although this
goes deeply against religious ethics, the concept is gaining support.
Many people connected with welfare have
come to the conclusion that the present system is so insanely set up that it defeats its
purpose. For every person on welfare there is
at least one equally poor who through pride

category is not benefiting at all.
I started out by saying that this system
came out of the depression and was built in a
hurry. Here we have a systern which originated in the 1930s, and in the 1960s it is outdated
because it was designed to help persons who
were temporarily victims of the depression of
the thirties. It is an inadequate system which
fails to provide a decent level of support to
many of the people it is supposed to help.
It is uneven. The assistance differs very
widely from province to province and even
within a province. There is fragmented federal assistance which is spread over many,
many categories, and it is self-perpetuating.
There is little incentive offered for most
employable welfare clients to go to work.
Thus a person who takes a low-paid job may
be no better off financially for his show of
initiative.

SENATE DEBATES
of the nineteenth century. The marks of poverty today are more subtle and more complex.
So we must first know what poverty is, how
widespread it is, and what forms it takes.
This we do know, that poverty breeds poverty, and poverty is perpetuating.
Let me carry this analysis a little further.
There are two main kinds of poverty problems facing us. First, there are the people and
families that have no possibility whatever of
earning an income which will bring them
above the poverty line, however we define
that line. That may be true of the chronically
sick and handicapped, the aged, of households in which school-age children are fatherless. In this kind of circumstance, where
there is no possibility of a full-time breadwinner, the prevention of poverty depends on
social security progranis, welfare and social
assistance programs, or whatever label one
wants to use for the various categories of
assistance.
In these fields our Canadian measures are
extensive in comparison with most countries,
and of late they have been greatly improved.
I am thinking of the Canada Pension Plan,
the Old Age Supplement which provides a
degree of guaranteed income, and the Canada
Assistance Plan which, if the provinces so
wish, provides half the cost of assistance on a
very flexible income test.
I am not suggesting that our income
maintenance measures are complete. Obviously, frcm their practical application, they are
not, but it is equally clear that the intent is
there, and so is a great deal of appropriate
machinery. Our problem is in finding out why
there are nevertheless many cases in which
the necessary maintenance is not provided on
a scale suffcient to save families from acute
destructive poverty.
That is one kind of poverty. There is a
second kind, and here I am referring to cases
where the primary difflculty, at least, is not
that a family lacks a member of the labour
force. The problem is that that worker does
not earn enough. We may be dealing here
with long-term unemployment, or with the
under-employment of the marginal farmer or
fisherman, or with the seasonal casual nature
of such jobs as are available to many people
in many areas of this country.
J do not suggest that they are necessarily
the most frequent. In some areas they probably are, and in other areas they certainly are
not. But, in many areas tragically there are
many cases where families are poor, despite
having a man or a woman who is or who
could be employable, because that person is

October 8, 1968

not in fact able to work steadily and effectively at decent wages. Here, surely, is the
basic and stubborn problem we have to solve.
It is not one of income maintenance or assistance; it is a problem of how to make
employment opportunities effective for those
whom they now pass by.
If that diagnosis is right-and I think it
clearly is-the main measures needed are the
two upon
which

has
embarked. They are manpower programs,
and regional or area development programs,

employment. Yet, the results are something
less than those of which we can be proud.
Honourable senators, let me give you a
classie example. I have been talking about the
man who goes to work, and who works as
best be can, but who does not earn enough
money to keep his family together. I am talking about a plant in Picton, Ontario, which is
near Belleville and Peterborough, and not
very far from Kingston. It is a town of 5,000
people in the heart of that area of Ontario.
There is at this time a strike at the ProctorSilex Company plant there which has been
reported on in the press. There is a manthere is no need for me to mention his name,
but if any honourable senator is interested in
knowing i he will find it in the Toronto
Telegram of October 3, 1968---who works at
repairing irons in

that factory. In

the week

before the strike he worked 39 hours for
which he was paid $54.12. After be had paid
his unemployment insurance, his income tax,
his Canada Pension Plan instalment, and his
hospitalization payment, he wound up with
$39.73 which he took home. He has two sons
of high school age. Another case is cited of a
woman who worked for 20 hours and
received $17.89. Workers at the Canadian
General Electric Company's plant at Barrie
receive $2 an hour, whereas these people
receive $1.37 an hour.
The Toronto Globe and Mail was very
disturbed about this whole situation, and it is
interesting to read what they say about it. In
an editorial in the issue of September 30, last
they say:
Ontario should have a minimum wage
at present of $1.50 an hour, and it should
apply to every worker.
The editorial continues:
The cry will of course be raised that
such a minimum-and it should be only a
beginning, there should be constant
review-would push a lot of companies
out of business. The cry would not

October 8, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

always, or perhaps even often, be true.
Forcing many companies to pay decent
wages would force them to become
efficient. But where it is true, the brutal
honesty of the situation is that such companies should go broke. If they cannot
survive without being subsidized by their
workers, they damage the economy as
well as the workers. They should go to
the wall and leave room for companies
that are efficient enough to concentrate
on what Canada can do well, and do
competitively.
Those are harsh words, but are they not
deserved? I share the view that a plant has a
social responsibility to the community as well
as its shareholders. Is not this the sort of
thing that keeps these people in perpetual
poverty? These people do not have a choice
of more than four or five plants at which to
work. Such plants as this locate themselves in
communities where there are married women
who can work part time, and they are quick
with their fingei-s and do good work. But the
men and women who live in these communities never get an opportunity to rise above
the situation in which they find themselves,
and this is one of the things to which we have
to give some thought.
As I pointed out earlier, the report of the
Economic Council will increase our interest in
a guaranteed annual income. They say that
we ought to study it. So, it is no longer "Pie
in the Sky", but a star of hope for the poor.
The Beveridge Report came out in 1942,
and honourable senators will remember the
cry that it would provide security from the
cradle to the grave, and from the womb to
the tomb. It contained provisions for all people in the manner of social security. That
report came out of a study made by the London School of Economics, in which the Laskis
were prime movers. To this day there have
been very few changes in it, but the one new,
original, and creative contribution that was
made to it, and effectively made, came from
this chamber when we, in our report on
aging, recommended the guaranteed annual
income, and which the Government accepted.
And, we did more than that. When the Government accepted that, they did away with
the means test-something that was not only
mean, but something that perturbed the people. When we did what we did in bringing
about these two reforms we enjoyed one of
the finest moments that the Senate has had in
many years.

Some of our most important welfare programs have an aspect of universality. We
have got to take another look at these programs, as we have already looked at Old Age
Security and made it meaningful to those in
need, for the payments made under the
universal programs are very often quite
inadequate.
The Economic Council of Canada has
reminded us that more than 40 per cent of
our non-farm population live in conditions
which are a disgrace; that millions of Canadians live lives of entrapment and hopelessness.
There are families where the "culture of
poverty" has been transferred from one generation to the next and there seems to be no
way for the new generation to break down
the vicious circle.
We are now starting to hear in this country
much talk about selectivity. It is a modern
term for the means test. The right-wing
groups are speaking of it, and some wellmeaning people do not appreciate its full significance. If you select and divide, you divide
the rich from the poor, which is exactly what
we are trying not to do. We will create a
chasm which will never be bridged and will
divide us even more. It creates artificiality, or
at least by official recognition emphasizes an
inequality of dignity between two social
groups, between the one who aids and the
one who is aided. This social segregation is an
affront to the dignity of the whole population.
Selectivity instead of universality is a blind
alley. It is a beautiful theory but it will not
work, and we have had our experiences of it
in this country. Universality is simple to
administer, pays benefits to everybody and
we get the money back at the end of the year
from those who pay income tax.
While poverty remains a social problem of
the greatest urgency, it weakens our productive capacity and our efforts towards national
unity. There are no magic solutions, but in
the course of the study there will be opportunity for experimentation and pilot projects.
We shall have to take some risks, and perhaps have some failures in our efforts to find
new ways to abolish the misery in our midst.
In the course of our study we shall have to
turn to the poor for their ideas and their
participation.
It is not an easy task. The challenge of the
Economic Council is a very simple one. How
can a great attack on poverty be waged,
involving possibly the guaranteed minimum
income, housing, health, education and other
needs which are tremendous, not forgetting
the upgrading of the Eskimo, Indian and

SENATE DEBATES
Metis living standards and many other aspects
of their lives, without at the same time
impoverishing the taxpayers? It is not easy to
answer that question, but there will be need
to co-ordinate the present anti-poverty policies, to revaluate them, to re-appraise them,
and we shall have to question the adequacy
in the present orientation of some of the universal allowances.
Let me say this, and with it I will finish.
The relationship between poverty and violent
society must be watched. The welfare state is
outmoded; the welfare balloon has just about
burst. Soaring costs and soaring rolls spell
crisis. We Canadians have met the challenges
of war; we have met the challenges of climate
and the challenges of a vast country with a
small and sometimes divided population. One
of the greatest challenges to us today is
whether we can show the foresight, courage
and vision to guarantee to our young people
that they will be properly trained for the
future, that there is an opportunity for them
in Canada to live a normal decent life in a
poorless society.
It is not an easy task that we have undertaken, or that we are called upon to undertake. The Senate bas risen to the occasion in
the recent past, as the Economic Council was
kind enough to point out. We must do our
best to rise to the present occasion. In doing
this we should tackle the problem in depth
and endeavour to ascertain the root causes of
poverty, to define poverty in so far as it is
capable of definition, to propose practical
solutions which are within the power and
capacity of the state to provide, and which
will preserve the inherent dignity of every
Canadian. We must look not merely for temporary palliatives or handouts but for longterm goals towards which we may work in
order that poverty in the midst of plenty may
ultimately cease to exist in this country. We
cannot forever tolerate what are sometimes
dismissed as mere "pockets of poverty" when
these pockets are as large as those in a
clown's costume.
We will apply ourselves above all to the
problem of how to make government programs come alive for the many hundreds of
thousands, even the millions, of Canadians
who are now on the outside of the society of
which we are otherwise justifiably proud. In
the rough arithmetic of the Economic Council
there are 17 million of us inside and four
million of us outside. The real war on poverty
in Canada will be a co-ordinated effort to
remove the many kinds of obstacles which

stop the four million from joining the 17 million. Much has been done and is being done
to create some of the necessary paths. However, much remains to be done to help people
on to those paths.

cognizant of the fact that they really did not
have many rules. They changed their procedure from time to time; and one did not
know what to expect when one got there, nor
did one know what to rely upon, because
there really were no precedents. The Privy
Council was so informal. Therefore, it is very
appropriate that, in developing rules of the
Supreme Court of Canada, it should be upon
application by a party to the appeal, and
should be decided by the Chief Justice then
sitting or, in his absence, by the senior judge
who is present at that time.
There are other clauses which were gone
into by Senator Phillips (Rigaud), which do
not require any further elaboration from me.
Ilonourable senators, I have been astonished
at the overload of work in the Supreme
Court of Canada. I have been going there
for thirty years-though not so often since
I went into the cabinet. We used to wait
many months to get an appeal heard. At present there are 13 cases which have been carried over from the last session. That is a lot
of cases in the Supreme Court of Canada.
They opened their sitting on October 1, and
they have a list of 65 appeals perfected and
ready for hearing at the pre ent time.
I am sure that others share ny view, that
they will not get through the Quebec cases
before Christmas. This is a very serious
matter, for it is a question of wbether we
are overloading the Supreme Court of Canada. As it is, they commence sitting the
first of October, take a short break for Christmas, and work steadily through until the end
of June. I think we are in danger of overworking the court. If we do that, the tendency
will be either that the judges' health will
suffer or that their efforts will become less
thorough. I am sure that this particular
Supreme Court of Canada Bench will never
be accused of shirking its duties.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Hear,
hear.
Hon. Mr. Walker: Having watched the
work of the Supreme Court of Canada since
the beginning of October, I have been
astonished at the expeditious manner in
which they dispatch applications for leave to
appeal. On October 1 there were eight such
applications: one was granted, one was
reserved and the other six were dismissed.
My friend Senator Phillips is one who
appreciates how thoroughly the court goes
into these applications. The point is that such
applications for leave are added to the work

October 8, 1968

that the judges have to do in addition to the
65 major appeals they have to decide. On
October 7, just yesterday, I noted that of nine
applications for leave to appeal, two were
granted, three were reserved and four were
dismissed. I fear that if we keep on adding to
the burden of the Supreme Court, the court
could cease to function as efficiently.
I respectfully suggest to my distinguished
friend the Leader of the Government in the
Senate that he convey my apprehensions to the
Minister of Justice, who I am sure has given
some thought to this problem. Why should we
allow appeals from the Exchequer Court to
the Supreme Court of Canada? There may be
exceptions. There may be something that is
most extraordinary, but, as my friend knows,
the Exchequer Court is a distinctive court
requiring a vast amount of expertise to deal
with cases involving patents, trademarks,
copyright, income tax, and expropriation.
Why should they not, as one of the great
courts of our land, set up their own final
court of appeal, sitting, of course, en banc?
Why not do that instead of, without either
qualifications or restrictions, allowing anybody to lake the judgment of the Exchequer
Court and appeal it to the Supreme Court of
Canada? I might point out that 18 of the 65
appeals on the list of the Supreme Court of
Canada at the present time are appeals from
the Exchequer Court. As I have said, and as
my friend the leader knows, the Exchequer
Court occupies a field of its own, and to
expect the Supreme Court judges to "bone
up" on all the intricacies of these types of
cases that I have mentioned is too much to
expect. It is too big a workload and cannot
continue to be properly discharged.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Would
the honourable senator mind a question at
this point?
Hon. Mr. Walker: Not at all, sir.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): He says
there are 18 cases now pending before the
Supreme Court by way of appeal from the
Exchequer Court?
Hon. Mr. Walker: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I simply
ask a question for the purpose of the record
and for our use in committee. Perhaps it
might be possible for the officials to give the
type of case that is involved in each of these
appeals, whether it be trademark, copyright,
tax appeal or patent case. I suggest this

because the dissenting judge has been overruled by the majority court. The dissenting
judgment should be recorded, because lawyers could find great benefit from reading it
and discovering why such an argument was
not acceptable to the majority court. It is also
important because the dissenting judgment
may have great merit in it, enunciating
expanded principles which some day may be
acceptable in the evolution of our laws,
although not now accepted by the majority

are lawyers, even though we have not ail had
the same opportunity at continuous practice,
do admire and feel strongly about the effect
of judicial law-making, and would not want
to see our final court of appeal robbed of
what I think in time could prove to be a
valuable instrument in the process of
adjudication.
Of course this bill-and this is in answer to
Senator Walker-will go to a committee. I
may say that one of the reasons I rise at this
time is not merely to comment on what Senator Lang had said, but to suggest that we
might take advantage of what Senator Croll
said on another matter earlier in the day.
Should it be our custom in these matters to
have only the speech of the person who
presents the bill? Should the bill immediately
thereafter be sent to committee?
It seems to me that we would do well to
regard ourselves as being what in fact we
are, a forum. On this bill I should have
thought that it would have been profitable,
particularly for those who are learned in the
law, to have given this chamber and the
country the benefit of their rich experience
prior to sending the bill to committee.
I have said since I came into the Senate
that I have been greatly impressed with the
competence of the members of this chamber.
We have in this body some of the ablest
lawyers in the country. We are now engaged
in the responsibility of initiating an amendment to the Supreme Court Act. We have
profited greatly from the address of Senator
Phillips (Rigaud), and we have now had a
useful response by Senator Walker. I am sure
that there are many other senators in this
house who could make useful contributions to
this particular debate. While I do not want to
impel anyone now to do so, I wish to make
the observation that, if not on this measure,
on other measures that come before us in this
house we need not feel that it is necessary at
al times to leave the presentation to one
person on either side. Some of these matters
are too important te be robbed of the advantage of general discussion. While there is a
searching examination made in committee, I
think that a general discussion of a matter as
important as this warrants the fullest debate
prior to presentation to the committee.
I strongly commend these views to honourable senators and in doing so I warmly congratulate Senator Phillips (Rigaud) and Senator Walker and, of course, Senator Roebuck.

Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators,
commenting on the point that Senator Lang
has raised, I wish to say that I fully agree
with what Senator Walker has said. I should
like, perhaps with less justification, to expand
on Senator Walker's reply.
It is true that the Supreme Court of Canada
is now our final court of appeal. However,
this does not mean that it has not the authority to find occasion to take advantage of a
minority opinion. What the Government had
in mind when it decided to abolish appeals to
the Judicial Committee was not that it was
anxious to break away from that great source
of common law practice and adjudication, but
to give our Supreme Court of Canada an authority and status which it did not have, in
spite of its excellence, because it was not a
court of last resort.
When one considers the tremendous contribution to legal jurisprudence, for instance,
arising out of the Supreme Court of the United States, one thinks of Brandeis and Holmes
and their dissenting judgments. They may not
have been decisive factors in decisions of particular cases in which the dissent was registered, nevertheless, they had effect in the
building up of the legislative law-making
power of the Supreme Court of the United
States. I think it would be regrettable if dissenting opinions were not part of the record. It
is desirable that advocates and judges should
be able to peruse them in respect of subsequent cases. I think it was Mr. Justice Cardozo who said that some of the dissenting
opinions of Mr. Justice Brandeis had more to
do with the development of the civil liberties
structure in the United States than some of
the actual judgments in preceding cases.
While I understand what Senator Lang had

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, I
have miscalculated the length of our sitting
this afternoon. Since I had made certain
arrangements with other honourable senators
regarding the work of the house this evening.
I move that we now adjourn during pleasure.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
At 8 p.m. the sitting was resumed.
CENSUS AND STATISTICS
REFERENCE TO COMMITTEE

The Senate resumed from Wednesday,
October 2, the adjourned debate on the
motion of the honourable Senator Carter that
a committee of the Senate inquire into and
report upon existing legislation regarding the
census and statistics and upon the admin.stration of such legislation and recommend any
changes in such legislation and administration
required to establish and develop the census
and statistics service as a vital and efficient
aid to the good government of Canada and
the advancement of private business in the
public interest.
Hon. Douglas D. Everett: Honourable senators, in rising to speak to Senator Carter's
motion for a special committee of the Senate
to inquire into the collection and analysis of
statistical data in Canada I would like first to
congratulate Senator Carter on the lucid presentation of his case. I listened to him with
great interest and was impressed; and I have
become even more impressed on reading his
remarks in Hansard. Happily, his presentation enables me to be extremely brief.
Honourable senators, Senator Carter's case
appears to me to be this. If you accept the
fact that it is likely the best decisions are
those that are made and based on the best
information, then you will be inclined to
make sure that the information you have is
up-to-date, as complete as possible and
extremely germane to the subject at hand.
And if you accept the fact that Canada, while
a small nation, is also a nation that is striving

for excellence, then I think you are bound to
accept the fact that our decisions must be
better than those of any other nation in the
world, and that it is axiomatic, therefore,
that the information we receive and upon
which we base our decisions must be better
than that of any other nation in the world.
At the present time it is interesting to note
that the Government of the United States is
agonizing over its statistical information services, and yet it is my understanding that
they are the most complete in the world, the
most pervasive and the most up-to-date. Yet
we are saying that if we have to make the
decisions upon which Canada can survive and
improve itself, those decisions must be better
than, and therefore our information services
must be better than, those of the United
States.
What is the situation? The Dominion
Bureau of Statistics operates under the Statistics Act of 1952-1953. While there have been
amendments, there has not been a general
revision of that act since the date I have
given, but, as Senator Carter pointed out, we
should look at the changes that have taken
place in that period of 15 or 16 years.
Senator Carter has given evidence, if it
were needed, of the tremendous growth in
the Canadian economy. We are all unhappily
aware of the tremendous growth of government in Canada. What is more important than
the growth of government itself is the growth
of the areas of concern of that government.
Government today is involved in aspects
of social policy that it did not begin to think
of at the time the Statistics Act was passed in
1953. But we do not even need to look at that
fact, for there is another that is even more
important, and that is the change in the
method of compiling and analyzing statistics.
The change in analytical and gathering methods between 1952 and 1968 is nothing short of
revolutionary. On account of that Senator
Carter suggests, and I think quite rightly,
that the time has come to look at our statistical information gathering services.
Senator Carter says we want to know
whether the information we are getting on
the particular subjects in respect of which
D.B.S. is reporting is complete. We want to
know how great the time lag is, for it does
little good to have information if that information is six months or, as in one case Senator Carter referred to, three years old. We
want to know whether in certain sensitive
aspects of our economy we lack statistical
information.

SENATE DEBATES
What Senator Carter is saying is: Let us
bring together all of those people who have
knowledge of the particular subject of statistical information gathering, and let us hear
their views. Here he is referring to scientists,
educators, businessmen, and those people in
government who know about this subject.
What he is saying is that there is no better
place for them to appear, no better forum,
than an inquiry committee of the Senate.
It is my belief-and I have stated it in this
house in the past-that the Senate should
make the widest possible use of its power of
inquiry. I do not underestimate the value of
the legislative function of the Senate. It is
indeed an important one. The Government
Leader perhaps opened up a whole new area
of work when he talked about the Senate
being a debating forum, and that is a most
interesting aspect. But I suggest that the best
work of the Senate in the past has been done
in the area of inquiry, and that is where its
best work will be done in the future.
I endorse Senator Carter's motion because
it is so well based. I believe there should be
an inquiry by a Senate committee. However,
I make one qualification. A committee of
inquiry must have every opportunity to succeed in its work. Accordingly, before proceeding with the setting up of such a committee I would like to know the views of the
Dominion Bureau of Statistics on this whole
subject of the inquiry. If we are able to
sit down and talk to them we would quickly
find out the parameters of the inquiry
which we propose to undertake. I hope that
Senator Carter will see fit, before a special
committee is set up, to refer this matter to
one of the standing committees of the Senate
so that it may hear evidence from the Dominion Bureau of Statistics. Then, having heard
that evidence, and having determined where,
in the Bureau's view, the problem lies, the
Senate will be far more capable of determining precisely what sort of an inquiry it should
undertake.

October 8. 1968

Senator Carter referred. The statistical system provides the basis on which to an
increasing extent our political, social and economic institutions depend for the information
they require in making important decisions
and in managing their affairs, as we were
reminded a few moments ago by Senator
Everett.
This point was emphasized early this year
by the chairman of the Economic Council of
Canada, to whom Senator Croll made reference in another context this afternon. The
chairman of the council said in part:
To a growing extent, the modern
economy is coming to run on knowledge
and information which needs to be taken
into account in economic decision-making
at all levels, whether by consumers, by
private producers and distributors, or by
governments. Moreover, to use this
resource most effectively in our modern
society the information inputs cannot in
most cases be raw or casual information.
To be really useful information needs to
be an organized, a processed, a workedover product; It must be in readily applicable form. It needs to be accurate. It
needs to be available in a timely way.
And it needs to be relevant to decisions.
He concludes:
In short, good information is indispensable to good decision-making and to the
efficient performance of modern economy.

Honourable senators, this year the Dominion Bureau of Statistics celebrates is fiftieth
anniversary. It has been characterized, I
believe, by both growth and modification as
new and different needs have developed. This
has been particularly evident during the last
six years as operations of government and
industry have become more complex. Both
the D.B.S. structure and its legislative basis
have constituted the pattern for other statistical organizations within Canada and abroad.
The Statistics Act, which was passed in

October 8, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Some people and organizations have encountered difficulties arising from the existing
legislation, as we were reminded by Senator
Carter, arising mainly from the protection
afforded respondents, but the legislation has
been regarded by other observers as a useful
safeguard to the Dominion Bureau of Statistics and to those who provide it with confidential information. I am sure we all remember
the initial efforts of Dr. Coats, the Dominion
Statistician, whose name will ever be
associated with the work of an instrument
that has been regarded by the world as an
exemplar in this field.
Some years ago the Royal Commission on
Government Organization, known as the
Glassco Commission, made a thorough review
of federal statistical services, found the system generally good and made a number of
recommendations, most of which the governments of Canada have implemented. It is my
impression that there were no substantial
recommendations regarding legislation at that
time. However, for some years the bureau
itself had felt that certain changes in the act
would facilitate some of its operations and
would enable it to meet more fully the needs
of users who seek additional services. In May
1967, at the sixth federal-provincial meeting
on statistics, officials of the bureau and of
provincial governments discussed legislation
fully and reached the conclusion that there
was room for useful changes.
Since then, officers of the Dominion Bureau
have undertaken an exhaustive review of the
present act and, with provincial officials, have
studied its relationship to similar provincial
legislation. The process of consultation with
interested groups is expected to continue and
to result in a proposal to the Minister of
Trade and Commerce for changes, which the
minister is likely to present to the cabinet
about the middle of next year. Such suggestions for legislative changes as are acceptable
to the Government will then be submitted to
the Senate and to the other house. This will
give the Senate an opportunity for a general
discussion of the statistical system and will
permit it to make such recommendations for
changes as are indicated by the needs of the
community.
I may say that the range of D.B.S. activities
is such that a broad review could be very
lengthy, if the Senate wished to delve into
the numerous subject matters covered. In
addition to the well-known work on economic
statistics, comprising trade, manufacturing,
prices, transportation, agriculture and the
29234-15

census, the bureau covers education, health
statistics, judicial and vital statistics, as well
as a growing volume of financial statistics.
Then there are the broad aggregates of the
national accounts and the balance of international payments. These are all very important
in assessing the state of the economy and in
planning for the future.
Honourable senators, the Senate Committee
on Science Policy, under the chairmanship of
our colleague Senator Lamontagne, has
indicated that it proposes to look into the
social sciences as well as the natural and life
sciences. The work of our Bureau of Statistics
is largely directed at providing data for the
social sciences, broadly interpreted; and the
committee may well wish to make some
observations on the bureau's program, in its
report on science policy, towards the end of
the present session.
I would expect that honourable senators
would wish to have these comments, when it
comes to making an appraisal, if it does, of
the desired statistical legislation and the
administration and the need for changes.
The resolution before us calls for a committee of the Senate to inquire into and report
upon existing legislation regarding the census
and statistics and upon the administration of
such legislation, and to recommend any
changes in such legislation and administration
required to establish and develop the census
and statistics service as a vital and efficient
aid to the Government of Canada and the
advancement of private business in the public
interest.
In view of the fact that there will be legislation next year, and bearing in mind that we
might not wish to overlap, I am wondering if
the suggestion by Senator Everett is not a
wise one, in the circumstances. It does not
preclude an acceptance of the proposal itself:
it merely suggests that the subject matter of
the legislation, or the resolution itself, if that
is within our authority, be sent to a standing
committee for the purpose of hearing the
Director of the Bureau of Statistics, or his
representative, explain the program that they
have in mind with regard to the proposed
legislation.
It seems to me that this might be a wise
first step, one that does not bar acceptance of
Senator Carter's idea but does give us an
additional opportunity of appraising at what
period we should begin this work, if indeed
the proposal is accepted by the Senate.
If that is agreeable to Senator Carter, I
would point out to him that under the rules
we would require a further motion, notice of

SENATE DEBATES
which could be given tomorrow, naming a
specific standing committee or appointing a
special committee.
My own view is that in the circumstances it
would be wise to refer the matter to a standing committee for the purpose that Senator
Everett mentioned. In this way we would be
reinforced with the information that we
would want to have before us to determine
when the study should begin.
Hon. Salter A. Hayden: Honourable senators,
I am a little puzzled by the point of view
expressed by Senator Everett and also by the
Government Leader on the matter of a delay
in our consideration of this motion. To me
there is nothing unusual in the motion.
Many times in the Senate during the period
that I have been here we have had motions of
this character, motions that have been put
forward to inquire into and study certain
existing legislation in order to determine
whether that legislation at the time in question was functioning to the fullest advantage
of the public interest. This is all that this
motion does. The fact that there may be some
purpose to be served by such an inquiry is
evident from the statement the Government
Leader made that this subject is within the
contemplation and even now under active
consideration by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics and elsewhere, which may lead to some
proposals by way of legislation next year.
Over the period that I have been in the
Senate, many times I have heard the view
expressed in committee as to a reason why
we should not do something. On some of
those occasions I have accepted that view,
but I have waited two, three, four and five
years for the next step to occur. There are
some cases I could enumerate in which those
steps have not as yet been taken.
I see nothing wrong with this motion. It is
no reflection on the administration of the
Dominion Bureau of Statistics. Times have
moved along, and if there is a greater need to
perfect our statistical system, and this would
appear to be within the viewpoint even of
those who are performing these functions,
then there is no reason why we should not
study it. Perhaps in the circumstances, a
Senate committee inquiry could give some
good leadership in this line which would be
of assistance and might produce even better
legislation next year, if it comes before us
next year.
As to the proposal of referring the substance of this motion to a committee to deter-

October 8, 1968

mine whether or not there is some merit in it
so that it might be worth-while to have a full
fledged inquiry, I have several answers. One
is that I know of no procedure in the Senate
without 100 per cent consent of the senators
by which the substance of a bill can be
referred to a committee. I mean the substance, rather than the bill or the motion
itself. On many occasions in the period that I
have been here the Senate has referred the
substance so that senators might acquire some
knowledge, and, therefore, could consider
better, on a continuance of second reading,
what their attitudes and viewpoints should be
before giving the bill in question second reading. But in every case unanimous consent was
obtained. Certainly if it is sought to refer the
substance of this motion rather than let the
motion take its course in the Senate, and if
consent is asked, whatever the next step is, I
am opposed to that way of dealing with it
and I would certainly withhold my consent.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable Senators, I do not propose to hold the house for
more than a few minutes. It seems to me that
probably we can have the best of all worlds,
namely, the proposal of Senator Carter and
the suggestion of the leader, and also the
suggestion of the Chairman of the Banking
and Commerce Committee, Senator Hayden.
I am very pleased, as I am sure all of us
are, to hear the leader participate in this
discussion and to talk about the function and
role of the Dominion Bureau of Statistics.
I am personally pleased that he should mention the founder of the Dominion Bureau of
Statistics, Dr. Robert Coats, who perhaps was
one of the world leaders in the field of
statistics. He was consulted by governments
of many countries when they established
similar bureaus. I am sure that Mr. Duffett,
the present director, is doing an outstanding
job.
I recall that about a year or more ago there
was a Commonwealth or world meeting of
chief statisticians from various countries held
in Ottawa. It was highly appropriate that
they should meet here, because of the work
that has been done by our bureau. We are
most indebted to the leader for taking the
trouble to delve into the functions of the
bureau as he has done and to present his
findings to us. I am very interested and I am
sure we are all pleased to hear him say that
the Government has a plan to look into the
revision of this piece of legislation under
which the bureau now operates. The question
of data collection today is becoming more
important as time goes on.

SENATE DEBATES

Honourable senators will perhaps remember that last spring I had the privilege of
reporting upon a meeting I attended in Paris
on behalf of the then Minister of Industry. It
was a meeting of the science ministers of the
twenty-two O.E.C.D. countries. I think of all
the extra-curricular activities of the Government in which I have participated, perhaps this
one was the most interesting and exciting. It
was exciting because of the kind of discussions which took place, and it has proved to
be even more exciting because a Canadian
initiative was taken at that time at the
instance
of people
from the Science
Secretariat, the National Research Council
and the Department of Industry. It has resulted in a very important step forward. That
meeting was primarily concerned with the
compilation and correlation of data both within and between O.E.C.D. countries in the field
of science alone, but science in its broadest
aspect. What Canada proposed, without making a resolution, was that if there was consent, there should be set up by O.E.C.D. a
small committee to examine this procedure of
collating and correlating data so that no matter in which of the countries it was developed
it would also be available to scientists in all
the others as well as in the home country.
Perhaps a simple example will illustrate
exactly what I mean. A man may be working
in the field of physical chemistry in Ottawa
or Toronto, in Queen's or McGill, and he may
come across an idea that bothers him. He may
wonder whether or not there has been any
research done on this idea. If he has the
facilities to feed into a computer the data that
he has and asks questions to which he needs
the answers in order to complete the work he
is engaged on, then, whether that work has
been done in Japanese, German, Finnish or
Italian, and no matter where in the world it
has been done, the proposal is that the answer
would come out in his own language.
The leader of the American delegation Dr.
Hornig from the President's office, who is a
physical chemist from Harvard, was delighted
with the Canadian proposal. He was afraid
that if he made it some of the other O.E.C.D.
countries might think that because it came
from the Americans it should be automatically turned down.
However, the proposal was made and it
was acted upon and Dr. Kristensen, the
Secretary General of O.E.C.D., this summer
appointed a committee of three people, one of
whom was a Canadian. These three will in
turn be in touch with industry, particularly
the computer industry such as I.B.M. and
29234-151

others, for the purpose of trying to correlate
or reconcile the systems within the different
countries in various fields, which I think will
be very much to the advantage of scientists.
In the profession of law, practised by so
many of us, most of us will remember the
long hours, especially in our earlier days,
which we spent digging into the books and
into the digests and wondering whether we
had all the cases on a particular point. It is
now possible to feed certain data into the
computer and get a line of cases, and one can
be pretty sure that one has practically everything that is available on the particular point.
Dr. Hornig spoke particularly about a test
which he had made; he had asked the American Medical Association and certain medical
schools in the United States, and the computer services, to set up a service designed to
serve the medical profession and to supply
certain data on a specific problem. He said he
got a wonderful response from the American
Medical Association and from the medical
services, but he got the most complete response on the data available from the computer. As a result of this special test, he said
that the method of doing it now so far surpasses the use of libraries and curtails the
time that the use of libraries entailed, or the
presentation of papers to learned societies,
that it is almost essential in the field of
science and will be increasingly so in other
fields.
I think all of this is germane to the problem raised by Senator Carter. We all want
to know whether Canada is in the van of
progress in the assembly of statistics, and
whether they are computerizing and whether
computerizing is going to help. The more
electronic devices we can bring to bear on
such problems, the more we are a part of the
western world.
It was interesting to observe at that meeting of ministers in the field of science that if
the Americans were at a certain high level,
and they are considered to be the leaders in
the field, it was admitted by the Europeans
that their level, relative to the Americans',
was very low, particularly in the field of
innovation and invention. I was particularly
interested to note that the Japanese and the
Canadians occupy a middle position, perhaps
closer to the American than the European.
The reason for this, according to Europeans,
is that their own university systems are much
too rigid.
I think all this has a bearing upon the
problem Senator Carter has raised in his

SENATE DEBATES
motion, and I think the subject is worthy of
study.
Hon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson: Honourable
senators, this has developed into an interesting discussion. I am sorry I was not present
to hear all Senator Everett's remarks, but I
believe I understand the gist of his proposal.
On its merits, Senator Carter's motion is
interesting. I also think we are now involved
in a matter of order and procedure in regard
to the work of the Senate.
When Senator Carter introduced his motion
we on this side did not know if this was
merely a thought of his own, which was supported by Senator Urquhart, his seconder, or
whether he had discussed it, as some of us
presumed he would have done, with the
Leader of the Government and others on the
Government side and, consequently, it was
the desire of the Government side to have
such an inquiry. However, I will not discuss
that further.
The point I want to make is that personally
I do not see how the Senate can deal with
this motion in any way other than that of
either accepting or rejecting it. Senator Hayden suggests that it could perhaps be referred
to one of our standing committees, with consent. I even doubt that.

October 8, 1968

Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I thank the honourable Leader for his observation. There is
much substance in it and, of course, I would
have expected that before this motion was
made in the Senate there would have been
some consultation with the Dominion Statistician or other officials of the department in
regard to itHon. Mr. Martin: There was.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: -just as I would
have expected there would have been discussions with the Leader of the Government in
this house. This is an important matter, as
has been indicated by so many senators.
I just want to say that it is our duty to deal
with this matter on its merits. If the motion is
passed, then we will proceed to the investigation. If it is not, then there will be no investigation. I make only this suggestion, that it is
possible to refer this matter to one of the
standing committees of this house rather than
to a special committee. At this moment I have
no suggestion as to what committee it should
be referred to, but I do think it would be
preferable to refer it to a standing committee,
because the investigation of the problem
there would be just as complete as that conducted by a special committee.

Hon. David A. Croll: Honourable senators,
the discussion here has taken an unusual
turn. I support Senator Hayden's view. I do
not think that the purpose of this bouse is to
become a debating society. The purpose of

or not.

October 8, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

A resolution has been placed before the
house, and it ought to be voted upon. I can
see no reason why it should not pass. We
can then have one of the standing committees
deal with this subject or have it dealt with by
a special committee, but that is another matter entirely.
I was somewhat surprised at what my
friend Senator Thorvaldson said, because he
always feels there should be very little politics in this house-and there is never any
more than there should be. If he thinks that I
or any other member of the house-and others
can speak for themselves-always run to the
leader in order to get something done, then
he has another thought coming. That is what
he said, and I cannot understand that sort of
thing. I am an independent member here. If
Senator Thorvaldson presents a resolution
and it is satisfactory, I shall be glad to vote
for it.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: This is the first time
I have ever heard the honourable senator
suggest he is an independent.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I have certainly never run
to the leader-this leader or any other
leaderHon. Mr. Thorvaldson:
you!

Nobody believes

Hon. Mr. Croll: -to ask permission to do
this or that. I present what I want to present
to the house.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: I rise on a point of
order. I did not say "permission". I was very
clear in my remark.
Hon. Mr. Croll: The honourable senator
used the word "clearance".
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: No, not even "clearance". The word I used was "discussion".
Hon. Mr. Croll: We get a lot of that in this
house. I do not know why anyone should run
to the leader privately for it. However, I shall
vote for this resolution. I think it should be
supported.
Two years ago the bureau promised they
would do the best they could, and yet, even
up to this time, nothing has been done. This
is not the fault of the people in the bureau.
They are excellent people, and have been
helpful on every occasion. But, honourable
senators, to get something done you must put
heat under the Government-make it really
hot, and then you will get results.

Hon. Douglas D. Everett: Honourable senators, I should like to refer to Rule 35, in order
to explain part of my speech, which I think
was misconceived.
Senator Hayden said it was my intention to
refer the substance of the motion to a standing committee. That was not my intention at
all. I think I endorsed Senator Carter's
motion. What I suggested was that it would
be worth while hearing from officials of the
Dominion Bureau of Statistics as to the
parameters of the inquiry which would take
place. I did not at any time intend that we
would refer the substance to a committee and
then bring it back to the house.
The Hon. the Speaker: Do I understand
that the honourable Senator Everett is rising
on a point of order to explain certain implications in the speech he made a few moments
ago?
Hon. Mr. Croll: It is the United Nations all
over again-seventeen explanations.
Hon. Mr. Everett: I will leave it at that,
Mr. Speaker.
Hon. Mr. Carter: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: I would remind
honourable senators that under the rules the
motion is a substantive motion and therefore
if the honourable Senator Carter speaks now
it will have the effect of closing the debate.
Hon. Chesley W. Carter: Honourable senators, as Senator Thorvaldson has said, this
has developed into an interesting debate, and
I wish to express my appreciation to everybody who has taken part in it. Senators Hayden, Croll and Thorvaldson have dealt with
the point of order involved in the suggestions
made by Senator Everett and by the Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Martin) and for
that reason I will not take up your time by
referring to those matters.
I am grateful to Senator Everett for his
kind remarks about my motion. There was
only one point at which he said there was
some disagreement or that he had one
qualification to make. If I understood him
correctly, he felt that this matter should be
referred to another committee; in other
words, that we should hold an inquiry to see
if another inquiry should be held. I agree
with Senator Thorvaldson that that is not the
way in which we should proceed with the
business of this chamber.
In his opening remarks, Senator Everett
twice referred to a special committee. It may

SENATE DEBATES
have been a slip of the tongue. He may have
mentioned it inadvertently, but since he
seemed to be thinking in terms of a special
committee I would point out that my motion
makes no mention at all of a special committee. It merely says that a committee should
look into this. I agree with Senator Thorvaldson that we should not proliferate our
committees when there already exist committees which are capable of doing this work. I
left the question open for the Senate to
decide, but in my own mind I was thinking of
the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce, which is an extremely able committee with a very able chairman. There is no
abler man in this or the other house than
Senator Hayden.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Carter: Honourable senators, I
have great admiration for him and for the
way he has conducted the meetings of the
committee, of which I have been a member
for only a short while. However, there seems
to be a difference of opinion in the mind of
Senator Everett and in that of the Leader of
the Government.
If I understood Senator Martin correctly,
when he arose to explain his position in reply
to the point that Senator Thorvaldson raised,
his idea was that we should have the D.B.S.
appear before a committee, not the committee
which is going to hold the inquiry but before
a standing committee, to determine when it
would be convenient or when we should
begin the inquiry.
I may have misunderstood him but that is
how I interpreted what he said. Whereas, as I
said pre'7iously, Senator Everett's idea seems
to be tnat we should hold a preliminary
inquiry to decide whether we wish to have an
inquiry on a larger scale later on.
Honourable senators, I would be less than
honest if I did not say I am not happy about
Senator Everett's suggestion.
I am unhappy on two counts. First, I do not
think it is the way in which this chamber
should proceed. I think it is contrary to our
procedure and I doubt if any precedents can
be found in the past to uphold such a procedure. And I am unhappy because it implies
two things. It does not come out and say it,
but it implies that somehow my motion is
directed against D.B.S. I thought I took extra
pains in my presentation to point out that this
is not the case. I do not see what a preliminary inquiry could do that could not be done
if we followed the ordinary procedure and
referred this to a committee.

October 8, 1968

I said earlier that what I had in mind was
that this inquiry be conducted by the Senate
Committee on Banking and Commerce. If the
chairman has no objection and if the Senate
accepts this motion, I would be quite willing
to move that the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce be designated as the
Senate committee to conduct this inquiry; or,
if it would be in better order, I would give
notice that I will make this motion at a later
date. I am in the hands of the Senate on that
point.
Honourable senators, there is an implication that somehow or other this proposal is
aimed at D.B.S. and that therefore D.B.S.
should come before the Senate committee and
we should find out from them how much further we should go. If this committee were set
up, the ordinary procedure would be that a
steering committee would be appointed. The
steering committee would decide how the
committee would proceed and what areas
would be investigated, and it would act
accordingly.
I think it is logical to assume that D.B.S.
would be the first people to be called, particularly in view of the fact that, as our leader bas told us, a review of this legislation is
being contemplated. Surely, if this legislation
is to be reviewed, we would wish not only to
review D.B.S legislation, and the Statistics
Act, but also review the related legislation,
which would include several other acts.
Furthermore, D.B.S. is but one Government
agency. What I would like to do, and what I
had in mind when I proposed this committee,
is that we would look at the whole statistical
operation. Practically every department of the
federal Government has its data-gathering
division; provincial governments have such
data gathering divisions; universities and
industry have similar agencies.
It is quite possible that D.B.S. today is collecting material which is no longer very useful. On the other hand, it is quite possible
that they are not collecting information which
is absolutely vital. What I have in mind is
information on regional disparities. We have
already gone ahead. We have spent millions
on ARDA, on FRED, on ADA and on A.D.B.,
without having the necessary statistical foundation on which sound plans could be drawn
up. Neither do we have or have we been able
to get sound statistical yardsticks with which
to measure the effectiveness of these programs as they are being implemented.
If the Senate adopts this motion and agrees
to send it to the Standing Committee on

October 8, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Banking and Commerce to conduct the inquiry, certainly the D.B.S. officials can appear
before it and we can hear their story. Any
special problems they have can then be taken
into consideration and we can probably bring
in an early report to assist them in drafting
new legislation. But I hope we can do much
more than that. I hope we can "pick the
brains" of everybody who uses this information, everybody who is involved in gathering
and analysing statistical data, so that we can
have the most up to date and best legislation
that can be devised. I point out to honourable
senators that when this revision takes place
in a year's time or more it will then set the
framework in which D.B.S. will operate for
another period, probably of 10 years, certainly of five years.
We want the very best we can get. I do not
think we should be dependent solely on ideas
and information obtainable from D.B.S. officials, important as these are. We want to get
ideas from outside D.B.S. so that we can
weigh one against another.
Senator Martin referred to the Glassco
Commission. Well, the Glassco Commission
was set up by the Government to inquire into
the administration of government departments and it was within that framework that
they investigated D.B.S. and made their
recommendations. But this motion as I
envisaged it would provide a larger framework than that.
Senator Connolly (Ottawa West) referred to
computers. I, for one, certainly want the
ideas of more people than simply the D.B.S.
officials on what we should be doing concerning computer policy. Computers have come to
the point now where they practically make
decisions. Not so long ago we saw on television the title fights between Dempsey and
other boxers being conducted by computers.
It is not inconceivable that the day will come
when government decisions also will be made
by computers. We do not know when that day
will come. It may be here even now. At any
rate, a computer, no matter how wonderful it
is, is only as good as the information fed into
it.

inquiry should be held. I cannot see that it
can serve any useful purpose. Surely we can
trust our own committees to proceed in a
logical manner. If they see that the time has
come to cut it off, they know when to stop. If
they feel that certain areas need further
investigation they can see to that.
I do hope, therefore, that the Senate will
adopt this motion and will proceed with it in
the regular manner.
Hon. Mr. Choquetie: I am quite aware that
Your Honour warned honourable senators
that if Senator Carter were to speak again it
would have the effect of closing the debate. I
wish, therefore, to ask a question of the honourable Senator before he refers it to a committee. I wish to ask if he is aware of a certain
committee to which I think the question
should be referred. That is the purpose of my
rising now.
Senafor Croll: Ask the question.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable senators, that the question may be asked
of the sponsor?
Some hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: I ask this question of
Senator Carter. We have a committee called
the Public Service Administration, comprised
of the honourable Senators Belisle, Blois,
Bourque, Cameron, Choquette, Dessureault,
Fergusson, Flynn, Gouin, Grosart, Inrnan,
Irvine, Kinley, Martin, O'Leary (AntigonishGuysborough), O'Leary (Carleton), Quart,
Roebuck and White. I ask the honourable
Senator who has proposed this motion, is he
aware of such a committee of Public Service
Administration, the members of which committee I have just enumerated, and does he
not think that this would be the appropriate
committee to which to refer this matter?

Hon. Mr. Carter: Honourable senators,
personally I have no preference as to which
committee would do this. To answer Senator
Choquette's question, I say, yes, I am aware
there is a Committee on Public Administration but, as I understand it, the duty of that
committee is to do what I am trying to avoid,

PRIVATE BILLS
CANADA TRUST COMPANY-SECOND

READING

Hon. J. Campbell Haig moved the second
reading of Bill S-6, respecting Canada Trust
Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
rather simple bill. It contains one clause, to
increase the capital stock of the corporation
from $5 million to $20 million.
This company was formed 74 years ago,
and it is now wholly-owned except for directors and qualifying shares by the Huron and
Erie Mortgage Corporation. By reason of the
growth of trust company business in the past
few years, this company needs further capital
for expansion.
One of the major functions of the company
is the acceptance of money in trust through
guaranteed trust certificates or guaranteed
deposit certificates for investment. At present
the Trust Companies Act limits the amount
that may be borrowed by any trust company,
together with moneys entrusted to it for
investment, the repayment of which is guaranteed by that trust company to a maximum

THE HURON AND ERIE MORTGAGE CORPORATION-SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. Haig moved the second reading of
Bill S-7, respecting The Huron and Erie
Mortgage Corporation.
He said: Honourable senators, The Huron
and Erie Mortgage Corporation, like the
company covered in the previous bill, bas
its head offices in London, Ontario. It was
incorporated in 1864, and by reason of subsequent changes in its act it continued up until
1899, when additional borrowing and investment powers were granted to it.
In 1913 the Parliament of Canada by statute further extended the amount of the company's permissible liabilities to the public,
and in 1915 the name of the company was
changed to The Huron and Erie Mortgage
Corporation.
Further acquisitions were made in 1923,
and in 1955 the capital of the company was
fixed at $10 million, divided into 500,000
shares with a par value of $20 each.

October 8, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

In 1961 there was a further subdivision of
shares, and in 1965 yet another subdivision of
shares into five million shares of the par
value of $2 each.
During 1964, the centennial year of the corporation, the total assets under administration
by the corporation and its subsidiary, the
Canada Trust Company, passed the $1 billion
mark. This year, less than five years later,
total assets under administration will pass the
$2 billion mark.
The corporation's main business constitutes
the lending of money on building mortgages
across Canada. By reason of the expected
growth of this corporation an increase in
capital is needed.
I submit to honourable senators that the
principal role of this corporation is in the
housing area of mortgage lending where at
present some 85 per cent of its mortgage
moneys are invested.

29234-16

For the foregoing reasons the corporation
is requesting legislation to increase its authorized capital to $20 million.

SENATE DEBATES
Moreover, the court being removed from the
localities in which the cause arises, it has a
more detached view, and certainly a somewhat different view from that taken in the
provinces or municipalities where the trial
takes place.
This is a trend that has been going on for
some time, and is being continued by this bill
and in several ways. To begin with, it
increases limitation on the jurisdiction of the
court in that particular division from $2,000 to
$10,000, and in that way it accentuates the
idea of the Supreme Court of Canada being a
rich man's court. I mentioned its not being a
poor man's court, but I wish I had not used
those words. It takes the court out of the
range of possibility of service to the ordinary
man, and leaves it only to the rich man and
the big corporations. That, to my mind, is
quite out of keeping with the democratic fundamentals of our Constitution. I would like to
see this court widened rather than restricted
in its jurisdiction and service to the people of
Canada.
The only argument against that is the convenience of the court itself, and that, honourable senators, is not a good argument. If we
have a service to give, then it should be given
to the rich and to the ordinary people alike.
If the number of appeals are more than the
court as now constituted can handle, then
constitute it differently.
In so far as a division is concerned between
rich and poor, it has always been our concept
that justice is blind, and that every man had
an equal right to a decision from our courts.
If we have not enough judges, let us appoint
more, but, above all, let justice be done
though the heavens fall.
I do not like the trend that has been going
on for some time, and which seems to be continued by this bill.
Let me point out another aspect of what is
happening. In the past when an application
was made for leave to appeal it could be
made to the Superior Court of Appeal in a
province, and that court could give consent to
an appeal involving, in former days, at least
$2,000, and now $10,000. The provincial court
could give consent to an appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada. That is being
changed by this bill which has been approved
by our committee, I am sorry to say. This
means that a litigant must apply for consent to
appeal to the court here in Ottawa. It means
an application in the capital of the country,
and another trip to Ottawa by the solicitors,
and all the costs that go with it.

October 9, 1988

For goodness sake, honourable senators, is
not the cost high enough now? This courtand it is the only one in Canada which does
so-requires that counsel's factum, the appeal
book and, worst of all, the entire evidence, be
printed. Imagine the cost of printing lengthy
evidence given in a trial that lasted many
days. The expense is so great that the factum
alone will cost $100 or more, and not infrequently, honourable senators, the printing of
the evidence runs to $1,000 or more.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Those costs have nothing
to do with this bill.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It is the trend I am
talking about.
The Hon. the Speaker: Order, please. May I
interrupt at this point to remind honourable
senators that there is a motion before the

Hon. Mr. Flynn: Should we always bow to
practice like that, especially when we are
considering an examination of our rules?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I think,
honourable senators, it is desirable that this
course should be followed and that the committee on the rules will consider this point.
The history of the Finance Committee is a
peculiar one, but of late years we have used
it with the consent of the house generally as a
place where appropriation bills, estimates and
related matters were studied rather than by
other committees. Since it has had this peculiar role to play in the development of the
work of the Senate, a role which I think most
of us approve, we should try to keep it in
that perspective.
So far as bills of this kind are concerned, a
customs bill is normally considered a money
bill; it comes out of the budget. Apparently

this is not a money bill. Bills concerning
income tax, excise tax and imports generally,
go to the Standing Committee on Banking
and Commerce. I think it is a desirable
precedent for us to follow.

with the proposition that whoever speaks to

mentary action, I can see the reason for it
and I recommend it to the house.
The Precious Metals Marking Act sets out
the rules for marking articles when claims
are made as to the precious metal content of
the article. Four metals are defined in the act,
calling them precious metals. They are gold,
silver, platinum and palladium.
Since the early years of this century the
precious metal products of the jewellery
industry, whether Canadian-made or imported, have been subject to a federal statute.
The legislation was designed to prevent misrepresentation to purchasers and to ensure
orderly marking by the establishment of
quality standards and marking controls. In
the intervening years the industry has grown
from the collection of small individuallyowned firms to an industry which, I forecast,
will in this year probably have a sales value
to the extent of about $300 million. It should
be borne in mind that, while this figure
includes the value of the various classes of
items handled by jewellery stores, the value
of articles which are subject to this bill would
represent a substantial portion of the total.
Through the Canadian Jewellers Association, the industry is, I understand, a strong
supporter of this legislation, which it recognizes as a vital element in maintaining public
confidence in the quality of its products.
The operations of all segments of the trade
are affected by, and benefit from, the provisions
of
this bill-the manufacturers,
wholesalers and importers, through to the
local retailers across the country. In addition,
the protection touches practically every person in the country at some time, through the
purchase of a watch, engagement and wedding rings, fiatware, silver tea services, and
all such items of quality where marking will
be some guarantee to the purchaser.
The intent of the bill is to update the Precious Metals Marking Act, chapter 215 of the
Revised Statutes of Canada, 1952 and to provide the mechanics for more easily meeting
technological change. It is to that extent that
I confess that certain things which were subject to statute might be passed on to regulatory authority through the administration of the
department or the cabinet. Originally enacted
in 1908 as the Gold and Silver Marking Act,
numerous subsequent amendments necessitated a general revision in 1946, which resulted
in the present Precious Metals Marking Act.
This has been amended on two occasions, the
second of which was in 1955. Several desirable amendments have been held in abeyance

October 9, 1968

since 1959, due to priorities on our part in the
increasingly heavy legislative programs since
that time.
The present act governs the markings, descriptions and advertising of articles composed
of gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
While marking is not mandatory and it has
not been made mandatory in this bill, any
quality marking or description is confined to
the form and manner provided in the act.
Responsibility for the quality of the article is
established by the general provision that a
quality marked article must also bear a trade
mark which is registered or applied for under
the Trade Marks Act. By this means an
offending article can be traced back to the
person or firm responsible for the quality
marking.
National marks can be used under licence
for precious metal articles of gold and silver
which are manufactured in Canada. It is desirable that such marks should be available for
platinum and palladium articles; and, to obviate proliferation of marks, a single one is
proposed in this bill. The single mark
proposed is a maple leaf with a circle around
it.
In addition to providing general basic
provisions, the bill embraces numerous operative sections of a technical nature in which
the provisions define the material content
specifications for various classes of articles.
With advancements in new processes, production methods and quality control, the existing
provisions have or might become obsolete,
and if simpler mechanics for change are not
provided, there would be unnecessary delay
in recognition of such improved techniques.
Technical change is the basis for the amendments to the act. Since almost all required
amendments to this statute are related to
manufacturing techniques, it is considered
advisable that the act be reconstructed to
retain the present basic provisions and place
the operative technical sections in regulations
made under the authority of the act.
Such basic provisions to be retained in the
act relate to general requirements respecting
correct quality marking and identifying trade
marks; offences, penalties and disposition of
articles upon conviction; powers of inspection, seizure and assay evidence; and authority for the Governor in Council to make certain regulations. The authority being sought is
to transfer to regulations all technical provisions that are in the existing statute. These
cover definitions of material content and
assay tolerances for the various classes of

POVERTY IN CANADA
MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL
COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of the honourable Senator Croll that a special committee
of the Senate be appointed to investigate and
report upon all aspects of poverty in Canada.
Hon. Edgar Fournier: Honourable senators,
coming from the so-called poor people class,
it is a pleasure and a privilege for me to
make my humble contribution to this debate,
especially on the birthday of His Honour the
Speaker.
Yesterday we heard my honourable friend
Senator Croll speak on this subject for more
than an hour. He covered a lot of ground, and
repeated with extreme caution, that nobody
has an answer to this problem of poverty. We
all know that last week the honourable senator spent the better part of his time in pray-

October 9, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

ers and devotion, and I congratulate him for
that. However, I would have thought that
after a week of meditation the honourable
senator would have been hesitant in presenting his motion for a special committee to
study such a confusing and widespread problem for which, as he readily admitted, no one
has a solution. Personally, I do not see this
motion as one resulting from a whole week of
prayers, or from inspiration from the Holy
Ghost, but rather inspiration from a Liberal
ghost.
The war on poverty means quite different
things to a number of people. Overnight, it
seems, there are no more poor people. Every
one is rich. Nobody works. There are no more
responsibilities, and the rich support the
nation. This, on the surface sounds very good,
but in application it does not work so well.
Let us not forget the words of our Lord when
he said that the poor will always be with us.
However, if this committee is set up under
the able chairmanship of Senator Croll then
we can expect it to be a very active and busy
committee, and I might even give it my
support.
On the motion itself, may I say first that
before we apply too much ointment, let us
find out where the wounds are. At the
moment, no one seems to know. Perhaps the
first question we should ask ourselves is:
What is a poor person, and who are the poor?
Where is the line to be drawn between the
two groups? Why are there some poor persons? If I understand the motion correctly,
the purpose of this committee is to answer
questions such as these. If that is so, the committee will have my entire support.
My lifelong friend Senator Hedard Robichaud and I come from adjoining ridings that
are labelled across Canada as the poorest
areas in the country. I repeat, they are
labelled as the poorest areas of Canadaknown as areas of desolation, misery and
suffering. This is the result of some miserable
and tasteless articles that have been published by some newspapers and backed up by
the C.B.C. representation.
At this time I should like to refer to an
article written by Miss Sylvia Fraser a Star
Weekly staff writer, which appeared in the
edition of December 24, 1966. This lady surely
reported upon what she saw and found, but
why exploit the poor people right across
Canada? Believe me, honourable senators,
that was not a very nice Christmas gift for
the people of New Brunswick.

Alongside this disreputable report-and I
cannot find a more appropriate description
for it-there could have been printed a report
about the most modern schools and hospitals
worth millions of dollars, booming mining
industries, modern bridges and highways,
flourishing lumber and sawmills, well-established pulp and paper mills, fishing fleets,
fish processing plants, modern homes, churches and convents, which exist in this area-a
report that would be quite a contrast to what
was published. This would have given the
Canadian people a fair and just picture while,
at the same time, exposing poverty.
I am sure, honourable senators, that I could
go to Montreal, Toronto, Ottawa, Winnipeg,
and Vancouver, and visit the slums in those
cities, and produce the same type of report. It
seems that we shall always have slums. I
could visit them, and talk to the people and
take pictures, but such a report would not
give the Canadian public a fair picture. Those
are things that fair and just-minded people
do not do.
Referring again to this particular issue of
the Star Weekly, I should like to read one or
two short extracts for the record. This tells us
what Father Lamontagne had to say when he
was interviewed by this writer:
Father Lamontagne, a genial, whitehaired priest who spent three years in
the Brantville area, told me, "Food
doesn't always depend on the money we
have in our pockets. Brantville children
are like children anywhere-they spend
too much money on potato chips. The
people have sufficient heat, food and
clothing, and they certainly came to me
with their problems. The business about
this area being distressed-that's mostly
propaganda."
Another priest told me jovially, "Most
of the people in this area have good cars.
On Sunday, you should see the acres of
them at every church-oh, big ones, they
are cars. And, of course, they all have
their television sets!"
Then, an old man 75 years of age, whose
name is not given, was interviewed. He had
this to say:
A bunch of fools from Ottawa were
here all summer, taking pictures and
making damn fools of themselves.
Honourable
son, who are
they poor? Is
on account of

senators, what is a poor perthe poor people, and why are
it on account of sickness? Is it
large families which generally

SENATE DEBATES

the French-speaking people have? Is it on
account of poor education? Is it because they
do not earn large enough salaries? Is it
because of a lack of transportation to points
of employment? Is it because of poor
administration and poor family budgeting? Is
it because of over-spending? Are the taxes
too high? Is the cost of living too high? These
things are relevant and contribute to poverty.
Again, who is poor and who is not? Is a
man with only one car, or a man with a car
and only one television poor? Is a man who
cannot afford the luxuries of a few weeks in
the South Seas in the wintertime poor? Or is
a poor man one, who by his wisdom, by his
tricks and dishonesty, works just enough during the summer months to acquire a few
unemployment insurance stamps along with
some welfare assistance and other means and
who otherwise refuses to work and provide
his family with the necessities of life? Is he
poor? Honourable senators, it is in that category that we find too great a number.
On the other hand, honourable senators, we
can find good, honest citizens willing to work
anywhere at any time but who are held down
by large families, sickness, poor education,
facing the difficulties of life with ambition,
with proper family budgeting. These are the
people who need assistance, and usually assistance given to them is properly used. But that
does not happen too often. Furthermore, we
can find families living today on the minimum revenue that you and I could not
improve on even if we gave them a handout
of $100 a day. They are not prepared to
adjust themselves accordingly and can spend
any surplus faster than it can be provided.
One has only to examine some households to
see what they are buying out of their welfare.
Some husbands and wives are not prepared to
manage their own affairs as they should be
managed, which in turn results in extreme
poverty.
Over the years some of our people have
become spoiled by too many easy handouts.
This has grown out of the vicious circle in
our society today. Too many avenues have
been opened leading to abuses and have
become the tools of weak conscience, resulting in loss of responsibility, disregard for authority and an attitude of getting everything
possible, no matter how you get it, if it is
government property. And public funds are
government property. Of course any acquisition under false pretences can lead to serious
consequences.
I hope that no honourable senator will
think for a moment that I am saying that the

October 9, 1968

poor people are dishonest people-far from it.
I say that the poor people are the most honest
people in the world. That is the reason they
are poor, because they still believe in the
honest dollar. In many cases it is because of
their honesty that they seldom benefit from
the welfare system. They are too honest to
ask for it. They would rather suffer. They
would rather go without it and retain their
self-respect.
My remark concerning "weak consciences"
refers to many of the so-called "rich poor",
those who can afford to spend $25 or $30
every weekend for entertainment or amusement, those who can afford to attend every
social activity in the community, those who
can afford a new car every year or so, a
coloured television, a summer cottage, a
house trailer, and yet through unacceptable
reasons are able to find ways and means of
obtaining welfare assistance. Believe me, this
group today is much too large. And it is
indeed sad to see public funds intended to be
directed to the needy people too often falling
into the hands of those who really do not
need it, and the needy ones are by-passed.
Senator Croll made mention several times
of "too-low income." To me this is the most
controversial aspect of the whole situation. A
maximum income under our present system
is just impossible; our society is not geared
for it. The individual income of the employee
is regulated by the service rendered, and no
one can expect $5,000 or $6,000 remuneration
if one can produce only $2,000 or $3,000 worth
of services. The problem is getting more and
more difficult as this class of people, mostly
poor people, are facing mechanization, electronics, computers, I.B.M. and what have you.
All these things contribute to unemployment.
Honourable senators, how can we ever
expect to provide adequate employment and
adequate remuneration when our society is
running away from the possibility and potential of the labour force, which is the only
possible source of adequate remuneration for
thousands and thousands of people in Canada,
mostly poorer people? To me this is the main
problem that society is facing today.
I have read with great interest chapter 6,
pages 103 to 137, of the Report of the Economic Council of Canada on the subject of
poverty. The council has produced many facts
indeed, but to me it is mostly a compilation
of statistics without presenting any solution
to the problem. It is discouraging for any
government to tackle this problem when one
knows that in too many cases social welfare is
wasted through extravagance and ill manage-

October 9, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

ment. To me this phrase "social welfare" or
"social assistance" should be replaced by the
phrase "social work program." It should be
made a work program instead of a hand-out
program.
Let us not overlook the fact that we are not
going to build a strong nation by paying our
people to remain at home idle, drinking beer,
criticizing society because society does not
provide them with more.
Honourable senators, I belong to a group
which dislikes the word "poverty." I say this
first of all because it has had a bad influence
on our society and, secondly, because there is
no poverty in Canada. Canada is one of the
wealthiest countries in the world. In Canada
no one dies of hunger; in Canada there is
shelter for everyone; in Canada there is a bed
for every living soul; in Canada there is a
place for every individual; and in Canada we
have abundance. But somewhere along the
Une our system of distribution has gone out
of control. In my humble opinion we have
lost the humanitarian control of our wealth,
with the result that the poor are getting poorer while the rich are getting richer.
Our society today reminds me of a gravel
pit. If you stand on the edge of a gravel pit
you see that it has all the aggregate which
when properly used can build the strongest
foundation to support any structure that
science can provide. But a screening machine
has to be introduced into the pit to sort the
material. This machine stands high in the air,
and the material is carried over on a long
conveyer belt which separates it on the way
down. The first screen removes the large
stones; the second screen removes the not-solarge stones; the third screen separates the
coarse gravel from the finer gravel; the
fourth screen separates the fine gravel from
the sand; and the fifth or final screen separates the coarse sand from the fine sand. Each
element is directed to a separate pile. At this
moment our sandpile is much too large, and
much of it is useless. Here we have to keep in
mind that any single element of this aggregate is just about useless by itself. Usefulness
and strength are to be found only in a wellproportioned mixture.
Is that not what we have done in our society? Have we not placed too many screens in
our system? Is our sandpile not too large?
Think about it, honourable senators. Have we
walked away from the idea that the proper
mixture is needed? I ask you to think about it
and about what we should do to combat this
problem of poverty.

I would like to give you a little example
from an interesting situation which arose
some years ago. I come from the Parish of
Iroquois and St-Basile. Naturally I belong to
the Iroquois. This parish in which I was born
and raised is known or was known at that
time to be one of the poorest. We had no
industries, only small farms with poor
incomes; nothing in sight that would relieve
the situation, only casual labour and small
farmers. In 1944 we assessed our position,
and I believe it is very important that this
committee should try to tell people to assess
their position. When you do that you find out
where you are, where you stand and what
you can do about it; then you may change
your mind.
I believe that today there are thousands of
people who do not assess their position, find
out what they can do for themselves, and
where and how they can receive help. This is
what we did. In 1944 we assessed our problem. It was a question of do or die. We preferred to do and we did not die. We had to
improve our conditions. The only solution in
sight was to build up a caisse populaire, and
under the able leadership of Père Sandon
twenty of us, poor people, giving $5 apiece,
built up a $100 fund. Progress was very slow
in the beginning, until somebody was able to
benefit from this $100 which had been set
aside.
During the first years we often talked of
the possibilities of this caisse populaire and
what it could do for our area, and we hoped
we might live long enough to see $100,000 in
the fund to serve the area. That was a longterm dream. Last July we celebrated the 24th
anniversary of our operations. This year's
annual meeting was an unusual meeting
because we were celebrating our first million
dollars.
When you talk about $1 million in St-Basile
or Iroquois you do not talk about it in the
same voice that we do on Parliament Hill.
There it means something. We have $1 million available to this small community of 350
people. You have no idea what service this $1
million can render. This fund can serve for
many operations, almost anything we could
think of, such as building new homes, sending our boys to school, paying for colleges,
putting up new buildings, buying' farming
equipment, house restoration, even vacations.
It has completely changed the situation in the
area.
I may add that at the meeting to which I
just referred I was presented with a very
much appreciated gift for the work I had

SENATE DEBATES

done as a founder of the organization and for
the interest I had taken in it, and still do.
Needless to say, I was very honoured but I
was more pleased to think that people were
actually making use of this fund.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary (Antigonish-Guysborough): What is the number of members?
Hon. Mr. Fournier
gouche): Roughly 350.

(Madawaska-Resti-

[Translation]

Honourable senators, perhaps I will be
criticized for having made all my comments
in English. It will be nothing new if I am
criticized by certain newspapers; anyway, I do
not care.
It goes without saying that it would have
been much easier for me, and perhaps less
boring, if I had made my comments in my
native language. I would have made them
with greater ease and I would have felt much
better.
Nobody except me realizes the effort I am
making here. This effort is much greater than
you would think, for, not having yet succeeded in perfectly coordinating thought and
speech, I have to think in French and translate simultaneously-if I may use that termand, believe me, it is not an easy thing to do.
Hon. Mr. Martin: You are very fluent in
both languages.
Hon. Mr. Fournier: Thank you. As I have
set my heart on becoming perfectly bilingual
one day-if such a thing is possible-this
house gives me a good opportunity. I am asking you to forgive me my mistakes for I often
do not say what I would like to say, but
rather what I can say, and I am aware of
expressing myself rather badly.
I would like to tell my English-speaking
colleagues this: if you wish one day to
become bilingual, do your best, as I do; it is
sometimes humiliating-as I know from
experience-but
your
efforts
will
be
appreciated. We are always prepared to help
you. Do not wait until you know a language
perfectly, make the effort and, little by little,
you will realize one day that it is net impossible, after all.
[English]

In closing, may I say that a tremendous
challenge now faces the parliamentarians and
the Senate of Canada. It will not be easy, as
Senator Croll has said. No one has the
immediate answer. Let us first make an
assessment of our position, a true and realistic assessment. Let us not look at the problem

October 9, 1968

with an attitude of indifference, because our
freedom is at stake. Whether members of this
committee or net, let us look net at what we
get out of this but at what we can put into it.
Let us make this individual assessment of our
own situation, net by looking at what the
others have that you have net, but rather by
looking at what you have that the others have
not, and then you may find yourselves in a
much more comfortable position than you
ever realized.
Hon. Eric Cook: Honourable senators, I
wish to give this motion my warmest support.
It may be interesting to note that legislators have only been concerned with the welfare of the ordinary citizen in comparatively
recent times. In 1845 Benjamin Disraeli referred in his novel Sybil to the fact that there
were two nations, namely the rich and the
poor, and that these two nations were as
ignorant of each other's habits, thoughts and
feelings as if they were inhabitants of different
planets.
Around that time landowners were permitted to have steel man-traps and spring guns
on their property to prevent poachers from
taking the game. Around that period little
boys were used as sweeps, and there were
numerous cases of ill-treatment and abuse
ending in the death of many of these
unfortunates.
In the days before the enactment of the
Plimsoll line one seaman in every sixty met a
violent death. As late as 1910 it was not
uncommon for shop assistants to work as
many as 91 hours a week. Many more examples of the absence of any legal protection for
the poor can of course be given. However,
public opinion became more enlightened, and
the law gradually shifted from being concerned only with the protection of property,
and legislators became interested in the protection and wellbeing of the individual.
Already considerable progress has been
made in social welfare legislation but much
remains to be done. The field of social welfare is a very large one, and continuous study
must be given to the matter before extensions
are undertaken.
I agree with the Economic Council and
with the proposer of this motion that the
Senate might well undertake this task. The
first step when discussing any problem is to
get the facts, and all the facts, and to realize
that the facts are constantly changing. The
policies which were effective a few years ago
may no longer be effective.
It is often stated that some welfare programs are wasteful. It is also contended that

October 9, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

the economy cannot afford the programs
already in force. However, these are some of
the matters concerning which a Senate committee would hear evidence. We may be able
now to take further steps ahead, but on the
other hand, we may have to pause, in which
case it would be well to plan carefully now
for the time when we can once more move
ahead. Perhaps some items of welfare legislation should be discontinued, or some
merged or expanded. Indeed, the very statements made in the Report of the Economic
Council of Canada require further investigation, in order that their accuracy may be
tested and the whole problem of poverty
examined.
It is not too difficult for those who are
associations,
organized in manufacturers'
trade unions and other like bodies to produce
evidence for Government departments, in
order to have the laws amended to remedy
any inconvenience which they suffer; but it
is not always easy or possible for the young
or the old, the handicapped and the uneducated to do this.
We must, however, face up to the fact that
regard must be had to our ability to finance
further expansion of social welfare legislation.
If it should be that, upon investigation, it
becomes clear that we must pause and rest
upon the plateau we have now reached, there
is no need to lose heart or to throw in the
sponge. If, at all levels of Government, men
of good will are working and planning for the
well-being of their fellow human beings, it
will surely be but a short while before we
can once again start the upward climb.
A Senate Committee on Poverty might well
be the medium through which all those who
are interested in the plight of the less fortunate of our fellow citizens can make their
views known.
The members of the committee must, of
course, examine the problem objectively. It
would be highly dangerous to allow our
hearts to run away with our heads. The country cannot afford unwise and over-generous
schemes which place an undue burden on the
economy. Indeed, the ultimate outcome of
such legislation is but to hurt those whom
they seek to help. To overload the economy
will handicap the whole nation, and the last
state of those now suffering from the effects
of poverty will be worse than their first and
present state.
If the committee receives the support and
co-operation of the federal and provincial
welfare and other departments, and the help
and assistance of the churches and others con-

cerned with the problem of poverty, it will
perform a much needed and worthwhile service for Canada.
Indeed, such a committee might well rank
with some of the more outstanding committees of the Senate, which have already inspired reforms in the laws of the land.
On motion of Honourable Mr. Choquette,
on behalf of Honourable Mr. Belisle, debate
adjourned.
NORTH ATLANTIC ASSEMBLY
COMMITTEE MEETINGS AT BRUSSELSDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Tuesday, October 1, the adjourned debate on the inquiry of
the Honourable Senator Lang calling the
attention of the Senate to the Standing and
Preparatory Committee Meetings of the North
Atlantic Assembly, held at Brussels, Belgium,
20th May to 24th May, 1968, and in particular
to the discussions and proceedings of the
Meetings and the participation therein of the
delegation from Canada.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators,
Senator Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche>
has reminded me that it is about time for me
to practise my French. Therefore, I will continue in my mother tongue.
[Translation]
First of all, honourable senators, I would
like to congratulate Senator Lang for calling
the attention of the Senate to the standing
and preparatory committee meetings of the
North Atlantic Assembly held at Brussels,
Belgium, from May 20 to 24 last. I would like
to say also that the reports I received about
the work done by Senators Lang and Willis
indicate that they did a remarkable and very
efficient job and that they both made Canada
proud.
I said that I found Senator Lang's inquiry
very timely because 1969 will be a crucial
year for the North Atlantic Treaty. He mentioned that section 13 provides that in 1969,

twenty years after the signature of the treaty,
any party will be allowed to withdraw or to
terminate the treaty as far as it is concerned.
That possibility creates for NATO a most difficult and disturbing situation, since in 1966
France decided to withdraw from the integrated force and asked her NATO allies
to move their military bases and other installations out of France.
A second factor which must be kept in
mind and which makes the situation disturb-

SENATE DEBATES
ing, as far as the NATO members are concerned, are the remarks made by the Prime
Minister of Canada since last spring. If you
reread the various statements made by Mr.
Trudeau in April, May and August, you will
see that he does not discard the possibility of
Canada withdrawing from NATO. There is no
doubt, when you examine his remarks-I
could quote many of them but it would take
too long-that he gave clearly the impression
when he talked of reviewing, reassessing,
analysing the position of Canada in NATO
that the conclusion might be a simple withdrawal of the Canadian forces stationed in
Europe under the auspices of NATO.
Moreover, after considering the remarks of
the Prime Minister, and reading Senator
Lang's speech again, we see that they are
abysmally different, worlds apart in fact.
Senator Lang declared himself a strong supporter of NATO. For him, Canada's withdrawal from NATO is completely out of the
question. Indeed he did not object to a review
of the matter, a review of the part Canada is
playing, but the idea of a withdrawal is far
removed from his mind. So he is diametrically opposed to the Prime Minister on the matter. That is probably why the Leader of the
Government hastened to take the floor after
Senator Lang, to bridge the gap between the
opinion of the Prime Minister and that of
Senator Lang; with his usual skill, the Leader
of the Government told us repeatedly that it
is quite clear to him that a review does not
mean a withdrawal, even if he suggested that
he could not speak for the Government at
this time.
He also indicated that he remained a supporter of NATO. Nothing of what he said
shows that new factors should be considered
in the review of our role within NATO,
our participation in the joint defence provided by this treaty. We will eventually see
how it will be possible to reconcile Senator
Lang's opinion with that of the Prime Minister, and we will see whether we will be able
te follow the golden middle-course dear to
the Leader of the Government.
Another interesting aspect of Senator
Lang's speech was his pessimism with regard
to France. He seems to take for granted, and
perhaps rightly so, that France bas decided
to withdraw from NATO next year.
He ascribed to General de Gaulle rather
sinister purposes as regards Great Britain,
the United States and even Canada. There are
indeed certain things, certain positions, certain attitudes of General de Gaulle with
which I entirely disagree and I suppose that

October 9, 1968

in this regard I share the opinion of Senator
Lang; but between that and putting in the
same bag the problem raised by the refusal
on the part of France to admit Great Britain
in the Common Market, and the aspirations to
supremacy on the part of France, I believe
there is quite a difference. Be that as it may,
even in this respect, Senator Lang could not
find any support in the present Government,
since
Senator
Martin
intervened
and
expressed his optimism as regard the decision
France will have to make next year. As far as
I am concerned, as far as we are concerned
on this side of the Chamber, we wish to share
this optimism of the Government Leader, and
we hope France will not withdraw from
NATO.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Hear, hear.
Honourable Mr. Flynn: We believe with
senator Lang and with the leader of the government-and in this respect we do not
entirely agree with the Prime Minister, unless
he bas changed his mind lately as a result of
the situation in Czechoslovakia-that the conditions under which Canada became a member of NATO 20 years ago have not substantially changed. We believe that if we were
justified in signing the treaty and in becoming a party to this joint system of defence in
the North Atlantic area, there is no other new
fact today which suggests that we should not
remain in NATO and continue to play our part
while reappraising the situation. Let us have
a review of our role; but we also have responsibilities and, again, conditions have not
changed. In any event, they have not changed
to the extent where we should seek a new
principle of action other than the collective
defence initiated through the NATO treaty.
A while ago I mentioned the Russian inva.
sion of Czechoslovakia. I see in that action
not so much an aggressive move on the part
of Russia against western nations but rather
a defensive move. I feel that the U.S.S.R.
fears that the countries she was keeping under
control, by evolving towards greater democracy and greater freedom, might turn not
only from an ideological point of view but
also from the economic, and therefore military
point of view, towards the western powers.
But the fact remains that the U.S.S.R. proved
in Czechoslovakia that she still believes in
force. That alone should be enough for us to
decide to stay within NATO.
The Leader of the Government told us, if I
remember correctly, in the speech he made
during the Throne Speech debate, that he
foresaw for the Senate a far more active role

October 9, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

in the field of external affairs. On that score I
had already indicated my support and my
approval. All the senators have since endorsed the suggestion of the Leader of the
Government. Well, I should like to say to the
Leader of the Government that it seems to
me that one of the first questions, if not
the first, which should be referred to the
standing committee on external affairs of the
Senate, is precisely that question of NATO.
Public opinion should certainly be alerted
and educated in this particular regard. Generally speaking, to most people NATO is a
very vague concept because, after all, who
can recall exactly what reasons Canada had,
20 years ago, to become a member of that
mutual defence system? Moreover, why could
we not, we, members of the Senate, acquaint
ourselves further with the matter and obtain
from the officials of the department a mass of
information on our participation, our experience, and our future plans? Thus, by becoming more familiar with the subject ourselves, we can better inform the public. The
public will then be in a position to crystallize,
at least in part, what the Government thinks
or at least what the Prime Minister thinks; it
might help him to reach a decision.

think, are held by the Government Leaderand they are much more definite that those of
the Prime Minister-we will be better able to
make a decision which will reassure our allies
and prevent other defections. I am convinced
that if the NATO alliance were to fall apart, a
substitute would have to be found in order
that we might still have a system of collective
defence such as this one, which has been very
useful and has given excellent results so far.
In my opinion, NATO should be maintained, and if it is not, it will have to be
replaced by another alliance based on the
same principles. That is why I repeat my
suggestion to the Government Leader to refer
this question as soon as possible to the Senate
committee on external aff airs.

CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAY BILL
CONSTRUCTION OF LINE OF RAILWAY NEAR

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill C-109, respecting the construction of a line of railway in
the Province of Alberta by Canadian National
Railway Company from the vicinity of Windfall on the Windfall Extension to the Sangudo
Subdivision of the Canadian National Railway
in a westerly direction for a distance of
approximately 51 miles to the Bigstone property of Pan American Petroleum Corporation
and of a connecting spur extending in a

Hon. Mr. Martin: I feel that it is not a

fact that the present Government is now

indecision.

the Government Leader sees the matter, or
perhaps that is the only interpretation he
can put upon it, and therefore it is logical
that be should have wanted to give us the
assurances he gave us the other day. Nevertheless, the fact remains that if we look at the

RHODESIA
MEDIATION IN CONSTITUTIONAL DISPUTE

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Chesley Carter: Honourable senators,
I gather from what His Honour the Speaker
said yesterday that it is in order to put oral
questions to the leader, on Orders of the Day.
I should like to take advantage of this opportunity to ask a short question consisting of
two parts.
In view of the fact that meetings are once
more taking place between the prime ministers of the United Kingdom and Rhodesia,
can the leader inform the house, first, as to
whether Canada bas made any efforts ta
mediate in the dispute between the United
Kingdom and Rhodesia; and, second, what
factors determine Canada's attitude in this
matter?

nevertheless,

October 10, 1968
whatever

accommodation

is

reached, it will be within the six points; and
that will fully conform with the policy of
Canada.
Hon. Mr. Carter: Honourable senators, I
should like to thank the Leader for his kind
answer. Would he permit a further supplementary question?
Is not Canada's very active role in the
United Nations with respect to Rhodesia
somewhat inconsistent with Canada's role
with respect to the Nigerian problem?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, my
answer to that is "no". In the case of Nigeria
we are face to face with a sovereign power,
with a member of the United Nations, with a
country that is beholden to no other authority
for its external representation or defence
policy or domestic policy. It is a sovereign
power, like Canada. That is not the situation
in the case of Rhodesia: it is not a sovereign,
independent power.
As I said a few moments ago, Rhodesia's
declaration of independence was illegal,
unconstitutional. Britain continues to be the
colonial power and there continues to reside
in the British Government the ultimate authority, in certain phases of defence and certain matters connected with the foreign policy
of Southern Rhodesia. So we are not dealing
with identical entities. The one is a power
that is beholden in part to another: the other
is a fully sovereign country.

Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators,
with regard to the first part of the question,
it will be recalled that, before the Smith government made an illegal declaration of
independence, our Government had stated
that it had joined with other Commonwealth
governments in trying to persuade Prime
Minister Smith not to take this dangerous
step.

NORTH ATLANTIC ASSEMBLY
COMMITTEE MEETINGS AT BRUSSELS

The Senate resumed from yesterday, the
adjourned debate on the inquiry of the
Honourable Senator Lang calling the attention of the Senate to the Standing and Preparatory Committee Meetings of the North
Atlantic Assembly, held at Brussels, Belgium,

20th May to 24th May, 1968, and in particular
to the discussions and proceedings of the
meetings and the participation therein of the
delegation from Canada.
Hon. T. D'Arcy Leonard: Honourable senators, I would like to start by congratulating
Senator Lang on initiating this debate as well
as on the excellence of his own speech in
opening. I was not present to hear it but I
read it with the greatest of interest and pleasure. Senator Lang thought that the fact that
I had been in Czechoslovakia at the time of
the recent invasion might have some bearing
on the debate on this subject. He felt that if I
had any views they might be of interest to
the Senate, and it is on that basis that I speak
now.

While my own personal participation as a
witness of some of the things that happened
is certainly not by any means an epic story,
nevertheless I did see enough to form some
definite impressions and to arrive at certain
conclusions which have a bearing on my
opinion with respect to NATO, which views
might be of interest to you.
My wife and I were on a holiday trip and
arrived in Prague on August 15, some five or
six days before the actual invasion took place.
We had been in Prague a few years before.
We liked it very much at that time and we
made up our minds we would try again some
day to go back. It is a beautiful city. It is a
great historical city and the people are very
fine indeed. We also thought we would like to
see some more of Czechoslovakia, if we ever
got back there. In the course of our lengthy
travels, we have taken in a good many countries; indeed, we have been in all the countries behind the Iron Curtain, including
Russia. Of them all, there are only two that
we felt we would like to go back to, from the
standpoint of pleasure and enjoyment. One
was Czechoslovakia and the other was Yugoslavia. We returned to both of these countries
this year.
Naturally, in June and July there was some
doubt in my mind as to whether we should
not change our plans because it was obvious
from press reports that there were differences
of view between the U.S.S.R. and Czechoslovakia, and there was some feeling that the
liberalization movement going on in Czechoslovakia at that time was lu some way
antagonistic to the views of the U.S.S.R., and
the troops were dragging their feet in leaving
Czechoslovakia. So I was quite prepared to
change our plans if there was likely to be any
difficulty. As you will recall, however, the
representatives of the two countries met in
Bratislava early in August, and the communiqué that was issued on August 3 as a
result of those meetings was reassuring. The
tone of it was to the effect that whatever
differences there had been between them
seemed to have been mutually agreed upon
and settled. Indeed, from the Czechlosovakian
standpoint, it seemed almost as it they had
had their way and won the day.
How wrong that was, subsequent events
proved. One now knows that even though at
that time the U.S.S.R. appeared to have
accepted the Czechoslovakian position, they
were already preparing for the invasion.
However, so far as we were concerned, we
found everything very peaceful, quiet and
serene. The people were going about their

SENATE DEBATES

business in the usual way. Not only was there
no trouble, but there was no sign of trouble
and no indication of fear of trouble.
On the Saturday before the invasion took
place we rented a Czechoslovakian car. It had
a Czechoslovakian licence, of course, which
had some bearing on what happened afterwards. We rented it from the Cedok-Intravel,
which is the government travel organization,
being another of the state controlled operations in that socialist state. We drove from
Prague to Karlovy Vary, in Bohemia. Karlovy
Vary used to be part of Germany and in
those days it was known as Carlsbad and was
a famous spa resort. King Edward VII used
to go there, as did some other well known
personages. It is still a very beautiful place in
a very attractive location with thermal
springs. It does not have the grandeur of the
nineteenth century, but it is still a very pleasant place to be. It is about 100 miles from
Prague and 30 miles from the border between
Czechoslovakia and West Germany.
We used Karlovy Vary as our headquarters, driving out from there through the
countryside to various other towns and places
in Bohemia. It is also known to us in poetry
and literature as a place of considerable
romance and charm, and, indeed, it is a
charming place. Again, there was no sign of
any trouble; there was no indication of any
fear; no alarm whatsoever. Things were just
as quiet as one might normally expect. On the
night of Tuesday-Wednesday, August 20-21,
the night on which the invasion took place,
we attended a concert in the large auditorium
in Karlovy Vary. It was a very distinguished
concert. People were dressed in evening
clothes and obviously they all enjoyed themselves. It was a fine concert and we enjoyed
it too.
Looking back afterwards, my wife and I
were reminded of the words of Byron's poem,
"On the Eve of Waterloo":
There was a sound of revelry by
night...
But hush! hark! a deep sound strikes
like a rising knell!

October 10, 1968

I was alarmed, naturally, and I had my
qualms. I suspected that perhaps there was
trouble ahead. But there was nothing we
could do at that time except go back to bed
and get up early in the morning. This was the
day we were going to arrive back in Prague.
The following day, Thursday, we were going
to fly to Vienna. So I packed early and went
down to the lobby of the hotel. There I found
the staff all gathered around the radio. The
women were in tears and the men were sober
and obviously very worried.
They told me the news. I had suspected by
that time the Russians had moved in during
the night and that their planes, tanks and
guns had taken all the airports. They had
moved into Prague and their tanks were in
Wenceslaus Square. Incidentally, the hotel in
which we had stayed the previous weekend
and to which we were planning to return that
day, Hotel Jalta, is situated on Wenceslaus
Square. I learned that Dubcek was missing,
and that there would be fighting and killing,
that the borders would be closed, and that
the approaches to Prague were blocked.
Under the circumstances, obviously, there
was no use in my starting out to drive to
Prague; that is what everyone told me.
Because of the fact that we could stay on in
the hotel, we decided for the time being to
stay put.
During the day we investigated the possibility of driving the car to the West German
border, about 30 miles away. We were several
hundred miles from the Austrian border, and
had been informed that the border was
blocked and we would be unable to get
through. I tried to get a Czech, either from
Cedok or somewhere else, to come with us
and take the car back, but it was impossible
to get anyone, even though we canvassed all
possibilities. We decided therefore to remain
where we were that day.
During the day, of course, we were in the
streets listening, watching and talking to the
people. The free radio was broadcasting constantly and announcements were being made
for the most part by one man and one girl.
The free radio continued at least six days and

picked up some news from various people.

October 10, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Circumstances became worse as the days
moved on, such as an increase in the number
of troops, more killing and so on.
The young people of Karlovy Vary demonstrated; they organized parades and marched
through the streets shouting for Dubcek and
Svoboda, to show their support for the Czechoslovakian government. They carried signs
reading, "Russians, go home", and distributed
flags and generally showed antagonism to the
invasion that had taken place.
The Moscow Papp Hotel in which we were
staying is a rather famous old hotel, and was
named after the man who used to run it, Mr.
Pupt.
When the Russians moved in in 1945, following the retreat of the Germans, they were
of course, hailed as saviours of Czechoslovakia and were welcomed with open arms.
The name of this particular hotel was then
changed, in honour of the Russians, to the
Moscow-Pupt Hotel and for all these years
has borne that name. I saw a young girl
climb up a ladder with a bucket of paint and
brush and black out the name "Moscow", to
the cheers of everyone around. This was rather typical of the feeling of the people. Up to
this time, of course, the Russians were supposed to be friends of Czechoslovakia.
As I said before, we stayed there all day
Wednesday. Thursday morning I was up
early and went to the Cedok office as soon as
it opened to endeavour to find out what had
happened through the night. I was still unable to obtain much news, except that apparently some telephone calls from Prague got
through. I tried to put in a call to the Canadian Embassy in Prague but after an hour or
two, I was told it was impossible to get
through. There did, however, appear to be
some indication that possibly foreigners were
crossing the border into West Germany.
When we got that news my wife and I decided to drive immediately to the West German
border.
We checked out of the hotel, but asked
them to keep a room for us in case we had to
come back that night, and drove off. A few
miles out we ran into a line of some 20 or 30
cars which were stopped. We also stopped
and went to see what the trouble was, expecting to find a Russian barricade. However,
though it was a barricade, it was not one
erected by the Russians; it was a barricade
erected by the Czechs themselves as part of a
demonstration called for that day over the
free radio all over Czechoslovakia, and a general strike of all the people of Czechoslovakia

to show their resistance to the Russian
invasion.
Again they had their signs and again it was
quite evident that they were all terribly
shocked and strongly opposed to what had
taken place. The general strike had been
called for one hour, and during that time not
a wheel turned, not a car moved and
throughout Czechoslovakia not a person
worked. At one o'clock when the time was
up, the barricade was pulled away, people
cheered, and we went on.
We got to the border in perhaps another
three-quarters of an hour, and at the border
there was a Russian tank and Russian soldiers
supervising what was going on. However,
they were allowing the Czech customs, immigration and police . officials to permit those
people in foreign cars to leave. In fact all the
other cars accept my own were German,
French or from the United Kingdom and
were being allowed through after being
scrutinized and checked.
When they came along to my car, bearing a
Czech licence, it posed a problem for them.
Fortunately there was a young man in the car
ahead of me, a German from West Berlin,
who in addition to his own language spoke
English and Russian. He volunteered to help,
and his help was very valuable indeed. He
conveyed the information to the Czech officials that I had rented the car and I was prepared to leave it there and get across the
border in whatever way we could manage. It
took a little while to satisfy them. They made
us pull out of the line, and went through the
car with a fine-tooth comb, searching it thoroughly, even under the hood. They also went
through our papers very thoroughly. Finally,
the chief customs officer took the responsibility of taking over the car, the papers and
keys. Once he had reached this decision, he
was most helpful. He took our bags out of the
car for us and asked how we were going to
get across into Germany. He informed us that
there was a no man's land of about half a
mile in between. I said that we would walk if
necessary, but asked if there was any form of
transportation available. He said we could get
a taxi and he actually telephoned for one for
us.
In due course a taxi drove up; it was a
Mercedes Benz driven by a charming German
lady. It transpired that she was one of a
voluntary service operated by the Germans
helping anyone who was trying to get out of
Czechoslovakia. She not only drove us across
the no man's land but also took us through

the German customs and immigration like a
breeze, and drove us 10 miles on to the railroad station where we got a train to Frankfurt. This was like coming from hell to heaven. She refused to accept any payment; she
would not even accept a gift. So all I could do
was to kiss her goodbye.
Hon. Mr. Martin: It was certainly a chivalrous act.
Hon. Mr. Leonard: This may be somewhat
boring, honourable senators, but two things
struck me very forcibly and these are the
things I want to convey to you. The first was
the complete surprise and shock that this was
to the people of Czechoslovakia. One might
think they should have been more concerned
about this in the light of what had happened
in the past, but to them it was simply a stab
in the back from friends. Whatever they
miglit have thought of the difficulties as
between their country and the Soviet Union
on matters of political progress, they certainly did not expect that there would be any
resort to arms. This was definitely regarded
by them as a rape of Czechoslovakia.
The other thing that impressed me forcibly
was the complete solidarity of the Czechs.
Whatever specious propaganda the Russians
might have thought they could put across
about coming to the help of the people of
Czechoslovakia was certainly proved to be
completely false. The people of Czechoslovakia were 100 per cent against the operation and it was abundantly clear to everyone
that the Russians were unable to find any
Quisling, Ulbricht or Gomulka to take over
and do their bidding.
One cannot blame the Czechs, honourable
senators, for not actively resisting with force.
Had they donc so, it would have resulted in a
blood bath. But unquestionably the passive
resistance was universal and continues to go
on. Unfortunately this will mean-and it has
already developed-a tightening of the
screws, and their lot is not going to be a very
happy one. It will grow harder and harder,
but it may well be that ultimately it will be
proved that in this case the Soviet Union bas
bitten off more than it can swallow. I think
the reaction of the world, the reaction of
some of their own people and of other communist parties, particularly those of Roumania
and Yugoslavia, have had a very considerable
effect on Russian thinking.
These two things are important to be kept
in mind: first, that it was a complete surprise
and an act of treachery and, secondly, that

October 10, 1968

the people themselves are completely opposed
to what has taken place.
Later we travelled from Frankfurt to
Yugoslavia. Lest honourable senators might
think it was a foolhardy action and that we
were going from the frying pan into the fire,
I should say that I did check with the
Canadian Embassy in Athens before going on
to Yugoslovia. Actually it was our fifth trip to
Yugoslavia and we know the country and the
people quite well. We received sufficient assurance from the embassy that it seemed to be
all right to travel into Yugoslavia. There we
found quite a different situation from that in
Czechoslovakia. There is no doubt at all that
if Yugoslavia were attacked, it would fight
back. It would be war. This is due to the
character of the people and to their history.
And probably because of the qualities of the
people and the terrain of the country they
might very well be successful in resisting the
power and might of the U.S.S.R. As all
honourable senators are aware, Tito had
denounced the invasion by the Soviet Union
as being a brutal act, and the feeling of the
people of Yugoslavia with whom we talked
indicated to us that they were not at all
afraid of what might happen.
Now, honourable senators, I bring this to a
conclusion by relating what I saw to Senator
Lang's motion as to NATO. I hope I have not
bored you with this experience, but unquestionably my own mind bas changed with
regard to NATO. If we are to deal with this
kind of mental and moral complex that we
have seen in the action against Czechoslovakia, we are dealing again with the same
kind of thing that Hitler or Stalin did. It is
something that is foreign to our own thinking.
We do not want, we do not anticipate, and
I hope that we will not have, any more wars
of any size. I would not anticipate even now
that this will happen in Roumania, Yugoslavia
or any other country; but I did not anticipate
that it would happen in Czechoslovakia. It is
going to require a great deal of thinking,
planning, hard work and negotiation to be
sure that we can now avoid another war, that
we can maintain peace and security; and I do
not think we will get it by argument, reason
or logic alone. It seems to me there are only
certain kinds of arguments that really would
have an effect on the minds of those who
would perpetrate an invasion of Czechoslovakia.
Whatever work bas to be done, whatever
planning we are going to do, whatever negotiating we are going to do, we must plan and

Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon Mr. Leonard: Whatever need existed
for NATO twenty years ago, or at any time
during the intervening period, that need is
just as great now as it has ever been.
So, the conclusion I reach is that, to maintain peace and security, or to do our best to
maintain peace and security in the hope that
we will accomplish it, the strenthening of
NATO is the policy we must pursue. Whatever the price is, that is the price we must pay.
SUPREME COURT ACT
BILL TO AMEND-MOTION FOR ADOPTION OF
REPORT OF COMMITTEE-MOTION IN
AMENDMENT-DEBATE ADJOURNED

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the report of the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce on Bill S-8, to amend
the Supreme Court Act, which was presented
yesterday.
Hon. Lazarus Phillips, for Senator Salter A.
Hayden, Chairman of the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, moved that
the report be adopted now.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, as I said on a previous occasion, in my
judgment this is a very important bill, one
which touches principles deeply imbedded in
our consciousness, of long standing and of
great importance. While I am critical of some
of the details of the bill-which, with your
kind permission, I will discuss at some
length-I am more concerned with the general tendencies which the bill intensifies than I
am with perhaps the exact details.
I would like to point out that in 1956 we
passed an act raising the limit of jurisdiction
of the Supreme Court of Canada from causes
in which the minimum of $2,000 was in issue
to those in which $10,000 was in issue. In
doing so we closed the door of this court on
the great masses of the ordinary citizens of
this country. There was an English jurist who
once made the comment that the doors of the
court were open to al mankind, be they rich
or be they poor. Then, after a little pause, he
added, "-just like the doors of the Ritz Carlton!" I am afraid that we are making the
doors of this court somewhat similar to the
doors of the Ritz Carlton-for the rich man
and not for the ordinary citizen and, above
all, not for the poor.
29234-17

I remember hearing a statement by an
admirer of our Constitution and our economy,
that in this country our laws were such that
they gave equal rights to the rich and the
poor-to sleep under a bridge. Well, this
increase in the minimum monetary jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada slams
the door in the face of the ordinary people
and the ordinary sized businessmen of
Canada.
I spoke on another occasion of the poor
and, of course, they are included, but the
blockade that is now being erected and intensified by this bill does not only extend to the
poor but, I repeat, also to the ordinary people
and the ordinary small businessmen of this
country.
How often as the years go by has the ordinary businessman a cause in which as much
as $10,000 is in issue? And how often has he
the funds available to pay the inordinate costs
of an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada? I will have something to say about those
costs in the course of my remarks.
Clause 2 of the bill intensifies the evil of
the 1960 act in the raising of the minimum of
the jurisdiction of the court from one of
$2,000 to that of $10,000, by making the change
apply to something that was overlooked, I
would think, when the bill of 1956 was
enacted.
May I read, in part, clause 2' of the bill so
that we may have in our minds, as clearly as
possible just what is being proposed.
Section 39 of the said Act is repealed
and the following substituted therefor:
"....an appeal to the Supreme Court lies

on a question of law with leave of the
highest court of final resort in a province
from a final judgment of another court of
that province, the judges of which are
appointed by the Governor General, pronounced in a judicial proceeding where
the amount or value of the matter in
controversy in the appeal exceeds ten
thousand dollars-"
Whereas, heretofore it has been $2,000.
-"and an appeal lies to that court of
final resort-"
That is another qualification: the appeal
must lie to that provincial court. Then, in
addition:
"if the consent in writing of the parties
or their solicitors, verified by affidavit, is
filed with the Registrar of the Supreme
Court and with the registrar, clerk or
prothonotary of the court from which the
appeal is to be taken."

SENATE DEBATES
It is a little difficult to grasp the meaning
of that quickly. It means that with the consent of an appeal court of one of the provinces to which a right of appeal exists as to a
judgment from a court of first instance, an
appeal may be made directly to the Supreme
Court of Canada, bypassing the provincial
court, when the parties or their solicitors consent. The minimum at present is $2,000. If
this bill becomes law it will be $10,000.
This is a useful provision, and one that I
have taken advantage of on occasion. When it
was not necessary to make two argumentsthat is, one to the provincial court of appeal,
and later to the Supreme Court-we have
obtained the necessary consent, and made the
appeal from the court of first instance directly to the Supreme Court of Canada.
We did that in the constitutional appeals
which I personally argued on behalf of the
Province of Ontario, following the Bennett
regime in the early years of the King regime.
That would be about 1936. It was a useful
provision. It saved costs. We reached the final
court in Canada in one step instead of two,
with a consequent saving of time and money.
There are not many appeals of that kind so
to that extent this tightening of the court is
not so critical as that of 1956, but in principle
it is just as bad.
In a practical way, I think that clause 3 is
even more important. Clause 3 provides for
the repealing of section 44A of the act, and
the following substituted therefor:
Notwithstanding any other Act of the
Parliament of Canada, all applications for
leave to appeal to the Supreme Court
shall be heard and determined by the
Court-

October 10, 1968

If I am right, we were permitted to apply
rather informally to a single judge of the
Supreme Court of Canada. I have been present on such an application. Such an application must under this bill now be made to
three judges which involves, of course, more
formality, and with formality there is usually
increased expense. This means that the parties who wish to appeal to the Supreme Court
of Canada with a case involving less than
$10,000 must make a preliminary trip to
Ottawa, and at that time be ready to argue
the whole case and justify it before it comes
on for trial. This is just adding expense to
expense, and building blockades in the road
to what we hope is justice.
Honourable senators, is not the present
expense sufficient? This court of ours in
Ottawa requires the printing of almost the
entire case; not the exhibits, but the factum,
the appeal book and the whole of the evidence have to be printed. I am not exaggerating when I say ta you that the cost of all this
printing in an ordinary case brought before
this court can be $1,000, and sometimes very
much more. That expense must be incurred
before the litigants are given a hearing.
In all the other courts of appeal of the
provinces a typewritten transcript of the evidence is used and perfectly effectively, but
when the litigant comes to the Supreme Court
of Canada everything except the exhibits
must be printed, and everyone knows the cost
of printing these days. It seems as though the
real purpose is to erect obstacles in the way
of those seeking justice.
We have an assurance, I understand, that
these restrictions will not lead to a tightening
of the Court's decisions in regard to leave to
appeal. I am referring here to section 41 of
the present act, which now makes it possible
for the intending litigant to apply to the

tion has been surmounted and, second,

October 10. 1968

SENATE DEBATES

whether the decision is on a point of law,
and, third, whether there is involved a point
of law on which a decision will be of benefit
to the nation generally, and will help develop
Canadian jurisprudence. It is not entirely a
question whether justice has been done in the
courts below but whether some extraneous
matter, in which the litigants have not the
slightest interest, is also involved. I know
personally of a case in which the justice of
the decision of a lower court was in issue,
and the judges, on adding up the various
items constituting the financial issue, found
the total was $200 or $300 below the $10,000
required and threw the parties out. They
refused to decide the real issues of the case;
they threw it out on the ground that there
was involved a few dollars less than the $10,000 required. That does not appear to me to
be the quality of justice we in this chamber
should demand from the courts of our
country.
I know of only one reason put forward to
justify the restrictions in the present bill or
in the one that preceded it, and that is the
convenience of the court. But for the blockade there would, of course, be more cases on
the court docket. These restrictions reduce
the number of cases and the work load on the
judges. I submit that that argument is untenable. I am for widening the jurisdiction and
not for narrowing the services this court may
give to the people of Canada, be they rich or
be they poor, or be they in any intermediate
circumstances.
In my judgment, this court has a very
great role to play in the business activities of
our nation, in the lives of our people, in the
development of a jurisprudence that applies
in all Canada: first, in order that the law may
be more just, and secondly that it may be as
uniform as possible in all our provinces,
which is very important. There are ten provinces in Canada with ten sets of trial courts
and ten courts of appeal. Sometimes the judgments of these courts conflict with one
another. It is most important that we have a
Supreme Court whose judgment is superior to
all others, and, in consequence, a uniformity
of law results.
The desirability of a uniformity of law is
indicated in the British North America Act in
which there is a section designed to assist in
that regard. In the Department of the Attorney General of the Province of Ontario, over
which I have presided, we had a committee
which met with committees from other provinces, the object of which was uniformity of
law. It is vitally important that the law in all
29234-171

provinces be essentially similar. That is one
of the most important services this court may
provide.
The Supreme Court of Canada is more distant and removed from the localities where
disputes arise and thus more detached from
local thought, but above all from local prejudices. It has a real service to perform, even
within the narrow jurisdiction we have
allowed to it. It has in the past performed a
magnificent service.
The jurists who have sat on the Supreme
Court of Canada have been really great men.
Mr. Justice Lyman Duff, for instance, was a
jurist equal to any on the bench in any part
of the Commonwealth, including Great Britain. He was followed by Patrick Kerwin, a
magnificent judge. The Chief Justice is now
Mr. Justice John Cartwright, for whom I have
the greatest respect and admiration. We have
a splendid court, a well qualified court, a well
manned court, and it should be our effort not
to restrict its services to the people of Canada
but rather to broaden its jurisprudence and
influence. If we must limit the number to be
served, a distinction between the rich and the
poor is the very last expedient we should
accept.
As I have already said, the argument as to
the convenience of the court is utterly untenable. If the court is overburdened by the
number seeking its services, the answer is not
to repel the applicants but rather to widen
the abilities of the court. If we have not
enough judges let us appoint more judges to
create more courts. Whatever the requirements may be, we should meet them. In the
lower courts, we appoint more judges if more
judges are required. In this senior legislative
chamber the last item we should reduce is
that of the administration of justice.
I am inclined to think that if we have to
have consent to appeal, that consent should be
required of all people, great or small, and
whether there is $10,000 or 10 cents in issue.
As long as parties are aggrieved and have
just cause of complaint they should be heard.
If we have something to give, I repeat, it
should be given to every citizen without distinction. I also submit that in this matter we
and the people of Canada generally should be
proud to give the service. I am proud of this
court; that is why I am defending it. I am
not, as someone has suggested, attacking this
court. I am attacking those who would ruin
this court.
There is an old saying among English jurists which came, not from the Proverbs but

SENATE DEBATES

from a judgment of long ago: "Let justice be
done, though the heavens fall." I stand by
that-let justice be done though it costs some
money.
There is another clause in this bill, which
limits appeals to questions of law. In the past,
as you know, we have been able to appeal on
questions of fact, or on questions of law and
fact which may be mixed. Now it is stated
definitely in cold type that the appeals are to
be on questions of law only. It is difficult to
estimate the effect of such a change.
It is obvious that every question of law in a
case must be based upon fact. Why this
proposed distinction between law and fact? I
suggest it is a pretty poor answer that we
would give to a litigant who felt himself
aggrieved by some injustice, to tell him that
his case has been dismissed because the issue
was on fact rather than on law-something
which he did not understand and between
which most lawyers find it difficult to draw
the dividing line. It is another restriction,
another road block, which I think is unnecessary and far from salutary.
Honourable senators, there is another
objection, my final objection at this moment
to this bill. My friend, Senator Phillips, for
whose work I have the greatest admiration,
tells us in his excellent explanation of this
bill, and I think he is right, that if it is
passed it will abolish direct applications to
the Supreme Court of Canada for a writ of
habeas corpus.
I have already said once, and I will say it
again, that the habeas corpus principle has
been in existence in English law for many
centuries. You will find it referred to in
Magna Carta. It has been treasured hundreds
of years by those who have lived under the
common law, because of the protection it
affords to the liberty of the subject.
So important has it been considered in the
past, and in this very chamber, that we have
kept it in effect. It is the rule that one may
shop about from judge to judge, and that if
any judge, no matter what a previous judge
may have said, is of opinion that there is
doubt as to the imprisonment or detention of
an individual by some other person, that
judge may issue a writ that requires the
jailer, shall I call him, to appear in court and
explain his actions and justify the imprisonment. Now, who could argue against that?
Notice that expedition is a most necessary
feature of this proceeding. So we have retained it after an argument here in this
chamber, we have retained up to the present

October 10, 1968

the right of the individual to direct access to
the Supreme Court of Canada. There are good
reasons why we have done so.
Some person may be imprisoned in one of
the provinces in which there is a prejudice
against him, or he may feel that the courts or
the province are against him, because of local
matters. He may have been tried by the
newspapers or whatnot, and so we have
decreed that he may come to Ottawa to any
judge of the highest court in Canada.
Honourable senators, if we pass this bill as
it stands, we shall deny him that right. We
will make it necessary for him to apply to a
court of first instance and, if that judge is
against him, to appeal to the court of appeal
of the province in which he lives, and if that
court is against him he may then come to this
court of ours in the nation's capital. While
what Shakespeare calls the delays of the law
take place, he rots in jail. You may ruin him
in the procedure.
At present, if he feels that he cannot
get relief in the courts of his province, he can
come here to a single judge and ask for a
writ that will bring the jailer before the
court, and why not, in the most expeditious
manner possible? If this bill passes as it
stands, he must go through the circumlocution of appeal to the appeal court of his province-and there is no telling how long that
may be delayed-and then come here. In the
meantime he is wasting in jail.
Honourable senators, this is outrageous. So
far there bas been no attempt at justification.
Are we expected to swallow such a proposal
for no good reason but to convenience the
court, to lighten its work load? I do not say
that the court is initiating the proposal. I am
not attacking the court; I am praising the
court and I do not want it restricted; but it is
the responsibility of whoever has brought this
bill before us.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: You said that it is the

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It comes to us from the

Hon. Mr. Benidickson: You also sat in Cabinet at one time, and realize that one does not

Hon. Mr. Flynn: Surely not in a matter of
this importance.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I
am not interested in whether or not the Government is involved, and members of this
chamber should not be interested in that
either. We will deal with this bill on its merits
irrespective of its origin.
It is our privilege to save this court which,
by the way, is under attack. It is our duty not
only to save it from attack, which I foresee
unless we allow it to perform the services for
which it was constituted and which it is our
duty to preserve. We should make this court
and its potential for public service available
to all men, rich or poor, who are suffering
injustice or think they are. Above all things,
we should bring this court back to the people.
I do not know that I am right in this, but it
seems to me that if I move to refer this bill
back to the Standing Committee on Banking
and Commerce, I will contribute in some
measure to further discussion and more
mature thought to the consequences of this
bill. Therefore, I will move, and it may be
that someone will second my motion-

Benidickson, that this report be not now
adopted but that it be referred back to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce for further consideration. Is it your
pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the
motion? Honourable Senator Phillips.
Hon. Mr. Phillips (Rigaud): Honourable
senators, quite obviously I am prepared to
reply to the motion put forward by our highly respected colleague Senator Roebuck, but
having regard to his desires, I have no objection that it be so referred.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, may
I just say that there is no objection on the
part of the Government to this further study
suggested by Senator Roebuck. Would it be
within our rules, however, for the senator in
charge of the bill at the moment to make a
reply which, then being on the record, would
be available to the committee? If so, I think
it is desirable that Senator Phillips make
some response now, it being understood that
the bill will go back to the committee for
further discussion.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It is a debatable motion.
He can certainly speak on it.
The Hon. the Speaker: Order, please. After
I put the motion I asked whether it was the
pleasure of honourable senators to adopt it. I
then paused, and I noticed that the honourable Senator Phillips was rising in his seat. Of
course this is a debatable motion, and I was
under the impression that the honourable
Senator Phillips would reply to it.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Your Honour, I am very
anxious to hear what Senator Phillips will

however, Senator Roebuck's motion is passed

him to speak. So Senator Phillips is the man
who is on the spot and must make a decision
before the rest of us go on. Personally, I am

Hon. Mr. Prowse: With all respect, honourable senators, what we have before the

It is an amendment to the motion before the

If my interpretation is correct, and I
believe it is, Senator Phillips has the right to

Hon. Mr. Flynn: He said he wanted to
listen.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I thought that Senator
Prowse said be wished to speak. Why should
other senators not be allowed to speak now?
If they do so, then Senator Phillips (Rigaud)
will be able to deal with all the replies. It
seems to me that this would be a more orderly way of proceeding.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Is he considered a spokesman for the Government in this instance?
Hon. Mr. Martin: He is carrying this bill
for the Government.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I realize that, but as far as
the argument put by Senator Roebuck is concerned, he is not the only one who can reply.
The leader may also reply.

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Mr. Martin: The leader may speak,
but in this instance I have asked Senator
Phillips to take the bill, and I have followed it
with close interest. I am suggesting the most
orderly way to proceed would be to let
honourable senators who wish to follow Senator Roebuck, speak and present their views. I
am sure this is the way it should be done.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Let us hear Senator
Prowse.
Hon. J. Harper Prowse: Honourable senators, I would have been quite happy to have
permitted honourable Senator Phillips (Rigaud) the privilege of off ering his rebuttal, as
I would have had the opportunity of taking it
to pieces, without his being able to take mine
apart. However, in the interests of an orderly
house and the welfare of the people of
Canada, this procedure, whereby he will be
permitted to hear all arguments against the
bill, and then to allow a summing up by the
sponsor before the house is asked to reach its
decision, will perhaps enable us to arrive at
the most rationaL conclusion.
As I understand it, these amendments
which were brought in do in effect whittle
down the limits or the jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court of Canada, and they are being
introduced merely because at the present time
the court has become so overloaded and overworked that it is taking longer to get out its
judgments than is generally considered desirable in the interests of orderly dispensation
of justice.
This is not, as has been pointed out, a
criticism of the court, but rather a circumstance that arises out of the heavy load of
work the court has to carry. But when we are
faced with a simple solution to such a serious
problem as is represented by this bill, then it
seems to me that somebody has lost sight of
the function of the Supreme Court of Canada. Like Senator Roebuck, I do not care who
that person is-I think they should be asked
to look at what they are doing.
I had the privilege the other afternoon, as
many of you had, of hearing Senator Walker
speak about the many duties that fall upon
the Supreme Court. Every lawyer in the
country is familiar with the fact that at least
half of the reports of the Supreme Court that
come out at regular intervals are devoted to
Exchequer Court appeals. Most of them in
fact deal with revenue cases, and the rest
deal with decisions by other goverriment
boards.

Now, it may be necessary that there should
be provision for some kind of appeal from the
Exchequer Court, but these cases all deal
with technical and specialized sections of the
law which are of more interest, usually, to
large business corporations than to individuals. It is a very lucrative kind of law practice
to get into, and very important to the country, because it affects its revenue and the
operations of the departments of government
with private industry, which provides so
much of the wealth on which the country
depends. But if it is the load of work that
they are getting by way of appeals from the
Exchequer Court or the Tax Appeal Board,
or whatever they may be, that is burdening
the court to the extent that it cannot perform
its primary function, then we say the answer
is to set up another court to deal with that
type of appeal.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Prowse: It seems to me that very
often the judges we are going to bring in
from parts of the country other than Ottawa
and its near vicinity to sit in the Supreme
Court of Canada generally may not, because
of their remoteness from this part of the
country, have had experience in those particular areas. But the first function of this
court, so far as Parliament and the people of
Canada are concerned, is that it should
ensure not only that justice should be available and should be done for every Canadian
who finds himself in need of justice, but that
it should also appear to be done. And the fact
that a right of appeal is there, whether it be
used or not, is an essential part of that function which is ensuring that justice should
appear to be done because then if the person
concerned does not like what has happened in
a lower court, he has the right to go elsewhere. But when we do as we are doing here,
putting in a dollar value, we are saying in
effect, "Unless the thing you are arguing about
is worth $10,000, the court cannot waste its
time on you."
Honourable senators, some of the finest decisions to be found in the reports of the House
of Lords and the Privy Council were concerned with matters of a shilling or sixpence. They were concerned with matters
where the people went there as paupers
because the courts felt that their services
should be available to them.
Let me add this, honourable senators.
Today we hear in this chamber and elsewhere
in the country expression of concern about
the future of this particular body. This is

SENATE DEBATES
supposed to be the body of sober second
thought. But let us not deceive ourselves
because we happen to be dealing with initiating legislation that we no longer have responsibility to be looking at it as though we were
giving it sober second thought. Therefore, I
predict, and I have no fear about the outcome
of my prediction, that if this bill goes as it is
to the other place, it will come back to us
amended in exactly the way the honourable
Senator Roebuck has suggested it should be
changed. Rather than increasing the limit
from $2,000 to $10,000, we would be better
serving the interests of justice in Canada, we
would be doing more for the reputation of our
love for justice, and we would be doing more
to support and enshrine the reputation of our
courts if we were to reduce the $10,000 to
$2,000 where it appears, or even take it out
altogether.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Prowse: Personally, I would take
it out altogether. I would accept quickly the
suggestion made by our honourable colleague,
who has had experience not only as a lawyer
and legislator but as an attorney general of a
province, that perhaps it should be by leave.
When you say $10,000, all right-to the big
corporation lawyer that is not important. He
will say, "What is the Supreme Court being
bothered for, and why should I have to wait
a week to get on because they have a list of
murder appeals; everybody knows this is a
formality before you get around to putting
the guy away for the rest of his life." We
have all heard this type of comment from
counsel who do not take that kind of case.
Well, honourable senators, I have had that
kind of case, but not very many of the other
kind. How can we give way to the idea that a
case involving any sum of money could be as
important as a case involving a man's life?
Some of these amendments may not deal
with criminal appeal sections, but they do
deal with sections which involve matters of
principle. In per saltum appeals, all lawyers
know and are decided that certain points will
have to be determined. Before they start in a
court of law at all, they can agree that there
are certain grey areas that are only going to
be determined and in the end no one will be
happy unless they can be determined by the
Supreme Court of Canada. We have the situation where the courts in one province have
said one thing in a particular set of circumstances, while the courts of another province
have said something esle, and in most cases

October 10, 1968

courts are governed by the precedents set in
their own provinces. But if it should happen
that the amount involved is less than $10,000,
they cannot go to the Supreme Court of
Canada.
Let me tell you about a piece of legislation
we had in Alberta a number of years ago for
the protection of home owners and farming
people. It used to be a great game with some
people to overprice their land and sell it, and
when the man who bought it could not pay
for it, to take back the land from him and
sell it again. But the government of the day
took action and put a section in the Judicature Act which said that anybody who sold
land was limited, if the person buying the
land could not pay, to a return of the land.
That is if you sold a farm or a house and the
person to whom you sold it could not pay,
you could get the land back but you could not
keep the money you had already received and
keep the land as well. Furthermore if you
took the land back and then sold it again and
got more for it than was owing to you, the
difference had to go to the original purchaser.
That was a good law.
But then some bright person got the idea
that he would ask the people to waive this
legislation, and for years people in certain
places in Alberta were signing waivers of this
legislation.
Now without wishing to bore people who
are lawyers, and indeed those who are not,
with a dissertation on the law of waiver, I
simply say that it was generally believed that
this waiver was not worth the paper it was
written on, but if it made some mortgage
corporation lawyer sitting in Toronto happy
to think he had a waiver, that was fine. But
as far as we were concerned, nobody in
Alberta took it seriously.
Then, honourable senators, there was a
case involving a business deal worth half a
million dollars, and there was a waiver
involved. As I say, nobody had paid any
attention to those waivers for 20 years
because it was felt that they were void, being
contrary to public policy. This case went
through to the Supreme Court of Canada, and
that court agreed with the courts of Alberta,
that this particular waiver was effective
because the general principle was never
intended to apply to businessmen. The result
was that a lot of people who had signed waivers, being satisfied they did not mean anything, are now not at all sure where they
stand. Had the validity of that waiver been
tested on a $1,500 shack, I have not the

Now, I think that the decision in the two
cases would be distinguishable, but at the

was a law which applied without distinction
to the smallest and to the largest.

OMBUDSMAN COMMITTEE
MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COMMITTEEDEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. David A. Croll moved, pursuant to
notice:
That the Senate considers it desirable
to establish at an early date a committee
of the Senate, to be known as the "Ombudsman Committee", to inquire into and
report to the Senate on any matter or
thing within the jurisdiction of Parliament relevant to the protection of human
rights and fundamental freedoms, and

October 15, 1968

the prevention of unjust or arbitrary conduct, and in particular to investigate and
report upon any grievance complained of
as a result of administrative action for
which no other remedy is available.
He said: Honourable senators, the sole purpose of this motion, which was first introduced
at the last session of the previous Parliament, is to seek your approval of the establishment of a committee of this house which
would serve, in effect, as a collective ombudsman to investigate, rectify where possible,
and report upon when necessary, any grievance complained of by a Canadian citizen,
and allegedly arising from maladministration,
error, or carelessness on the part of any
department, agency, or service of the federal
Government below the ministerial level.
The purpose of this committee will be to
reaffirm the citizen's ancient right of protest.
The public servant's interpretation of the
intent and spirit of laws passed by Parliament, and his application of such laws, may
be examined by this committee, acting as the
champion of the citizen.
The citizen's right to protest the administrator's decision and discretion in applying the
law to him, and the citizen's remedy to have
an official champion who is protected against
reprisals to investigate that protest, is as old
as society itself. In the Greek constitution the
Thesmothetae was charged with investigating
complaints against the conduct of the
administration. In the Roman constitution the
Tribuni Plebis was essentially the representative of the plebians who afforded protection
against abusers, usurpers and the ambitions of
the patrician administrators. Under British
law the citizen had direct access to Parliament by petition of Parliament.
In Canada the member of Parliament has
occasionally used the private member's public
bill, which is a reversion to the old form of
petition, but the opportunity to debate the
citizen's grievances is rare and passage of the
bill is scarcely likely to be obtained. It relies
mostly on publicity.
Those of you who have followed the proceedings in the other house will realize that
they have set up a special proceeding for
grievances under the Proceedings of Adjournment Motion. On looking at the end of Hansard for instance, of Thursday of last week, it
will be found that they discussed agriculture,
the biological effects on
chickens of
microwave tower radiation; communications,
co-operation with France in space and satellite research; on Tuesday they dealt with Corporations and Labour Unions Returns Act,

October 15, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

and also with fisheries. These matters are
dealt with in very short order, but an opportunity is there given for the purpose of presenting a grievance.
I am not speaking of people outside of Parliament. The individual members are increasingly threatened by the power that Parliament confers on public servants to determine
his rights and obligations, often without
appeal to the law courts. The rights of parliament fade as the powers of politically responsible ministers are in fact exercised by
politically irresponsible public servants. The
modern public servant is often in a position
to make the law, apply it, and give final judgment with respect to the rights of individuals
and groups affected by that law.
The need for some sort of instrumentality
in the nature of an ombudsman, which would
be constantly available for investigation of
grievances suffered by ordinary citizens at
the hands of officialdom, was recognized long
ago in the Scandinavian countries. Its origin
in the modern sense is to be found in the
establishment under the Swedish constitution
in 1809 of the post of ombudsman, to ensure
on behalf of the Swedish Parliament that
Swedish laws were adhered to by the
administrative and in fact by the judicial
authorities of that country.
The Swedish word "ombud" refers to a
person who acts as spokesman or as the
of another person. The
representative
ombudsman is, therefore, a representative of
the ordinary citizen, vis-à-vis the officials.
The Swedish ombudsman is not a judge
and has no power to change administrative or
judicial decisions, but it has been found in
Sweden and in other countries that a public
rebuke or criticism, or even the ability to
administer one, is sufficient in most cases to
rectify any wrong which is at once recognizable and reparable.
Following the Swedish example, the institution of parliamentary ombudsman was established in the Finnish constitution of 1919.
At first, it proved to be of little practical importance in that country and its abolition was
contemplated in 1932. Since that time, however, its importance has constantly increased.
The institution was in fact so successful both
in Sweden and in Finland that neighbouring
Denmark adopted it in 1955, and it spread to
Norway in 1962.
Honourable senators, the institution was
first adopted by a commonwealth country in
the common law tradition in New Zealand in
29234-18

1962. No common law jurisdiction appears
ever to have considered the adoption of any
system of administrative courts, such as there
are in the French conseils d'État, designed to
supervise the administration. These have been
regarded as an alien instituton incapable of
being transported into or superimposed on
those of Anglo-Saxon origin.
It is not surprising, at least to begin with,
that the Scandinavian institution of ombudsman was also looked upon by common law
lawyers in a somewhat blasé fashion. The
breakthrough appears to have come about
through the proselytizing zeal of the Danish
ombudsman, Professor Stephan Hurwitz,
whose appearances on TV and on radio in
Great Britain and whose paper on the subject
at the United Nations seminar in Kandy, Ceylon in 1959 stimulated the interest of New
Zealand in the institution and led ultimately
to their establishment of an ombudsman in
1962.
Hon. Mr. Martin: What was that seminar
on?
Hon. Mr. Croll: I do not know. I have not
the particulars with me, but I seem to recall
from my reading that it was on human rights.
I hope it will not be necessary for me to
retrace all the early ground or rethresh old
straw in order to demonstrate that the establishment of an ombudsman could not be
incompatible with the British system of government. The experience of New Zealand has
shown that this is simply not so; the institution has become quite acceptable.
I do not think I need to remind honourable
senators that the House of Commons Standing
Committee on Privileges and Elections dealt
with this subject when it met in 1964 and
1965 to consider a private members bill sponsored by Mr. R. K. Thompson, a member of
Parliament. By the way, Mr. Thompson is
sponsoring Bill C-57, now before the House of
Commons. It is written in the same language
and in the same form. He is hopeful and so
am I. The recommendations of that committee
are set out in the Minutes of March 1, 1965:
After due consideration the Committee
recommends that the Government consider the establishment of an office, like that
of an ombudsman, for the purpose of
investigating and reporting on administrative acts of the Government of Canada
complained of by members of the public.
The Committee recommends also that
the Government of Canada should take

SENATE DEBATES
an early opportunity to urge the establishment of a similar institution by each
of the provinces, for scrutinizing in the
same way administrative action under
provincial jurisdiction.

October 15, 1968

it being clearly understood that this is not a
precedent.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, as
the Leader of the Government said, this is
not exactly the same as the case we had the
other day. At times you may wish to have a
document printed as an appendix to Hansard,
in support of the argument you submit.
But this is actually part of the speech by
honourable Senator Croll. That is why this
precedent is more dangerous than the one to
which we alluded, involving the printing of
an article, as was requested by Senator Cameron. On the other hand, I agree with the
Leader of the Government that we are now
considering a review of our rules and, as long
as the requested leave is not used as a precedent for an argument to change the rules in
the future, I have no objection. I gather that
the purpose of Senator Croll's suggestion is to
save time, under the circumstances, but it is
with some reluctance that I give consent and
I do not accept that I should be reminded I
have done so.

I commend to all honourable senators the
evidence given before the committee by Sir
Guy Powles, the New Zealand ombudsman.
In order to have a proper understanding of
the New Zealand experience, which has been
a very happy one, it is necessary to read
what he said. May I quote a few pertinent
paragraphs from Sir Guy's testimony, which
should serve to remove any remaining doubts
as to the utility and suitability of such an
institution. The evidence appears in the
Minutes of the Standing Committee on Privileges and Elections, No. 6, at pages 360 and
361.
In accordance with His Honour the Speaker's suggestion in such instances, I have sent
to him a copy of what I propose to read. I
would now ask the indulgence of the house to

speech certain quotations, which I shall not

October 15, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

counter arguments put up by other
members in the house seemed to prevail,
and since the establishment of the Act, I
personally do not sense any feeling that
members think I am depriving them of
any of their rightful privileges.
Mr. Fisher: What about the question
upon which you touched before with
regard to ministerial responsibility and
its effects upon that? That is an argument
that was put to me by federal lawyers
here when I was in discussion with them
about this. They felt there was a very
substantial likelihood that such an office
at work in Canada could very well interfere between the senior civil servant and
his feeling that the minister is responsible for him and that he is responsible to
the minister.
Sir Guy Powles: I would not know
whether that would be likely to happen
in Canada, but I have not seen any evidence of its happening in New Zealand. I
do not see that it works in that way; it
does not interfere with those relationships.
Mr. Fisher: What about the tendency
toward ministerial sensitivity any time
anything is discovered-in this country
anyway, I would say-to the effect that
when the administration is looked upon
unfairly or badly it tends to be a blot
upon the reputation of the government
itself?
What I would like to know in connection with this is what kind of publicity
develops from the cases you handle and
how the interventions you make are kept
from assuming a derogatory character in
so far as the government is concerned.
Sir Guy Powles: I publish a report and
I lay it on the table of the house every
year. There are substantial case notes in
that report referring to all cases. As a
matter of fact, I have a few copies here
and I would be delighted to let you have
one. I do not think it has that particular
effect on the minister's feeling with reference to his department.
Generally speaking, the minister's attitude is rather like that of the attitude of
the departmental head, and he is quite
glad to have something pointed out to
him that has gone wrong in his department so that he can fix it up. He likes to
know about these things. The worst thing
that can happen to a departmental head,
and I assume to a minister too, is to have

maladministration in his department and
not know about it.
Mr. Macdonald: Would it be correct to
say that rather than relieving the minister of any responsibility, this is really a
further fact-finding arm that is more than
ever bringing home to him that there has
been this maladministration?
Sir Guy Powles: I think so, yes, and
ministers have asked me to assist them in
certain respects in one or two cases,
which I have done.
Mr. Fisher: Have you had any cases
which have involved not an administrative but a real policy problem, cases in
which your investigation and report calls
something into question? It is hard to
think of a general example of the type of
thing of which I am thinking but I can
think of a couple of examples in the
Canadian context. I am wondering if you
have had sufficient experience as yet to
be able to say that some of the recommendations which you make might even
fit a pattern that would lead to fairly
substantial legislative changes or amendments.
Sir Guy Powles: I think that could
possibly happen. Of course, this difficult
distinction between policy and administration is one which sometimes, I am
inclined to feel, does not really exist. I
am empowered to examine matters of
administration; it does not say that I cannot examine matters of policy. There is
an element of administration presently in
a very large number of cases. It is very
seldom that one gets a case which is completely pure policy, and of course if it
was completely pure policy I could not do
it. That is one of the most difficult areas
of decision that I have to make."
Hon. Mr. Croll: I wish to thank the honourable Leader of the Government and the
honourable Leader of the Opposition for their
indulgence, but I can reassure them that I
could tire listening to my own voice.
Subsequent to the report of the committee,
the following statement appeared as an item
in the Speech from the Throne on April 5th,
1965.
My government will appoint a royal
commission to study the status, form and
procedures of adjudicative and regulatory
bodies and to investigate the desirability
of instituting a parliamentary commissioner or Ombudsman for Canada.

been followed up; however, I have in my
portfolio an impressive list of legislative precedents and common law jurisdictions following on the New Zealand precedent, although I
cannot guarantee that it is fully up to date.
My list is as follows:
1. Statutes of the Parliament of New
Zealand, 1962, No. 10: section 2 of which
reads as follows:
'2. (1) There shall be appointed, as an
officer of Parliament, a Commissioner
for Investigations to be called the
Ombudsman.
2. Statutes of Alberta, 1967, Bill 7 (now
in force) Section 3 of which reads:
'3. (1) There shall be appointed, as an
officer of the Legislature, a commissioner for investigations to be called
the Ombudsman.'
3. A White Paper presented to the
Legislature of Manitoba by the Hon.
Stuart MeLean, Provincial Secretary, in
December, 1966, which envisages the
establishment within a "Citizen's Remedies Code" a "Legislative Commissioner
for administration" with powers and
duties similar to those of an ombudsman.
4. The Ombudsman Act, chapter 18 of
the Statutes of New Brunswick, 1967.
5. Bill 13, read first time in 1968 in the
Legislative Assembly of Quebec, providing for the appointment of a Public Protector with powers and duties similar to
those of an ombudsman.
This was presented by the Government.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It is passed now.
Hon. Mr. Croll: The list continues:
6. The Parliamentary Commissioner
Act, 1967, chapter 13 of the United Kingdom Statutes of that year.
In what follows I shall assume that the
major battle has been won and that there is
now general agreement to the effect that
there exists a real need for an institution in
the nature of an ombudsman at the federal
level in this country, that existing remedies
and procedures at law are inadequate to protect fully the average citizen in his contact with
officials, and that the existence of an orderly,
simple and inexpensive machinery whereby
the citizen may have his complaint impartially processed would have the same beneficial
effects in Canada that it has elsewhere.

October 15, 1968

Professor Donald C. Rowatt, who is Chairman of the Department of Political Science at
Carleton University, and author of The Ombudsman: Citizen's Defender is, I think, one
of the best authorities on the subject that I
have yet come across. He says we do not have
to look far to find out why there is a greater
interest in the ombudsman style of institution.
We need a protection against administrative
arbitrariness in government at all levels. He
points out that the courts, the protector of
individual rights in the past, cannot properly
right the wrongs of administrative action;
they move too slowly, they are too costly, and
in this century there has been a tremendous
growth in the range and complexity of government activities. This has brought about the
need to grant the executive side of government increasing power of discretion.
In the case of Ottawa alone, there are decisions affecting citizens being made by 21 government departments and more than 40
crown corporations, as well as a number of
commissions, boards and councils. With all
the caretaking to protect the individual, there
will invariably be some decisions that are or
appear to be unjust.
We need some review tribunal to permit
Canadians to seek redress from bureaucratic
injustices. There is a distrust of bureaucratic
maze. To err is human but it is also inhuman
to become indifferent and reach a conviction
that years of experience have molded perfection. The ombudsman is far faster, less costly,
more likely to bring about corrective
legislation.
May I now ask that the statement made by
Dr. Donald C. Rowatt at page 474 of the committee report be incorporated in this record
and form part of my remarks.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
is it agreed?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
(Extract from report of Committee fohlows:)
I think there is a stronger case for a
scheme of this nature in Canada than in
some of the other democracies of the
world, because we have not done quite so
much in the way of providing remedies
for a citizen against administrative
action.
The basic reason why the scheme bas
become of great interest is that there bas
been a tremendous growth in the
administrative side of the government, in
the functions and activities, and in the
discretionary powers granted to officials,

October 15, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

while the existing remedies-in case
there is an arbitrary, unfair, or unjust
decision made against an individual by
an officer of administration-are inadequate.
I think it would be worth reviewing
this very briefly. First, in Canada you
find that administrative procedure has
not been laid down in many cases for
departments or agencies of government to
use in dealing with individual cases. On
the other hand, the United States has an
administrative procedures act which was
passed in 1946. It has been proposed in
this country by the bar association, but
not adopted in any jurisdiction. Both the
U.S. and Great Britain have had elaborate investigations of the problem by
official bodies, and Britain has set up a
council on administrative tribunals with
functions somewhat paralleling those of
an ombudsman; but in this country we
have done very little about studying the
problem.
My second point is that the appeals
available to a citizen in a case where he
believes that an arbitrary decision has
been made, or that he has a grievance
against administrative action, are very
limited. We have set up in this country a
number of specialized appeal bodies such
as the income tax appeal board, the
appeal in connection with immigration,
and so on, but there is no comprehensive
system of administrative appeal as in
many countries of western Europe, where
there is a complete and comprehensive
system of administrative courts. The
council of state in France is perhaps the
best known and the most comprehensive
of the administrative courts in western
Europe. Similarly, there is an administrative court system in Western Germany,
which has existed in Germany for many
years; its jurisdiction was extended by
the constitution of the new Western
Germany.
Coming to the English-speaking world,
perhaps we are not any worse off than
the other English-speaking countries
which have not provided for a comprehensive system of appeal against administrative decisions, but we certainly do not
have a very elaborate system in this
country.
My third point is that the opportunity
for reviewing administrative decisions by
the courts is seriously limited here as

elsewhere in the English-speaking world.
You are all familiar with the fact that
many pieces of legislation include a
privative clause stating that there shall
be no appeal to the courts, particularly
regarding decisions made by certain
types of boards or commissions. But even
where there is an opportunity for appeal,
the way in which the appeal may get
before the courts is very complicated.
This is done by ancient writs, and often
it takes a very skilled lawyer to know
which kind of writ should be used; if he
makes a mistake, the case may fail. So it
is a complicated business getting an
appeal before the courts.
Another factor is that the courts operate rather slowly; and it is likely to be
very costly in relation to the importance
of the issue or the money involved, and a
citizen would hesitate, especially in minor
cases, to appeal his case to the courts.
Another limitation is that the courts
usually have taken the view that they
will make a decision on the law only, and
an appeal on the merits of the case cannot be brought before the courts. Where
there is a discretion, the court feels that
it should not substitute its judgment for
that of the competent administrator who
is an expert in his field.
My fourth point is one with which you
are all familiar: parliament itself is the
traditional vehicle before which to bring
complaints and grievances about the
actions of administrators and the executive, yet parliament is seriously limited
in what it can do. Members of parliament
may find themselves very heavily loaded
with cases brought before them by their
constituents. I think that perhaps members of this committee would agree that
they have plenty of work to do in their
various capacities. If the number of
complaints should become overwhelming,
it tends to take their time away from
other important functions of the legislator, such as consideration of policy and
legislation, and keeping up with events
that would be necessary as background
for dealing with important proposals laid
before parliament.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Administrative difficulties
are in fact steadily mounting. We have seen
over the years the growth of increasingly
extensive, numerous, complex and sophisticated relationships between the official and
the citizen. It has been said, "You can't lick

SENATE DEBATES
city hall." It has been equally difficult for
the citizen to contend with the colossus, the
monolith, the civil service establishmentwhatever you may call it. As we all know, the
individual parliamentarian can do so much
and no more. Certainly he cannot spend all
his time acting as an ombudsman for his
constituents without being derelict in his other
parliamentary duties. Ministers of the Crown,
too, have other and paramount functions without dealing exclusively with a myriad of individual administrative complaints. In my view
the minister, the parliamentarian and the
individual citizen alike should welcome the
introduction of the ombudsman principle.
Now, what is the position of the Senate in
relation to this real and present need? In my
view the establishment of an Ombudsman
Committee of the Senate would serve the
purpose admirably. The resolution was
framed in its present form deliberately so
that only the principle of the proposal would
be under debate. If and when a committee
were to be actually appointed, its terms of
reference would have to be somewhat more
specific, although I personally would hope
that they would be as broad as possible, leaving it to the good judgment of the committee,
in the light of the numerous legislative precedents now existing, and in the light of its
own experience, to work out its own policies,
processes and procedures, at least in the initial stages.
My own thought would be that to begin
with it ought to be set up as a special committee. It would thus be in the beginning
experimental in nature. If it proved to be
successful, and I think it will be, and no
legislation creating an ombudsman is enacted,
consideration could later be given to the establishment of a standing committee on a permanent basis with permanent personnel,
functioning much as the Divorce Commissioner is now functioning.
The Senate is very fortunate to have builtin and ready-made procedures whereby a
committee might be set up to exercise all the
functions of an ombudsman, entirely in
accordance with the British tradition. It
would have full power to investigate and
interrogate officials and to report to the
Senate when necessary from time to time.
Such a committee would have at least the
prestige of, and perhaps greater prestige,
than, a parliamentary ombudsman acting
under statute.
The Senate committees have been the centre of its greatest activity and the source

October 15, 1968

from which its greatest contributions have
come. The relations of the Senate committees
with deputy ministers and other officials have
always been both close and cordial, and there
is no reason why this should change. My own
belief is that most of the injustices uncovered
by an Ombudsman Committee of the Senate
would be rectified without the necessity of a
publicized report. Certainly this has been the
experience of the Scandinavian countries and
New Zealand.
No doubt the establishment of such a committee would entail a lot of hard, responsible
work on the part of its chairman, the committee members and its staff. But senators have
been demanding, almost pleading for, more
useful work to do. And recent events have in
fact resulted in an attrition of the Senate's
functions. The passage of the new Divorce
Act will mean the phasing out of the work of
the Divorce Committee, after a hundred years
of faithful service to the country. Passage of
recent amendments to the Canada Corporations Act has practically put the Committee on
Miscellaneous Private Bills out of business. It
is true that new and important committees
have been established or are contemplated,
such as the Science Policy Committee, but
there is need for even greater activity. The
establishment of an Ombudsman Committee
would add a new dimension to the functions
of the Senate and would vastly improve its
image. It would thereby become a "public
protector" in the real sense of the term, and
thus make a significant contribution to what
has been referred to as "the just society".
May I invoke at this time perhaps the most
famous passage in Magna Carta:
To none will we sell, to none will we
deny, to none will we delay right and
justice.
Honourable senators, there is just one further context in which I wish to discuss this
matter briefly. We hear much these days of
the "right of dissent" and of "the violent society". Canada has been largely free of the
troubles which have beset our neighbours;
but we have felt the breeze and can heed its
warning. We read in the newspapers today of
student revolt taking place here and there. A
very useful advertisement appeared in the
Globe and Mail today, and I suppose in other
papers in Ontario, entitled: "A letter of concern regarding The Secondary Schools of
Ontario". I am not going to read it, but it
speaks of the responsibility of students,
teachers, and of the public. It rather infers
that students are not sent to school these days

October 15, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

to learn how to sit in or how to protest or how
to take over. It was not part of the syllabus in
my days at school.
Even in this country, which traditionally is
law-abiding, if dissent is not to burst into
violence there is a need for more adequate
safety valves, for proper channels into which
legitimate grievances may be directed. We
have not enough of these channels in this
country, and I think the establishment by the
Senate of an Ombudsman Committee at the
federal level would provide at least one additional outlet.
It may also be that the Senate, through an
Ombudsman Committee, could play a useful
role in the field of culture and linguistic
rights, particularly if a Bill of Rights, as
proposed by the Government, is written into
the Canadian Constitution. It is true that the
Senate was conceived of, at the beginning,
primarily as a place in which local interests
might be protected and sectional jealousies
prevented;- but federalism today does not
necessarily mean exactly what it meant in
1867. The Senate is ready to play its full part
in what we hope will be the revitalized
federalism of tomorrow.
I think a Senate Ombudsman Committee
would be good public relations for the Senate,
because it would establish an avenue of communication between the Senate and the people, as a public watchdog. The French use a
State Council as a review board.
I have already suggested that many are
resorting to violence these days because, we
are told, they have no peaceful or legal remedies to their grievances. But violence is not
the remedy.
The French language and culture in Canada, outside of Quebec, could well be maintained by an Ombudsman Committee, which
would have representation from all the provinces. With proper direction it could be a
source of impartial and effective review of
citizens' grievances. It could be the effective
instrumentality of constructive criticism of
existing administrative functions and actions.
It could provide an atmosphere within the
halls of Parliament where citizens could lodge
complaints without fear of retaliation or
reprisal.
I invite honourable senators to contribute
their ideas in the course of this debate and
ultimately to vote for this resolution.
On motion of Hon. Mr. McDonald (Moosomin), debate adjourned.

SUPREME COURT ACT
BILL TO AMEND-MOTION IN AMENDMENT TO
REFER BACK REPORT OF COMMITTEEDEBATE ADJOURNED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, October 10, the adjourned debate on the motion,
in amendment, of the honourable Senator
Roebuck, to the motion of the honourable
Senator Phillips (Rigaud), for the adoption of
the report of the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce on Bill S-8, to amend
the Supreme Court Act.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators,
Senator Choquette adjourned the debate at
my request, but only for the purpose of giving an opportunity to Senator Hayden to
speak. I understand that he will be here soon.
In the meantime, Senator Phillips (Rigaud) is
willing to proceed, and therefore with the
permission of honourable senators I wish to
yield to the honourable Senator Phillips
(Rigaud).
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Lazarus Phillips: Honourable senators,
I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his
courtesy in giving me this opportunity to
address you now.
I shall, in the main, speak to the remarkable and warm speech of our respected Senator Roebuck. Those of us who had the opportunity of listening to him last week were
deeply touched by his reaction to what he
clearly thought was, and probably still thinks
is, the invasion of the rights of the poor man.
In reacting very warmly, however, to this
emotional interest, I am sure the honourable
senator for whom we all have the utmost
regard, respect and affection, will expect me
to deal in some detail with the subject matter
of his observations and to see, having regard
to the fact we are dealing with a very important bill involving the Supreme Court Act,
that we relate ourselves possibly more directly and in more detail to the subject matter of
the various sections of the bill itself.
However, before doing so, may I cover one
personal point in respect of which I have a
vested interest, I think, having regard to the
fact that the honourable Senator Roebuck
referred to the Book of Proverbs. He said:
There is an old saying among English
jurists which came, not from the Proverbs but from a judgment of long ago:
"Let justice be done, though the heavens
fall."

October 15, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

It follows, therefore, that the general conception that appeals to the highest court in
the land were related in some form to the
amount of money involved is not new. It goes
back to the very inception and constitution of
the Supreme Court of Canada. It was raised
to $2,000, and then it was raised to $10,000.
My honourable friend Senator Roebuck
himself admitted, in so far as clause 2 of the
bill is concerned-and surely the honourable
senator was a member of this chamber in
1956 when the bill increasing the amount
from $2,000 to $10,000 was passed-that it
was because of oversight on the part of the
officers of the Crown that section 39, in respect of per saltum appeals, was not amended
to bring it into line with section 36. By "per
saltum appeals" I refer to appeals from a
lower court jumping the appellate court within a province and, with the consent of the
parties, being taken directly to the Supreme
Court of Canada.
What does this bill that is before us do
specifically? It does not attack the rights of
the poor. It does not create privileges for the
rich. What it does is this: it provides that in
respect of appeals to the Supreme Court of
Canada, such appeals under section 36 lie as
of right to the appellant where there is an
issue of law involved, and there is taken
away from the Supreme Court of Canada a
jurisdiction in respect of the subject matter
of cases which deal with questions of fact,
and of mixed law and fact. That is the effect
of clause 1 of the bill.
Clause 2, dealing with per saltum appeals,
merely brings the amount of $10,000 up from
$2,000 so that section 39 of the act is in line
with the amendment of 1956. I have already
indicated the chain in the conception of jurisdiction related to dollar amounts going back
to 1875, when the Supreme Court of Canada
was first constituted.
Honourable senators, I had intended to
draft something which I could incorporate in
my remarks to indicate why it is desirable to
take from the Supreme Court of Canada
this burden of dealing with questions of
fact and questions of mixed fact and law.
Those members of this house who are fellow
lawyers with me at the Bar will, I think,
without hesitation confirm my observation
that in the overwhelming number of cases,
appellate courts are loath to interfere with
the trial judge's appraisal of the value of
evidence given by witnesses. The tendency all
through my lifetime as practitioner at the
Bar-which, alas, is close to half a centuryhas been for appellate courts to say that the

trial judge, having seen how the witnesses
behave in the box under examination and
cross-examination, is in the best position of
any to judge credibility. When an issue is
brought before an appellate court that is
wholly one of fact, or even one of mixed fact
and law but where the law depends upon the
credibility of the evidence and an appraisal of
the facts, the appellate court will almost invariably say: "We will not interfere with the
views of the trial judge, and his appraisal of
the credibility of the evidence."
I suggest, honourable senators, that if you
are trying to protect the interests of the litigants and trying to avoid increasing the
chasm between the rich and the poor when
dealing with the highest court of the land, we
should take away from the highest court the
jurisdiction to deal with questions of fact,
because in practice they are loath so to do.
What happens in cases which go up to the
Supreme Court on questions of fact is that the
litigants get poorer and the lawyers get richer, and I am sure that Senator Roebuck did
not have that in mind when he dealt with his
concern for the poor.
What is the responsibility of the Supreme
Court of Canada and what should it be? Here
I should like to repeat something and read it
into the record as constituting a wonderful
statement on the duty of the highest court,
which one would expect from the eminence
and legal attainments of Senator Roebuck.
Some of my listeners may not have read the
speech, some of you may not have listened to
the speech. Listen, honourable senators, to
this remarkable and concise statement of what
the Supreme Court should be:
In my judgment, this court has a very
great role to play in the business activities of our nation, in the lives of our people, in the development of a jurisprudence that applies in all Canada: first in
order that the law may be more just, and
secondly that it may be as uniform as
possible in all our provinces, which is
very important. There are ten provinces
in Canada with ten sets of trial courts
and ten courts of appeal. Sometimes the
judgments of these courts conflict with
one another. It is most important that we
have a Supreme Court whose judgment is
superior to all others, and, in consequence, a uniformity of law results.
Not a word about appraisal of evidence, not
a word about authority and the desirability of
jurisdiction being given to Supreme Court
judges to set aside findings of facts of judges

SENATE DEBATES
in the lower courts, but a paean of praise to
the Supreme Court that it should become the
highest court in the land in order that we get
a set of uniform laws for the whole of Canada. He continues:
The desirability of a uniformity of law
is indicated in the British North America Act in which there is a section designed to assist in that regard.
I therefore submit that surely in relation to
section 36 and section 39 the issue is not the
convenience of the court, which has been suggested, and therefore on that basis let us have
more judges. The issue is to modernize the
law having regard to the development that
has taken place, as I said in my initial
speech, in this great country of ours so that
we do not burden the highest court of the
land with absurd questions of fact on whether
an automobile driven by "A" was going at
60.8 miles per hour or whether an automobile
driven by "B" was going at 60.9 miles per
hour.
The whole idea is to do what my learned
friend Senator Robuck says, to give this
court consisting of nine of our greatest jurists
the right, opportunity, facilities and time as
questions of law come before it under section
36, if this amendment goes through, and
under section 39, the per saltum section, so
that they can deal with the very questions
that are necessary in order to expose the law,
to analyze the law and bring about a uniformity, so that the law-abiding citizens of
this country can guide themselves as individuals and as corporate structures. So much
for sections 36 and 39.
Then we come to what the senator regarded, possibly with the exception of the habeas
corpus item to which I will come, as the item
which seemed to be disturbing him the most,
namely that which now calls for the application to be heard before three judges rather
than, as in previous instances, before one
judge in some cases. In dealing with that
subject the honourable senator said:
If I am right, we were permitted to
apply rather informally to a single judge
of the Supreme Court of Canada. I have
been present on such an application. Such
an application must under this bill now
be made to three judges which involves,
of course, more formality, and with formality there is usually increased expense.
I have read and re-read this paragraph and
I find it difficult, with the utmost affection for
my learned colleague, to determine how it

October 15, 1968

becomes more expensive, once you have to
come up to Ottawa and are making an
application for leave under section 41 of the
act, bec'ause the application is made before
three judges rather than before one judge. In
my humble opinion, the introduction of the
concept of three judges to listen to an
application for appeal under section 41 helps
the poor man rather than the lawyer who
submits the application on the part of the
poor man.
The honourable senator has referred to the
fact that in the Supreme Court of Canada the
exhibits must be printed, and also that the
factum in the case may be printed. I do not
wish to burden the house on this point, but I
would ask the honourable Senator Roebuck to
be good enough to check with the rules of the
Supreme Court, where he will find that
Xeroxing and copying is allowed, and that it
is not necessary to print, as he indicated in
his speech. This is simply part of the idea of
progress which may have escaped the attention of the honourable senator. That, however, is only incidental, and is not a material
point.
The real issue is when you come up under
section 41-and again I remind honourable
senators that here is a poor man who as of
right comes to the Supreme Court of Canada
and says that he wants justice to be done,
that he wants to be heard-and the amount
involved does not exceed the $10,000 under
section 36, and is not in excess of $10,000 in
the per saltum under section 39, then subject
to the decision of three judges this poor applicant will have his case heard before a full
court.
Honourable senators in this chamber who
practise law will agree with me, I think, that
they would rather have three judges to determine if there is a strong enough case for
this poor man to warrant his going to the
expense of continuing to employ counsel to
bring that case to the Supreme Court of
Canada with all the attendant expense
involved. The mere fact that an appellant
who is poor can appear before one judge and
get the right to go to the Supreme Court of
Canada may be anti-social and may be contrary to the interest of the applicantHon. Mr. Choquette: And his refusal as
such, as in the Coffin case where one judge
alone refused leave to go to the Supreme
Court of Canada, and the whole cabinet had
to intervene.

October 15, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Mr. Phillips (Rigaud): Exactly. At
least when you go before three judges and
when this poor applicant is given the right to
go to the Supreme Court of Canada, there is a
reasonable prima facie case that justifies his
lawyer in taking that case from the appeal
court to the Supreme Court of Canada.
Therefore, I submit that clause 3, which is
amending section 44A of our Supreme Court
Act, is a poor man's amendment and not a
rich man's amendment, in the sense that he
has a reasonable assurance, after three judges
listened to his application, that he has some
sort of a case which justifies a full court to
hear it.

again, of the right to go to the Supreme Court
of Canada in matters involving sums of less

Hon. Mr. Martin: Does the honourable

for by section 41, subsection (3)?

Hon. Mr. Phillips (Rigaud): My learned

was previously overlooking the wording of

SENATE DEBATES
Under sections 38 and 41 of the law, in
amounts involving less than a sum in excess
of $10,000, we have still the jurisdiction of
our provincial courts and our Supreme Court
to see that appeals are heard by the Supreme
Court.
Honourable senators, in my opinion, this
should conclusively dispose of the objections
which have been raised to clauses 1, 2 and 3
of the bill.
I turn now to a section which, as I think I
said in the introduction of the bill, might give
some concern, where one's first reaction
would be: Let us take a good look at this one
because we are dealing with an historic right
of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum. I agree
with honourable senators that we should deal
carefully with a section of this kind.
Honourable Senator Roebuck made this
statement at page 260 of Senate Hansard,
October 10, 1968:
So important has it been considered in
the past, and in this very chamber, that
we have kept it in effect. It is the rule
that one may shop about from judge to
judge, and that if any judge, no matter
what a previous judge may have said, is
of opinion that there is doubt as to the
an

or detention
imprisonment
individual by some other person, that
judge may issue a writ that requires the
jailer, shall I call him, to appear in court
and explain his actions and justify the
imprisonment. Now, who could argue
against that?
The answer to this position is simple. The
argument against it is the law of the landthe amendments that have been made to the
Criminal Code on this whole question of how
to deal with the subject matter of habeas
corpus, the Criminal Code being under the
jurisdiction of this Parliament and the amendments having been made in this Parliament
obviously with the approval of this august
chamber.
Section 691 of the Criminal Code was
amended in the Statutes of Canada, 1964-1965,
chapter 53, section 1, and it provides for an
appeal to the provincial courts of appeal as of
right from the refusal of an application for a
writ of habecs corpus ad subjiciendum.
Where in such an appeal the application is
refused, a further appeal lies, again as of
right, to the Supreme Court of Canada.
The amendment also provides that when
the application for a writ is granted there
shall be an appeal as of right to the provincial court of appeal from the judgment issued

October 15. 1968

on the return of the writ with further appeal
to the Supreme Court of Canada with leave of
that court. The Supreme Court now having
jurisdiction to hear appeals in habeas corpus
in criminal matters from provincial courts, it
is considered that section 57 has been rendered superfluous. In fact, it is anomalous
that the court should have both an appellate
and an original jurisdiction in relationship to
the same subject matter.
What does section 691 of the Criminal
Code, which I have summarized, say in actual
words? I think it should be read into the
record, because after I read it into the record
you will see that in the rest of Canada an
applicant will not have the right to shop from
judge to judge in order to get a writ; but the
suggestion is made that the right of merchandising or shopping be still available in
appearing before judges of the Supreme
Court of Canada. That is what we are saying.
Judges of the lower courts, in dealing with
this matter, are not subjected to this "shopping" activity. If one judge says no, then you
cannot go to another judge. But when it
comes to the nine judges of the Supreme
Court of Canada the suggestion is that these
nine judges should be subjected to the "shopping" operations of a practising lawyer in
order to obtain the writ.
I read into the record section 691 of the
Criminal Code as amended in 1965:
1. (3) Where an application for a writ
of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum is
refused by a judge of a court having
jurisdiction therein, no application may
again be made on the same grounds
whether to the same or to another court
or judge, unless fresh evidence is
adduced, but an appeal from such refusal
shall lie to the Court of Appeal, and
where on such appeal the application is
refused a further appeal shall lie to the
Supreme Court of Canada.
Parliament of Canada in its wisdom and
under the jurisdiction vested in it, in dealing
with the Criminal Code-one of the most
important pieces of jurisdiction that it
enjoys-passed this amendment and, in passing it, the wisdom of Parliament concluded,
presumably in both houses, that the rights of
the subject were amply protected and that
there was no danger that the historic rights of
Magna Charta going back to medieval times
would be affected in any way.
We are now being asked to question the
judgment of the Parliament of Canada as it

October 15, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

sat in the year 1965, at which time, presumably after careful consideration of the entire
matter, it was felt that the rights of the subject in Canada were properly protected by
giving him the right to proceed as provided
under section 691, inclusive of an ultimate
right of appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada. All we are doing is simply taking away the concurrent jurisdiction of the
nine judges of the Supreme Court of Canada,
first, because it is absurd to take away the
right to shop, to visit all the judges from
coast to coast in Canada but still subject the
nine judges of our Supreme Court to this
procedure, and secondly, because it is clearly
anomalous-I should like to use the word
absurd-for practising lawyers to have a high
court of the land, our highest court, both the
highest appellate court and still a court of
original jurisdiction in respect of the same
subject matter.
I think honourable colleagues who practise
law will agree with me in this observation.
Honorable senators, I yield to no one in my
respect, affection and regard for Senator
Roebuck. I am only sorry that the fates did
not bring me here sooner so that I could have
had the advantage of his friendship and guidance in many matters through the years. I am
a newcomer to these parts. If I have been
unduly emphatic in some of my observations,
they have been merely due to my desire to
discharge my duties as I see them in explaining this bill, and I certainly do hope that I
have not offended in any way a gentleman for
whom I have the profoundest regards.

involved here is a great principle, taking
away from the ordinary man something
which he now has. I think those who are
proposing this amendment are looking at it
from a different point of view to that of Senator Roebuck and myself. They are looking at
it from the point of view of the Supreme
Court of Canada whereas we are looking at it
from the point of view of the ordinary man
and woman in Canada.
Some suggestion was made that the process
of appealing to the court should be streamlined so as to do away with what might be
considered absurd cases. Although I do not
know how many trivial matters were brought
before the Supreme Court of Canada since
1956, I would like to say that I believe it is
better that that court deal with some cases
which might be called trivial or absurd rather
than allow an injustice to be done to any
person who lives in Canada. I would further
state that I have no time for this idea of
having to go before the Supreme Court or a
provincial court for leave to appeal. I believe
anyone who lives in Canada should have the
right to go before the Supreme Court of
Canada if he pleases and if he believes that
an injustice has been done him. It should be
his right as a citizen of this country. He
should not have to ask for leave to appeal, to
go on bended knees to anyone. Certainly we
are taking something away by these amendments, and I say that this is wrong. It has
been stated that the Supreme Court of Canada should not have jurisdiction over habeas
corpus cases. I completely disagree with this,
for again we are taking something away

CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAY BILL
CONSTRUCTION OF LINE OF RAILWAY NEAR
WINDFALL, ALBERTA, AND OF A CONNECTING SPUR-SECOND READING

Hon. Maurice Bourget moved the second
reading of Bill C-109, respecting the construction of a line of railway in the Province of
Alberta by Canadian National Railway Company from the vicinity of Windfall on the
Windfall Extension to the Sangudo Subdivision of the Canadian National Railway in a
westerly direction for a distance of approximately 51 miles to the Bigstone property of
Pan American Petroleum Corporation and of
a connecting spur extending in a northerly
direction for a distance of approximately 9
miles to the South Kaybob property of Hudson's Bay Oil & Gas Company Limited and its
associates.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of Bill C-109 is to permit the Canadian
National Railway to build approximately 60
miles of new branch line trackage to serve
the requirements of two new sulphur recovery plants which have been built or are being
built in the Windfall gas fields in Alberta.
This trackage will consist of a branch line
about 51 miles in length extending westerly
from a point on the existing Canadian National line near Windfall to the Bigstone property
of the Pan American Petroleum Corporation,
and also a spur about nine miles long extending northerly from that line to the South

SENATE DEBATES
Kaybob property of a syndicate headed by
Hudson's Bay Oil & Gas Company Limited.
These two properties represent important new
industrial developments and new sources of
sulphur and liquid petroleum gas, and can be
looked to for substantial contributions to the
economie activity of that particular region as
well as to Canada's export trade.
The Bigstone plant is already in production, and the construction of the South Kaybob plant is well advanced, completion being
scheduled for November of this year. The
need for the services which the new line will
provide is therefore pressing.
The cost of the new line including the crossing of the Athabasca River is estimated at
$10,435,000, averaging about $174,000 per mile.
In accordance with the usual practice, this
bill authorizes the expenditure of that sum,
and allows for an additional 15 per cent, if
required, to cover contingencies. The usual
borrowing powers are also included.
I am informed by the management of the
Canadian National Railways that the traffic
agreements negotiated between that company
and the Pan American Petroleum Corporation
and Hudson's Bay Oil & Gas Company Limited guarantee annual shipments over the new
C.N.R. line of 75 per cent of all production of
sulphur and liquid petroleum gas at both
plants, with a minimum of 223,000 long tons
of sulphur. If the companies fail to meet the
minimum annual guarantee, they are subject
to a penalty in respect of any tonnage which
falls short of the minimum annual guarantee.
Officials of Canadian National Railways
have confirmed that gross railway earnings
generated by the operations of these two sulphur recovery plants will meet all expenses
of operation and maintenance of the branch
line, and the cost of transporting the industry's traffic on other lines of the Canadian
National system plus interest and amortization of the cost of the branch line, and will
produce also a satisfactory surplus for the
railway. The new trackage will also stimulate
interest and activity in the development of
other resources in the area, including similar
mineral prospects and the extensive timber
resources of the Whitecourt Forest District
through which the new line will pass.
I am told also that a second sulphur recovery plant at South Kaybob is already under
construction and that there is a strong likelihood that another such plant will shortly be
developed along the route traversed by the
new line.

October 15, 1968

I am sure all honourable senators are
satisfied that the economics and other justifications for the project contemplated by
this bill are sound, and that the construction
of this line is clearly in the interests of the
railway and also of the taxpayers of Canada.
I do not think it is necessary to explain all
the clauses contained in this bill because
except for the necessary changes pertaining
to geographic
location and the dollar
amounts, the form and provisions of the bill
are in all other respects similar to legislation
which has been passed by this house from
time to time authorizing the construction of
C.N.R. branch lines.
In closing I may add that this bill has
received the unanimous support of all parties
in the other place, and I do recommend it to
this house.
Hon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson: Honourable
senators, I think we could all agree that some
of the most interesting bills to come before
the Senate in recent years were those relating
to the building of railways. I refer particularly to the building of railways in the northwestern part of Canada. I think we all know
that bills providing for the building of railways have traditionally been an important
function of the Parliament of this country.
We may also recall that some years ago the
Senate was not in agreement with the other
place in regard to many railway-building
projects that were then about to be undertaken subject, of course, to the concurrence of
this house. I think, too, it is historically accurate to say that the Senate saved Canada
many millions of dollars by refusing certain
railway developments which subsequent years
proved would have been very unwise investments for Canada.
However, there is a new surge of prosperity and development in the northern part of
Canada, particularly the northwest. This was
brought forcefully to our attention a few
years ago when Parliament dealt with the
construction of the Pine Point Railway, running from a point in Alberta to the Pine
Point mineral development in the Northwest
Territories. I think it is a fact that that railway has been very successful both operationally and financially. It was essential for the
development of that part of Canada, and time
has proven that fact.
I think the same thing can be said for the
construction contemplated in this bill. Just
this morning I was reading in the Financial
Post a report of the fantastic development in
oil and its by-products that is taking place in

SENATE DEBATES

October 15, 1968

the northwest of Canada, and indeed in the
ocean north of us. The building of this railway is for the purpose of making possible
this great development which is indeed only
in its first stages at the present time.
I am sure we will be most interested to
hear in committee what the officials of the
railway have to say about this construction.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

THE EXCELSIOR LIFE INSURANCE
SECOND READING

COMPANY-

far back as 1897, and is one of the dozen or
so major life insurance companies.
Not only is it under the jurisdiction of the
Province of Ontario by reason of its incorporation, but it has also been registered for a
number of years under the Canadian and British Insurance Companies Act and, as such, it
is subject to the jurisdiction of both Departments of Insurance. Over the years this double jurisdiction has created some difficultieseven, one might say, some hardships.
Without going into them in detail, there
are differences with respect to the investment
powers of the company. The company must
comply with the provisions of both jurisdictions. It is subject, of course, to the supervision and inspection of both jurisdictions. It
must make and file returns with both jurisdictions. Probably most important of all is the
fact that it being a reasonable size of company, doing business throughout Canada and
outside of Canada, it is convinced that it
would be better for it to be federally incorporated and come under federal jurisdiction.
This decision on its part met with the approval of the Ontario Department of Insurance,
which department agreed to this application
for an act of incorporation; and, in fact, the
Ontario Legislature in 1966 passed the enabling act that enables this company to become
a federally incorporated company, and that
legislation comes into effect if and when the
federal Parliament passes this bill.
The effect of the bill is really to convert the
company from its provincially incorporated
status into a federally incorporated one.
This bill has not passed the House of Commons because of objections raised by some
private members, I think in line with objections they have raised to some other bills.
The fact that the Excelsior Life Insurance
Company is an affiliate of a foreign company-it is an affiliate of the Aetna Life Insurance Company in the United States-has
caused the objection to be raised that the
Aetna should dispose of its interest in the
Excelsior Life Insurance Company within a
period of five years.

Hon. T. D'Arcy Leonard moved the second
reading of Bill S-13, respecting The Excelsior
Life Insurance Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this is the
third time that the principle and the substance
of this bill have been before this chamber. In
1966 a bill in identical wording received first
and second readings, and was sent to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce where witnesses were heard. Subsequently the bill was reported back to this
chamber, received third reading and was sent
to the House of Commons. It had not been
passed by that chamber before prorogation.
Incidentally, prior to coming before the Senate
in 1966 the bill had been approved, as to its
wording and terms, by the Superintendent of
Insurance and the Department of Justice.
The bill was reintroduced in 1967. Again, it
received second reading. Without having
checked the record, my recollection is that
the suggestion came from the floor of the
Senate that it was not necessary for the bill
to be referred to committee, in view of the
fact that the evidence had been heard and the
bill explained the year before. Again, it
passed the Senate and was sent to the House
of Commons, where, again, it did not receive
third reading.

Senator Thorvaldson would like to have. The

of the other place. I think honourable senators
are aware that those who have raised that
objection are not large in number.
The only submission I wish to make to this
chamber is that if this kind of change were to
be made, it is the kind of change that should
apply to all companies and should not be a
discriminatory one used against this particular life insurance company. That is to say,
there is a number of other Canadian companies which are controlled outside of Canada,
and if there is to be any legislation with
respect to foreign control of life insurance
companies, it should be by amendment to the
general act and not by taking this particular
company, for example, and making such an
amendment.
As I say, this is the principle and substance
of the bill, one which comes before us for the
third time.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: In identical terrns?
Hon. Mr. Leonard: Yes, in identical terms.
On the first occasion it was referred to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce. On the second occasion the Senate
itself saw fit-and this is, again, my recollection-to dispense with referring it to committee. And on this occasion, the third time, I
am in the hands of the Senate. If honourable
senators feel they would like to hear the witnesses again, they will no doubt come from
Toronto and give whatever evidence the committee would like to hear. I do suggest, of
course, that the real gist of the objection
raised in the other place is the kind of thing
that should be dealt with in the other place
rather than here.

Hon. Mr. Leonard: That is possible. If this
is the kind of thinking of any one senator,
that is sufficient answer for me. I have no
desire whatsoever to push it forward or to
rush it. If honourable senators feel they
would like the bill to be referred once more
to committee, then, after second reading, I
will so move.

Hon. Mr. Croll: No, I am not asking for it
to be referred to committee; I am perfectly
satisfied. I am suggesting it might be to their
advantage to have them appear before the
committee and there say something to offset
the arguments being used against them. If
that helps you, fine.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I suggest it would be more
helpful to have that occur in the committee of
the other place.

SENATE DEBATES

PRIVATE BILLS
THE EXCELSIOR LIFE INSURANCE COMPANYTHIRD READING
Hon. T. D'Arcy Leonard moved the third
reading of Bill S-13, respecting The Excelsior
Life Insurance Company.
He said: Before the motion is put I think I
owe it to the Senate to correct a statement
that I made yesterday. In the unrevised print
of Hansard, page 284, when referring to the
history of this bill, I mentioned that on the
first occasion it was referred by the Senate to
the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce. I go on to say, "On a second
occasion the Senate itself saw fit-and this is,
again, my recollection-to dispense with referring it to committee."
I was wrong in my recollection. The Senate
did refer it to the Banking and Commerce
Committee for a second time, and that committee again approved it in the form in which
it had reached the committee and had gone
through the Senate. Now, I do not think that
in giving me leave to proceed with the third
reading without going back to committee
again this statement was of any great importance to the members of the Senate; nevertheless, my recollection was wrong and I
wanted to bring this to the attention of the
Senate.
Actually, when it went before the committee last year the proceedings took only a few
minutes. Mr. Humphrys was the only witness
called, and he explained the bill as he had
the year before. The president of the company and their counsel were here from Toronto,
but the committee did not ask them to give
any further evidence. While proceedings last
year were not a precedent for dispensing with
the committee stage this year, there are other
precedents with which I confused this particular case. If any of the members of the
Senate feel that because it went to committee
in two consecutive years it should go again, I
am in the hands of the Senate. However, I do
.uggest that it having gone through the committee twice is really another argument in
favour of not sending it to committee this
year.
In addition to that point there were some
questions asked of me yesterday, which I
answered. I think I can amplify those
answers.
Senator Thorvaldson asked me the extent
of control held by the Aetna Life Insurance
Company over the Excelsior Life Insurance
Company. I knew there was control, but I did
not know the extent of it. However, upon
checking back, I have discovered that Aetna
29234-19

Life Insurance Company holds 70 per cent of
Excelsior.
Senator Flynn asked whether the sponsor
could tell us if anything had happened since
the bill was examined previously in committee which could alter the judgment of this
committee. My answer was that I knew of no
change. However, in this case I also checked
with Mr. Humphrys, Superintendent of Insurance, and asked if he knew of any changt
since last year which would affect the situation. He said he knew of no change that
would in his opinion affect the opinion of the
committee. I also checked with counsel for
the insurance company, with the same result.
Senator Grosart asked if the bill passed and
became a matter of federal jurisdiction,
would any form of licensing by the provinces
be required by the company to operate. My
reply was that in my opinion the answer was
no. I also inquired about this, and Mr.
Humphrys informed me that the provinces do
in fact have legislation and assert the jurisdiction to require federally incorporated insurance companies to take out licences in the
province in order to do business there. Now,
whatever constitutional question may be in
dispute on that, the fact is that the companies
are required by provincial legislation to take
out licences and in fact they do so.
If those explanations are satisfactory, I will
proceed with the motion for third reading.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I am a
little concerned about the regularity of proceeding in this fashion with private bills. I
wonder whether the sponsor has considered
Rule 117, which reads:
Every Private Bill, after its second
reading, is referred to one of the Standing Committees on Private Bills.
However, if the motion has been put to dispense with the application of that rule, the
situation is clear.
Hon. Mr. Leonard: The answer is "yes". In
raising this question before the Senate yesterday, I called attention to Rule 117 and
advised the Senate that we would have to
dispense with that rule, and the Senate
agreed.
Motion agreed to and bill read third time
and passed.

SUPREME COURT ACT
BILL TO AMEND-MOTION IN AMENDMENT TO
REFER BACK REPORT OF COMMITTEE
NEGATIVED-REPORT ADOPTED
The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion, in amendment, of the honourable Senator Roebuck, to
the motion of the honourable Senator Phillips
(Rigaud), for the adoption of the report of the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce on Bill S-8, to amend the Supreme
Court Act.
Hon. Saller A. Hayden: Honourable senators, first I wish to commend the honourable
Senator from Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Phillips)
for the very clear and concise statement
he made yesterday in his reference to and
description of the scope and effect of the pertinent sections in this bill which seemed to
raise difficulties so far as some honourable
senators were concerned.
As a matter of fact, after having heard a
portion of his remarks and having read the
rest, my first reaction was to feel that the
matter had been so amply covered that it

would be unnecessary to add anything.
However-then perhaps I made a fatal mistake-I went back and read again what Senator Roebuck has said on three occasions, I
think it is, during the consideration of this
bill, and also the remarks of Senator Prowse

and Senator John Macdonald. After having
reflected on those remarks, I felt there were
some things I should say today, and I will
come to them in a moment.

May I first refer, in a summary and preliminary way, to the scope and effect, as I see
it, of three pertinent provisions in our
Supreme Court Act and in the bill before us.
In section 36 of the act which this bill
proposes to amend, there is a provision for an

appeal as of right to the Supreme Court of
Canada from the final judgment of the highest provincial court in any matter where the
value of the judgment in question exceeds
$10,0C0. The amendment proposed in this bill
would also add the condition that the right to

appeal, even if that dollar amount is satisfied,
rests only as to a question of law.
Then we come to section 38 of the act,
which provides the widest discretionary

power in the court of last resort in the province to grant leave to appeal from a final
judgment to the Supreme Court of Canada in

October 16, 1968

any matter-regardless of the dollar amount,
regardless of whether it is a question of law
or a question of fact, or a question of mixed
law and fact. The only point the Court of
Appeal in the province must be satisfied on is
that the question involved in the appeal is
one that ought to be submitted to the
Supreme Court of Canada for decision.
Then, with that very wide discretionary
power, by leave, for getting a final judgment
in a province before the Supreme Court of
Canada, we also have section 41 of the
Supreme Court Act. It provides that, with
leave of the Supreme Court of Canada, an
appeal lies from the final judgment of the
highest court in the province, and that leave
may be granted, whether or not it bas been
refused by the court of last resort in the

province. You will notice it is very wide in its
scope-as wide as it possibly could be. There
are no limiting factors, except the discretion
of the Supreme Court of Canada as to whether or not it will grant leave to appeal. There
are no guidelines by way of having to meet a
certain dollar amount or that it must be a
question of law. There is the widest possible
basis upon which leave to appeal can be
granted.
As far as I have been concerned-if I may
make a personal reference-in the many
years when I seemed to do nothing but litigation, leave to appeal was not regarded as
being derogatory, or as lessening the scope of
the individual, or tending to defeat the purpose he was seeking to achieve. It was something which the law of the land, or the rules
based on the law of the land, required. Therefore, you either fitted into them or you did
not. If you did fit into them, you got leave; if
you did not fit into them, you did not get
leave.
Having outlined that as the basis for what
we are now called upon to look at, and to
send back to the committee for reconsideration, I would point out that it is suggested
that by providing a dollar amount-that is,
that there must be a judgment in controversy
which exceeds $10,000 in amount before you
have a right of appeal-we are changing the
purpose of the Supreme Court of Canada.
Indeed, the proponents of this must say not
that we are changing, but that already the
operation and purpose of the Supreme Court
of Canada has been changed because this
$10,000 condition was established in 1956.
In that connection let me say that there
was a very considerable debate in the House
of Commons, as can be discovered by reference to Hansard of that time, and these ques-

October 16, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

tions that are now being put forward as to
the possible effect of the $10,000 condition
were all discussed then. The amendment
came to this house from the other place on
August 8, 1956. I mention that date so that
my friends will have a ready reference to the
Debates of the Senate.
The then Leader of the Government in the
Senate introduced the bill on first reading,
and on second reading gave an explanation of
its purpose. Several senators spoke in the
debate, one of them being Senator Croll and
another being myself. The speeches that were
made at that time did not refer at all to the
$10,000 condition. They referred only to some
other aspect, namely, that there should have
been something in the bill under which a
person who had been convicted and sentenced
to death-in other words, in capital casescould have an appeal as of right ·to the
Supreme Court of Canada from the court of
last resort in a province. This is the point
that Senator Croll raised and stressed. I think
it was still fresh in his mind because there
was at that time a joint committee of both
bouses that had been sitting for several years
studying a list of subjects which included
capital punishment, corporal punishment and
lotteries. What a combination of things to put
together! I think the reporters of those days
referred to that committee as the committee
on trap, strap and crap. This is what Senator
Croll spoke about. Yet, the $10,000 condition
was staring us right in the face.
I went to the trouble of checking Hansard,
and I discovered that Senator Roebuck was in
the house, but the $10,000 condition at that
stage did not disturb him. I suggest for his
consideration that if it did not disturb him at
that time, and the Supreme Court of Canada
has operated under that condition from 1956
to date with no apparent derogation of the
rights of ordinary people to which he
referred, then it may well be that this is a
good working rule, and one that is not interfering with the rights of any person who
thinks he bas a matter that should be taken
as far as the Supreme Court of Canada.
Such a person has a right to go to the
Supreme Court of Canada, because if he is
blocked on the question of the amount of
money involved in the judgment, and is
blocked on a question of law, he still has a
choice as between the highest court in a province and the Supreme Court of Canada itself
in respect of any reasonable ground that be
can put forward as a basis for getting leave
to appeal.
29234-19j

I am told that the number of applications
for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada is increasing annually, and that about
20 per cent of the total applications-and in
1962 there were over a hundred-would be on
the basis of the dollar amount of the judgment in controversy, and possibly 20 per cent
of those applications for leave to appeal
would be granted. I cite these figures to show
that this sudden tempest that bas blown up
here-and which has provoked such comments as: "We have a rich man's court", "We
should give the Supreme Court back to the
people", "Everybody in Canada who feels
himself aggrieved should have a well-defined
and clear-cut path, with no obstacles whatsoever, to the Supreme Court of Canada", and
"The character of the Supreme Court of
Canada in being a court for the poor man or
the ordinary citizen bas been taken away"-is
really a tempest over nothing. I say in all
sincerity that if you study the performance of
the Supreme Court of Canada since the limiting condition of $10,000 was established about
thirteen years ago you cannot find support for
that statement.
In addition, I say to you with all the sincerity I can command that the Supreme Court
of Canada is not a poor man's court. Likewise, the Supreme Court of Canada is not a
rich man's court. The Supreme Court of
Canada is not an ordinary man's court. The
Supreme Court of Canada, under the structural setup and constitution of the Government of Canada, is the court of last resort
where there is a final opportunity for litigants
to have their rights determined, and the
procedures for getting to that court are
provided.
You may say: "Litigants should be able ta
get to the last court just as easily and just as
quickly as they can get to the first court".
Now, let us take a look at that statement. A
litigant who feels he is aggrieved by something-he may have a damage claim, or a
breach of contract claim-can start his action
in, for instance, the Supreme Court of
Ontario. If the jurisdiction of the court is such
as to allow it, and his claim is such that he
can fit into that court, he can start his action,
and have a trial in the trial division of the
Supreme Court of Ontario. The judge at that
trial sees the witnesses; he hears the evidence; he assesses the facts; he studies the
credibility of the witnesses who are giving
evidence; and then be writes a judgment
either for or against the person who is
instituting the action. The litigant who has
failed to obtain a favourable judgment at the

SENATE DEBATES

trial may then appeal to the Court of Appeal
for the Province of Ontario, and I have no
doubt that there are similar procedures in all
the other provinces of Canada.
That litigant then has another chance, but
on this occasion he is limited to the evidence
that was presented at the original trial. In the
Court of Appeal he has the opportunity
before three or five judges, depending upon
the assessment by the court of the importance
of the principles involved, to argue his case
based upon the evidence, and that court may
deal with matters of law or of fact or matters of mixed law and fact, and deliver a
judgment.
At that stage the litigant who felt himself
aggrieved originally has had two opportunities to present every fact that he possibly
could present in his favour before either four
or six judges in two different courts. If he
wants to go further, then I think it is reasonable that there should be a differentiation
between those things that are meritorious and
those that are not. It has always been my
opinion that a question of law is a meritorious ground for appeal, but as to questions of
fact there may be situations and circumstances where there could be a fairer assessment, than the determination first made, and
if so established, leave to appeal is granted.
Once the judge in the trial court, who has
had the benefit of observing the witnesses
and knowing how they presented their evidence, says that on the basis of the conduct
of one witness in the box, and on the way in
which he answered questions, I find him to
be not a credible witness and, therefore, I
prefer the testimony of another witness, then
you have a finding of the trial judge. Once
you get that kind of a finding in the trial
division, then I have to say to you I do not
know of any case in which an appellant has
been able to upset such a judgment which
turned in any way upon credibility of witnesses and the refusal of the trial judge to
accept the evidence of one or two of the
witnesses, even though that evidence might
have supported the case for the appellant.
In those circumstances I say it is fair and
reasonable that there should be some limit on
these adventures in law, although, speaking
as a lawyer, I think it is always very interesting and reasonably remunerative to find quite
large numbers of people possessed of litigious
instincts. With no further serious meritorious
foundation than to give a man an appeal as of
right solely on a question of fact where both
courts before that in arriving at their judg-

October 16, 1968

ments have found against the litigant on the
basis of the facts, would be unjustified, and
the most you could expect in those circumstances would be that he would have to get
leave to appeal. Certainly, be is not circumscribed by the court of appeal of the province, if it found that the question involved in
the case was one that ought to have judgment
passed on it by the Supreme Court of Canada.
The Supreme Court of Canada can offer any
number of reasons, or simply grant leave
without giving any reasons, and the number
of cases in which they grant leave which have
no relationship to the dollar amount of the
judgment in controversy very substantially
outweigh the number which are tied to the
dollar amount in controversy.
That covers one phase. As to the other
phase, what bothers me is the assumption
made by these three senators that it is only
the rich man who gets a judgment in excess
of $10,000 and only the poor man who gets
a judgment of under $10,000. That has not
been my experience, and it is certainly a
fallacy to assume that because the judgment is in excess of $10,000 the man who
got it is a rich man, and that the man
who got a judgment of less than $10,000 is a
poor man. It is like trying to string apples
and bananas together, to say that because I
got a judgment in excess of $10,000 I am a
rich man.
We know the difference in purchasing
power of the dollar today and the attitude of
juries in damage actions when trying to
assess damages, whether there is a temporary
impairment of earning capacity or a permanent impairment. They make their assessments of the amount the man is entitled to in
compensation for damages of that nature, and
of necessity their calculation of those damages is on a higher basis today than it was 20
years ago because of the increased cost of
living, the increase in earnings, and so that
people will have the purchasing power necessary to be able to live.
Today it cannot be said that a judgment in
excess of $10,000 is a rich man's judgment. It
may well be that the rich man gets the smaller judgment, while the person in ordinary
circumstances who has suffered real injury,
who has made quite an appeal to the jury,
being dependent on his own mental and
physical ability to earn his living, stirs the
sympathy of the jury-I do not say unjustifiably so, but there would be that tendencyand that loss of earning power is replaced
perhaps more generously by some money
equivalent.

October 16, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Having taken that position about these
remarks to which I referred earlier, I should
like to add that I do not say they were
intended to, but they have the effect of
dramatizing in a very grossly distorted way
the picture of the poor man's court and the
rich man's court, so that you have the poor
man in his rags knocking on the door of the
Supreme Court of Canada and being refused
admittance, while the rich man bas the door
opened for him before he reaches the
entrance and is welcomed and greeted favourably, all because he had a judgment in
excess of $10,000 and the other was not fortunate enough to have one that high. This is
basically a wrong approach in considering
this question.
The question must be considered from the
point of view that we have a system of law,
that everyone is equal under the law and
everyone has the same rights under the law.
In the legislation we are now considering
everyone has the same right; one is an absolute right of appeal and the other is a right of
appeal with leave, for whatever ground he
can urge, and if it is not meritorious he
should not be granted leave, in my opinion.
Having said that, perhaps I should change
to another point that I wanted to develop.
Before doing so, I should like to say that
Senator Roebuck seemed to feel that the condition adding a question of law as one of the
conditions, the $10,000 condition, before you
had a right of appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada was a limiting factor. Again I went
back and looked at some of the things that
Senator Roebuck and I had done together in
this Senate.
I found that when we were reviewing the
Criminal Code and creating a new one, which
was introduced in the Senate and went to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, we had a subcommittee on which
Senator Roebuck was one of the hardest
working members. We were very much in
agreement on that committee. One of the
provisions about which we agreed in connection with appeals in criminal cases under section 583 of the Criminal Code was:
A person who is convicted by a trial
court in proceedings by indictment may
appeal to the court of appeal
(a) against his conviction
(i) on any ground of appeal that involves
a question of law alone,
There is the question of law.
(ii) on any ground of appeal that involves
a question of fact alone or a question of

mixed law and fact, with leave of the
court of appeal or upon the certificate of
the trial judge that the case is a proper
case for appeal
The rest of it is unimportant.
Therefore, when we were dealing with the
side of the administration of justice involving
the freedom of the individual as against, as
here, the civil side of appeals that may in
some way affect the pocketbook of the
individual but does not involve his freedom,
we were satisfied-and I am still satisfied
that we provided correctly in section 583 of
the Criminal Code-to say that on a question
of law there shall be a right of appeal; on a
question of fact alone, mixed fact and law,
appeal with leave of the court of appeal, or
by certificate from the judge.
In addition to that, many of our federal
statutes, such as the National Energy Act and
others, provide for an appeal as of right from
the decision of the board to the Supreme
Court of Canada on a question of law. There
is, therefore, nothing in adding the words "a
question of law" as one of the conditions in
section 36 that is aimed specifically at making
it more difficult for the man of ordinary
means to be able to embark on an appeal to
the Supreme Court of Canada after he has
had two chances to prove his case with a full
dress performance in each court. A question
of law provision, and the right in connection
with that question of law, is something which
seems to be well preserved and gives to the
litigant, whoever is involved, a right where
there is a question of law.
When you move along so far in litigation,
then the limitations or conditions are in the
area of questions of fact and mixed fact and
law, yet the right is not absolutely taken
away and the discretion of the court of
appeal-in one case of the province and in
the other case of the Supreme Court of Canada-is not fettered by any direction or guidelines. They can exercise their discretion; they
can grant leave with or without reasons, and
very often they simply grant leave. The combination of facts in the case may influence the
court to exercise its discretion.
I feel that if I say any more on this part of
the subject it might be repetitious.
Honourable senators, I wish to say a word
about habeas corpus, as there seems to be
some misunderstanding as to the scope and
effect of it. Habeas corpus simply means,
"Deliver up the body." If a person is in prison
and it is felt that he is there unfairly and
without jurisdiction, then, before 1965, one

SENATE DEBATES

speech by honourable Senator Roebuck-sincere, as always. We have heard the able
explanation given by the sponsor of the bill, a
great jurist. I think everyone would agree
with that.
I do not see any need to continue. This
could go on indefinitely. Those who have
already spoken may wish to reply to Senator
Roebuck, and may do so. I am inclined to
agree with Your Honour, and say that honourable Senator Roebuck should not be
entitled to adjourn this debate.
The Hon. the Speaker: I do not think I was
well understood. The honourable Senato'r
Roebuck has just moved the adjournment of
the debate.
If honourable Senator Roebuck wishes to
reply to the arguments of those who have
spoken on his amendment, I would ask
honourable senators, if, by leave, they will
permit him to reply. Is it agreed?

Hon. J. Harper Prowse: Honourable senators, may I suggest with respect that if the
motion made by the honourable Senator
Roebuck be considered as a substitute motion
for the original motion to adopt the report
and is considered under those circumstances,
then, as a substantive motion, he would at
this time or whenever we get round to it,
have a right which is accorded to a senator
who moves a substantive motion of replying
at the end, that is, closing the debate with his
reply.
If, on the other hand, His Honour rules that
this is not that type of motion but is an
amendment, then we will at some stage of the
proceedings vote on the amendment, and if
the amendment is lost there can be further
debate on the main motion. But Senator
Roebuck, having already spoken on the main
motion in order to move his substitute
motion, would not then, of course, be entitled
to speak twice.
I think, with respect, that whether or
not he is entitled to speak ought not to
depend on our being asked to extend our
indulgence in order to vary a rule but ought
to depend on the determination by the Chair
as to what kind of motion we now have in
front of us. Clearly, then, he either has a
right to speak or he has not.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I think the rule to which
Your Honour has referred relates to a substantive motion, and it is a substantive motion,
to refer this report back to the committee.
I do not want a right given to me by charity of my friends in the Senate. If I have not

and if it was agreedSome Hon. Senators: No.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: I did not agree. I certainly expressed the opinion that the honourable senator was not entitled to do so.

Therefore, since this is not a substantive
motion but is an amendment, my honourable
friend Senator Roebuck has no right of reply
and Your Honour is perfectly right in so
ruling.

respecting Bill S-8, intituled an act to amend

October 16, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

the Supreme Court Act, be now adopted. Is it
your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt
the motion?
Hon. Mr. Prowse: Honourable senators, it is
not my intention to impose upon you for any
length of time, but I would like to say just a
few words with respect to clauses 1 and 2 of
the bill, which are included in the report.
Everything that has been said about all of
the different things that can be done, and the
fact that the approaches to the court are
limited, are perfectly true. But the simple
fact remains that if this report is adopted,
access to the court will be limited. Whereas,
at the present time there is a right, where
certain sums of money are involved, for anyone who feels himself aggrieved by a decision at the local level-whether he is a plaintiff or a defendant, whether he has been upset or supported on appeal-to go on, as a
matter of simple right to the Supreme Court
on any question he feels ought to be adjudicated upon by that court, whether it be on a
question of law, on a question of fact, or on
a question of mixed fact and law.
I think lawyers will agree with me when I
say that once you have established the facts,
it is very seldom that anyone has any trouble
deciding the law that should be applied to
those facts. The big problems and the bases
of nearly all judicial decisions are, first, the
ascertainment of the facts; and then the area
where you have mixed fact and law, and it is
difficult to tell which ought to take precedence, or which is which. These are the areas
where it is very often desirable that there
should be an appeal.
It is true, as has been stated, that under
section 41 you can still apply to the court and
go there with leave. But to obtain leave, particularly where smaller sums are involved
and costs are important, imposes a double
appearance before the court, which will
double the costs for those living outside of
Ottawa, who have to come here twice. It does
not necessarily double the costs of printing,
but the fees and other costs are doubled. In
other words, it makes justice that much more
difficult to achieve and that much more expensive. It may not affect many cases, but it
is a spectre facing every person who feels
that he has a right to be heard and to receive
justice.
The fact that in this chamber twenty-four
senators were concerned enough to support
the amendment that we had before us, surely
ought to be evidence that in other places people who have not had the experience we here
29234-201

have had are certainly going to feel that
these hazards placed in the way of getting to
the Supreme Court of Canada are not going
to do our image of justice any good. I do not
want to cast aspersions on anyone. I am talking about the image of justice and the image
of the availability of justice.
Section 39 of the Supreme Court Act deals
with those cases where there is either a confused or unsettled question of law to be dealt
with, and the opposing lawyers are agreed
that this is an unsettled area of law. It provides that they should go to trial to establish
their facts and to get a ruling from the judge.
Then, it may be an instance where there are
conflicting decisions of their provincial
Appeal Court on some point of law, and they
would like to have the matter clarified. It
may be a point the provincial courts have not
ruled on at all, or there may be conflicting
decisions in the courts and the matter has
never been clarified by the Supreme Court. It
may be a matter on which no one has yet
rendered a decision.
Everyone agrees, and every lawyer knows,
that often a case arises which involves a matter that ought to be settled by the Supreme
Court in order to clarify the law. This
recourse used to be available where the
amount in issue was only $2,000. It may be
that someone decided to take the case and
test it, there being only a small amount
involved, for the very simple reason that the
smaller the amount in controversy the smaller
the fees and the smaller the costs. Then, by
agreement, they could escape the double cost
of going to the provincial Supreme Court, and
the repetition of costs in going to the
Supreme Court of Canada. With leave of the
Supreme Court of the province they can go
directly to the Supreme Court of Canada and,
therefore, reach their objective with twothirds of the costs and two-thirds of the legal
fees that would be involved in going through
the whole procedure.
We now say that this recourse is only available provided the sum involved is over a
certain amount. This puts a terrible temptation in the way of a lawyer who now finds
himself with this kind of case. He might feel
that in all probability, say, $5,000 is the reasonable amount to ask for by way of damages,
but that he had better ask for $15,000 so that
he will have the right to go to the Supreme
Court of Canada. In other words, this kind of
thing perverts the course of justice and does
not help it.

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Mr. Choquette: I would not want the
honourable senator to induce us in error. You
can ask for $100,000, but it is the amount that
you are awarded by either a jury or the court
that decides whether you achieve the limit. It
is not what you ask for, but what you obtain
by way of judgment in the first instance.
Hon. Mr. Prowse: Well, that may be, but if
you ask for enough you may be able to get
there too. Certainly, I know that when they
raised the original limits of the jurisdiction of
the District Court in Alberta they automatically raised what had been the lower limits of
damages asked for in civil actions in the
province. But the fact remains that regardless
of how good the system may be, these two
sections mean that some Canadians over the
next few years, who might feel strongly
enough about the rightness of their case and
who want to have it adjudicated upon and
determined by the Supreme Court of Canada,
will be barred from that court by the action
we are taking; and that is an action which 1,
for one, am not prepared to accept.
Motion agreed to and report adopted, on

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third

POVERTY IN CANADA
MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL
COMMITTEE-DEBATE ADJOURNED

On the order:
Resuming the debate on the motion of
the honourable Senator Croll, seconded
by the honourable Senator Roebuck, that
a Special Committee of the Senate be
appointed to investigate and report upon
all aspects of poverty in Canada(Hon. Senator Belisle).
Hon. Rheal Belisle: Stand.
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, is
there no hope of our proceeding with this
order? Many senators wish to speak in this
debate, and it is now only a quarter to five. It
was my understanding that we had decided
not to resume this debate yesterday because
there was no time available, and that Senator
Belisle was prepared to go on today.

October 16, 1968

Hon. Mr. Choquette: If there are other
honourable senators who wish to speak now,
then we will yield.
Hon. Mr. Belisle: Honourable senators, I
am willing to yield at the request of the
honourable Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Martin), but having regard to what he
said yesterday I thought I would have an
audience. Knowing that I will be more than
a half or three-quarters of an hour, I rather
doubt whether there will be many members
in the chamberHon. Mr. Croll: It is the prerogative of His
Honour the Speaker to adjourn the house.
Hon. Mr. Martin: The honourable Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Flynn) did suggest that there was no disposition not to
proceed with this debate, but that Senator
Belisle preferred not to go on at this time. If
there is another honourable senator who
wishes to proceedHon. Mr. Belisle: I will go on now.
Honourable senators, in rising to take part
in this very important debate on poverty, I
do so because I consider the subject to be one
of prime importance. If our society and our
present institutions are to survive the crises
of our time, then we must do something
about poverty. This problem has always been
with us, and we must face the fact that poverty in Canada is real. As described by the
honourable sponsor of the motion (Hon. Mr.
Croll), its numbers are not in the thousands
but in the millions. There is more poverty
than our society should tolerate, more than
our economy can afford, and far more than
our existing measures and efforts can cope
with. In my belief, its persistence, at a time
when the bulk of Canadians enjoy one of
the highest standards of living in the world,
is a downright disgrace.
I endorse Senator Croll's suggestion that a
committee should be appointed to investigate
and to hear those who have seen it, felt it,
and experienced it, whether as its victims or
as those trying to do something about it. Such
witnesses can supply this committee with the
truth. There are not two solutions for it,
because one reason for poverty's partial
invisibility is that the poor tend to be collectively inarticulate. Many of them lack the
education, the will, and the organization to
make themselves heard. Most of them are
outside the ranks of the trade unions. They
have few spokesmen and groups to represent
them and give voice to their needs.

October 16, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Another difficulty is that it is all too easy in
Canada to file poverty away under the heading of certain other long-standing national
problems, and in this way to lose sight of it
as a major problem in its own right. Thus
many Canadians may assume that the problem of poverty is identical with the problem
of low average incomes in the Atlantic provinces and eastern Quebec. The incidence of
poverty, and the chance of a given person
being poor, is certainly much higher in these
areas and among such groups just mentioned.
But in terms of absolute numbers, between a
third and a half of the total poverty in Canada is to be found among the Indians and the
white population of cities and towns west of
Three Rivers, as mentioned in the Fifth
Annual Review of the Economic Council of
Canada.
There are two major problems in defining
poverty. First, it is a relative concept.
Second, while the availability of relevant statistics compels it to be discussed here largely
in terms of low incomes, it means something
more than simple income deficiency. It is true
of course, that generally agreed upon concepts of poverty alter through space and time.
Thus, the situation of those Canadians whom
the majority of their fellow citizens would
deem to be suffering from poverty is hardly
to be compared with that of those of Biafra
or India, and if a typical 1968 "poverty line"
defined in terms of real income were extended back through time, most Canadians during
the depression of the 1930s, and perhaps even
most Canadians of the 1920s, would be found
to have been living below that line.
But neither of these facts makes poverty in
Canada in 1968 any less real or painful. To
feel poverty is, among other things, to feel
oneself an unwilling outsider-a virtual nonparticipant in the society in which one lives.
The problem of poverty in developed industrial societies is increasingly viewed, not as a
sheer lack of essentials to sustain life but as
an insufficient access to certain goods, services and conditions of life which are available to everyone else and which have come to
be accepted as basic to a decent minimum
standard of living.
I know that here in Canada we have started on some extremely promising developments, and I do not wish to build an overoptimistic picture nor to suggest that much
further experimentation and improvements
are not required. But it is undoubtedly the
case that the prospects for mounting a powerfully renewed offensive against poverty with

clear performance criteria and appropriate
feedbacks of information on actual results
obtained should force the Senate into greater
participation, and thus establish a special
committee to deal with all those aspects.
Poverty, thus defined, is not quite the same
thing as low income. A statistician would say
there is a very strong association between the
two, to the extent that one can often be used
as a rough and ready substitute for the other.
They are not, however, identical. For example, the low-income population of Canada
includes a small proportion of people such as
the university student who gets by on $1,500
a year, but does not feel himself irrevocably
poverty stricken, first, because he has a family to fall back on if necessary, and, second,,
because much better income prospects lie a,
short distance ahead of him. Much more serious and widespread is the kind of low income
situation which carries with it a sense of
entrapment and hopelessness. Even the best
statistics can only hint at this. They cannot
capture the sour atmosphere of poor health
and bad housing-the accumulated defeat,
alienation, and despair which often so tragically are inherited by the next and succeeding generations.
I believe that serious poverty should be
eliminated in Canada, and that this should be
designated as a major national goal. I believe
this for two reasons. Firstly, Canada, as one
of the wealthiest societies in world history,
cannot avoid setting itself such a goal if it
aspires to be a just society. Secondly, poverty
is costly. Its most grievous costs are those felt
directly by the poor themselves, but it also
imposes very large costs on the rest of
society.
They include the costs of low productivity
and lost output, of controlling the social tensions and unrest associated with gross inequality, and of that part of total welfare
expenditure which is essentially a palliative
made necessary by the failure to find more
fundamental solutions.
It has been estimated in the United States
that one poor man can cost the public purse
as much as $140,000 between the ages of 17
and 57. It should also be noted that in recent
years there has been a burst of improvement
in the available weaponry against poverty.
Not only have new weapons been devised or
proposed, but there has also been a development of techniques of evaluation by which
the effectiveness of both old and new weapons can be assessed and enhanced. Much of
this improvement has occurred since the
United States Government declared formal

SENATE DEBATES
war on poverty with its Economic Opportunity Act of 1964.
The term "war on poverty" is appropriate
in more than one sense, for ironically enough
some of the techniques of policy planning and
evaluation now being applied in the field of
poverty originated within the military and
defence planning establishments.
Where a low income family is, for one reason or another, incapable of offering labour
services and is therefore largely dependent on
government payments, the policy problem of
how to aid that family is in one sense relatively simple: the major issue is the size of
the income to be provided. But where there
are earnings on an insufficient scale, or where
there is an unexploited potential for earnings,
the policy choices are less simple. Other
things being equal, it is far better to help
people to help themselves, to put them in a
position to upgrade their earnings permanently, through such measures as training and
manpower mobility programs, and to exploit
unused earnings potential, provided this does
not involve a sacrifice of future to present
earnings as in the case of the youth who
drops out of high school to augment family
income. But self-help takes time, and meanwhile income support in the form of government payments may be needed. It seems a
fair generalization that in the past Canadian
social policy has tended to emphasize various
forms of income maintenance and has only
recently moved strongly into the more difficult area of promoting self-help among lowincome people.
A more concerted and purposeful attack on
poverty in Canada is now urgently required.
Such an attack would not only benefit those
low-income families whose needs now are
inadequately met, but would also bring substantial benefits to all Canadians. The challenge in the short run is to alleviate the conditions which today thrust many Canadian
families and individuals into involuntary
poverty and hold them there. In the long run
the challenge is to prevent the development
of these conditions. The aim must be to identify those measures that will meet this challenge effectively and economically, but also
compassionately, taking care to preserve the
human dignity and freedoms which our society cherishes.
The early forecasts of impending unemployment and serious under-employment
accompanying the introduction of automation
in western industrial nations has not been
borne out in practice. The more optimistic
social and economic observers have concluded

October 16, 1968

from this experien'ce, particularly during the
1960s, that the fears once held for the impact
of automation
upon employment
were
groundless. Nothing could be further from the
truth.
In this society in which industrial processes
are increasingly automated it may be that
work will more and more become a privilege
rather than a right, and the whole question of
providing a sufficiency of income will assume
far greater importance than in the past 20
years. We hear more and more about such
concepts as "guaranteed annual income" and
the "negative income tax". It must be
emphasized that all these concepts require the
identification and adoption of a level of living
appropriate to an individual or a family in
our society.
The question of financing such income policies is equally a matter of raising the revenues and determining the standard of living
below which we would not wish a family to
fall. Taxation policies may make it more difficult to obtain the underlying social objective
of a modest but adequate standard for all
citizens.
The Canadian-born Harvard economist,
John K. Galbraith, has argued that our affluent society has a responsibility to see that as
many of its members as possible can not only
survive but can live decently and with dignity. Our difficulty in accepting a radical concept like the guaranteed annual income is a
further reflection of the problem that all of us
have faced through the nearly 25 year since
the end of the Second World War, the fact
that we live in a radical economic technology
in which social technology is distinguished by
its conservatism rather than its radicalism.
Automation does not give youth individual
hope; they feel that all they are is a cog in a
huge machine that they cannot comprehend.
Now the emphasis is on the fact that computers provide us with solutions. The personality of the individual, however, is neglected
and he cannot find a place in the increasing
automated society. In all our problems of
society we are really avoiding moral issues.
Canada's 28th Parliament opened on September 12 with a huge backlog of problems
besetting Canada. These include an alarming
housing crisis, rising prices, high unemployment, crowded and polluted cities, widespread poverty and a widening gap between
rich and poor.
In the midst of apparent affluence and
prosperity, the Canadian mood may have
been disclosed by survey results published

tion of our fellow-citizens spend their lives in
the shadow of poverty and despair and moral
degradation.
Hon. Muriel McQ. Fergusson: Honourable
senators, I rise to support the motion of the
honourable Senator Croll that a Special Committee of the Senate be appointed to investigate and report upon all aspects of poverty in
Canada.
As this is the first time I have spoken in
this chamber during the present session, I
take the occasion to congratulate our new
Speaker, who gave us such clear and concise
explanations of the Estimates during the last
session, when he was Deputy Government
Leader. He won the admiration of all of us
who were privileged to listen to him. He certainly has my best wishes in his new office.
My good wishes also go to the new Leader of
the Government, Senator Martin, whose
career I and many thousands of others
throughout Canada have followed and are
still following with great admiration. We are
fortunate to have such an outstanding
Canadian as Government Leader in the
Senate. His presence adds prestige and lustre
to this chamber.
I also wish to welcome all new senators and
to congratulate the mover and seconder of the
Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne. All of those I have mentioned are on
the Government side of this chamber, but I
would not wish to neglect our good friends on
the other side, and I sincerely say that I am
delighted we have with us, obviously in top
form, the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Flynn). We are also glad to see his friendly
Deputy Leader, Senator Choquette.
All honourable senators, I am sure, have
been concerned over the existence of poverty
in Canada, which has received so much attention from the Canadian Welfare Council, the
Economic Council of Canada and other organizations, as well as from the press.
Statistics quoted by these groups show that
a large minority of the Canadian people are
living in poverty, and we know too that there
are many others suffering from poverty who
are not shown in any statistics.
Many senators, no doubt, have been searching, as I have been, for some solution to this
problem, through reading the results of studles carried on and books written on this
subject in Canada and also through reading
the valuable and pertinent studies and books
on this same subject which have appeared in
the United States of America, where poverty
is considered one of the outstanding problems
of the day.

October 16, 1968

As Senator Croll has pointed out, the Economic Council of Canada, in its Fifth Annual
Report, on pages 136 and 137, has suggested
that the Senate of Canada might consider the
advisability of creating a special committee to
inquire into the problem of poverty in Canada. Senator Croll has accepted this challenge
by making the motion now before us, for
which we owe him our thanks and our support. Because Senator Croll is a great
humanitarian and has exhibited all through
his life interest in the welfare of all Canadians, it is appropriate that he was the one
among us to react so promptly to this
challenge.
All studies on this subject seem to find
difficulty in defining poverty. As the Fifth
Annual Report of the Economic Council points
out, poverty is a relative term and generally agreed-upon concepts alter through time.
I can remember that in the town where I
lived in my early youth, at a certain time
every year a meeting was held at which
provision was made for the poor, for those of
the community who could not maintain themselves and for whom the municipality had a
responsibility. At this meeting a form of bidding took place and the person who agreed to
provide food, clothing and shelter for the
least amount for an indigent person took that
person into his or her home for the coming
year. If the indigent were able to do some
work such as sewing or gardening or chopping wood, the bidder would offer to keep
him or her at a lower rate than would be
offered for someone unable to make such a
contribution. This impressed me very much
when I was young, and my father, who was a
great humanitarian, would come home on the
day that this took place and there would really be gloom in our home because we felt that
this was a dreadful thing to be happening. It
impressed me as a very terrible system. It
may not have been widespread, but I know it
existed in some communities at one time.
People with no means of support in Canada,
people who are poor, are not now subject to
such indignities, nor have they been for many
years.
Even though in meeting their obligations
our governments nowadays provide, in better
style, the basic necessities of food, clothing
and shelter for those dependent on public
support, changing ideas and concepts have
made us all, including those who are themselves suffering from poverty, realize that
every human being is entitled to more than a
bare existence.

October 16, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Nowadays the modern concept of those living in poverty not only includes those who
cannot provide for the basic necessities of life
for themselves and their families but also
includes those and their familles who are
denied the minimal levels of health, housing,
food and education which our present technological and scientific knowledge should make
available to everyone in this country.
I cannot entirely agree with Senator Croll
when he referred to our present welfare programs as a "hodgepodge of gaps, inadequacies
and inequalities". There are many such gaps
and inadequacies and I am sure a study by a
special committee of this house would pinpoint them and would show how these gaps
and inadequacies might be overcome. Nevertheless, I believe that much of our present
social legislation is valuable and should be
retained, perhaps with some changes and
modifications.
Old Age Security, the Guaranteed Income
Supplement which I believe is an outcome of
the study on aging by a former special committee of this house, and Family Allowances,
are parts of our social legislation which have
done much for the people of Canada. They
have also done much to maintain income and,
incidentally, to maintain purchasing power in
Canada. Without them I firmly believe poverty would be a much worse problem here than
it is today. Not only have they provided
income maintenance but they have given
great happiness and added dignity to many
older citizens and to many mothers of young
children.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Perhaps honourable
senators will forgive me if I refer briefly to
my own experiences in connection with two
of these acts.
For several years, as Director of Old Age
Security in my Province of New Brunswick, I
had many opportunities to come to a realization of how much that pension means to those
who make up the majority of older people in
this country. Prior to the introduction of the
Old Age Security Pension, many older people
were reluctantly provided with shelter, clothing and food by members of their families,
who did not hesitate to let them realize they
were a burden. These same older people,
when they became the recipients of that pension, small as it may seem to many honourable senators, were, through that pension, able
to contribute to their own maintenance. They
even found that they became welcome members of the family and were actually sought

after. This pension has greatly changed the
attitude toward older people in many parts of
Canada.
My responsibilities also included the
administration of Family Allowances for my
province. I know that, owing to Family
Allowances, very many children in my province are healthier, better fed and better
clothed and are able to attend school more
regularly than they would have been without
the allowance. Because of that small additional allowance, parents can now provide proper
food, clothing and other necessities for their
children which, without the allowance, many
of them would be unable to secure even with
the best will in the world.
I am well aware that there are criticisms of
these acts, but if honourable senators were to
have the personal experience of dealing with
the people who benefit through them, as I
have had, I believe they would agree with me
that the good accomplished far outweighs any
criticism there could be.
Canada has subscribed to the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights passed by the
United Nations General Assembly in December, 1948, one article of which is:
Article 25: (1) Everyone has the right
to a standard of living adequate for the
health and well-being of himself and of
his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social
services, and the right to security in the
event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age, of other lack of
livelihood in circumstances beyond his
control.
Honourable senators, having subscribed to
this declaration, I believe it is our duty to do
all we can to make it possible for everyone in
Canada to enjoy these rights.
I do not think this can be accomplished
merely through providing necessary goods
and services to those who need them. We
must give to all Canadians an opportunity to
work for adequate wages so that they can
provide these things for themselves.
In connection with Canada's external aid to
developing countries, we accept the principle
that it is better to help the developing countries to help themselves become selfsufficient, than it is to continue indefinitely to
supply their actual needs in the way of basic
necessities. This principle is equally applicable to the part of our population who are not
now able to be self-sufficient, owing to their
lack of education or lack of employment

SENATE DEBATES
opportunities. I believe the studies of a committee such as has been proposed might well
determine how this could be done.
Although poverty in its modern interpretation is often defined as the state where people
are deprived of the opportunity to enjoy life
on the level they might expect to do in view
of our technological and scientific discoveries,
the only method by which we can measure
poverty is by the amount of income received.
As I stated earlier, the studies of the Canadian Welfare Council, the Economic Council of
Canada and others, with the statistics they
quote, point out that according to that method
of measurement there are many people in
Canada, not only in the Atlantic region,
whose income puts them in what is generally
considered the poverty level.
It is strange that this should be true in this
country, about which our former Governor
General, Lord Tweedsmuir once said:
The resources of Canada are so rich and
varied that it would not be easy I think
to find their parallel elsewhere in the
world. We have only begun to scrape the
edge of our inheritance.
I believe that what Lord Tweedsmuir said
is as true today as when he said it. If it is,
why are we allowing such a large minority of
Canadians to suffer deprivation while at the
same time a large majority of us enjoy a very
high standard of living? There must be some
method through which the proceeds of a
country which is so rich in natural resources,
can be divided more evenly among its people.
The committee which Senator Croll has suggested might, I believe, find some solution to
this problem.
So far I have dealt only with humanitarian
reasons for finding a solution to the problem
of poverty in Canada but, I believe, there are
other reasons for this study.
Lack of money leads to the lack of many
things which in this age men and women
have come to feel it is only right and fair that
they should have.
Mr. Braine, Commonwealth Under-Secretary in the British House of Commons in 1961,
said:
It would be folly to ignore the fact that
the days when men were prepared to
accept the evils of poverty as being part
of the natural order are over.
Again, Mr. Braine said:
Is it so surprising that men everywhere
are now beginning to understand that
hunger, sickness, unremitting toil and

October 16, 1968

early death are no longer inevitable or
that they grow impatient for change and
are caught up, to use Mr. Adlai Stevenson's vivid phrase, in "the revolution of
rising expectations".
It seems to me that if we do not make it
possible for all Canadians to participate in
the good life which our country could provide
for all and which it does provide for so many,
we may well be caught in that "revolution of
rising expectations".
Humanitarian considerations aside, great
manufacturing and trading nations, such as
we hope and expect Canada will be, have
everything to gain by raising the standard of
living of the poorer people, for this increases
the levels of consumption, which in turn creates more trade within the country and leads
to more prosperity.
Again, to refer to purely practical considerations, in supporting the idea that people
should be trained to help themselves so that
they will be self-supporting, President Lyndon Johnson of the United States expressed
the view that $1,000 invested in the retraining
and rehabilitation of an unemployed worker
is likely to return to the national economy
about $40,000 in the lifetime of the individual
so assisted. On the other side of the picture,
as Senator Belisle has told us and as the
report of the Economic Council sets out, it
has been estimated in the United States of
America that one poor man can cost the public purse as much as $140,000 between the
ages of 17 and 57 years.
There will always be a small minority of
those who cannot support themselves, such as
the chronically ill, the permanently disabled,
one-parent families with small children and
inadequate incomes. These groups will always
have to receive welfare assistance.
However, a thorough investigation by a
Senate committee might very well provide
guidelines showing what our country can and
should do to eliminate poverty and improve
the standard of living among those able and
willing to work, but who, even if they can
manage to secure employment, cannot earn
enough to provide for themselves and their
families the standard of living which in this
rich country and these modern times they are
entitled to and expect to enjoy.
Other countries, particularly the United
States of America, are making great efforts
toward the same objective of a better standard of living and the abolition of poverty.
Also in an effort to improve the standard of
living in India, the government of that coun-

October 16, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

try bas laid great stress on industrialization.
The countries of Africa have put greater
stress on agriculture. In Canada we have
undertaken projects to achieve this aim, but
from the results obtained we have apparently
not done the right things or we have not done
enough to make any great improvement in
the standard of living of those in the more
deprived regions of our country and among
our Indian, Eskimo and Metis population.
Despite our efforts, it seems the gap
between the well-to-do and the poor is not
closing.
The appointment of a special Senate committee to study this matter may well lead to
recommendations which will do much to solve
the problem, and I wholeheartedly support
the motion.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Carter, debate adjourned.
PRIVATE BILL
AETNA CASUALTY COMPANY OF CANADASECOND READING

Hon. Eric Cook moved the second reading
of Bill S-11, to incorporate the Aetna Casualty Company of Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, I am sorry to
say that some of you will now be hearing the
explanation of this bill for the third time.
The bill was first introduced in the Senate
in June 1965, was passed by the Senate on
June 30, of that year, but received only first
reading in the other place before Parliament
was adjourned. The bill was again introduced
at the next session of Parliament, was passed
by the Senate in 1966, but was talked out in
the other place when it came up for third
reading. The bill was introduced in the other
place in the session which commenced in May
of 1967 but was talked out before it received
second reading.
Honourable senators, the purpose of Bill
S-11 is to incorporate in Canada the Aetna
Casualty and Surety Company. The American
parent company bas already been doing business in Canada for 47 years. It now wishes to
incorporate a Canadian company for the purpose of transacting business in Canada in
future.
The first directors of the new company will
be the promoters named in section 1. The
capital of the company is to be $5 million, of
which $1 million in capital and surplus must
be paid in before the company may commence business.

The head office of the company will be in
Toronto, and by virtue of section 6 the company will be empowered to carry on business
in the fire, casualty and surety fields, but not,
of course, the business of a Ife insurance
company.
Honourable senators, if the bill receives
second reading, I shall move that it be
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, where the promoters will
be available to answer any questions which
may then arise.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Is this bill identical with
the others that we have had?
Hon. Mr. Cook: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Why was it tossed out
on two occasions?
Hon. Mr. Cook: It was in the other place,
Senator Roebuck. I could not say.
Hon. Mr. Croll: There was a filibuster in
the other place.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, I
hope that we will be able to proceed tomorrow with the debate on the motion standing
in the name of Senator Croll calling for the
establishment of a committee to examine into
and report upon all aspects of poverty in
Canada. A list has been made and I hope the
speakers will be alerted and ready to go on so
that we can conclude that debate, or at least
make some progress in it.

Now since there is some lack of understanding about these matters, why should we
be in a hurry about this other very important
study that Senator Croll advises? I think on
the matter of consumer credit, progress has
been made, and also following the report of
the Joint Committee on Divorce very important progress has been made. But I suggest
that on something as important as the matter
under discussion, the leader should not hurry
us.
We need some help on the communications
media to make the people of Canada aware
that Parliament, and particularly this branch
of Parliament is considering this very important subject.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
may I add a word to that. My own position is
that I want to speak on this matter, but have
not yet had an opportunity to prepare for it.
I would point out that I handle a very large
number of divorce cases and read every one

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, as previously announced, the Minister of
Finance will deliver his Budget Speech in the

May I be permitted to remind honourable
senators that none but senators will be admitted to the Senate gallery of the House of

excluded from the gallery because of many of
the places being occupied by relatives and
friends of senators.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, this

may be a convenient place to indicate what
will likely be our business for next week.
On Tuesday afternoon we will continue the
motion standing in the name of Senator Croll
for the appointment of a Special Committee
to investigate and report upon all aspects of
poverty in Canada. There are a number of
speakers already on the list. I understand
there are others who also wish to speak.
Furthermore, there will be the debate on
third reading of Bill S-8, to amend the
Supreme Court Act.
As the Leader of the Opposition reminds
me now, it has been agreed that senators will
take advantage of provisions which are rightfully theirs, to listen to the budget in the
other place on Tuesday next.
There will be divorce resolutions and
reports.
We will have before us the Farm Improvement Loans Act and the Judges Act. I expect
that we will have three other bills in our
hands, when we meet again next week.

NATO
USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS-ALLEGED STATEMENT BY GENERAL LEMNITZER
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are called, I
wish to reply to a question Senator Carter
asked me yesterday and in connection with
which I said I would endeavour to reply to
today.
In replying to this question regarding the
military situation in Europe and NATO, and
the statement attributed to General Lemnitzer,
who as you know, is the Supreme Allied
Commander, Europe, I wish to say that he
was reported as having made certain remarks
last weekend in Lisbon during an address
to the annual assembly of the Atlantic Treaty
Association. I have not yet had an opportunity of seeing the complete text of what he
said. However, I have seen excerpts which

cover the aspect referred to by Senator Carter.
General Lemnitzer's first point was to suggest that because the conventional forces of
the members of the Warsaw Pact powers are
superior in number to those of NATO, there
could well be a requirement at a relatively
early stage of any major conflict, which we

October 17, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

all hope will never take place, to use the
tactical nuclear weapons available to NATO.
General Lemnitzer went on to argue that, in
addition to having such nuclear weapons, it
was important for the alliance to make clear
its will and determination to use them if circumstances warranted. If there was any
doubt about this point, he suggested, the
deterrent value of NATO's military forces
could be jeopardized.
Against this background, I would like to
deal with the two specific questions addressed
to me by Senator Carter. The first was
whether I would care to comment on the
statement as a whole. Well, this would be
difficult for me to do because I have not seen
the full statement. My impression is that the
points General Lemnitzer sought to make
were not new, although the way in which he
expressed them and the manner in which
they were reported in the press may have
given that impression. It should, of course, be
recognized that General Lemnitzer was
speaking in his capacity as a senior military
officer with responsibility for defending Western Europe against a possible Warsaw Pact
attack. He was not necessarily enunciating the
views of the alliance as a whole or those of
any of its individual members.
Perhaps the best way of answering this
point is to remind honourable senators that
NATO has recently adopted a policy of what
is called "flexible response," which is based
on the proposition that wars may break out
or aggression take place below the nuclear
level and that in such a situation nuclear
retaliation would be inappropriate and dangerous. This doctrine therefore recognizes the
necessity in an age of nuclear weapons of
being able to respond to any aggression with
the degree of force necessary to defeat it
without escalating the conflict to all-out
nuclear war. It places increased emphasis on
conventional forces as a means of achieving
objectives; flexible response reduces dependence on nuclear weapons but it does not,
however, eliminate the requirement for them.
Senator Carter's second question was
whether in my opinion the Russian occupation of Czechoslovakia had changed the military situation in Europe to the point where
expenditures on conventional arms were
becoming a waste of money and the security
of the free world now demanded a return to
"the brinkmanship of the nuclear deterrent."
I think the lesson to be drawn from this
situation is not that expenditures on conventional arms are wasted, but rather that
NATO, apart from any individual nation now

in the organization, has a continuing requirement for sufficient conventional forces to deal
with any local disturbances before they can
develop into a major conflict. With adequate
conventional forces the alliance can hope to
deal with minor conflicts-resulting perhaps
from accident or miscalculation on the other
side-below the nuclear threshold.
Hon. Mr. Carter: Honourable senators, I
should like to thank Senator Martin for his
very full answer to my question.
RHODESIA
MEDIATION IN CONSTITUTIONAL

DISPUTE

Hon. M. Gratian O'Leary: May I direct a
question to the Leader of the Government?
Inasmuch as we are a party, indirectly, to
all of this dispute between the British Government and the Government of Rhodesia,
can the Government Leader in the Senate
tell me whether the Government of Canada
was consulted by Mr. Wilson when he made
his "take it or leave it" proposal to Mr. Ian
Smith the other day?
Hon. Mr. Martin: I do not know that I
would agree with the last remarks of Senator
O'Leary (Carleton), that the proposition could
be characterized as a take it or leave it
proposal. It is a fact that the Government of
the United Kingdom did indicate to the
Canadian Government that the proposed conference would take place between the British
Prime Minister and Prime Minister Ian
Smith. In addition, my colleague the Secretary of State for External Affairs was advised
of the proposed meeting by the Foreign
Secretary when both were in attendance last
week at the United Nations.

are victims of poverty in affluent Canada. We
read about them in the press; we see and
hear about them on television and radio practically every day.
I recited that poem for a second reason, to
illustrate one tremendous difference between
the society of 170 years ago and the society of
today in Canada and English-speaking countries generally. In Southey's day practically
everyone was poor; only the very few were
rich. Today, in the English-speaking world,
and certainly in Canada, the majority are
well off; it is the poor who are in the
minority.
I ask the question: Has there been a
corresponding change in attitude? I doubt it.
The rich man in the poem took poverty for
granted, and that is understandable when one
considers that one of the hymns he would
sing in church told him:
The rich man in his castle,
The poor man at his gate,
God made them high or lowly
And ordered their estate.
It is understandable that he should ask why
the poor should complain instead of accepting
their lot as it had been ordained.
Is the attitude of the well-off majority in
Canada today towards the poverty-stricken
minority much different from the rich man in
the poem? It is true we no longer blame it on
God, but do we not blame it on something
else-on the Government, on industry, on
welfare agencies and sometimes even on the
victims of poverty themselves?
It is only now that we are beginning to
appreciate the plight of our Indians,
Eskimos and the Metis. Only now, as a people, are we beginning to recognize our responsibility towards these native groups and
how much we have failed them. But the Economic Council tells us that poverty not only
exists among the native groups and in rural
areas, but among the white people, not only
among seasonal workers in rural areas but
among the non-farm population in the urban
centres. The Economic Council tells us that in
urban areas which are outwardly affluent
there exist pockets of dire poverty not easily
discernible nor recognizible, but there
nevertheless.
The war on poverty is not a job for government alone-it is a job for everyone-and if
this committee can shake the well-off majority out of their apathy and make thein more
aware of their responsibility to help combat
poverty in Canada, then the committee will
have amply justified its existence.

The Economic Council has suggested several lines of attack on this problem of poverty
which the committee might explore. Senator
Croll elaborated on some of them when he
suggested that some way must be found to
cut the Gordian Knot of dependency, to break
the vicious circle of causes that destroy incentives and make poverty self-perpetuating.
The Economic Council pointed out that the
influence of poverty is highest among the less
educated and unskilled. No doubt, better educational facilities, better health services, better manpower programs, more adult education will contribute towards the solution.
The way that some of our manpower
retraining programs have been operating
leaves much to be desired. In talking to a
friend some time ago who operates a fish
plant, he said, "We have eleven welders
working in the plant now." I asked, "Why on
earth do you need eleven welders?" "Oh," he
said, "they are not welding; they are cutting
fish." I asked how this had come about and
he replied that a vocational school had
opened and they were paying young men to
go to take courses in welding. So seven or
eight of these young fellows, finding the pay
was very good, went off and took these
courses. However, after the courses were
completed there were no jobs available, so
now they are back at the plant doing the
same job they were doing before.
We give courses in the use of heavy equipment, and it is difficult for a person, after
taking such a course, to get a job, simply
because he bas no experience. Any contractor
on a big contract demands experience, and
how can students who have just finished a
course get experience unless someone
employs them?
Senator Croll also referred to the need to
provide employment opportunities. In this
connection I should like to express my
of the Government's new
appreciation
approach to regional development. It would
be useful to have someone from the new
Department of Regional Development appear
before the committee to tell it of their plans,
but I think it would be more beneficial if the
committee first took a look at the old programs and got some idea of their deficiencies.
A few days ago a friend told me that in
India $67 billion had been spent on the development of power projects and other schemes
billion from the Indian budget, and
-$50
another $17 billion in external aid from
various countries-yet, in spite of that huge
expenditure, the incidence of poverty had

SENATE DEBATES
actually increased because the new jobs
created by this expenditure had not been
sufficient to keep up with the increase in
population.
As far as job opportunities are concerned,
all development programs, in my opinion,
must be evaluated against the trends of this
technological age. The present trends towards
automation and cybernation are such that job
opportunities are likely to diminish instead of
increase. Machines now do the work of brains
as well as muscles. Many people around the
age of 50 with low education find no market
for their labour.
I know that some economists disagree with
this. They point to the industrial age and the
industrial revolution, when jobs actually
increased. But the industrial age was an age
of mechanization. It is true that machines
destroyed jobs, but they also created jobs for
the men who ran the machines. Many reputable economists today point out that even in
the industrial age new jobs kept pace with
the increase in the labour force only by
reducing the number of hours worked per
week. These economists now emphasize that
industrially we have passed into a new era,
the post-industrial era. Many top economists
forecast that by the year 2000-in 30 years'
time-so much work will be done by automated machines controlled by computers that
75 per cent of Canada's work force will be
paid not to work.
Under those conditions it seems that some
form of guaranteed annual income must be
inevitable. With the advent of such abundance the elimination of poverty will be a
problem more of distribution of wealth produced than of production.
Many people today believe that poverty
results in large measure from the fact that
our distribution system is geared to scarcity
instead of abundance. The committee may
find it necessary to look into this aspect of the
problem. In any event, if the committee can
come up with a plan for the gradual and
orderly transition into the post-industrial era,
and for the elimination or alleviation of
human suffering during the transitional period, it will have performed a very valuable
service to Canada and to Canadians.
Hon. Mr. Raitenbury: Would the honourable senator permit a question? In his reference to unemployed welders and heavy
machine operators, was he referring to Newfoundland alone? If so, I would ask him if he
has any figures to indicate the percentage of
unemployment in these fields.

October 17, 1968

Hon. Mr. Carter: No, I have not those
figures. I did not think they were relevant to
this particular subject.
Hon. Mr. Rattenbury: My experience as a
businessman with a reasonably large number
of employees would indicate that there is an
acute shortage of such personnel, not a
surplus.
Hon. Mr. Carter: That may be. I do not
dispute what the honourable senator says, but
the fact is that there is a shortage of trained
personnel that a contractor would want to
employ. He would not employ the new graduates from the schools because he would not
consider
them
sufficiently
trained
or
experienced.
Hon. Mr. Rai±enbury: As a contractor, I
would love to employ them.
Hon. Mr. Carter: Well, the honourable
senator is an outstanding employer, and one
who is quite different from the contractors I
hear about in my province. I know some of
the cases I refer to from personal experience,
and I can vouch for them.
Senator Croll referred also to the need to
examine pilot projects, both in Canada and
abroad. I believe that this is essential. There
are a number of pilot projects going on in
Canada sponsored by ARDA, FRED, and
ADA, and by the Atlantic Development
Board. The committee must, I think, take a
look at some of these in order to get a clear
idea of what will work and what will not
work, and why.
J understand a study is being carried out
on the possible impact of the closing of the
steel mill at Sydney, Nova Scotia on the surrounding area. This is a vital study because it
deals with the spillover of benefits of isolated
urban industry into rural areas. I hope it will
be possible to have the people conducting the
study appear before the committee to explain
their findings.
I have in my hand a book entitled Isolated
Communities, by Oscar Waldemar Junek. It
deals with Blanc Sablon, a little fishing village in Quebec-Labrador. It describes this
community in great detail from economic,
sociological and ecological viewpoints as Mr.
Junek saw it in 1934. This book attracted my
interest because I have seen many fishing villages in my own province with almost identical conditions. It would be interesting if the
conditions today at Blanc Sablon could be
compared with those of 30 years ago, so that

October 17, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

the impact of various programs could be evaluated in so far as they have resulted in
human betterment.
I gathered from Senator Croll's remarks
that lie would like this inquiry organized in
such a way that the committee would be able
to make a reasonably early interim report
containing some useful recommendations. To
do this the committee will have to set priorities, and in my opinion top priority should be
given to the examination of existing welfare
programs and their administration.
I propose this for three reasons. In the first
place, the costs of these programs are fantastic. They seem to have got out of control.
When I was preparing this address I looked
through the Revised Estimates, copies of
which we all have, and I was amazed to find
in them that provision is made to spend $1.58
billion on Old Age Security, another $561.7
million on family allowances, $51 million on
youth, and $251.9 million on the Canada
Assistance Plan. If there is added to those
amounts the expenditure for disabled persons
and old age assistance, which amounts to
$15.75 million, the grand total is $2.461
billion.
The program in respect of old age assistance, disabled persons, and the Canada
Assistance Plan are all shared-cost programs,
of which the total of the federal Government's share is $267.6 million. This means
that the provinces also will spend $267.6 million on these programs, which brings the total
combined expenditure up to $2.729 billion.
To that we must add the expenditures on
war veterans. Veterans' pensions, in the Estimates, amount this year to $225.2 million. In
addition to that there is $108.6 million for war
veterans' allowances, making a total expenditure of $333.8 million by the Department of
Veterans Affairs. If we add that amount to
the other figure, we get a grand total of over
$3 billion that is being spent on welfare in
Canada.
Surely, with an expenditure of that magnitude there should be no poverty among the
sick, the aged and the handicapped in Canada. Yet the Economic Council tells us that in
spite of that huge expenditure there are at
least five million Canadians below the poverty level, about 25 per cent of the total population, and that is measured by a yardstick
which would give a conservative number.
One of the questions this committee must
try to answer is why these programs are not
more effective. This is particularly urgent
because these programs will have to remain

in force until new ones are worked out, and
improvements are not possible unless we
fully understand and correct the faults in the
old ones.
My own impression is that the trouble with
many of these programs is that they are not
geared to people. They are geared to bureaucracy, to provincial priorities, possibly even to
political objectives. They are geared to many
things but not to people. I have personal
knowledge of people who own some items of
livestock, but when they went to seek welfare
because they needed assistance they could not
get it unless they sold their sheep, their cow,
their goat, or whatever it was they had. It
would be interesting to discover whether this
stupid regulation is still being enforced,
because nothing can be more self-defeating or
more destructive of incentive than that type
of regulation.
Widows, particularly those under 55 without children, are the forgotten people in our
welfare programs. With the unemployment
figure in my own province running between
10 and 20 per cent, what market is there for a
woman's labour? Yet they cannot get assistance because of the age limit. It was my
understanding that the Canada Assistance
Plan was expressly designed to take care of
that type of case, but from my own experience it has not worked out that way, and as
far as I am concerned the whole Canada Assistance Plan is very disappointing.
Probably the main reason for our poverty
in Canada is because our programs are
designed to treat the symptoms of poverty
and not deal with the real root causes of
poverty.
Another priority must be to evolve a suitable yardstick to measure poverty over a wide
area. We already have some yardsticks in our
statutes. For example, in the guaranteed
annual income legislation we have the figure
of $1,260 for a single old age pensioner, or
$2,520 for an elderly couple. In the War Veterans Allowance Act we have a figure of $2,940 maximum permissible income, and that
figure applies to couples. This statistical yardstick works a particular hardship on young
veterans under 60 years of age who are trying
to bring up children. These young veterans
cannot qualify unless they are unemployable,
and being unemployable they cannot add to
their income through casual earnings as can
people over 60 or people able to work. Many
of these disabled veterans, who are not suffering because of their war disability but are
nevertheless disabled, are trying to bring up

SENATE DEBATES
families, yet their only income is $2,940,
which constitutes some sort of yardstick
which has been worked out to measure their
needs.
Then there is the magie figure of $3,000 for
a family of four. I am not sure where this
figure originated, but the Government has
given it some sanction by using it as a basis
for some ARDA programs. Bearing in mind
the postal strike, it would be interesting to
know how the earnings of many of our government employees who are employed on a
casual or prevailing rate basis-and I think
the committee should make an inquiry into
this-compare with the figures I have just
quoted as to the poverty level.
Finally there is the yardstick suggested by
the Economic Council. This yardstick describes the poverty level as when 70 per cent
of a person's income is expended on food,
shelter and clothing. This yardstick has the
advantage of fiexibility and almost universal
application. Whether the percentage should
be 60, 70 or 75 is a refinement the committee
should be able to determine. However, this
yardstick is not entirely satisfactory in that it
leaves open the question of what should be
the minimum acceptable standards for shelter, food and clothing. A person may spend 70
per cent of his income on these three items,
but his house may still not be fit to live in, or
the food may be extravagant, or the household finances may not be properly managed.
If some way can be found to work out a
qualitative and quantitative standard for
food, shelter and clothing the Economic
Council yardstick affords, in my opinion, the
best method by which the true dimensions of
poverty in Canada can be meaningfully
measured.
This year Canada will spend $3 billion plus
on various welfare programs, and that does
not leave much room for additional anti-poverty programs. Senator Cook points out in his
speech a few days ago the dangers of overburdening our economy. Indeed, it seems that
our economy may already be over-burdened.
Senator Croll also emphasized that the committee must find answers which will not
impoverish the taxpayers. Nevertheless, the
Economic Council raises the question whether
Canada can afford not to eliminate poverty.
Apart from the human degradation, suffering
and privation, the committee must try to
assess in dollars and cents the results of
poverty in terms of crime and lost production
and balance that against the cost of remedial
programs, which can be worked out in terms

October 17, 1968

of goals and priorities and implemented
progressively as the capacity of the economy
to support them increases.
Senator Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche)
in his excellent speech made a point by quoting a text from Scripture, namely, "The poor
will always be among us." When Our Lord
spoke these words I think that He was thinking in terms of mankind in general and not of
one particular group or region. When we contemplate the massive proportions of poverty
throughout the world, in Asia and Africa,
there is no reason to doubt the literal truth of
that statement.
The Economic Council bas pointed out that
poverty is a relative term. Poverty in Canada,
bad as it is, cannot be equated with poverty
in India or Asia, where millions are born on
the street, grow up, and die on the street,
without ever having had a roof over their
heads or any possessions of their own.
If one accepts a definition of poverty as
related to average standards of a community
or area, then poverty will always be with us,
because as the standard of living rises in a
community or area, the poverty level will rise
with it. In an affluent society like that of
Canada, there should be no real poverty, particularly among the sick, the aged or handicapped, and there can be no "just society"
until it is eliminated.
There is no need to refer to the causes of
poverty. We all know about them. These have
been enumerated by the Economic Council
and Senator Croll covered them extensively
in his speech. They are the lack of earnings,
seasonal work, insufficient earnings, low
wages, poor health, insufficient education,
and lack of skills.
However, Senator Fournier (MadawaskaRestigouche) did mention one cause which
merits consideration. He pointed out that
some people are poor because they are too
honest, and some are poor because others are
not honest enough. He referred to people who
spend incomes on non-essentials and still
manage to get welfare payments. No doubt
this practice increases the difficulty of
administration and results in hardship in
some cases, while genuine need goes unrecognized and unmet.
In the same category belong those employers who discontinue their private pensions to
employees when those employees reach the
age to qualify for old age security. A very
dear friend of mine, now long gone to his
reward, used to say: "There is enough in this

October 17, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

world for everybody's need, but not enough
for everybody's greed." Every day, the truth
of that observation becomes more evident.
There is no doubt in my mind that the
poverty we see around us derives in large
measure from the materialistic values by
which our action are governed, as compared
to the spiritual values, to which we give only
lip service. That being so, a moral uplift on a
national scale will go a long way towards
solving the problem.
Honourable senators, in conclusion, I think
we must recognize that poverty in Canada is
in some ways related to poverty abroad. If the
Portuguese people had a higher standard of
living, it would not pay them to come all the
way to Newfoundland to catch fish, because
we could produce fish much more cheaply for
them and our fishermen would be consequently better off.
If the Caribbean peoples had higher
incomes, they could afford to pay higher
prices for our salt fish on which they depend
for protein.
I am personally convinced that any solution
to poverty in Canada, to be satisfactory and
lasting, must be worked out within the moral
framework on which our democratic society
is built. If such a solution can be found, it
will be applicable not only to Canada but to
the world at large.
Honourable senators, I believe that Senator
Croll's motion to inquire into poverty in
Canada contains one of the greatest challenges ever presented to this chamber. It is a
gigantic task, but I cannot think of any cause
more noble or more worthy of the talents and
experience represented in this chamber. I
hope it will receive unanimous support.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. J. Harper Prowse: Honourable senaors, the proposal put before us in this resolution moved by Senator Croll affords the
Senate of Canada an opportunity to perform a
most necessary and vital service for this
country and its future. I can think of nothing
more important to those of us who are alive
today and who expect to see tomorrow, than
to ensure that everything we can do is done
to provide opportunities for those who will be
here tomorrow to live at least as well as we
are able to live today.
I was shocked on reading in the newspapers some excerpts from the Report of the
Economic Council dealing with poverty, in
which the Council indicated that more than
four million Canadians-and you can play

with the figures, depending on the line you
wish to take-are living on incomes which
cannot possibly provide them access to the
supply of goods and services necessary to
permit them to feel that they are enjoying a
reasonable share of the good things which
this Canada has to offer to its people and in
which you and I often take pride.
Honourable senators, it is not my intention
to insult your intelligence or try your
patience, by seeking to make your hearts
bleed for the individual cases of poverty and
the effects of it. I take it for granted that
each of us is aware of individual instances
which have made our own hearts bleed and
which would make the hearts of others bleed
also. There is no need for a dreary repetition
of these sad effects, in order to grasp the
importance of the situation. Rather, should I
like to appeal to you, and through you to the
people of Canada, to approach this problem
not merely with Christian sympathy, which
we can take for granted, but in an attitude of
enlightened self-interest. In other words, it
seems to me that the reason why we must
take hold of and deal with this problem of
poverty, or the complexities of problems
which make up what is called the problem of
poverty, is that unless we do so we may find
ourselves in a most difficult and unexpected
position. We must bear in mind that the theory of democracy assumes some reasonable
degree of equality between those people who
are participants in this form of government.
When one finds large sections of the community living in conditions which are different
from those of other sections of the community, then that difference becomes the only
basis for their approach to problems, and that
kind of approach to problems can be a rock
which will smash democracy to pieces. Hungry men are not apt to think too clearly.
Frightened people do not think too clearly.
Democracy functions not for hungry people,
not for frightened people, but in the long run
it functions well when people have confidence
in it.
The absolute figures of the number of
unemployed in any one place at any one time
do not necessarily give us an indication of the
seriousness of the problem. The seriousness of
the problem from the point of view of its
effect upon the other portions of society in
the country as a whole depends rather upon
how long people remain unemployed, whether
their condition is temporary or if they have
a reasonable expectation of improving their
position, or whether they are locked into this
state of deprivation and have lost hope of

SENATE DEBATES

getting out. Once we allow deprivation to
continue for long enough that the person who
is suffering from it becomes locked in and
feels helpless to get out, and feels that nobody cares whether he gets out or not, then
we are heading for a situation which can only
result in disaster.
I think it may be true to say that one of the
reasons the United States, our great and powerful neighbour to the south, is suffering the
tremendous problems it is with its rash of
disorders, is that it has too many people of a
minority race who for too long have suffered
obvious deprivation, or deprivation which
was obvious to them every time they looked
around, and they have become convinced that
nobody cares.
The efforts that have suddenly been
brought about to ameliorate the situation
down there have perhaps come too late.
Because one of the strange things about
human nature is that a man can go without
something if he is alone and does not know
somebody else has it. In such a case he will
never miss it. You never need a Cadillac until you see somebody else enjoying one. You
do not have to keep up with the Joneses, if
there are no Joneses within your sight. But
when a person sees that he is able to enjoy
only substantially less than his neighbours in
other sections of society whom he sees frequently-and now that we have television he
sees them all-his first reaction is interest,
perhaps surprise. His next reaction is envy;
envy then grows into resentment, and resentment fanned by neglect or a feeling of
neglect, can grow into hate and hate will
progress by normal steps into violence.
I may be overdramatic, but I think not too
much, if I say that unless we allow ourselves
the luxury of permitting our hearts, and perhaps even our pocketbooks, to bleed a little
for those in our country who are deprived,
regardless of the reason, we may in the
future become familiar with the sight of
blood in our streets.
To me this is the crux of the problem. I do
not know whether we have within our means
in Canada today the ability to solve the problem by mere redistribution of income. I
would seriously doubt if that is the way this
problem can be solved. There are certain sectors of our community, and they have been
mentioned-the aged, the disabled and other
persons who realize they cannot help themselves-who can have their problems solved
as well as possible by either private or public
charity at a reasonable level. But I think we

October 17, 1968

must remember that there are four needs
which are basic in every human being, four
drives which command our life and its enjoyment.
The first is the instinct to do what needs to
be donc to continue the race-the instinct for
race preservation. The second is the instinct
for self protection. But what is sometimes not
so readily realized is that there is in every
man a third need, one for a feeling of self
expression, of doing something where he simply says, "This is me." Ordinarily we associate that feeling with the artist's work, but it
is truc of every man. He must have some
chance of that feeling of self expression or his
life becomes hollow and unsatisfactory. Finally, every man must have a feeling that he is
approved by his fellowmen. He may select
either a large or a small group to get approvai from.
These are the four basic drives, and a person who is able, or feels he is able, to do
something useful and wants to live his whole
life doing something more than merely
receiving and being fed without making any
contribution, is going to be a continuous
threat to the ability of other members of society to continue to live in peace and happiness.
We have to realize, therefore, that what we
are talking about in attacking the problem of
poverty is not merely providing the money to
make a payoff today so that people can get
enough to eat. The problem is to try to find
out why these people do not have enough.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Hear, hear.
Hon.

Mr. Prowse: And

then to provide

those who are able to take this kind of help
with the help they need so that they will not
need any more help.
Society can be divided generally into three
types of people: those who are gifted by God
with special abilities enabling them to look
after themselves with some to spare; those, at
the other end of the spectrum, who have not
been so gifted or so well endowed and who
just are not capable of looking after themselves; and those-the biggest mass of people-who form the group in between and
who, if given reasonable opportunity, will be
able to look after themselves reasonably
satisfactorily.
Our goal must be to see to it that nobody
who is able to help himself should have to be
in or should be permitted to remain in the
area where he is dependent on others for
help.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I wonder if the
honourable senator will permit me a question.

lism and Freedom. In any event, some of you
who have been in the Senate for years may
remember that prior to 1948, or about the
time you were dealing in committee with the
problems of the old age pension, a man by
the name of Anderson-I think it was Robert
Anderson-who I believe was Vice-President
of the North American Life Insurance Company in Canada, appeared before the Senate
committee and recommended the possible
adoption of a form of negative income tax.
I think most of us know that a negative
income tax is based on the following assumption. There are several forms, but this will do
for one. Everybody who is making an income
above a certain level has to file an income tax
return. There are individuals entitled to certain basic deductions, and if their incomes
rise above that level after the deductions,
they pay taxes. Any person whose income is
below that level is deprived of the opportunity of taking the deductions because he has
nothing to take it against.
Let me just give you some idea of how
frustrating it is to try to find out what economists really mean and think. I am going to
read from Newsweek dated September 16,
1968, an article written by Milton Friedman
entitled "Negative Income Tax-I" which is
the first article on it. He says:
This plan is intended to replace completely our present programs of direct
relief-aid to dependent children, public
assistance, and so on. For the first year or
two, it might cost slightly more than
these programs-because it is so much
more comprehensive in coverage. But, as
the incentive effects of the plan started to
work, it would begin to cost far less than
the present exploding direct-assistance
programs that are creating a permanent
class of people on welfare.

Hon. Mr. Prowse: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: If I understood him
correctly, he just suggested that no one
should be permitted to remain in an area
where he cannot obtain work. Would you use
force to move people out of an area where
they cannot get work?
Hon. Mr. Prowse: I must have expressed
myself badly if I left that impression. If I
said that, I was in error. What I intended to
say is that our goal and our aim should be to
produce a situation in Canada by attacking
this problem so that it will not be necessary
for anybody who is able to work to look to
society for assistance. If there are opportunities which a man deliberately turns his back
on, then we have a problem with which I am
afraid I do not have much sympathy. I think
that the individual has as much responsibility
to society as society has to the individual.
Perhaps that answers the honourable member's question.
Now, when we discuss this, I suggest that
we do not mislead anyone. If we give the
indication that the solution to this problem is
going to be quick, easy or simple I would
venture to guess that there is no simple
explanation, no single cause, and no simple
cure.
I have been impressed by the reference
which was made to guaranteed minimum
incomes and negative income taxes. I think
most of us would agree that a guaranteed
minimum income represents a fairly reasonable way of dealing with our responsibility to
people who have reached the age where they
no longer ought to be worrying about where

SENATE DEBATES
income tax out of state funds-preferably
by enacting a supplementary state negative income tax.
This man, in the second article, does a
complete about-face. In the first article he
says that this will be a complete replacement
of all other welfare programs. Then, in his
second article, he proposes state supplements
to the scheme.
We then have Paul A. Samuelson who also
wrote an article for Newsweek dated June 10,
1968, and he referred to this fact:
Last week more than 1,200 economists,
from 150 different colleges and universitics, signed what may be an historically
significant petition.
What they did was to ask the Government of
the United States to introduce a negative
income tax. This is what he says it is going to
cost:
An appreciable beginning could be made
by the new Congress in the year just
ahead for $5 billion net-i.e., $7.5 billion
gross minus $2.5 billion saved on present
welfare.
In other words, it is going to cost thern
three times as much as they are complaining
about paying now. Friedman says it will cost
hardly anything at all.
There is another danger in this scheme. Let
us say that a particular man, if he were to
pay taxes, would have a basic exemption of
$3,000 per year. If we make up the whole of
the deficiency between his actual income and
this base figure, then we would pay a man
with no income the entire $3,000. Obviously,
it would be foolish to work when you could
get $3,000 for doing nothing at all.
Friedman, therefore, would supplement his
actual income by only one half of the difference. That is, the man with no earnings
would receive $1,500, the man with earnings
of $1,000 would receive $1,000. The man with
earnings of $2,000 would receive $500. In
other words, every one dollar of earnings
would reduce his grant by 50 cents.
I suggest that the man with earnings is not
going ta be very happy. He is going to say
that because his grant is reduced by 50 cents
for every one dollar he earns that he is in
fact being taxed at the absolute rate of 50 per
cent of earnings. He is going to ask himself,
why am I working when I am not going to be
allowed to keep every dollar I make? Why
should I, with a sub-standard income, when I
.+11 need assistance, be paying 50 per cent

October 17, 1968

tax when fellows making $4,000 are paying
15 per cent? And a person has ta be making
$50,000 or $60,000 a year before lie has to pay
that rate.
Honourable senators, I am merely suggesting these things to you to point out that if
anyone finds the solution to everyone's prob1em, le had better go back and do a little bit
more reading. It is not easy, but the problem
is there and it is important that we should
keep it in mind and do what we can about it.
The thing I want to impress upon you is
that it may be someone's suggestion, as Senator Carter and other speakers suggested, that
because of technological progress and the
incident of automation, we have a different
situation today than that which resulted from
the industrial revolution. The introduction of
machines then made it possible for people
running them to make other machines; and
the kind of machines we have today take
smart and highly educated people to make
them, and smart and highly skilled people to
operate them.
Then we look at the numbers of unemployed and we see that two-thirds of them
did not get to grade 8 in school, and we think
that there must be some causal connection
here. It is rather like taking the two-thirds of
the world's population who have never had a
full belly from the day they were born to the
day they die and relating that to the twothirds who have never learned to read or
write. But is it not just possible that the man
who has a low income and a low education is
in this situation for some third basic cause?
There has not been enough research of the
right kind done. Much research has been done
by economists but we require much to be
donc by psychologists and sociologisis. When
this committee calls for experts, let it get the
right kind of experts, because the biggest
mistakes are made when you get an answer
to a medical problem from a lawyer, or ask a
doctor the answer to a political problem.
Let me sum up by saying that there is
grave danger in this situation. Rome in its
final days is remembered because it was the
city of bread and cireuses. The balance of
political power was in the hands of the mobs
who were unemployed, who lived on the
handouts of the state, which also provided
them with entertainment. We must keep in
mind that if we allow the situation to arise in
this country where a very large percentage of
the people who hold the balance of power
lose hope of any chance of improving their
situation, and leave them in the position

October 17, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

where they are dependent for the food they
eat on the largesse of the people whom they
elect to office, and for entertainment on the
TV which is provided for them, then we are,
as sure as God made little green apples,
doomed to go the same way as the Roman
Empire and other empires have gone. Let us
learn from the past and be warned by it, and
let us now, before it is too late, take the
opportunity to do what can be done to ensure
that every Canadian is able to take advantage
of the tremendous opportunities and challenges which this country offers to us.
Hon. Hedard Robichaud: Honourable senators, rising for the first time to participate in
a debate in the Senate, may I be permitted to
mention how very favourably impressed I
have been with the high calibre of speeches
delivered by members of this chamber since
the opening of the first session of Canada's
28th Parliament.
May I also be allowed at this time to offer
my warmest and most sincere congratulations
to the Speaker, the honourable Senator Deschatelets. Like some of my colleagues I had
the privilege of sitting with him in the House
of Commons, first as a backbencher on the
Government side, then as a member of Her
Majesty's Loyal Opposition, and finally in the
cabinet. He has always been a loyal colleague,
always ready to serve his party and his country. I wish to join with those who have spoken before me in extending to Mr. Speaker our
best wishes in the high office he now
occupies.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robichaud: There is very little I
could add to what has been said so far in
praise and appreciation of our new Leader of
the Government, the honourable Senator Paul
Martin. With him also I had the privilege of
sitting in the other place, and while I also
was in a position to admire and recognize his
experience and ability as a colleague in the
Government as a member of the cabinet,
there was also another brief phase of his
political career which I shared with him and
which I have not forgotten. I refer to those
years when sitting to the left of the Speaker
as a member of a small Opposition force of
fewer than 50 members, one had to become
almost overnight practically an expert on
such subjects as external affairs, agriculture,
fisheries, mining, the coal problems of Cape
Breton, statistics affecting our labour force,
Indians and Eskimos, and as my honourable
friend will remember, even on wheat,
29234-211

potatoes and soya beans. In other words, the
Canadian Senate is fortunate to have among
its members such a worthy parliamentarian, a
man of the experience and knowledge of our
Government Leader. I also wish him well in
his new and responsible assignment.
Honourable senators, I must admit that as
a newly appointed member of this chamber I
had made up my mind to sit and listen for
some months at least before participating in a
debate. However, after listening carefully to
the mover of the motion now before us, I
could not resist the temptation to express, at
least in a few words, my humble views on
this important subject.
May I congratulate Senator Croll for having given the Senate the opportunity to meet
this challenge of the Economic Council of
Canada where in its Fifth Annual Review,
released a few weeks ago, it suggested that
the Senate of Canada might consider the
advisability of creating a committee to
inquire into the problem of poverty in Canada and to inquire into all aspects of poverty,
urban and rural, and, what is more important, to define and elucidate this problem of
poverty and to build public support for more
effective structure of remedial measures.
Senator Croll's motion is drafted, as he
himself stated, in response to that challenge,
and in my humble opinion it must be considered by this house as one of urgency which
must be acted upon with diligence and with
the main objective of meeting head on the
serious problems of poverty which plague and
harass our society in the midst of plenty and
affluence.
In its review the council states that poverty
is not identical with simple income deficiency,
but it adds that it is also a state of mind.
There is no doubt that such a state of mind
which, unfortunately, is too common among
thousands and thousands of our Canadians, is
destructive of family life, destructive of personal initiative, destructive of our economicgrowth and has the effect of freezing a segment of our population into a permanent
guardian-ward relationship, thus resulting in
creating a socio-economic level which is destroying or reducing almost to a nullity the
potential capacity of such individuals.
In the course of this debate, futile attempts:
have been made to find a real and just definition for the word "poverty". It is only logical,
when dealing with such a controversial but
real problem, that opinions will vary, that
each individual approach to the problem will
be different, and that solutions offered will

SENATE DEBATES
cover a broad field, some more practical than
others and some probably irrealistic or even
physically impossible.
Some have defined poverty as applying to
those who are denied the minimum levels of
health, housing, food and education. As a
result of being deprived of such normal living
needs, a society is created in which a too
large segment of its people are internal exiles
who develop attitudes of defeat and pessimism, and are excluded from taking advantage of new opportunities. I am convinced
that no one in this chamber for one moment
believes that poverty can be corrected or
cured overnight by such social welfare measures as those in existence in our country at
this time.
There is much talk today of a "just society," of equal opportunities for all. Such a
worthy
objective, however, cannot be
achieved by the full implementation or even
by an accentuation of existing or additional
welfare measures. Social welfare, by itself,
will not cure or even properly alleviate the
great tragedy of poverty in our midst, even in
a country of wealth and abundance like ours.
One must admit, however, that those who
have not, those who are deprived of essential
needs, those who are poor in the real sense of
the word, must have not only Government
help but must also receive assistance from
that segment of our society that can well
afford to share the essential components of at
least a minimum standard which will allow
dignity and decency to a much larger proportion of our population.
The 160 or so existing programs of social
welfare in this country, while providing an
ad hoc type of relief to those who suffer the
most, are far from being adequate to meet
Canada's acute problem of poverty. It is true
that we have in Canada particular aspects of
underdevelopment or underemployment that
are more evident in certain regions, where
regional disparities must be reduced if all
parts of our country are to share equally in
our economic growth and development.
Already the present Government has
moved towards the consolidation of all
regional development programs into a single
department. This is a move in the right direction, but this reorganization alone will not
provide the assistance or measures required
to bring those regions on to a near equal basis
with the rest of Canada.

October 17, 1968

[Translation]
Honourable senators, since be entered politics, I have not always agreed with the views
expressed by our colleague on the other side
of the house, my friend the senator for
Madawaska-Restigouche, the Honourable Edgar Fournier. On many occasions and in many
circumstances we have expressed totally different ideas and opinions. I must admit, however, that I fully endorse the ideas he expressed in this house on Wednesday, October
9, during his remarks on the motion under
consideration. 1-le said then that we both come
from regions of Canada which are recognized
as the poorest in the country and designed or
recognized as regions of poverty, misery and
suff ering.
I wish to be the first to admit that in our
Atlantic provinces there are poor regions; we
have centres where poverty, misery and suffering prevail. Like my colleague from
Madawaska-Restigouche, I have to admit also
that unfortunately, mass media, newspapers,
radio and television, give too much importance to those reports, which are often
exaggerated and false, which shamefully
make capital out of misery and hardships
experienced by part of the people of our
Atlantic provinces. As my colleague pointed
out, I realize that, too often alas, these same
organisations make no effort whatsoever to
bring to the attention of an ill-informed
public the progress made by our governments, by our people and by our society, in
improving the lot of the people in those
provinces where obstacles to overcome are
more difficult and require more efforts and
sacrifices.
Honourable senators, those conditions exist
in other Canadian centres; they exist in
centres usually considered prosperous; they
exist in the vicinity of our large centres
such as Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver, Ottawa, and elsewhere.
I fail to understand how a crown corporation such as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation-now financed by over $150 million
annually in taxpayers money-can allow itself to offer its audience, from sea to sea,
programs such as those we have witnessed in
recent years on the national network. One
would think that the people responsible for
the production of those programs take pride
in exploiting as grossly as possible that misery
or that poverty which, without denying that
it exists to a certain extent, should not be
subjected to that exploitation, often false and
exaggerated. It is not suprising that an old

October 17, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

fellow in that area could say to his interviewer on the matter, as my colleague, Senator Fournier mentioned:
A bunch of idiots from Ottawa spent
the summer taking pictures and acting
the fools.
[English]
HonourabIe senators, a country which is in
a position to provide over $150 million a year
to its national system of radio and television
should also exercise the type of supervision
and control over such an agency which would
assure its taxpayers that this money is well
spent, to its best advantage and in their
interests.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robichaud: It seems to me that
the C.B.C. could better use the funds at its
disposal than depicting for its listeners and
viewers the worst scenes of slums, poverty,
misery and poor education that it has been
able to detect in any of the Atlantic
provinces.
I recall seeing in recent years C.B.C. programs on our Atlantic fisheries, programs
which would lead the general public to
believe that Canada had the most outmoded
and backward fisheries, that its fishing methods and techniques were most obsolete and
inefficient.
The facts are that our country's progress
and development in this particular field compare favourably to any of the fishing nations
of the world. This you will not believe to be
true if you depend for your information on
our nationally owned and operated system of
radio and television.
The Atlantic provinces, although generally recognized as a distressed or have-not
area, have much to offer in industrial possibilities or potentials, and adequate and
qualified manpower, as well as in natural
resources waiting to be developed and put to
efficient and profitable use. The Atlantic
provinces have as great, if not a greater, tourist potential than any other area of this
country. You would not think so if you
depend only on the type of propaganda provided to you through the C.B.C.
Honourable senators, I hope that I am
being understood. I am not denying that the
income distribution in our area of the Maritimes is far below the national average. I am
not denying that there exist in our midst
pockets of poverty, and levels of health,
housing, food and education which are below
the national average. We must admit also that

a wide variety of efforts have been made to
move our people out of poverty. We have to
admit, however, that the results achieved so
far cannot be accepted as altogether satisfactory, and new measures and incentives should
be introduced if we are to meet the challenge
of the present generation. Our modern concept of meeting this urgent problem must be
different. The attack must be different, and a
thoroughly revised and up-to-date creative
approach must be made if the poverty problem of today's world is not to be perpetuated.
Where is the answer? Where is the proper
machinery to deal with existing situations?
How can we, as a body, best contribute to
assure our country and our people of a just
society, of equal opportunity in a land of
plenty?
Honourable senators, the motion presently
under consideration, while not providing by
itself all the answers to this acute problem,
offers us, to say the least, the challenge, and
the opportunity to work for the national
good, to work for a country of which we have
every reason to be proud. It offers us the
opportunity to increase our usefulness, and
the opportunity to promote further this
national unity which is the concern of each
and every one of us. In accepting the present
motion we can prove to this country that we
recognize the fundamental principles of a
"just society," and of equal opportunity for
all.
As stated in the Fifth Annual Review of
the Economic Council, the work of a committee such as is suggested in the present
motion, could do much to define and elucidate
the problem of poverty in Canada, and to
build support for more effective structure of
remedial measures.
Honourable senators, like those who have
preceded me in this debate, I do not pretend
to have all or any of the complete answers to
this crucial, acute, and disagreeable problem
of poverty. It has been said that growing
wealth will not, of itself, solve the problem of
poverty. It is true that with increased wellbeing, the position of those left behind could
worsen and become perhaps even more
shameful. We see this situation in many countries. It is a well-recognized fact that the poor
are those who for reasons of location, education, health, environment in life, mental deficiency, or even of race, are not in a position
to participate effectively in the economic life
of a nation; those people who, whether they
want it or not, live in deprivation. The question before us is: How can they be rescued?

SENATE DEBATES
Public efforts, and public funds well spent,
can assist in relieving such conditions or
situations. Whether it is by applying civil
rights, by promoting proper education, by
increasing employment, by correcting slum
conditions, or by any other measures at our
disposal, we have to admit together that
something can and must be done to solve the
problem of poverty.
It is not by crying and promoting strikes or
quiet revolutions that poverty in Canada will
be cured, or even alleviated. I am not against
the right of labour to strike, but I am one of
those who believe that in our country, particularly in recent years, there have been too
many uncalled for stoppages of work, too
many man-production hours lost, and that
today we are reaping what has been sown.
I sincerely hope that a special committee of
the Senate, if and when it be called upon to
investigate and report upon all aspects of
poverty in Canada, and if and when it recommends appropriate action to ensure the establishment of a more effective structure of
remedial measures, will give proper emphasis
to education, the lack of which today, I feel,
is one of the prominent causes of poverty in
our midst. Personally, I am concerned about,
and almost alarmed by, the course of events
taking place today in our Canadian universities. We have witnessed such reaction in
many foreign countries, but not all of us ever
thought that such events could take place in
our own institutions in the year 1968.

October 17, 1968

However, I am asking myself: What else
could we expect? Our students have also
witnessed, just as well as we have, this growing tendency in recent years, among young
and old, to disregard all forms of authority
whether civil or religious, and even within
family life. What else could we expect when
some of our own universities, without screening whatsoever, have accepted or even
imported from other countries a certain number of professors or lecturers whose main
objective in life has been to promote, encourage, and even practise these types of revolutionary ideas which are so evident today on
their campuses. What can we expect from our
future generation when university students
state publicly that they have to support strike
movements, and express ideas contrary to
their own, in fear of being deprived of their
passing marks by those responsible for assessing their examination papers?
Education, I will admit, does not come
within federal jurisdiction, but nevertheless
we have every reason to be alarmed by what
is taking place today in our schools, colleges,
and universities.
Honourable senators, it is with great pleasure, and with no hesitation, that I endorse
Senator Croll's motion. I express the hope
that this house will see fit to give this motion
its unanimous and unlimited approval.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Macdonald, for Hon.
Mr. O'Leary (Carleton), debate adjourned.

HON. PAUL MARTIN, P.C.
TESTIMONIAL DINNER GIVEN BY MAYOR AND
CITY OF WINDSOR

Hon. Rheal Belisle: Honourable senators,
having had the privilege last Friday evening
of being one of the many invited guests on
the occasion of the testimonial dinner by
the City of Windsor in appreciation for the
services of the Honourable Paul Martin, I am
taking the liberty of expressing the Senate's
thanks and appreciation for his appointment
as Leader of the Government in this house. I
am sure that al honourable senators will
approve this gesture.

The Prime Minister the Right Honourable
Pierre Elliott Trudeau, and two former prime
ministers, the Right Honourable Lester B.
Pearson and the Right Honourable John G.
Diefenbaker, eloquently told numerous anecdotes about our leader's qualities, talents and
contributions in serving his former riding of
Essex East, his country and, indeed, humanity. More than 1,100 persons, representing all
fields of national and international affairs,
gathered in the Cleary Auditorium in Windsor to honour the veteran political warrior
whom this august chamber is privileged to
have as its Government Leader.
I believe that we Canadians are always toc
reluctant to recognize our great men. We
seern to find pride in them only after they
have departed from the Senate. It is my
intention briefly to record my admiration for
a great Canadian, the Honourable Paul Martin, and to express my belief that this man,
who has played an outstanding role in the
other place, will by his wisdom and skill contribute in very large degree to making the
Senate of Canada a strong and steady influence in national and world affairs.
Senator Martin comes to us with a vast
wealth of experience. The test of time under
three government administrations has given
him the opportunity to demonstrate the qualities of foresight, application, talent and energy in many varied vital fields. Certainly this
will greatly assist him in carrying out his
duties as Senate leader on a high level.
His life has been characterized by an
aggressive pursuit of difficult goals. Nothing
has come easily to him; each achievement has
been won at the cost of careful planning and
infinite attention to detail. His self-confidence
at times approaches boldness, and above all a
driving energy directs his every active
moment into serious activity.
Our colleague bas achieved much. At the
age of four he fought and won against spinal
meningitis. He worked his way through university and law school in Canada and won
postgraduate scholarships in the United
States, Great Britain and Switzerland. He was
elected to the House of Commons for the riding of Essex East at the youthful age of 32.
At the age of 33 he was leading Canadian
youth delegations abroad, and at 35 he was
an official Canadian delegate to the League of
Nations.
It impressed Senator Martin, in his visit to
Dieppe in 1945, that Canada was really a
mosaic composed of Anglo Saxon, French,
Irish, Ukrainian, German, Italian and many

SENATE DEBATES
other ethnic groups, all of which are a valued
part of our Canadian fabric. He vowed that,
if ever he had the opportunity, he would do
something to emphasize this communion of
nationalities in Canada.
Fired by memories of this emotional
moment in the Dieppe cemetery, Senator
Martin moved quickly to prepare the Canadian Citizenship Act of 1946, which was the
forerunner of, and model for, similar legislation in Britain and all other Commonwealth
countries.
His vigor and drive transformed the infant
Canadian social welfare program. He added
an entirely new concept of federal responsibility in health matters and changed the
Department of Health and Welfare from a
minor portfolio to one of the most vital
departments of government.
His vast knowledge of political science,
coupled with a great gift of human psychology, assisted him immensely in convincing
Mackenzie King's cabinet that health and
welfare legislation was of prime importance.
It was, in a sense, an architectural design of
all the future social programs that were
enacted by Liberal governments.
Honourable senators, the Honourable Paul
Martin's respect as a world diplomat was due
also to the fact that he was one of the besteducated foreign ministers in the world.
His length of service in the House of Commons, and his vast political sagacity made
him indisputably the No. 2 man in the St.
Laurent and Pearson governments.
He is sometimes accused of "talking
around" a subject, a perfectly natural tendency in a man who must harbour many
diplomatic secrets and whose every statement
is examined by foreign governments for indications of new policy.
Senator Martin's accomplishments at the
United Nations and at the NATO Council
meetings made me feel proud to be a member
of those teams. He won the confidence and
respect of many small nations and gave to
Canada the reputation of being an independent country willing to take the initiative even
in the face of opposition from great powers.
His excellent work in the Cyprus crisis, with
the peacekeeping force, though very costly
for Canada, undoubtedly headed off a potential war between Greece and Turkey. That
combined with his constant efforts over the
past few years in breaking the deadloci: over
the Vietnam war should qualify him as a
candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize.

October 22, 1968

Senator Martin's superb talents as a politician have for many years tended to obscure
the fact that he is an intellectual, a scholar
and an academician. These attributes have
been more noticeable since he became Government Leader in the Senate.
This is a humble tribute to a great Canadian. To do him full justice, it would be necessary to deliver a much longer testimonial.
[Translation]
Honourable senators, I would be remiss if I
did not tell the honourable Paul Martin how
proud French-speaking Ontario is to count
him among its most noble and distinguished
sons.
As honorary president of the FrenchCanadian Association of Education of Ontario
and also as president of the board of governors of the University of Sudbury, may I
express the great regard we have for you and
our gratitude for everything you have
accomplished.
You have always been one of our most able
defenders not only in Ontario, but in Canada
as a whole. The very fact that you were born
in our capital bestowed on you the responsibility of being one of our most spirited and
eminent fellow-citizens.
Your family's decision to settle in the
Ottawa valley made you realize not only the
sacrifices needed to get a bilingual education
but also the advantages it offered and the
need for it, a need which becomes more and
more obvious if one wants to contribute fully
to the development of the Canadian nation.
Your wide knowledge in many fields, but
especially in the field of social justice, made
you realize that when one undertakes to
rebuild one finds out that to do something
useful and to break new ground, one must
start from what has been achieved already,
from a set of values which are as many
materials and tools accumulated by previous
generations.
The philosopher Gustave Thibon put it
very well in these words:
One does not build the roof of a building
with stones torn from the foundations.
Progress does not consist in destroying the
past, but in building upon it and in going
beyond it.
With your great knowledge of the problems
of Ontario and of Canada, you have, with the
dignity of a great statesman, greatly contributed in international circles to make people realize that, in order to adjust to these

new times, one must not relinquish essential
values and reject one's heritage entirely.
The French fact of today would not have
been possible without the wisdom of your
fights and of the efforts of all those who live
outside the beautiful province. These constitute in fact, the essential phenomenon which
summarizes and characterizes bilingualism in
our country.
When the many pages of the history of
Ontario, as well as that of Canada, are written, I am sure the name of the honourable
Paul Martin will stand in the forefront; his
contribution will have been considerable; his
ideal should inspire many young Canadians.
Yet, fate willed that three times, at three
different stages of your political career, you
should fail to accede to the leadership. But
the future of the Senate, its very survival,
depended perhaps on that decisive factor in
your career. In these very difficult times we
are going through, a man with your experience, your talents and specially your prestige
could guide Canadians and make them
understand that the Senate is one of the two
legislative houses needed in our country, that
as long as it remains active and respected,
Canada will remain whole.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
[English]
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, I
have been taken by surprise by the very
generous remarks of Senator Belisle who sits
opposite. In all humility, I thank him for
his very kind references to me. I am sure
there are many who will join with me in
recognizing that he has exaggerated my worth,
but I assure him this exaggeration is greatly
appreciated.
The city from which I come did want to
mark my departure from the House of Commons by a special occasion, and Prime Minister Trudeau, Mr. Diefenbaker, Mr. Pearson,
the representative of Mr. Stanfield, the leaders
of other political parties and members of both
Houses of Parliament were good enough to
attend. The many friends who were present,
and those who sent messages expressing their
regrets at not being present, honoured me in a
way that I had no right at any time to expect.
I thank the Senator for having been there
himself, and more particularly for putting
this generous and kind tribute on our record
today.
[Translation]
I should like to express to honourable
Senator Bélisle my most sincere thanks for
29234-22

his kind words. Last Friday's celebration in
Windsor will always be for me and my family
an unforgettable event. The speech he delivered today is further proof of our indebtedness to him. My feelings of admiration and
friendship for the honourable senator are
great indeed.
[English]
I thank honourable senators for their warm
response to Senator Belisle's kind remarks.
It remains for me to live up to what I said
when I spoke to the citizens of Windsor, that
i my judgment this is a very valuable institution of Parliament, and that regardless of
our political affiliations we are all working in
this house for the good of our country and of
our generation.

SENATE DEBATES

POVERTY IN CANADA
MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL
COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, October 17, the adjourned debate on the motion of
the honourable Senator Croll that a special
committee of the Senate be appointed to
investigate and report upon all aspects of
poverty in Canada.
Hon. M. Gratan O'Leary: Honourable senators, I am sure it would be but a time-wasting redundancy if I were to try to go over al
the ground covered so well and so ably by
those who have preceded me in discussing
this motion. But I do want very sincerely to
support this motion, a motion dealing with a
situation which counsels, indeed challenges,
the concern of us all, which, in truth, should
make for the shame of us all.
Relatively speaking, Canada is a rich country: we speak, we often boast of our inexhaustible resources; we speak of our affluent
society. We are obsessed with what we call
our Gross National Product; and, certainly,
we spend vast sums lavishly on material
projects. Yet here in this latest report of the
Economic Council, we have a desolating tale
of degrading poverty of hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of our people living
in an abyss of misery and poverty; the exposure of a situation which surely calls for more
than that worried pity found so often in the
speeches and writings of humanitarians,
which calls for more than mere rhetoric about
a just society, and calls for more than certain
kinds of organized charity, once denounced
by a renowned poet as a "statistical Christ".
As I read that report, there came back to
me Goldsmith's lines from "The Deserted
Village":
Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey,
Where wealth accumulates, and men
decay:
Honourable senators, I have said before in
this house, and I repeat, that the greatness of
a nation must be weighed in scales more delicate than the balance of trade; that strength
cannot be measured only by a nation's
material resources, that its strength must be
measured by the vigour and health of its
population, just as its true glory must always
be found in the happiness of its humbler
homes.
This brings me to our welfare state. With
the philosophy and the principle of the welfare state I cannot disagree, for I am not one
29234-221

of those Conservatives who ling to the venerable and sanctified cliches of a sentimental
capitalism. Nevertheless, I do believe that the
time has come to take a hard and practical
look at our whole social security structure. I
believe, with Senator Muriel Fergusson, that
some of its measures are good. Certainly, we
must never forget that question which has
come to us down through the centuries: Am I
my brother's keeper?
At the same time, I think we should try to
make sure that we are not encouraging indolence, that we are not subsidizing, entrenchpoverty, making
ing and perpetuating
dependence on the state a way of life and
thereby undermining the worth and dignity
of the individual.
As I speak I think of a community in which
I lived as a boy some 70 years ago. The
people who lived there derived their livelihood from the yield of the sea, but also they
had small tidy farms-farms which did not
bring them wealth, but which did give them
security and a sense of manhood and dignity.
From their farms those people derived
everything that was needed for life-at least,
for a comfortable life. They grew their own
grain. They eut it with a sickle, and they
threshed it with a flail. I myself engaged in
those activities. They took that grain to the
local miller, and brought back feed and flour
for their livestock and for themselves. They
killed their cattle, and took the hides to the
local tannery and brought back leather, and
they had that leather made into boots and
shoes by the local shoemaker. They lived by
the light of candles made by themselves.
They sheared their sheep. They put the wool
on the slopes to bleach. They brought it into
the homes and carded it. They spun it into
yarn on old spinning wheels, and then took it
to the looms, which were in most of the
homes, and wove it into good homespun.
All of these things they did in their homes.
While I say this was not affluence, it was not
extreme poverty, and it had the great merit
of preserving the manliness, the dignity, and
the courage of the individual.
I can never forget the haunting beauty of
the shadows caused by sun and cloud over a
waving grainfield. These are the things I
remember of that community. But, what do
I find there now? I find those farms deserted.
I find them overgrown by switchgrass and
weed. I find young men now seemingly content to be guides for tourists, and when
winter comes-and it comes early in November-they revert to handouts from the state.

SENATE DEBATES

That, honourable senators, is an erosion of
what I have called the dignity of the
individual. That is something which, existing
as it does in other parts of the country,
should be looked into very closely by this
committee, if and when it is formed.
The Senate should take a meaningful look
at our social security system, and see what is
good in it-and there is much good in it. Who
can deny the worth and value today of old
age pensions? Certainly not those of us who
were brought up in the countryside. These
things in the system are good, but I fear
greatly that there are other things which are
evil, and which are doing harm to the moral
fibre, to the strength and character of the
Canadian people. These, I think, as much as
poverty itself, should be examined by this
committee.
Honourable senators, when I was a boy I
heard one of our great orators conclude a
speech on poverty with this ringing sentence.
"Gentlemen," he said, "it is a great thing, and
noble, to win the Victoria Cross, but it is a
greater thing, and nobler, to lift up one child
from the pavement to be kissed by the rays
of the sun."
If that be the aim of this committee, then I
think it deserves, and indeed commands, the
support of all of us in this house.
Hon. Clement A. O'Leary: Honourable
senators, this is the first time that I have had
the unenviable experience of following my
namesake. I may tell you that I am not very
happy about it.
Speaking in Hamilton on October 3 of this
year the Minister of Finance, in part, said:
During the past fiscal year the federal
Government spent just about $5 billion
on all kinds of social development programs. This accounted for 40 per cent of
all federal spending and went to pay for
income maintenance programs, health
and social services, economic opportunity
programs and for aid to education.
And he went on:
These extensive programs are generally
designed to alleviate current poverty or
to help adults and young people to obtain
the skills which can lift them from poverty permanently.
Just prior to those words, speaking with
reference to ministers and members of Parliament, Mr. Benson used these words:
... are more closely and vividly aware of
the problem of poverty than are the mem-

October 22, 1968

bers of the Economic Council. And we have
been doing things about poverty for years.
With these latter words he laid the basis
for outlining a number of the more significant
current programs designed to combat poverty.
Senator Croll and other honourable senators
have also spelled out many of these efforts,
indicating their varying degrees of success
and failure. The Economic Council of Canada
did likewise. So, for the most part, these
expressions have indicated no real difference
of views. Thus, there is no disagreement in
that, irrespective of our spending some $5
billion and participating in some 159 programs, poverty still remains a stark reality.
I believe we are all concerned, and that all
Canadians are concerned, as to whether or
not we are receiving even something near
good value for this money. This concern is
naturally shared by recipients and taxpayers
alike. It is obvious then that it is the desire of
all to seek more effective programs that can
render greater service.
This leads me immediately to the question
of, and to an attempt to understand at this
time, what the exact role of this committee
will be when it is set up. You will note that I
do not say "if it is set up."
It is quite easy to visualize most of the
critical areas which require study, but if we
or this committee are to avoid the overlapping and duplication which is decried in the
field of welfare programs themselves, then I
would hope that we may be able to assume
an area of responsibility unto ourselves.
I understand that cabinet committees and
the Government-appointed advisory committees have been, and are, looking at all of
these programs encompassed within the
expenditure of $5 billion in an attempt to
determine if they are accomplishing what was
intended when they were initiated. Considering, too, that in addition to this $5 billion
there is the provinces' shares to be considered, and, as well, those of the municipalities,
it is quite natural that representatives of the
federal Government should be meeting shortly with the treasurers of the provinces in a
joint effort to make a valid assessment of
what we presently have, before initiating
something new, which could be expensive and
only add to the hodge-podge.
In the first instance, I would judge that it
would be the Government's intent to effect
more remedial measures for poverty. And, we
certainly have good reason for thinking that
by a closer co-ordination of the present programs, and a cutting back, or even a removal

October 22, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

of some of them, we might do an equally
good job for less money. I am not imputing
motives, because even I believe that such a
revision could have the intended effect, but
we in this chamber must not and would not
be satisfied to continue the status quo simply
by doing equally as good a job with the same
amount of money or less.
It is felt in some quarters that the current
economic problems of our country have
panicked this Government into cutbacks,
even in this vital and urgent area of poverty,
for example, in disbanding the Special Planning Secretariat of the Privy Council, which
according to the Economic Council had given
promise of being a useful co-ordinating and
information-providing device. Once more I
quote from the same speech by the Minister
of Finance. He said:
Any proper attack on poverty requires
a great deal of study, a great deal of
understanding, many different policies
and many different measures.
Surely a great deal of study has already
been done on this subject, but if we did not
believe that more was required we would not
be considering setting up this committee
which Senator Croll has proposed. A great
deal of understanding must now be had on
the subject, in view of the great publicity
recently given to it, and we must remember
that in the Economic Council's recommendation for such a committee the building of
public support was spelled out as a part of
this chamber's role. I know we would all like
to come up with some simple solution which
would do away with the obvious necessity of
many policies and many different measures,
but I submit that no such pat solution has
been or will be suggested.
Although I listened to Senator Croll's
remarks very carefully and have read and
re-read them, and although I realize that he is
seized with the urgency of the problem of
poverty-as he said, "This is a matter of
urgency, for action now"-I am still not fully
clear how this committee can be truly different from other bodies, past and present, in
the study of this subject. I would agree that
the motion is in broad terms, and is deliberately so, to prevent restriction of the work of
this committee. Perhaps I need just a bit
more of Senator Croll's confidence that this
committee can lead the way in avoiding
previous time-consuming investigations by
selecting witnesses and probing projects that
can best and most expeditiously help us to
define and elucidate the problem, and thereby

insure that our recommendations will be selfevident and acceptable for immediate implementation.
As I read some of the statements of members of government, economists and personnel
engaged by the Government to do studies on
this subject, it seems to me difficult to imagine that any one body at this time will find a
general acceptance of its views, particularly
if they are arrived at in what might be
termed-not by me, mind you-a hurried
manner to meet the urgency of action to
which Senator Croll has referred. The fact
that we are a continuing body might just
possibly not be to our advantage, in that we
would not be pressured by the time element
and could delay making useful recommendations. This, of course, would not meet our
conscientious sense of urgency, and I would
hope that we would not experience great
difficulty in convincing other Canadians of
our genuine concern for action now.
I thought that Senator Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche) made an excellent speech in
this debate. I particularly liked his very personal illustration of what proper assessment,
determination and self-help can do to alleviate what sometimes appears to be a hopeless
situation. In his resumé of the history and
growth of his home credit union Senator
Fournier said little or nothing about that so
necessary quality of leadership. We who
know him and his modesty can quite easily
guess that he played a dominant role in this
area, and we most heartily commend him
for it.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary (Antigonish-Guysborough): As a general statement, I think it can
be said that since the publishing of the Fifth
Report of the Economie Council there is evident, perhaps for the first time, an acute
awareness on the part of corporate bodies,
co-operative
bodies,
organizations
and
individuals, of the fact that the poor are not
just a few in number but are many, and that
they are our neighbours.
I think that Dr. Laidlaw, Executive Secretary of the Co-operative Union of Canada,
wrote very well indeed for co-operatives and
credit unions in this country in "Co-op Conmentary No. 20", published about six weeks
ago, from which I will read two short paragraphs. Referring to the Fifth Report of the
Economic Council, he said:
Chapter 6 dealing with the incidence of
poverty in a supposedly wealthy nation

SENATE DEBATES
shocks all thoughtful Canadian citizens,
but it carries a special lesson for co-operatives, a lesson that can be expressed in
questions like these: Why is the co-operative movement, which had its roots in
poverty and hardship, so ineffective in
helping the poor and identifying with the
poor when a nation moves into affluence?
Why do co-ops of all kinds, including
credit unions, agricultural, consumer,
housing and insurance, tend to become
more and more "middle class" where the
poor feel out of place and neglected? Has
the co-operative movement as a whole a
moral responsibility to help the poor and
disadvantaged people in society by
encouragement, advice and financing to
organize co-ops?
In his final paragraph he said:

Probably the first step in the present
situation is for credit unions and other
co-ops to examine their membership and
see if they can honestly say they are
serving the poor well, and if the lowestincome families in the community
instinctively turn to the co-op as their
organization. Too often it will be found
that the co-op is made up of those who
have done pretty well and who think that
government is the best institution for the
ones who haven't "made it". Someone bas
said that religion is born among the poor
and dies among the rich. There is great
danger that the same might be said of
co-operation and the spirit that gave
birth to co-operatives, in Canada as
elsewhere.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Is that

all quotation?

Hon. Mr. O'Leary (Antigonish-Guysborough): That is all quotation.
I suppose it could be said that any committee made up of intelligent people serves some
useful purpose, provided its terms of reference are not too restricted, or that it is not
faced with a budgetary handicap. But then I
am sure that all honourable senators would
not want such a committee from this chamber
merely to serve "some" useful purpose. It
should and can play a vital role, and
undoubtedly that is what Senator Croll has in
mind.
In 1965-66 Pierre-Yves Pepin did an ARDA
research report entitled "Life and Poverty in
the Maritimes". I am certain that a number of
lhonourable senators have at least seen this

October 22, 1968

report. I did not receive a copy but I know
that some were distributed. Mr. Pepin did his
field work unassisted, in the months of July
and August 1965, visiting and living in three
counties in Nova Scotia, two in New Brunswick and one in Prince Edward Island. He
completed the report on June 1, 1966 but I do
not believe there was any public release until
March 1968. An English copy available in our
library bears an August 6, 1968 date stamp.
In the preface of the report, he tells about
the types of people he interviewed, in rather
general terms, such as:
It was a matter of maintaining a balance
between contact with elements representing social and economic leadership and
with elements representing the mass, the
positive and the problematic elements.
Some of Mr. Pepin's interviews lasted four
or five hours, he tells us in the report. In
answer to a written question in the other
place, it is interesting to note, for example,
that in King's County, P.E.I.-Senator Inman
will

be

interested,

although

she

probably

knows this already-Mr. Pepin reported
interviews totalling twelve people. These he
classified as follows: 3 agricultural, 3 clergymen, 2 labourers, 2 fishermen, 1 cook, 1
fishbuyer.
I understand there were other interviews
but he did not report them. Now, was it
through intent or inadvertence that no welfare workers were interviewed, and, more
particularly, those from the voluntary agencies? Of course it could be that the three
clergymen in that county had full knowledge
of the work of the voluntary agencies.
In the matter of defining the poverty problem, this report tells us little-so far as I
could determine from reading it-much less
does it offer solutions. But, in fairness, we
must remember that Mr. Pepin was asked to
report on "life" and "poverty" in the Maritimes and he apparently gave "life" the
priority.
Notwithstanding my questioning as a Maritimer the value of such a report as this, I
could not but be intrigued by words such as
these:
This was our first extended contact with
the Maritimes, and it soon aroused our
desire to return to this modest but proud
people who live in picturesque or spectacular surroundings, and who have preserved a way of life and a dignity that
deserves respect.

SENATE DEBATES

October 22, 1968

And of Inverness, Nova Scotia, he wrote
these words:
Inverness represents isolation and modest
resources amid an imposing landscape.
I would hazard a guess that Mr. Pepin was
very happy to get back to Montreal after his
two months' visit.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I doubt
that.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary (Antigonish-Guysborough): I think so. I would judge he was in a
bit of a hurry.
My only reason for referring to this report
at all is to attempt to demonstrate that in too
many instances the approaches made in studies of the problem of poverty have left much
to be desired. I am sure no one would disagree on that. A committee from this chamber
could very well corne up with at least a goodly number of the answers that are being so
earnestly sought. This of itself is sufficient
reason for me to endorse warmly Senator
Croll's motion.
On motion of Hon. Mr. McDonald, debate

in those days. I say remarkable because what
I recall most distinctly about it is that, having
served throughout the First World War, our
Professor MacKenzie had enlisted as a private
and had been discharged as one!
This, in our eyes, was indeed a record of
rather questionable merit, having heard of
the promotions generally by one who served
over such an extended period of time and
under very arduous circumstances. Of course,
it was some time before we learned that
our Professor MacKenzie was one of those
men who preferred not to gain in rank but to
serve continually and throughout the piece
with his comrades in the thick of the fighting
in the trenches. Our admiration for him under
those circumstances knew no bounds, and
I can assure you we thereafter paid very
strict attention to his juridical injunctions.
Last week, at a ceremony in Victoria, Senator MacKenzie had conferred upon him by
the Lieutenant-Governor of that province the
Canadian Forces Decoration for distinguished
service of over twelve continuous years in the
Canadian armed forces.

CZECHOSLOVAKIAN REFUGEES
IMPLEMENTATION OF CANADIAN
IMMIGRATION ARRANGEMENTS
Hon. Andrew Thompson: Honourable senators, I now ask for leave to call the attention

representative of the Minister of Manpower
and Immigration in connection with the

of Canadian immigration
arrangements for Czechoslovakian refugees.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, does the honourable Senator Thompson
have leave to proceed with his report?
Some Hon. Senators: Agreed.

October 23, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Mr. Thompson: Honourable senators,
the purpose of my 10-day tour of Europe was
to provide a personal assessment for the
Minister of Manpower and Immigration of his
department's procedure and policy concerning
Czechoslovakians who, because of the invasion
by the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact
allies, had decided or might decide to emigrate to Canada.
Let me say at the outset that I felt particularly privileged to be asked to do this. As
honourable senators are perhaps aware from
my accent, I am a naturalized citizen, and I
think possibly the only senator who became a
citizen when the new Citizenship Act was
implemented. I think it was developed by the
present honourable Leader of the Government, and I appreciate that he did this for
me. May I say also that my wife is a post-war
refugee from Europe and perhaps because of
both our backgrounds, I was very interested
to have the opportunity to see what is being
done on behalf of the Czechoslovakians who
have left their country.
It is very hard, honourable senators, to
make a report without being emotional concerning this whole situation. Perhaps before I
start to give statistics and some background
with respect to the procedures, I could tell
you of an incident that occurred a few days
ago as I was flying back on a chartered aircraft carrying Czechoslovakian refugees. As
we approached Canada we were all looking
out the window and we saw a symphony of
autumn colour. One little boy whose father
for a period of 11 years had been imprisoned
prior to being allowed out to do only menial
work, was looking through the window and
let out a cry, "It is Canada." Believe me, that
sent a tingle up my spine. I was very proud
of my country.
I would like to report on the order of the
timetable which the department had arranged.
As honourable senators realize, our departments of External Affairs and Manpower and
Immigration work closely together, and therefore after a general briefing by the Deputy
Minister of Manpower and Immigration, my
first meeting was with Mr. Ritchie, our High
Commissioner in the United Kingdom, and
with Mr. Victor Millard, Director of Immigration Services for the United Kingdom and
Ireland.
As of October 11, about 1,000 Czechoslovakians were temporary residents in Britain, which figure includes 200 students. All of
these had visas for temporary entry into Britain. They are given short extensions and Brit-

ain is being liberal to the Czechoslovakian
applicants who have opportunities and relatives in the United Kingdom. A scholarship
fund is being set up and the students are
being encouraged to apply for places in the
universities in Britain.
I suppose the other main receiving country
is Australia. Their policy toward the Czechoslovakians who are in Britain and in Europe
generally is one of relaxed selection criteria,
free passage in every case. The Canadian
policy towards Czechoslovakians in Britain is
of course uniform in application to those in
Europe. Those who have not settled permanently there or are on temporary visas in
Britain or Europe can apply for priority
immigration interview, medical and visa control, and if the applicant has no funds, the
Canadian Government has arranged to lend
the money to cover the cost of transportation
to Canada and, indeed, if the circumstances
warrant it free passage is provided.
With respect to medical examinations, failure to pass does not mean automatic refusal.
Such cases are referred to the Medical Service in Ottawa in order that facilities for
treatment can be :provided here, and, to date
all Czechoslovakians emigrating to Canada,
whether from the United Kingdom or Europe,
have met our medical requirements.
I spoke of the students in the United Kingdom. In Canada, the federal Government-in
response to off ers of more than 200 places of
free tuition arranged through the Association
of Universities and Colleges of Canada-is
making available to Czechoslovakian students who can qualify for immediate entry, a
combination grant and loan on a 50-50 basis,
of $1,200 a year. This would apply, of course,
only to the first year, because in the second
year they would come under the benefits all
Canadian students get.
The Canadian Immigration Department in
Britain and Europe does not push an aggressive, hard-sell approach to the non-resident
Czechoslovakian. We do not have to. I do not
think such an ambulance-chasing approach
would be appreciated by the host countries,
nor would it be appreciated by the Czechoslovakian. He is torn with concern and often
deep anguish over the harsh events in his
homeland and, understandably, he is fraught
with indecision concerning whether to return,
or to stay nearby an open border, or to emigrate to our country. It is a hard and bitter
decision to leave one's homeland when you
have had high aspirations that you were
working towards a liberalized atmosphere.

SENATE DEBATES
I spent a morning with Mr. Millard, who is
in charge of the United Kingdom and Ireland
offices, and his senior officers, discussing their
procedures. I talked with Dr. McQuade, who
is Health and Welfare Director for Great
Britain and the European area, and I watched
our immigration officers interviewing Czechoslovakian applicants.
I would like to say a word about our immigration officers overseas. They are young
graduates, often with post-graduate degrees.
Many of them are post-war immigrants themselves and, therefore, with a knowledge of
European languages and culture, but they all
have the stamp of Canadians, and they have
a deep pride in our country. Interlaced
through their ranks are widely experienced,
older immigration officers. I am sure that
their experience is the equivalent of a university degree and is recognized as such by
the department. I was immensely proud of
and impressed by every member of the Immigration staff whom I met.
I sat in on interviews in every immigration
office I visited. In London I watched a young
officer, Miss Myhal. I do not know if honourable senators have ever sat in on the interview
when someone is applying for entry into
Canada. You can see the tension and apprehension in the face of the applicant. He is
assessing Canada, not only through the information which the officer gives but also by the
very attitude and demeanour of the officer. I
found the officers to be kind and polite. They
stood up, shook hands at the start of the
interview, and at the end. Some of them even
had biscuits behind their desks, and if young
children came in with their parents they
would hand these to the children.
Perhaps the greatest tribute comes from the
Czechoslovakians themselves. They told me
on the flight back how deeply affected they
were by the kindness and politeness of our
immigration officers. Yet, let me make it clear
that the officers are frank and realistic in
apprising applicants of the difficulties they
would meet in Canada in professional acceptance and employment opportunities. It would
be nonsense for anyone te suggest that any
applicant is being told that the streets are
paved with gold. They are advised that they
have to be prepared to work at any job.
Many of the officers who are advising them
have themselves migrated to Canada, and
they realize that it is unfair and unkind to
raise the hopes of immigrants, and to try to
lure them with false impressions of our
country.

October 23, 1968

To date in the United Kingdom, Canada
has accepted more Czechoslovakians than any
other country, including the United States
and Australia. I was very proud as I went to
each country to see this record maintained.
Canada, in respect of the number of Czechoslovakian immigrants it has received, stood at
the top of every list.
I went then to Geneva where Mr. McWilliam is the Director of European Immigration.
The Ambassador, Mr. Delisle, had arranged a
luncheon conference for me with Mr. Jamieson and Mr. Woodward of the United Nations
High Commissioner's office for refugees. From
discussions in Geneva I learned that as of
October 4 it was estimated that about 12,000
Czechoslovakian nationals were believed to be
in Vienna; about 598 Czechoslovakians in
France had requested an extension of their
visas; there were approximately 3,000 Czechoslovakians in Germany who had net yet
made a decision concerning their future and
whether they would omigrate or not; and
that there were about 2,400 Czechoslovakians
in Italy.
I was greatly impressed by the scope of the
dedication and wisdom of Mr. Jamieson and
Mr. Woodward of the United Nations Refugee
Commission. They had limited resources, but
here again Canada stands high. Canada has
provided $350,000 annually for the work for
refugees, and this year there will be a significant increase in our contribution, as was
announced by Mr. Sharp in his speech to
the United Nations General Assembly on
October 9.
From the figures which I quoted a few
moments ago it can be seen that it is in
Vienna that the pressure of applicants is to be
found. Before I talk of the Canadian immigration officers' role in Vienna I should like to
say a word of deep praise for the Austrian
Government, which has been keeping its borders open and providing a haven for these
refugees.
The border is open, and there is a flow
back and forth. In Vienna before August 21
the Canadian Immigration office was staffed
by an officer in charge and two counselling
officers. These officers interviewed and issued
visas to 3,300 immigrants in 1967. The office
in Vienna has now received reinforcements in
staff, and it is still able to deal with its normal flow of applicants while at the same time
dealing with the Czechoslovakian refugees
who wish to come to Canada. This staff is
working overtime.
The head of the Canadian immigration
office in Vienna is a young man, Mr. Zawisza.

October 23, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

He worked previously on a major project
for Expo. He comes from Poland to Canada.
He holds a postgraduate degree, is imbued
with the importance of his work and is very
proud to represent Canada in this vital work.
I was in Vienna at Thanksgiving, and Mr.
Zawisza and his wife had arranged that al
the staff would come for a Thanksgiving dinner. In a sense, they are out on a frontier,
and yet they are very proud of being Canadians. They should be recognized by Canada. If
I do nothing else today I can at least place a
tribute to these men on the Hansard of the
Senate. If that is all I do, I will still feel my
trip was worthwhile. These men are working
overtime and on a shift basis, and yet the
process is a systematic one, with the immigration, medical, and visa control officers
working as a team.
In early September there was some press
criticism about the slowness with which the
Canadian Governrment reacted to the Czechoslovakian crisis. I am satisfied that this criticism was not warranted. I recall that it was
on August 22 that the tanks rumbled into
Czechoslovakia; on September 4 the immigration officers were directed to begin processing
Czechoslovakian refugees, and four days later
the first refugees arrived in Canada. They are
continuing to be processed at a very
accelerated rate. All of our officers overseas
are giving priority to the processing of the
refugees.
As of tomorrow, October 24, some 3,377
Czechoslovakians will have arrived in Canada. Of these, 2,628 will have come on chartered flights frorn Vienna. So far 14 charters
have arrived, and a further 16 have been
arranged.
The situation in Austria, as we all know, is
subject to sudden change. Up to this moment
the border has remained open, but many
Czechoslovakians have not yet made up their
minds. If the border is closed then those
remaining outside will undoubtedly decide to
seek asylum in a western country. The Austrian Government may be faced with an
increased burden. I know that the Immigration Department is watching the situation,
and is also in close liaison with the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
When I was in Austria I went out to visit a
refugee camp which is run by the Austrian
Government. In the past we have received in
Canada Hungarians and others who have
come through this camp. In less happy days it
was a training centre for National Socialist
youth, but today it is for refugees of any

nationality. Austria accepts anyone, and I
give that small country great credit for this
humanitarian act. The camp is not ideal, and
as winter comes on there will be the cost of
heating it, but meals and beds are provided.
Any Czechoslovaks in the camp who wish to
come to Canada are processed very quickly
by our people over there.
From Austria I went to Stuttgart, where I
was met by Mr. Scott, the officer in charge of
our immigration office, and also by Mr. Morrison, our regional officer. As we know, in
West Germany there is a booming economy
and I would think that many of the Czechs
will be able to be adapted into that economy.
There may be approximately 3,000 Czechoslovakians in West Germany who as yet have
not made a decision concerning their future.
I was taken out to the refugee camp where
the people from the Intergovernmental Committee for European Migration met us. I went
to Zirendorf. The camp is in Zirendorf. Again,
this is a camp which in former days had been
an S.S. officers' training centre, but today
one sees areas which have been converted for
use by children. They have a magnificent
nursery facility there, also individual rooms
for families and rooms for single men.
One thing I should like to point out to the
Senate is that there were a number of cars
and motorcycles belonging to some of the
refugees who had been able to cross the border. The situation, of course, is different from
the Hungarian movement where the border
had been closed and people had to flee by
climbing over barbed wire, with the threat of
bullets. Here, because the border is open, the
people have perhaps a harder time in making
the decision, for they are able to pass back
and forth using cars, going back to see relatives and talk over the decision with them.
From Stuttgart I went to Italy, where Mr.
MacDougal, the Immigration Director, met
me. Again I met with the staff and was deeply impressed with them. It is almost like a
United Nations with the talent for language
and understanding of various cultures, yet
again, I emphasize, always with the stamp of
being Canadians. I talked with the staff and
learned of the situation of Czechoslovakians
in Yugoslavia and the numbers coming into
Italy. Unfortunately, I did not have an opportunity to go out to the Italian Government
refugee camp because I had to return to
Vienna.
When I returned to Vienna it was my
intention to see at first hand the type of
transportation we provide for the Czechoslovakian refugees. I returned to Vienna,

SENATE DEBATES

where arrangements had been made for me
by the Director of Immigration. I also had the
opportunity to be briefed at a lunch given by
our Ambassador, Mr. McCordick, in Vienna. I
felt I now had gained some understanding of
the situation there. At 4 a.m. I went out to
the airport in Vienna where there were 200
refugees waiting for the plane. Again, I could
not help feeling a sense of concern over their
position. As we ate breakfast at the airport, I
sensed that that breakfast prior to leaving
probably had a bitter-sweet taste, because it
is a hard tough decision to make, to get on a
plane and fly away from loved ones and from
home. Yet this was a decision which was
made and is being made by so many.
I should like to say a word about the Air
Canada staff, with whom I was deeply
impressed. Mr. Hukl, who co-ordinates all the
details concerning the fiights and passengers,
is at the airport with the Director of Immigration, listening to emergency problems
which can arise.
Honourable senators can appreciate that
with a group of 200 people, no matter what
the purpose, there will be some emergency
situations. With a group of 200 people who
have turned away from their homeland and
are making decisions to leave, there will
certainly be difficult situations develop, and
Mr. Hukl and the Director of Immigration
impressed me with their compassion and
understanding, yet firmness, as they handled
this group.
I flew back to Canada with this group of
refugees, and I was proud of what Air Canada is providing. The stewardesses on the
plane were chosen because they have a
knowledge of languages. They were enormously sympathetic to the people who were
travelling. I talked to many of those travelling, because they speak some English, and I
learned of their backgrounds. I learned also
of their apprehensions about their new land.
As I mentioned earlier, I watched their faces
as we flew into Halifax.
Let me say a word about the people of Nova
Scotia. Before we landed in Halifax I had
been talking with a father and a little boy of
two. There was also another family of a lawyer and a doctor who had lived in a tent
outside Vienna for three weeks. The father of
the little boy had been imprisoned for eleven
years and was then allowed out of prison,
provided he did menial work.
As we landed in Halifax I decided that
perhaps they would like to symbolize the
other refugees on the plane and would shake

October

23, 1968

hands with the group in Halifax who were
greeting us. I carried the little boy, who his
father told me had been christened "Bobby"
on the plane, because it was a Canadian
name. Little Bobby went down the gangplank
with me and the people of Halifax were out
in full glory. They had a piper on hand, and
all the refugees were looking through the
windows with tears flowing at the hospitality
which was so apparent-so apparent was this
welcome which Canadians are giving.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Thompson: I would hope that this
will extend right through. I realize that we
want to keep the highest standards for our
professional associations and our skilled
trades, but when we think of the background
of skills and professions which are coming to
Canada I would hope that our professions,
unions and others will take a second look at
their requirements, examine the abilities
these people have and try to work out some
form of opportunity for them so that they can
very soon make a contribution to Canada.
From Halifax I went to Montreal and
thence to Toronto. I myself had become so
immersed in the problems of the people that
on Monday I went to look at our manpower
offices and to meet friends I had met on the
plane in order to find out how they were
being processed into jobs and integrated into
the Canadian community. I think the staff in
Toronto where I went is pressured and overworked, and I know that the minister is looking at this situation.
Honourable senators, my final contact with
my friends, with whom I flew across on their
first day, was to take three of them to the
Westbury Hotel in Toronto to give them a
fitting first meal on arrival in Canada. They
drank a toast to Canada and talked te me of
their deep appreciation of the kindness which
we have shown. They vowed to me that they
would work in order to help and to develop
our country.
Honourable senators, what are the conclusions at which I arrived from this trip? I
must say, first, that I was sent by the minister and some of the points of discussions I
have had with him must wait for decisions by
him. My own conclusions are these.
Because the political situation in Czechoslovakia is still fluid and the borders are still
open, the flow of Czechoslovakians includes
both the economic migrant and the political
refugee. Canada bas acted with compassion
and understanding to a people who have had
curtailed their advancement towards freedom.

SENATE DEBATES

October 23, 1968

I am sure that our compassionate act has not
been disregarded by the grapevine which
sweeps through the Soviet orbit.
Canada has been sensitive to the justifiable
indecision by many Czechoslovakians who
were visiting outside their homeland at the
time of invasion. We have not been acting
like aggressive hucksters, pressing for people
to migrate. We have recognized that the decision to immigrate is a major decision and that
therefore some do linger from a desire to
demonstrate solidarity with their compatriots
in Czechoslovakia.
I firmly believe that we rightly moved to
give selective treatment to Czechoslovakia
when the Russian tanks rumbled into their
homeland. But there are many refugees in
Europe and all Czechoslovakians, no matter
whether they are economie migrants or
refugees, cannot continue indefinitely to be
given priority over other refugees who apply.
The department has a traditional policy for
all bona fide refugees.
I am confident that any earlier indoctrination to which these people were subjected
will be washed away in the invigorating climate of private initiative and democratic
freedom. Indeed, it is that drive for personal
freedom which caused their move from
Czechoslovakia.
From my conversations with the Czechoslovak refugees, I believe they feel that
Mr. Dubcek will be maintained in office until
a Soviet puppet is fashioned to take his place.
The border may remain open for several
more months and this may be done for prestige reasons or in the hope of luring skilled
and professional people back home. It has
been the practice in the Soviet Union, when
they annex a small nation, to eliminate the
intelligentia through prison and freight cars.
In Czechoslovakia many of the intelligentia
were, fortunately, outside the borders.
I believe, as Senator Lang, Senator Leonard and others who have spoken said, that
the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia has
bared the cynical ruthlessness of the communist system, and it emphasizes the vital
necessity of maintaining our part in the
NATO Alliance.
SUPREME COURT ACT
BILL TO AMEND-THIRD

READING

Hon. Paul Martin moved the third reading
of Bill S-8, to amend the Supreme Court Act.

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, may I take advantage of this opportunity to express my thanks to Senator Thompson
for the magnificent report which he has just
given to'this house. I thank him for the assurance which he has given us of the kindness
and efficiency with which our officers abroad
are conducting their work, particularly as to
the refugees from Czechoslovakia.
I may say that I have experienced a certain
thrill of pride in the recounting which the
senator has given us of the work that Canada
has done, of the kindness and the hospitality
which we have shown to the refugees from
that sad European land. I congratulate the
honourable senator on the full report that he
has made, with a certain emotionalism that
struck a responsive chord in my breast.
Honourable senators, it is my duty to
address you in connection with Bill S-8. I
wish to assure you at once that it is not my
intention to repeat the statements I have
already made unless, of course, they are incidental to what I have in mind. What I have
said is on record and stands, but there are
some controversies that have arisen since I
spoke, which I suggest calls for some response by me.
I would like to make a preliminary remark
or two. I quoted a phrase "let justice be done,
though the heavens fall", which I attributed
to a high court judge in some ancient case,
and not to the Book of Proverbs. Now, I find
that I was right in that. I consulted a dictionary of quotations and I find it attributed to
Lord Mansfield, in the case of Rex v. Wilkes,
tried in England in 1768. Lord Mansfield, as
you all know is one of the great judges of
England. At that time, he was quoting a legal
maxim which was current in the courts so
long ago and which is still current both in
and out of the courts of all nations of the
Commonwealth. However, my friend Senator
Phillips of Rigaud found, I think mistakenly,
in my words an inference that the authors of
the ancient Book of Proverbs were not
interested in seeing that justice be done to
the poor, and he put on record quite a number of quotations from the Book of Proverbs,
for which I thank him. But quite contrary to
the inference which was suggested, my
thought on the spur of the moment was that
the phrase might have come from the Book of
Proverbs because it was so much in line with
the thinking of the writers of that ancient
script. I had no such inference in mind, and
I suggest that it was not justified even in the
words I used at that time. I think my friend

344

SENATE DEBATES

took advantage of it to give us the philosophy
of the Book of Proverbs rather than to
reprove me.
I may say that I have enjoyed reading the
two speeches which my honoured friend
made in this house regarding this matter. I
find both of them most admirable in every
way. They were clear and accurate; they
were couched in splendid and beautiful language, and contained very little on a study of
the words with which I need to take issue.
The Senator from Rigaud sponsored this bill
and he was duty bound to support it, which he
did, while on the other hand I have found in
the bill trends with which I heartily disagree,
but I would like to assure him and the house
that such a divergence of our views involves
no clash in fundamentals as between the
honourable senator and myself.
I thank Senator Phillips for the kind
compliments which he paid me and for the
longstanding friendship between us which he
so beautifully expressed.
Now, there are certain outstanding features
in this bill to which I have taken objection,
and those objections have been attacked by
other speakers. This is the outstanding thesis
of my speech. The bill includes per saltum
appeals with other classifications of appeals
against which the doors of the courts are
closed when the amount in issue does not
exceed the sum of $10,000, thus completing
and intensifying the limitation on the jurisdiction of the court which was imposed by
the amendment to the Supreme Court Act of
1956.
Now, my friend the honourable Salter Hayden argues that I was a member of the Senate in 1956 when this amendment was
passed and in that way I have some responsibility for its passage in the Senate. I would
like it understood that I am not on trial for
errors of omission which I may be accused of
committing some 12 or 13 years ago, nor will
I debate the subject on that basis. Our concern now is in regard to the law which places
a price tag on a court of justice, and which in
my mind draws an invidious distinction
between big and little litigants, an evil principle, in my judgment, which this bill intensifies.
Senator Hayden argued that the restrictions
on the jurisdiction of the court to cases in
which the amount in issue is in excess of
$10,000 does not disfavour the poor as compared with the rich.
I regret that Senator Hayden is not present
at this time, but may I say that he and I have

October 23, 1968

worked together on many occasions in friendship and in mutual confidence-at least I
hope it was mutual. I have often expressed
my admiration for the clarity with which he
reports from time to time on the activities of
the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce.
One of the best features of this chamber of
which I so highly approve and of which I am
proud, is that we can differ here and are
adult enough to clash without pulling our
punches, and yet to retain that warm friendship which exists between our members,
irrespective of party. It not only makes for
happy personal relations but it is wise as it
permits us to apply our judgment solely to
the subject at hand.
Having said that and having made it perfectly clear that there is nothing but friendship between us, let me quote what he said in
the October 16 issue of Hansard on page 292.
He says in effect, it may well be that the rich
man gets the smaller judgment, while the
poor man who has suffered real injury may
appeal to the jury on the ground of loss of
earning power and get a big judgment. In
other words, the poor man must be mauled,
due to the negligence of a defendant, so
severely that it affects his earning power and
moves the sympathy of the jury, in order to
place him on an equality with another man
who has an issue of $10,000 and accordingly
may appeal as of right.
Senator Hayden's long training in making
the best of a case is well known, but I think
in this instance he goes perhaps a bit too far.
It is of course clear that it is possible for a
little man to have a big case.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Or for a big man to have a
small case.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: But, we all know that
as a rule men big in commerce and affairs do
deal in big amounts while ordinary men as a
rule deal in smaller amounts.
Hon. Mr. Choque±e: May I ask a question?
I think it is recognized, that in our courts

today 80 per cent of the trials result from
claims for personal injuries suffered in
automobile accidents. The small man is struck
down and run over, andihe is being awarded
high verdicts of $25,000 to $100,000. So I am
asking why you still make the distinction
between the poor little man and the big
wealthy man? I fail to see that distinction.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: My answer is that I am
not making that distinction; it is this bill and
that of 1956 which make that distinction.

October 23, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

While there are a number of automobile accident cases, the great majority of judgments
do not exceed $10,000.
It is possible, and I have already said so,
that an ordinary man may sometimes get a
big judgment, but as a rule corporations and
rich men have the big cases and little men
have the little cases.
Senator Hayden excuses the $10,000 limitation on the ground that by section 41 of the
act the citizen may apply, at his own expense,
for leave to appeal, a procedure which is not
imposed on the man with the $10,000 in issue.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: And on a question of law.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is another matter,
I will come to that in due season. At page 293
of Hansardhe says:
In the legislation we are now considering
everyone has the same right;And I emphasize those words "the same
right".
One is an absolute right of appeal and
the other is a right of appeal with leave,
for whatever ground he can urge, and if
it is not meritorious he should not be
granted leave, in my opinion.
"The same right". This is rather like giving
a big peach to a big boy and a peanut to a
small one and telling them they are treated
equally.
Surely, all appeals should be meritorious.
But does Senator Hayden contend that all
appeals and all people who appeal in cases
involving a sum greater than $10,000 are
meritorious while only those who fail in the
means test are of doubtful merit? If so, he
has a rather higher opinion of some of the
litigants with big claims than I have. And
further, when the case is doubtful because
the amount in issue is less than $10,000, the
individual should have access to the court at
the pleasure of the court after a scrutiny in
the course of a special application.
Well, honourable senators, if merit, found
in advance, is the criterion for entrance to
the Supreme Court of Canada, my submission
to you is that it should be applied to everyone, not only to those with small cases while
exempting those with big cases.
At page 293 of Hansard Senator Hayden
further says that the Supreme Court of Canada in the granting of leave, and I quote:
-is not fettered by any direction or
guidelines. They can exercise their discretion; they can grant leave with or
without reasons-

I submit that Senator Hayden would have
been fairer had he told you that in actual
practice in the Supreme court the justice of
an applicant's cause is not the sole criterion
by which the court judges in granting or
withholding leave to appeal, in accordance
with that unfettered discretion which he has
described. Senator Hayden knows very well
that a very great factor in the decision of
whether or not to grant leave is whether or
not the judgment in the case which will be
given later is likely to contribute to the general jurisprudence of Canada, something in
which the litigant is not especially interested.
It would be fairer were the litigants, both big
and little, made use of in the same way.
Honourable senators, the more I listen to
the defenders of this bill, the more impressed
I am with the enormity of drawing a distinction between litigants on a money basis.
There should be no price tag on any court of
justice. The subject should have right of
access to this, the highest court in the land,
irrespective of how much money is in issue.
There have been attempts to justify
restricting appeals to the Supreme Court of
Canada to questions of law only, to the exclusion of questions of fact, on the ground that
the trial judge who heard the evidence is best
qualified to assess the credibility of the witnesses. Quite so! And al appeal court judges
from time immemorial have worked on that
theory, but up to now seldom has anyone
thought it necessary to outlaw questions of
fact in a court's jurisdiction. It is not banned
in the provincial courts; why should it be
banned in the Supreme Court-unless it be of
course that the purpose is to lessen the number of litigants and thus reduce the service
which the court would otherwise render to
the people of Canada.
Now, on the question of habeas corpus, I
objected to the abolition of the right to make
application to individual judges of the
Supreme Court for writs of habeas corpus,
and Senator Hayden recalled that he and I
were most active a number of years ago in
the revision of the Criminal Code. Honourable senators, we were indeed! The implication
of that statement was that I am in some way
responsible for the results. Well, I admit the
responsibility and take the credit. We made
over 80 amendments to the Criminal Code, as
it came to us from the Department of Justice,
which were later accepted with thanks by the
officials. But if there is any suggestion that I
was not on the side of the ordinary man, and
jealous of his rights, I say it is an error. May
I recall, just incidentally, that I initiated the

SENATE DEBATES

amendment granting a right of appeal in
cases of contempt of court, and I wondered
what reception I would receive when I next
appeared in a court where that amendment
applied. To my surprise and pleasure I found
that the judges were all in favour of it,
because it took away from the arbitrariness of
such judgments. One of them told me that
they would be much freer to exercise that
power when an appeal could be taken from
their decision.
The point of all this is that we substituted
at that time an appeal to the Court of Appeal
for the right that then existed of applying to
one judge after another for a writ of habeas
corpus. I was reluctant to make that change.
The senator did not tell you why he and I
consented. It was because there was a ready
access to any judge of the Supreme Court, or
one after another of the Supreme Court, if
that was necessary, which we thought was a
sufficient protection in cases of emergency,
and we nailed that down in section 690 of the
Criminal Code.
Section 690 of the Criminal Code reads as
follows:
Nothing in this Act limits or affects any
provision of the Supreme Court Act that
relates to writs of habens corpus arising
out of criminal matters.
That is, we nailed that down and made it
perfectly sure that what we were doing at
that time did not affect this right which is
now being taken away.
If it is enacted, this bill will destroy the
protection which we at that time so carefully
preserved and guarded. This bil destroys the
right of the subject who may be wrongfully
detained of coming to a Supreme Court judge
for a writ of habeas corpus, and restricts him
to the lengthy, sometimes cumbersome and
often slow process of an appeal to a provincial Court of Appeal before he even reaches a
right of appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada.
Now may I ask honourable senators why
all this pruning of the Supreme Court and its
jurisdiction, unless it be of course that the
court is overburdened with many cases so
that it is unable to give to each one the
meticulous consideration which is this court's
pride and its best virtue? If so, the whole
tenor of this bill, in cutting down the services
which the court may render, is not the right
solution.
Senator Prowse has suggested the proper
solution. He observed that appeals from the
Exchequer Court absorb an undue proportion

October

23, 1968

of the Supreme Court's time. Special arrangements, honourable senators, are made for
appeals in quite a number of divisions. A
special tribunal has been provided in labour
cases, in immigration cases, and, by action of
this chamber some few years ago, in taxation
cases. Those courts, for special appeals, have
been working very satisfactorily in the years
that have followed. Why not in revenue cases,
for instance, in patent and copyright cases, in
trade mark cases and the like, which come
from the Exchequer Court? Why not have
some special arrangements for these cases?
These are time-consuming appeals from the
Exchequer Court and could be dealt with by
a special tribunal. Then it would leave the
Supreme Court of Canada free to hear cases,
without monetary distinctions, from the ten
Canadian provinces. That was the purpose for
which this court was originally constituted.
And that is what I meant when I spoke earlier of returning this admirable court of ours
to the people of Canada.
Of course I will vote against this measure,
but, however the chips may fall, I have
prompted the powers that be, including the
new and young Minister of Justice, to take a
new and hard look at the arrangements that
affect this Court of Appeal.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators,
since I intend to vote for this bill, I cannot
leave the remarks of Senator Roebuck
unchallenged on the record. With all due deference, it seems to me that some points
should be made now. I do not intend to
rehash the replies, very adequate as they
were, made to all the points raised by Senator Roebuck by the honourable Senator Phillips (Rigaud) and Senator Hayden. However,
I think the criticism of Senator Roebuck goes
to the root of our whole judicial systemHon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: -and it may be that we
have been wrong for thousands of years, but
that is what he is implying today. If he wants
a completely new system, he may be right,
but he has not indicated what kind of system
he would like to replace our present one.
The first observation I would like to make,
before I touch on the proposition that I have
just taken, is with regard to increasing or
adjusting the amount involved in a case for
an appeal per saltum from $2,000 to $10,000,
the principle having been accepted years ago.
May I suggest to the honourable senator
that $10,000 today is not worth more than
$2,000 at the time the law provided for this

October 23, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

figure for an appeal to the Supreme Court.
Therefore, by increasing the amount to $10,000 the bill does not involve any question of
principle. It is exactly what we had then, and
we are simply adjusting the figure to take
into account the present value of our money.
I said that Senator Roebuck is arguing
against the general principle of the organization of our courts.
Does lie suggest that we should have only
one court? Does he suggest that the Supreme
Court of Canada should be the only court in
the land? If not, why make the several jurisdictions, for instance, in the ordinary courts of
the provinces? Why should we have a county
court in Ontario, and a supreme court, and an
appellate division? Why in the Province of
Quebec should we have a provincial court, a
superior court, and an appeal court? In the
provincial court in Quebec we have jurisdiction at present up to, if I am not mistaken,
$1,000 or maybe $500. There is no appeal to
the appeal court of the province from a decision involving less than $500, and I understand the same principle applies in Ontario
and all across Canada.
This is the principle. It bas been agreed
that we cannot have an appellate court or a
superior court deal with all the cases which
are the responsibility of a lower court. There
bas to be a division of responsibility and a
division of work.
If we want the Supreme Court to deal with
all those cases, then we will not have to
double the number of justices, but we will
have to multiply it by a thousand.

injustice. It is only wise from the viewpoint
of the legislature not to allow an appeal
in cases involving only $500 or $1,000. It sometimes happens that a litigant has lost enough
already in costs and should not be tempted
into going to a higher court. I think it is in
wisdom that the legislature has acted as it has
acted up to now in allowing appeals only
when a principle involved or the amount
involved justifies it.
I suggest that the discretion given to the
Supreme Court by section 41, in respect to
granting leave to appeal in all cases where
three judges so decide, is all that is necessary. I think it is reasonable that three judges
should decide upon whether leave to appeal is
granted or not, because there has to be uniformity in such decisions. Such a decision cannot be left to the fancy of only one member
of the court.
I suggest that this discretion is sufficient to
guarantee that the Supreme Court will be as
much a court of the poor man as of the rich.
In voting for this bill I will not accept the
charge that I am slamming the door of the
Supreme Court in the face of the poor man.

Hon. Lazarus Phillips: Honourable senators, may I first take advantage of this opportunity to thank Senator Roebuck for his very
gracious and warm references to me. I
appreciate the fact that because I have been a
member of this chamber for such a short
period of time he has treated me lightly in
comparison with his treatment of my other
colleagues who have spoken in favour of this
bill. I should like to say that the gracious and

SENATE DEBATES

saying the same thing although perhaps in
different language. I should like, therefore, to
refer honourable senators to that which I
have previously stated, and I sincerely hope
that a careful study of those observations will
in themselves constitute a reply to my dear
friend Senator Roebuck.
However, before concluding, I do wish to
make two observations which, although
slightly repetitious, may be in point. The concept that confining appeals to questions of
law introduces something novel in the
administration of our judicial system is, to
my mind, not valid. I should like to refer
Senator Roebuck to the Criminal Code. Under
the Criminal Code, appeals to the Supreme
Court of Canada in cases other than those
involving an offence punishable by death are
confined to questions of law. In the entire
criminal law of our country under the Criminal Code, issues of law are the only issues
that can be brought before the Supreme
Court of Canada, other than issues respecting
offences punishable by death.
All activities that involve a possible
application of the Criminal Code are as
important as anything else, and yet in respect
of issues envisaged by the Criminal Code a
citizen of this country can only apply to the
Supreme Court of Canada for relief when he
can indicate that there is a question of law
involved, and this is true of everything under
the Criminal Code except offences punishable
by death.
The other point I should like to make is a
very important one, and it involves habeas
corpus. It will be remembered that in my first
presentation of this bill I placed some
emphasis on the amendments concerning
habeas corpus. I stated that I thought it was
my duty in explaining the terms of the bill to
indicate why we were taking away from the
judges of the Supreme Court of Canada the
right of original jurisdiction in respect of habeas corpus. I said that in my humble opinion this was the most important amendment
in the bill, and I pointed out that the amendments to the Criminal Code created a situation where the original jurisdiction of the
judges of the Supreme Court in matters of
habeas corpus was inconsistent with the
appellate jurisdiction which was given to it in
virtue of prior amendments to the Criminal
Code.
Since that time I have had occasion to go
further into this question, and I wish to
assure honourable senators that in respect of
the taking away of original jurisdiction in

October 23, 1968

matters of habeas corpus from the Supreme
Court of Canada we have a precedent. We
have a precedent from the country which
created the whole concept of the law of
habeas corpus, namely, the United Kingdom
itself. When we speak of habeas corpus we
speak, in a sense, of the United Kingdom.
What is the law of habeas corpus in the
United Kingdom? I quote from a memorandum that I have before me:
In the United Kingdom the judges of
the Court of Appeal and the House of
Lords do not have any original jurisdiction in habeas corpus proceedings.
I repeat:
In the United Kingdom the Judges of
the Court of Appeal and the House of
Lords do not have any original jurisdiction in habeas corpus proceedings.
Original jurisdiction in habeas corpus is
vested in the High Court of Justice and is
exercised by the Queen's Bench Division and
the judges of the High Court of Justice; that
is to say, courts lower than the House of
Lords and the Court of Appeal. That is the
law in the United Kingdom. Surely in this
respect, because of the close association of
habeas corpus with the United Kingdom, we
should not be concerned if we eliminate the
right of original jurisdiction vested presently
in the judges of the Supreme Court.
Perhaps honourable senators will allow me
to read into the record my authority for what
I believe to be a very important statement.
The authority is Halsbury's Laws of England,
third edition, volume 7, page 28, and volume
9, pages 359 and 418.
In conclusion, honourable senators, I thank
other senators who have referred so kindly to
me during the course of this debate.
Motion agreed to and bill read third time,
on division, and passed.

Hon. Mr. Martin: This order will stand.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Until when?
Hon. Mr. Martin: I indicated previously
that it was the wish of the Minister of Justice
that the profession, the judiciary and the
public be given an opportunity to examine
the bill. There is to be a meeting of the

Hon. Mr. Flynn: Thank you.
Order stands.
JUDGES ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND

READING

Hon. Richard J. Stanbury moved the second
reading of Bill C-114, to amend the Judges
Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of the amendments contained in this bill is to
authorize the provision of salaries for 14
additional judges, il judges of the Superior
Court of Quebec and three judges in the county and district courts of Ontario.
The requirement to pass this legislation
comes from the British North America Act
which, as honourable senators are aware,
provides in section 92, subsection 14:
The Administration of Justice in the
Province, including the Constitution,
Maintenance, and Organization of Provincial Courts, both of Civil and of Criminal
Jurisdiction, and including Procedure in
Civil Matters in those Courts.
Section 100 of the British North America Act
says that the salaries, allowances and pensions of Superior and county court judges are
to be fixed and provided by Parliament.
The Ontario Legislature has passed an
amendment to the County Judges Act
requesting that these positions be set up. The

October 23, 1968

same thing has been done in the Province of
Quebec by amendmnent to the Courts of Justice Act. It is almost automatic for the federal
Government to respond favourably to these
requests from provincial governments.
It may be of interest to honourable senators
to know that while there has been in the past
a request every once in a while, sometimes at
close intervals and sometimes at inconvenience to the House of Commons and to the
Senate, they have been brought forward on
an irregular basis. The Minister of Justice has
now asked the provinces to bring forward
their requirements for each year by the
month of June in that year, with the hope
that the Parliament of Canada will be able to
deal with these requests during the fall of the
same year, and in that way bring some regularity to the amendments to the Judges Act.
The requests have therefore been made by
the provinces, and I think the purposes are
well understood by honourable senators.
The natural increase in the amount of work
required by our courts, in addition to the fact
that in some provinces they now have legal
aid, has increased the requirements of the
court. Also, the amendments to divorce legislation have resulted, particularly in Quebec,
in a very substantial increase in the number
of cases before the court, and therefore an
increase in the work of the judges.
J do not intend to speak for long in explanation of this bill, but if there is further
debate and there are questions I will be
pleased to answer them. However, I believe it
to be a straightforward matter in this house.
(Translation]
Hon. Léon Methot: Honourable senators,
the amendment to the judges act which this
bill would enact certainly answers a need
which the government must meet. That is
why I say now that I approve this bill.
[English]
For some time, in Quebec, it bas been said
that we were in need of more judges of the
superior court and that cases ready to proceed were waiting on the rolls for judges to
hear them. The new jurisdiction given to the
superior court in divorce matters will also
certainly increase the work of the judges of
the superior court and create a situation
which must be prevented.
According to the British North America
Act, Article 92, subparagraph 14, the administration of justice in the province-including
the constitution, maintenance and organization of provincial courts, both civil and criminal-is the responsibility of the province.

October 23, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

I am informed that the Province of Quebec
has accepted the proposal that the divorce
laws be decided there. This is the most
important reason why the number of judges
must be increased.
According to Article 100 of the same act,
the salaries, allowances and pensions of the
judges of the superior court must be fixed
and provided by the Parliament of Canada.
So to settle the actual situation, new judges
must be appointed and we must also authorize the provision of salaries for the additional
judges.
The new jurisdiction of the superior court
in divorce matters has increased for the
judges a work-load which was already
extremely heavy and perhaps too heavy in
Montreal and Quebec and in many other districts. I must admit that in my own district of
Trois Rivières, where we had two judges, a
third one was appointed, and I am sure that
the litigants have benefited greatly.
On the other hand, if two courts are created for divorce cases in the province, one in
Montreal and one in Quebec, I am convinced
that we are certainly in need of more judges
to dispose of the cases in these two districts.
I understand that the province is to be
divided into two districts, one for appeals
from rural districts west of Montreal, while
those from Trois Rivières would go to Quebec. I understand they have actually appointed two registrars. For example, if a petition
is taken by a lawyer in Trois Rivières, it
would be referred to Quebec, while one from
Sherbrooke would be referred to Montreal.
Therefore, they will be in need of new judges
to deal with those cases.
I am informed that the Quebec legislature
has provided for 11 new judgeships for the
superior court of the province, namely, three
for the judicial appeal district in Quebec and
eight for the judicial appeal district in Montreal. As far as the judicial district in Quebec
is concerned, I am told that one of the three

judges will be assigned to the new jurisdiction assumed by the province in divorce matters, and in the district of Montreal I am
advised that five of the eight judges will be
assigned to that new jurisdiction.
The other appointments result from the
increased work-load of the courts. The law of
the Province of Quebec authorizing the
appointment of 11 new judges was given

Royal Assent on July 5, 1968, and the section
dealing in the number of the superior court
judges is to become effective on the day of
proclamation, which I am told will be within
a few days.
According to the information I was able to
obtain, the superior court of the Province of
Quebec, when organized, will have to take
the consideration of the 3,000 to 4,000 cases of
divorce in the province, and it is expected
that 80 per cent of these petitions in divorce
may go to the district of Montreal.
Under such circumstances, I am absolutely
convinced that this legislation meets a necessity and that in approving this bill we will
give good justice.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Do I understand the
honourable senator to say there are 4,000
cases?
Hon. Mr. Méthot: There are 3,000 to 4,000
cases, of which 2,000 will go to Montreal.
[Translation]
Hon. L. M. Gouin: Honourable senators, I
only have a few words to add to the remarks
so ably expressed by my colleagues, Senator
Stanbury and Senator Méthot.
I was admitted to the Bar over fifty years
ago, and I still practise in the Montreal
district.
I am personally aware of the delays caused
by the number of cases listed on the role,
which in certain cases are there for years. It
almost amounts to a denial of justice to the
population as a whole.
Therefore, the new proposals under study
are an absolute necessity. I do hope this
honourable chamber will adopt them and
that we can soon have an additional number
of judges, for which there is a crying need.

INDIAN AND ESKIMO AFFAIRS
EMPLOYMENT OF NATIVE HELP-INQUIRY
ANSWERED

Hon. Allister Grosar± inquired of the Government, pursuant to notice:
1. What percentage of the 7,596 "man
years" of the establishment of the
Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development is occupied with native
Indian and Eskimo aff airs?
2. What percentage of the Budget of
$195.5 million of the Department is spent
on native Indian and Eskimo Affairs?
3. How many of the "man years" of the
establishment of the Department are
filled by persons of native Indian or
Eskimo origin?
4. What percentage of the budget of
$195.5 million is spent for salaries and
allowances of persons of native Indian or
Eskimo origin?
5. How many senior officers, from and
including heads of sections or equivalent
positions up to the Deputy Minister, are
there, and how many of these are of
native Indian or Eskimo origin?
Hon. Paul Martin: The answer to the
honourable senator's inquiry is as follows:
1. The total man-years of the establishment of the Department, which amounted
to 7,536 on January 1, 1966, when the
present Department was established,
stand at 8,376 for the 1968-69 fiscal year.
This larger figure is due to the rapid
increase in the Indian and Eskimo population and to the wider use of the national parks by the public, as well as to the
improved services and new and expanded
programs provided by the various
branches of the Department. Of the total

October 24, 1968

number of man-years of the establishment, 5,616 or 67.0 per cent are occupied
with Indian and Eskimo aff airs.
Of the persons occupied with Indian
and Eskimo affairs approximately 2,200
are employed as classroom teachers,
school principals, guidance counsellors
and vocational counsellors.
In addition to positions relating to
Indian and Eskimo affairs, the establishment of the Department includes positions concerned with the conservation
Program (Canadian Wildlife Service and
National and Historic Parks), and the
constitutional and economic development
of the Northern Territories including
direct management of the resources. Support services for the establishment concerned with Indian and Eskimo affairs
are included in the figure of 5,616 manyears above.
2. The 1968-69 budget of the Department is $256,580,000. Of this, 82.7 per cent
is spent on Indian and Eskimo affairs.
3. At present, 764 of the 8,376 manyears of the establishment are filled by
persons of Indian or Eskimo origin. It
should be pointed out, however, that 17
per cent of the establishment of 8,376
man-years is now vacant, partly as a
result of the Government's economy measures. It would be more meaningful,
therefore, to state that 764 of the remaining 83 per cent of the occupied positions,
or approximately 11 per cent of the
occupied positions, are filled by employees
of Indian or Eskimo origin.
In addition, there are persons of Indian
or Eskimo origin to the estimated number
of 2,775 man-years employed as casual
labour, as workers under contract and as
labourers on various projects throughout
Canada, and not charged against the establishment. They represent a very large
percentage of the total casual labour
employed by the Department or by contractors on Departmental projects pertaining to Indian and Eskimo affairs.
The total man-years for Indians and
Eskimos employed within and outside the
establishment may be considerably higher
than the figures reported above, since
departmental and contractors' records do
not always show that an employee is of
Indian or Eskimo origin.
4. Of the total budget for 1968-69,
approximately five per cent is being

what Senator Thompson had said. I wonder if
Senator Thompson, and those who assisted
him, took the precaution of giving to the
press an advance copy of what he was going
to say. If the Leader of the Government had
any experience of running a newspaper, he
would know that in the world as it is today,
with a procession of turbulent events every
day, it is simply impossible for the press to
be everywhere at all times, and to report
every proceeding of the Senate.
I am getting a bit weary of the complaints
here in the house about failure of the press to
report proceedings of this chamber. If and
when this chamber makes real news, the
press will report it, but it will not report
merely the exchange of these comfortable
statements of mutual praise which we hear
day after day.
Hon. Charles McElman: Honourable senators, with all due respect to a confrère who
has had long and revered experience with the
press, there are many occasions in this Senate
when matters of importance to the nation
take place. It is not the responsibility of the
Leader of the Government in the Senate nor
of the Leader of the Opposition, or any
individual senator to advise the press when
they should be represented in the gallery.
We have seen occasions when certain
honourable members of the Senate were making addresses that the press was present. I
for one think it is the responsibility of the
press, if they are to carry any sense of responsibility to the nation, to ensure that this
gallery should be manned every day the

Loans Act, it might be well to read into the
record some of the history of this act and the
part it bas played in providing credit to the
farmers of this nation.
As honourable senators know, this act was
first placed on the statute books of Canada in
1944 and was a measure designed to encourage our chartered banks to make term credit
readily available to farmers across the country for a wide range of important projects
and at reasonable costs. Most of us realize the
necessity of the legislation at that particular
time.
The history of farm credit prior to the coming into being of the Farm Improvement
Loans Act is rather a sorry one across Canada. It is a sorry one in that in many instances
farmers found it virtually impossible to get
credit. In other instances the interest rates
were almost prohibitive; and, on the other
hand, in many cases the institutions that were
making the farm loans found it impossible to
collect those loans because of agricultural
conditions across Canada. It is a wonder to
me that past governments had not recognized
this problem even at an earlier date than
1944. However, I do believe that the legislation has served our farmers well, and I will
refer to some statistics later in my remarks
which I think will indicate that point to all
senators.
As you know, the original legislation provided for government guarantees on all loans
made under this act, and the guarantee has
been renewed by Parliament from time to
time, as the original legislation ran for a
three-year period. The guarantee bas been
renewed every three years, but in the last
term it expired on July 1. As a matter of fact,
we have been without this legislation since
June 30, 1968. The reason for this was what
happened last spring when this house was
prorogued for an event that is now historyan event with which some of us are very
happy and others not quite so happy. In any
case, because of the election, the government

October 24, 1968

of the day was not able to complete the list of
legislation that it had hoped to place before
Parliament.
The Minister of Finance, in the interval,
indicated publicly that it was his intention to
seek amendment to the act as soon as possible-in other words, as soon as a new Parliament met-and also to include another lending period and to make the legislation
retroactive back to June 30 last.
The minister also advised the banks that
the new lending period, as I said a moment
ago, would be retroactive so that there would
be no lapse in the legislation because of the
events that took place earlier in the summer.
When this legislation was first introduced the
minister explained to the house that the act
was an incentive to have the banks enter into
the term lending field on a major scale and
on terms that would be favourable to our
farmers. The maximum interest rate at that
time and up until June 30 was set in the act
at 5 per cent. The interest rate together with
the guarantee that was spelled out in the act
were sufficient to cover the costs of the
money and the costs of handling these loans,
and also to give the banks an incentive to go
after the business that was available and the
business that the government of the day
hoped could be fulfilled through our banking
institutions.
The records indicate that the hopes of the
minister of that day have been fully justified.
If honourable senators have a copy of the
annual report for 1967, under the Farm
Improvement Loans Act, you can see from
the contents the great benefits that farmers
have received from 1944 to date.
It is not my intention to deal with many
statistics, but there are a few that I think
ought to be read into the record. In 1945, the
first year of operation, there were 4,300 loans
made under this act, for a total amount of
$3,382,000 odd. The average loan at that
time amounted to $784. The number of
loans increased from about 4,300 in 1945 to
60,755 in the year 1955, for a total of $69,105,521. The average size of loan had increased
from $784 to $1,137. Ten years later, in 1965,
there were 91,191 loans granted for a total of
$202,706,910, the average amount of the loan
having increased to $2,223.
The last year for which we have a complete
report is 1967. In that year there were 78,249
loans granted for a total of $203,664,856, and
the average loan had increased somewhat
from 1965 to an average of $2,602. But for the
total period of 1945 to 1967 there have been

October 24, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

approximately 1,419,000 loans made for a total
of $2,146,000,000, in round figures, and the
average loan over that period was $1,512.
Not only has the legislation been effective
in that the farmers have taken advantage of
the loans, as the figures I have read to you
indicate, but it has also been effective
because there has been an excellent record of
repayment of the loans.
You will recall that the original legislation
provided for a guarantee of 10 per cent of the
total loans granted over the three-year period
by any one lending institution. The cost to
the Government for the same years, including
interest and collections of difficult loans, is as
follows. In 1955 there were 229 claims unpaid,
for a total of approximately $135,000. Of that
amount, $5,074 was collected or recovered at
a later date. By 1965 there were 229 claims
totalling $203,333.33 that were not repaid. But
since then there has been a recovery of some
$36,000 of that outstanding amount.
In 1967 there were 285 claims unpaid, with
a total value of about $340,000. Of that there
has since been recovered about $43,500.
But over the period from 1944 to 1967 a total
of 3,432 claims have not been repaid. The
total value of these comes to $2,682,000. From
that you must subtract a recovery over that
period of $361,500. This means that the cost to
the Government of Canada through interest
payments and collection efforts has been
about $2.3 million.
In view of the amount of money involved,
some $2,145,977,861, it is a very good record
both for the Government and for the farmers
across Canada.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I think it is important
to remember that the objective of this legislation is to facilitate the making of guaranteed
loans to our farmers. The ultimate decisions
on whether or not the loans are made rest
with the lender, because we must remember
that this is bank money that is being loaned;
it is not Government money. So the decision
as to whether a loan is granted or not is a
decision of the bank to which the individual
farmer makes application.
The Farm Improvement Loans Act has
provided since its inception a guarantee to
the banks of 10 per cent of the amount of
money that they loan over a three-year period. Of course, this guarantee meant that the
interest rate was lower than if there had been
no guarantee. It seems from the record that I
have just read to you that the repayment has

been adequate and that the 10 per cent has
never been utilized-at least, not the full 10
per cent.
I would like to refer to some other tables in
the annual report. If you would turn to Table
3 on page 8, you will see an outline entitled
Loans by Provinces and Purposes 1967. It is
interesting to note the various uses of this
legislation by the farmers across Canada.
Table 3 shows us that some provinces have
made great use of this legislation. For
instance, the Province of Alberta in 1967 took
advantage of this legislation to the extent of
something in excess of $65 million. As a matter of fact, all of the Prairie Provinces and
Ontario made great use of this legislation.
The legislation has not been used to any great
extent in the Province of Quebec, but I
understand that one of the major reasons for
that is because some provincial legislation is
available there that is not available in other
provinces across Canada.
The experience in the Maritimes seems to
be that their usage of this legislation has
increased, but to date it seems to me there is
a lag, for some reason which I cannot
explain, in the use of farm improvement
loans in that area of our country.
There are other tables on pages 9, 10, 11
and 12 of this document, but there is only one
to which I want to refer. That is Table 9 on
page 14, Loans by Banks. As you know, up to
the moment the only people who have been
able to make loans under this act are the
chartered banks of Canada. All of them have
played a very important role, but I would
like again to put some figures on record.
From 1945 to 1967 the Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce loaned $666,627,764
under this act. The Royal Bank of Canada
loaned $580,882,973. The Bank of Montreal
loaned $409,850,516. The Bank of Nova
Scotia loaned $201,424,499. The Toronto
Dominion Bank loaned $178,345,555. The
smaller banks lent lesser amounts. I read this
into the record only to indicate to you that
the chartered banks of Canada have played
their part in developing this loan system and
making it operative across our country.
I would like now to turn to the act itself
and to the amendments that we have before
us. Bill C-111 proposes several changes in this
act; one of the first changes is in the definition of a bank.
For the purpose of this act the definition of
"bank" includes any bank that is incorporated
under the provisions of the Bank Act.

SENATE DEBATES
Secondly, it includes a credit union, caisse
populaire or other co-operative credit society
designated by the minister on application by
the society and is a bank for the purposes of
this act. In other words, if a credit union,
caisse populaire or other co-operative society
wishes to come under this act, they make
application to the minister, and if they are so
designated by the minister, then they may
qualify as a bank for the purposes of this act.
Thirdly, a corporation that carries on the
business of a trust company within the meaning of the Trust Companies Act, the business
of a loan company within the meaning of the
Loan Companies Act, or the business of insurance within the meaning of the Canadian
and British Insurance Companies Act-if they
apply to the minister to come under the
definition of a bank, and their application is
accepted, and they are so designated by the
minister, then they too will be able to make
loans under this legislation.
Perhaps I should refer to some experiences
the Government of this country has had since
they broadened the interpretation of "bank"
for lending money for other purposes. As you
are aware, credit unions have been brought
under the plan and are considered as a bank
for the purpose of lending money to students
under the student loan plan. In the year 1968,
$135 million was borrowed under that plan,
but out of this amount $133.2 million was
supplied by the chartered banks of Canada
and only $1.8 million by the credit unions. I
do not think that this is a criticism of the
credit unions. In many instances I am told
students do not have access to a credit union.
In some cases they live in cities in Canada
where there are no credit unions, and in
other cases they may take out the loan in the
city in which the university is situated and
they may not have credit union facilities
there.
In this connection I want to refer to my
own Province of Saskatchewan where we
probably have a greater concentration of
credit unions than any other province in Canada. In that province, offices of our largest
credit unions are to be found in the larger
cities of the province where university facilities are available. In that province, where you
have 45 per cent of all the credit union loans
in Canada under the Student Loans Act, you
find that they come frorn three credit unions
in the province. But this will not be the situation as far as credit unions are concerned in
supplying credit to the farmers under the
Farm Improvement Loans Act, because in
many cases credit unions are readily available

October 24, 1968

to farmers. At least that is the general experience in western Canada, and I think that
there will be great use made of the credit
unions under the amendments to this act, and
of course this will mean additional funds will
be available.
There is one other example of success when
other institutions were given the right to
make loans for other purposes. I refer to the
mortgage loans on non-farm residential construction, for the year ending December 31,
1967. N.H.A. and conventional mortgages
from our chartered banks for 1967 amounted
to $128 million for non-farm residential construction. By life insurance companies
through N.H.A. and conventional mortgages,
the surn was $493 million available for construction, and through trust and mortgage
companies, both N.H.A. and conventional
loans, the figure was $479 million. Then,
under C.M.H.C. a sum of $685 million was
provided for a total of $1,785 million.
Again I want to point out that almost $1
billion of that sum came from life insurance
companies and from trust and loan companies
who, to date, have not been able to make
loans under the Farm Improvement Loans
Act. I realize that many of these companies
are not strategically located in many areas in
Canada, but it seems to me that because of
amendments to the Bank Act and for other
reasons most of these institutions will be
located in those areas where they can provide excellent service to our farmers.
Subelause 2 of clause 1 is an extension to
the act so as to make it possible for money to
be made available for the purpose of purchasing land to add to an existing farm unit. To
date, there has been no provision under the
Farm Improvement Loans Act to borrow
money to buy farm lands, and of course this
problem bas been taken care of almost exclusively through the Farm Credit Corporation
and private lending institutions.
Let us take the farmer who wants to add to
an already existing farm unit by buying a
small parcel of land. Now that might have a
differcnt meaning in one part of the country
than it bas in another. But in my own Province of Saskatchewan a farmer who owns,
say, one or two sections and he wants to add
another quarter section, could borrow up to
$15,000 under the Farn Improvement Loans
Act, and it is hoped the loans could be
processed more quickly than through the
Farm Credit Corporation.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: That wouldn't buy much
land in Saskatchewan.

October 24, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Mr. McDonald: That depends whether
it is your land or mine. Where my friend
farms the land is much better and more
expensive than it is in my area. Nevertheless,
it might be useful in your area where there
are small parcels of land under a quarter of a
section, even with the maximum of $15,000.
The most reliable figure I can get is an
estimate that there could be $20 million to $30
million a year lent for the purchase of land if
this act is amended in accordance with the
bill before you.
Under section 2 of the original act the maximum amount of a loan was $15,000, with a
maximum repayment period of 10 years, and
a maximum interest rate of 5 per cent. The
amendments now proposed would increase
the maximum amount from $15,000 to $25,000,
with a limit of $15,000 on a loan for land
purchases, with a repayment period of 15
years, and a repayment period of 10 years for
the maximum of $15,000 borrowed for other
improvements or farm machinery. However, I
want it definitely understood that the maximum loan is $25,000, and if you take $15,000
on land, the maximum for machinery and
improvements is $10,000, but if you do not
take the maximum for land purchase then
you continue to have a maximum of $15,000
for improvements or new machinery.
Under the proposed amendments to the act
it is intended that the interest rate will be
prescribed by regulation. There will be no fee
or service charge of any kind; and the
interest is simple interest, at a rate prescribed by regulation.
Honourable senators, in regard to clause 3
of the bill, section 4(1) of the Act is repealed
and a new section 4(1) is substituted. Under
the old section 4(1) the minister was responsible to pay not more than 10 per cent of the
aggregate principal amount of the guaranteed
loan made by the bank during any periodand that refers to the three-year period. I
have indicated to you that this has certainly
been more than adequate, from the experiences of the past.
In the new act, section 4(1), the minister is
responsible to pay not more than 10 per cent
of the principal amount of the guaranteed
loan by a bank during the three-year period.
However, in addition to that, because we
are bringing into the act new institutions
under the definition of a bank, it is felt that
there should be further guarantees to some of
those institutions, because many of them are
not in a position to make as large a loan as
many of the chartered banks of Canada have
29234-24

made in the past. Therefore, as to the new
lending institutions which have been added
under clause 1, which is the definition section
with regard to a bank, the minister is responsible to pay up to 90 per cent of the aggregate
principal amount of the guaranteed loan
made by that institution, if its total loans do
not exceed $125,000. The reason for this is
that if you have total loans of $125,000 and
one or two of them go bad, a 10 per cent
guarantee is not much protection for you.
It is hoped that this will be an incentive to
the smaller lending institutions, credit unions,
caisses populaires, etc, to get into this
business.
The proposed new paragraph (b) of the new
section 4(1) provides for a 50 per cent guarantee of that part of the aggregate principal
amount of the guaranteed loan made during
the same period which exceeds $125,000 but
does not exceed $250,000. In other words,
there is a 90 per cent guarantee up to $125,000; on everything over $125,000 and up to
$250,000 there is a 50 per cent guarantee;
then, there is a 10 per cent guarantee on all
over $250,000.
Honourable senators, I wish to repeat that
the purpose of these amendments is to
increase the liability of the Minister of
Finance in respect of the loans made by
individual lenders and to encourage those
people to get into the field.
Clause 3(2) provides for a change in section
4(2) of the act, to extend the act for the next
three years, ending on June 30, 1971. This is
the only section in the act which is being
made retroactive to July 1, 1968.
Under clause 4 of the bill, section 5 of the
act is being amended to provide that the
maximum amount of money which may be
loaned by the chartered banks during the
three-year period will be $900 million. This is
a 50 per cent increase over the last three-year
period. The maximum amount of the loans
which can be made by credit unions, caisses
populaires, co-operative credit societies, insurance companies, trust and loan companies
designated by the minister, shall not exceed
$300 million. In this first three-year period,
despite the fact that the banks will be
allowed to lend $900 million and that the
other institutions classified as banks under
this act will be restricted to $300 million,
it is felt that that sum will be sufficient to
cover the demands on them during this
three-year period.
Clause 5 of the bill will authorize the Governor in Council to prescribe the interest rates
on loans made under the act.

SENATE DEBATES
Clause 6 is a consequential amendment,
relating to the definition of "bank" in section
1 of the act.
Honourable senators, I hope that the few
remarks I have made have indicated to you
that this has been a worthwhile piece of legislation and very beneficial to farmers across
Canada.
Hon. Mr. Bourque: And it bas been a good
speech.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I am sure that everyone recognizes the changes in conditions from
1944 and the minor amendments which have
been made in this legislation to date, but they
are not sufficient to cope with the conditians
in which we find ourselves today.
We are living in a period of time when
interest rates have been fluctuating. I am one
of those who believe they will continue to
fluctuate in the future. If our lending institutions are to make the money available in
sufficient quantities to keep the farmers of
our country competitive with farmers around
the world, the amendments suggested in this
bill are necessary and I recommend them to
you for approval.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Walter M. Asel±ine: Some honourable
senators will remember a short speech which
I made on October 1 with respect to the serious situation prevailing in the prairie provinces in connection with the threshing and
marketing of the 1968 crops.
Hon. Mr. Martin: We do remember.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I told honourable senators about the big holdover from the 1966
crop of wheat and from the 1967 crop, and
the big crop that we were trying to harvest
in these western provinces.
I went on to say that it was going to be
necessary for the farmers to build additional
storage in order to take care of the 1968 crop,
which was of very poor quality and which
could not be mixed with the No. 1 wheat left
over from 1966 and 1967 without taking a
chance that everything be ruined. To offset
that situation somewhat, and to help the
farmers, I suggested that the Government of
the day should allow accelerated depreciation
on new granaries and storage facilities, and I
requested the Leader of the Government in
the Senate so to advise the Government.
Honourable senators, I am pleased to find
that, in the budget speech which was deliv-

October 24, 1968

ered the other day, what I suggested should
be done has been done. I find this statement:
An amendment to income tax regulations will be made which will provide
that the capital cost of new buildings,
structures and bins for the purpose of
storing grain on a farm, acquired in the
period August 1, 1968, to December 31,
1969, may be written off for tax purposes
over a period of four years.
I appreciate that very much because it is
going to help the farmers in the difficult
situation in which they find themselves now.
During Thanksgiving week I made a special trip to the western provinces for the purpose of finding out if there had been any
improvement in conditions since I made my
speech on October 1.
I regret very much that there have been no
improvements whatsoever. After it had
rained for 18 days in the month of September
and many times during the month of October,
the wheat lay on the ground without being
threshed. In fact, it rained three times
during the week that I was in Saskatchewan
and there has been more since last Sunday
when I returned to Ottawa. I telephoned this
morning to find out if there had been any
improvement in weather conditions, and
although there was a possibility the sun
might shine a little today, no threshing bas
been done.
During my stay in the West I travelled
extensively through the west-central portion
of Saskatchewan from Saskatoon through the
Rosetown plains and on to Kindersley and up
to the Alberta border. I also did a lot of
telephoning. I got in touch with the northwestern parts of the province, west of North Battleford, the northeast portions of the province
and the southern portions. Everywhere I was
told that the crops were lying in the swath
unthreshed, wet, damp and sprouting, with
little hope of being harvested at all.
This is a very serious situation and any
help that the Government can give to the
grain farmers of western Canada will be most
acceptable. The growing of wheat and other
grains in Saskatchewan is a billion dollar
industry and, if seriously affected, the repercussions will be felt not only in the province
but throughout the whole country. This is the
situation as it exists right now.
One half of the grain crops, including
wheat in the west, central, and the northwestern part of the Province of Saskatchewan, bas been threshed-at Kindersley, 40 per

October 24, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

cent, North Battleford, 40 per cent, and Melfort and Tisdale, 25 to 30 per cent. In Alberta
it is 34 per cent, and in Manitoba it is less
than that. Over ten million acres of grain of
different
kinds,
including
wheat,
are
unthreshed at this moment in the Province of
Saskatchewan. Eight and a half million acres
of that total consists of wheat. The prospects
last night and this morning were that the
snow which has been falling in the north and
farther west might fall in Saskatchewan. If it
does fall on this wet, sprouting grain, it will
be impossible to thresh it in the spring. This
has been done on one or two previous occasions, but those crops that were snowed
in were not in the condition this crop is in. It
was dry, so that in the spring we were able to
pick it up and thresh it without too much
loss.
Honourable senators must wonder what I
have said so far has to do with Bill C-111, but
I wish to point out that we have three or four
farm bills which are coming up. One is a bill
to amend the Prairie Grain Advance Payments Act, to which I referred earlier this
afternoon and which we hope will be dealt
with as soon as possible.
Hon. Mr. Martin: On stored grain.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The legislation we are
dealing with, the Farm Improvement Loans
Act, is not so important, for reasons which I
will give you a little later. Then, we have a
bill to amend the Farm Credit Act. That is
the act which is used by the farmers when
they are enlarging their farms and obtaining
loans of a large amount. We also have a bill
to amend the Farm Machinery Syndicates
Credit Act. I was hoping that all of these bills
would be introduced in the Senate at one
time or close together so that I could make
one speech covering all of them. All these
bills are inter-related and are for the purpose
of helping the farmers out of their difficulties.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I would just as soon hear
the senator speak more than once because he
speaks so well.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I am not doing very
well today.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Oh, yes, you are.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: But you have a sad
subject.
Hon. Mr. Aseline: We have had a very fine
explanation of the Farm Improvement Loans
Act. It came into force in 1944 and has been
renewed every three years since that time,
29234-24J

but expired on June 30, 1968. The interest
rate was 5 per cent, and that was the reason
it was such a great success. The farmers used
it to improve their buildings, to buy new
machinery, to buy feeder stock, to go into
mixed farming, more or less, and generally it
was a great success.
But recently there has been very little
money available at 5 per cent, and last year
the credit dried up considerably. By this Bill
C-111 the interest rate of 5 per cent is
repealed but no new rate has been set up.
That is my objection to the bill. I have no
other objection to it, but I do not see any
hope for the bill being used by the farmers if
a high rate of interest is set up.
The definition of "banks" includes financial
institutions of all kinds, such as are designated and approved by the minister-the caisses
populaires, the credit unions, the loan companies, the trust companies, the insurance companies and other institutions of like nature.
The sponsor of the bill did not tell us
whether there was any consultation with the
banks and these other financial bodies prior
to the introduction of this bill. We do not
know whether they are interested in lending
money under this Farm Improvement Loans
Act at all. I am quite sure they are not going
to lend money at 5 per cent. That was probably the reason why the 5 per cent rate was
repealed. I submit, honourable senators, that
no one knows what this new rate will be and
I cannot see any great rush for the passing of
this bill until the new rate is set.
Trust companies are paying 7J per cent on
guaranteed deposit certificates, and they are
lending money out again at 9ý per cent right
now. We cannot expect much credit from
them. And since the budget which came down
on Tuesday I doubt very much if the insurance companies will be very much interested.
There is no formula in the bill for the new
rates, and I for one am not in favour of this
bill being passed through the Senate until we
know what the formula is going to be. The
interest rate should be tied to some formula
announced in advance. It should not be left
wide open as it appears to be at the present
time.
Why not let us have that formula now instead of next week or next month? When will
negotiations with the banks and the "near
banks" take place? We have no information
on that point at all. We do not know whether
these near banks such as the credit unions
and loan companies and athers that I have
mentioned are interested in this bill at all. I

SENATE DEBATES
am quite sure that they will not be interested
unless they get a whopping rate of interest. If
a trust company is paying 71 per cent twice
a year on its guaranteed certificates, it is
certainly not going to lend money unless it
gets in the neighbourhood of 92 per cent.
Most of the trust companies are paying a
brokerage fee as well to people who send in
money on behalf of clients to purchase the
guaranteed deposit certificates. You would
have to add at least l, per cent to the 71
per cent before a trust company would be
interested in making loans under this act.
Moreover, honourable senators, I cannot
see a farmer going into debt to improve his
buildings or to buy new machinery if he has
ta pay a high rate of interest. He would be
very foolish to do so. He could get by with
his old buildings. He could repair his machinery and wait until he could get a better rate
without going into debt. If the new rates are
not high enough the lending institutions will
not make the money available, because they
will not make loans at a loss or even for little
gain. That would apply even with the Government guarantee.
While I am talking about interest, I wonder
how many rates of interest there will be. Will
there be one rate for improvements on buildings, one for the purchase of new machinery
or livestock, and another on the $15,000 that
the bill provides for the purchase of additional lands. When I first read the act I wondered
why the $15,000 was provided for that purpose, because we had the Farm Credit Corporation which was making all kinds of loans to
enable the farmers to increase their holdings.
I would be in favour of the passage of this
bill if we were told what the interest rate is
going to be or, in the alternative, if we were
told what the formula is going to be to arrive
at that rate. Otherwise, I am not prepared to
support the bill because I do not think the act
will be used to the extent that it has been
used, as was explained so well by the sponsor
of the bill. If the rates of interest are high,
the farmers will not be able to pay off highcost loans.
After all, honourable senators, the basic
problem is ta take steps to increase the
volume of wheat sales so that the farmers can
market more wheat. At present the farmer is
on a one-bushel quota plus the 500-bushel
unit. He cannot live on that, even when he
gets the advances under the act, which I
mentioned a while ago. They will not amount
to any more than enough to pay his taxes and
his interest. The result will be that he will
not pay his taxes or his interest; he will keep

October 24, 1968

the money to live on, and I would not blame
him if he did that.
The only other thing that the Government
has advocated is the setting up of a National
Grains Council, but I cannot see how it will
solve the problems the farmers are now facing. The new budget does not meet the problems of the farmers, except in regard to the
accelerated depreciation on new buildings for
the storage of grain. This also bothers me.
When the Government brought down the
budget with this new provision for accelerating the depreciation, why did it not take off
the 11 per cent tax on all building materials?
That would certainly help matters. I think
they should still consider removing the 11 per
cent sales tax.
I do not intend to go into the provisions of
the bill; they were fully explained by the
sponsor. He seems to think that the farmer
can borrow himself into prosperity. I do not
think he can. It was all right when he could
borrow money at 5 per cent, but if he has to
pay 8, 9 or 10 per cent he will be in debt for
the rest of his life.
I suggest to the Government that before
this bill receives second reading we should
get some information on how the new rate is
to be arrived at. I also want to know if they
have taken up the matter of the new rate
with the new institutions that they expect
will lend money to the farmer if the Government guarantees part of it. Those are things I
want to known before I agree to support the
measure.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask a question? It
is perhaps not very relevant, but Senator
Aseltine has painted a sad picture of large
areas of land in which the wheat is lying
unthreshed on the ground and will probably
be a complete loss.
I was in England a couple of years ago
where the rains are fairly constant, and on
visiting one of the great farms there I found
that they had special arrangements for the
drying of crops of wheat and other grains,
which evidently worked very satisfactorily.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: You can buy a grain
drier for about $5,000. Some of the farmers in
northern Saskatchewan have them, and they
are threshing this wet grain and are proceeding to dry as much as they can. But they
have not that kind of money where I farm.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Argue, debate
adjourned.

POST OFFICE ACT
BILL TO AMEND-FIRST

READING

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill C-116, to amend
the Post office Act.
Bill read first time.
SECOND READING-DEBATE

ADJOURNED

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. Leopold Langlois. with leave of the
Senate, moved the second reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a substantial bill. I will endeavour to give as much
information as I can by way of explanation,
and I will be very happy to answer any questions that honourable senators might wish to
ask with reference to it.
Honourable senators, this legislation incorporates certain administrative changes and
certain changes in rates on those classes of
mail the responsibility for which rests with
Parliament, namely, first-class and secondclass mail. The details of those changes in
rates have already been announced. At this
stage I propose to give this house as much
information as possible on the background of
those changes, the reasons for them and their
implications. To that end all honourable senators have received copies of a financial statement which sets out, in greater detail than I
would be able to do in a set speech, the
statistical background of these changes.
Perhaps I can first deal with principle and
then move on to a discussion of specific practice. The Post Office account, that is, revenues
compared to expenditures, was last in balance
in the fiscal year 1956-57. This fiscal year,
assuming no change in rates, a deficit of $100
million is forecast; the next fiscal year, again
assuming no change, the deficit is anticipated
to be in the order of $130 million. Exact comparisons between the figures of today and
those of the past cannot be made because
there has been a change in the basis of cost

accounting, the essential effect of which is to
charge the Post Office for all its real expenditures such as depreciation of buildings and
equipment. However, as stated in the 1968
annual report, "The recording of these figures
by the Canada Post Office gives an accurate
picture of the financial situation as it is
today." In other words, we are dealing with an
anticipated deficit of $100 million this year
and an anticipated deficit of about $130 million next fiscal year.
Honourable senators may raise the question, and rightly so, of whether and why a
particular government agency should strive
toward a balance between revenues and
expenditures. In explanation I would make
these points.
First, the Post Office deficit, while it has
always existed, is in the process today of
reaching critical as well as chronic proportions. A deficit such as the $130 million
envisaged next year is simply insupportable;
unless controlled, it will escalate out of sight.
Second, this bill is aimed not at striking a
balance but at reducing the deficits to manageable proportions. A balance is not to be
achieved solely by raising rates. The new projected deficit for 1969-70 is $40 million,
assuming the proposed legislation goes
through. It is hoped this gap can be closed by
substantially increasing productivity and
efficiency.
Third, while the Post Office is aiming
toward a narrowing of the gap between revenues and expenditures, it is not its intention
to do so in every area of the service. As I
shall explain more fully in a moment, as a
matter of social policy, it intends to accept at
this time to run a deficit, that is, to extend a
subsidy to certain areas and services, notably
Canadians living in rural areas and to the
Canadian publishing industry.
Fourth, the consequences of a deficit, even
when the deficit has assumed the proportions
we are now facing, are more serious and
more damaging to the country as a whole
than the size of the deficit itself would suggest. Quite simply, the money has to come
from somewhere, and that somewhere is the
taxpayer. If the Post Office runs a chronic
and substantial deficit, the result is that taxpayers who make little use of the post office
services are required to subsidize, either
directly through taxes or indirectly through
lowered government expenditures in other
areas, those Canadian individuals and business concerns who do make an extensive use

368

SENATE DEBATES

of the Post Office. It means, in effect, that the
financial burden is being distributed unfairly.
Having taken the decision to reduce the
Post Office deficit, the department has operated on two bedrock principles, both of which
are incorporated in the legislation before you.
The first is that the user shall pay for what
he uses; the second, that social justice and
national need require specific subsidies for
specific areas or organizations.
The principle that the user shall pay for
what lie uses is an extension of the point I
made a moment ago. If the user does not pay,
then non-users will. This concept was enunciated on page after page of the Glassco Commission Report and, among many examples, I
would cite the commission's declaration on
page 383, volume 3 that:
... charges be made for all services rendered to the public and the amounts
thereof be so established as to recover the
full cost to the Government of the service
supplied.
There has been, for many years, one
instance of non-users subsidizing users of the
postal services which has caused considerable
concern. In studying the graph of Post Office
sales and costs contained on page 4 of the
background financial statement, honourable
senators will have noted that the gap, while
always present, bas assumed its present critical proportions only within the last few years.
The principal reason for this is that wages,
salaries and fringe benefits for the 48,000 Post
Office employees now amount to 63.9 per cent
of total annual costs. The settlement of last
summer's labour dispute alone amounted to
over $30 million. Other collective agreements
signed recently for supervisors and postmasters raise the figure to over $40 million. In
other words, Post Office employees want
wages and salaries commensurate with the
services they render to the users of postal
services. They refuse to subsidize those users
through their wages. And I agree with them.
The Post Office Department is now faced
with a real world. Their costs, in accounting
terms, are real; so is their wage bill. This
legislation is intended to cope with that real
world.
In their approach to this problem they have
utilized a combination of three well-known
techniques for bringing deficits into line.
They have improved, and will improve even
more, their efficiency; they have eut unnecessary services so the public is no longer
charged for a service it neither needs nor

October 29, 1968

uses; and, finally, they have increased their
rates.
They are taking the following steps to
reduce operating costs:
They have instituted a program to close
down smaller post offices where expenditures
clearly are much more than revenues.
They are amalgamating rural routes wherever it is clearly more economical to do so,
and this bas the advantage of providing the
mail contractors with a relatively more remunerative contract.
They are establishing distribution centres
across Canada which will make the handling
of mail more economical and more efficient.
As new post office buildings are erected,
new mechanized mail handling equipment is
installed, providing for easier and faster
movement of mail within postal installations
while facilitating the work of employees.
In the planning of post office buildings care
is taken to provide for better and more
economical plant utilization.
In co-operation with major transportation
system, containerization bas been introduced
to facilitate the movement of bulk mail and to
speed up the service.
Letter carriers use small trucks to deliver
mail where conditions so warrant.
Experiments are being carried out to find
the most economical means of transporting
mail within the larger urban centres.
New zoning systems are being implemented
in larger urban centres which will be integrated into a code system if and when such a
code is warranted on the basis of costs and
service.
There are many other areas where efforts
are made to reduce costs: in particular, in
better financial management, in the review
and preparation of departmental estimates for
the next year and five years ahead; in the
organization of a long-range planning division; in the installation of a total information
system so that decisions will be taken on the
basis of statistics, data, and facts gathered
through scientific modern systems; and in
research and development in the communications field.
Honourable senators may justifiably question why all of these steps taken together are
yet insufficient. The immutable problems lie
in the nature of the Post Office itself. Few
economies
of scale are enjoyed; each
individual letter bas to be individually handhed and delivered. The awaited break
through to automation in postal services has

October 29, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

not come. Machines have been developed and
tested, but still problems remain. Not until
optical scanners are perfected beyond their
present stage of development to allow the
reading of handwriting can much greater savings be made in staff, and productivity substantially improved. Scientists in the research
branch of the Department of Communications
are to tackle this problem as a matter of
urgency to help the Post Office meet the challenge of change.
As part of this program, and as part of a
drive to make the Post Office the most
efficient in the world, I might mention two
steps now under way. First, a thorough study
of the Post Office by a task force composed of
consultants and departmental officials has
been initiated to evaluate every aspect of its
operations and to consider the feasibility and
desirability of establishing it as a Crown
corporation.
Second, it is intended from this point on to
consider the Post Office not as an institution
but as a function-that is, not so much as an
organization in the business of moving mail
but as an organization in the business of communications and, therefore, as one arm of the
over-all communications industry. Perhaps
the most immediate effect of this change in
outlook will be in the field of research and in
the prevention of possible overlapping of
communication services and hence of waste.
Currently the rural mail contractor may
seek an increase once during the life of his
contract if the costs incurred by him in rendering that contract have risen. Under the
new legislation he will be able to apply for an
increase three times during the life of the
contract. This will result in an increased cost
burden to the Post Office but will benefit
rural mail contractors who have in the past
on occasion been seriously inconvenienced
financially by current cost increases for which
they lacked the means to be compensated.
Since 1954 when the last adjustment was
made in first-class mail rates, "all up" air
service has been restricted to letters weighing
eight ounces or less. This service is to be
extended to first-class letters over eight
ounces. At present an eight-ounce letter prepaid at the regular surface rate is given air
transmission whereas the sender of the letter
weighing nine ounces must prepay his letter
at the air mail rate to get the same service.
While this situation could be justified originally because of a problem of space availability on aircraft, this no longer applies.

In terms of reduction of unnecessary services, and hence of a lowering of the overall
cost burden to the general public, honourable
senators are aware of the principal steps that
have been taken. It has been decided to abolish the Post Office Savings Bank for which
no apparent need any longer exists. And it
has been decided to abolish the six-day delivery schedule.
However, in respect to the latter reduction
in service, it has become apparent as a result
of representations made directly to the Postmaster General that a five-day delivery week
will cause serious hardship to Canadians living in rural areas who depend upon Saturday
delivery for, in particular, their newspapers.
Hence the six-day delivery schedule will be
maintained in rural areas. In making this
decision the Post Office has been governed by
the needs of its clients, not by those of the
newspapers, though they will naturally be
coincidental beneficiaries. As important as the
principle that the user shall pay for what he
uses, is the principle that Canadians, no matter where they live, are entitled to equal government services to the maximum extent
possible. This is why the same amount is
charged for a letter sent from one address to
another in Ottawa as for one sent from
Ottawa to Resolute Bay, although plainly in
the latter instance a loss is incurred. This is
why, on the basis of social need and justice,
Post Office officials have been instructed to
proceed with the discontinuance of Saturday
delivery in urban centres where demand is
minimal and to continue with Saturday delivery in rural areas where the demand is substantial. By the way, this shortening of the
delivery week was one of the recommendations of the Montpetit Report. Plainly this
will reduce the amount of projected savings,
but it is anticipated that some of the net loss
can be recovered by the program of amalgamating rural routes already mentioned.
Also, no matter the cost, the service is
justified.
Now, honourable senators, let me say that
already efforts have been made and more will
be done to increase productivity and reduce
unnecessary expenditures. A wide gap
remains. It is of the order, as I have stated,
of $100 million this year and $130 million
next year. To close that gap, taking into
account the need for subsidies for those in
rural areas and continued subsidies to the
publishing industry, an integrated scale of
increases
has
been
constructed.
Each
individual increase is related to the others.

SENATE DEBATES
Third-class mail rates, which are at the
discretion of the minister, have already been
increased. As honourable senators will note
on page 3.2 of the financial statement which
sets out the effect of those changes in a full
fiscal year, the two categories of third-class
mail-domestic and international and unaddressed householder-which would have been
in a net deficit of just under $30 million next
year, will be brought almost to balance at a
deficit of about $1.5 million.
In the instance of first-class mail, which is
contained in the legislation before you, a
forecast deficit of $28.7 million will be
changed to a surplus of $12.4 million and
second-class mail, also contained in the bill,
will shift from a forecast deficit of $54.6 million to $39.1 million.
The specific changes proposed for first-class
mail are (1) that the local "drop" letter rate
be abolished, and (2) that the rate for letters
be raised to 6 cents for the first ounce and 4
cents for the second ounce.
The local letter rate from a cost point of
view can no longer be justified in Canada. It
has become an anomaly. Initially, a lower
rate for local letters was charged on the
grounds that such letters were received, sorted and delivered at the same post office. At
that time most people had to go to the post
office to receive their mail. This situation has
now been changed considerably with the
development of Canada, the establishment of
letter carrier delivery and rural mail
delivery.
The increased revenues from first class
mails anticipated by this legislation is $17.8
million for the remainder of 1968-69 and $42.7
million for the full fiscal year of 1969-70.
The letter rate moves up from five to six
cents. There has been no substantial legislation affecting first-class mail rates passed
since 1954. Those were the days of a five-cent
pay telephone call and a five-cent cup of
coffee. We are in the era of the 10-cent pay

telephone call and, often, of the 15-cent cup
of coffee. Yet we remain in the era of the
five-cent stamp.
Since the first-class rates affect every
Canadian, I can perhaps usefully give this
house some background information on which
to base its decision. About 75 per cent of
first-class mail originates from commercial
concerns and 25 per cent from private citizens, so the bulk of the burden will fall on
business rather than on the man-in-thestreet. The average Canadian sends just
under one piece of mail a week and the total

October 29. 1968

cost to the average Canadian of this increase
will be 49 cents a year, or $2 for the averagesized family.
I am confident this increase can be borne
and, for those reasons, to assess the impact of
the six-cent rate on Canadians we have, on
pages 8.1 and 8.2 of the financial statement,
calculated first-class rates as a percentage of
average hourly earnings in manufacturing
industries. In 1959, a decade ago, first-class
mail rates, as a percentage of average hourly
earnings, stood at 2.9 per cent. In 1968, the
six-cent rate stands at 2.41 per cent. At this
level, it is lower than in any post-war year
up to 1964. That is lower even with the
increase to six cents.
A secondary reason why I am confident the
increase can be borne is the comparisons,
contained on pages 9.1 and 9.2 of the financial
statement, between first-class rates in Canada
and those in comparable countries. At the
new level Canadians will mail letters to each
other more cheaply, by one half, than citizens
of Britain and West Germany, and more
cheaply by one quarter than citizens of
France. The only comparable country better
off than ourselves is the United States. The
difference is sub-fractional-2.4 per cent compared to 2.1 per cent and is accounted for by
our higher postal costs given our geography
and population distribution.
I now want to deal at some length with the
proposed increase in second-class mail rates.
This increase has been the subject of a great
many representations to the Postmaster General and to members of both houses. It has
also been, as we are all aware, the subject of
a great many editorials.
Subsidization of Canadian publishing dates
back to 1867 and Confederation. This practice, undertaken to help disseminate information and ideas is common to many countries,
though I might mention that in Britain the
Post Office, in an attempt to bring expenditures and revenues into balance, has recently
abolished all preferential treatment for newspapers and periodicals.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Not T.V.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: In my judgment T.V. is
in a different class altogether. There are regulations controlling the amount of publicity
that T.V. can handle, which is not being done
for newspapers.
In my judgment, and I believe in the judgment of all honourable senators, there are
sound reasons for subsidizing an industry
which, as said in the O'Leary Commission,

October 29, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

adds to the richness and vitality of Canadian
life. To quote the Postmaster General in his
speech to the other place introducing this
legislation, "...the communication of ideas
and information is the glue of Confederation
and the subsidy amounts to an additive to
that glue." It is nevertheless, sound practice,
and more than that, it is an essential democratic principle, for the Government to account for all its expenditures to the taxpayers who ultimately foot the bill. All subsidies
to any institution, however worthy, should be
clearly identified as such and justified on
their own merits. The merit, need and purpose of the subsidy to the publishing industry
might, at some other time, be the subject of
debate by this house. That is a long-term
concern; our immediate concern is not the
subsidy itself but the amount.
And that amount is reaching a staggering
size. Second class rates were last altered in
1951. In that year the deficit, or subsidy,
amounted to $13.5 million; by 1955-56 the sum
had roughly doubled to $28.2 million. That
doubling occurred over a span of 15 years. By
next year, fiscal 1969-70, assuming no change
in rates, a deficit of $54 million is estimated.
But this time the doubling of the size of the
subsidy has taken place over a span of only
four years. This rate of progression cannot be
allowed to continue. Over the past ten years
alone the Canadian public has disbursed a
total of approximately $300 million to publishers by way of a subsidy on second-class
mail rates, and all of this without debate, or
with very little debate, by members of this
and the other house.
That, however, as I have just said, is not
our present concern. What it is proposed to
do in this bill is to cap the subsidy, to bring
it under control for the first time in 17 years.
At present the cost coverage for all types of
publications, that is, revenues received as a
percentage of audited costs, is 20.5 per cent.
For some categories of publications, and I cite
weekly newspapers for example, the Post
Office recovers less than 10 per cent-9.7 per
cent, to be exact-of its costs. As a result of
the changes incorporated in the bill the cost
coverage, for all types of publications, will
rise to 53.5 per cent.
Here I would refer the honourable senators
to page 11 of the financial statement. You will
note that the cost coverage ratio is graduated
according to different types of publications.
In the case of weekly newspapers, which by
their nature are the most economically vulnerable, the new cost coverage is only 13.2
per cent. These publications will continue to

be heavily subsidized. For magazines, that
segment of the industry most vulnerable to
foreign competition, the cost coverage rises to
33 per cent. Finally, and here I am dealing
with broad categories, for daily newspapers
which in most instances enjoy a monopoly or
virtual monopoly in their own area, the cost
coverage is now set at 79.8 per cent as compared to 30.1 per cent under existing
legislation.
In a parallel attempt to spread the burden
as equitably as possible, honourable senators
will have noted that while the per pound rate
on the reading content of a daily newspaper
is increased from 24 to 5 cents, or doubled, the per pound rate on the advertising
content has been increased from 4 cents to 15
cents, or almost quadrupled. If these increases sound large, it is only because we
are working up from such a low base. Newspapers with a low advertising content and
who are therefore more vulnerable for financial terms will gain relative to their better-off
competitors. As a result, the second-class rate
increases, in other words, comprise an integrated package.
Here I might mention one particular problem raised in the other house concerning the
imbalance on second-class mail between
Canada and other countries. It was suggested
at page 935 of the Commons Hansardthat the
Government renegotiate the international
treaty which has involved us in loss and
bring about parity with the United States.
This cannot be done in that way. This loss is
comprised in large part, as honourable senators know, by our imbalance of postal trade
with the United States.
The principle of non-sharing of charges and
of non-payment of terminal expenses to the
administrations of other countries, as compensation for services provided on arrival of
foreign mail, applies to all items of letter post
in the international service.
Since the foundation of the Universal Postal Union almost 100 years ago, this concept
has been viewed as basic by its 137 member
countries and their territories.
While many attempts have been made at
the Universal Postal congresses, to introduce
some system of payment to compensate countries for the expenses incurred in the delivery
of international mail, these have always been
rejected. However, the last Universal Congress in 1964 adopted a resolution authorizing
a study of the cost prices of forwarding, transmitting and distributing letter post items in
the international service. The problem is very

SENATE DEBATES
complex because any system would require
the setting up of expensive and time-consuming control and accounting procedures at both
the despatching and receiving ends in Canada
and the other member nations of the Universal Postal Union. There is no immediate solution in sight, but a serious study is currently
underway and the results will be placed
before the next congress to be held in Tokyo
in late 1969. Therefore, there is no avenue
open to Canada to solve the problem in relation to the United States or for that matter
with any other country such as France, Great
Britain and the Netherlands with whom we
also are at a disadvantage.
I should point out that in terms of total
volume of second- and third-class mail handled in the Canadian postal service, the
imbalance of international traffic, if we
exclude that originating in the United States,
represents very little. In fact, it has been
estimated that this imbalance accounts for
less than one-third of 1 per cent of our total
traffic in terms of number of pieces handled.
Our deficit attributable to the imbalance of
traffic with the United States for second-class
mail is estimated at approximately $3.5 million annually. With third-class mail, however,
the latest survey indicated that the flow of
exchange seems to be in Canada's favour.
Unfortunately, we have no recent figures on
this particular type of traffic, but tests made
four years ago showed that the imbalance
favoured Canada by a margin of 13 per cent.
I return, honourable senators, to the issue
before this house. On second-class mail rates
the position of the Post Office is that the
deficit has continued too long, it is now at an
unmanageable level, and therefore the time
has come to cap it.
Such a step involves certain inescapable
difficulties. A situation unchanged for 17
years permits a privilege to become regarded
as a right. In their representations to the Post
Office, I am told, members of the publishing
industry have argued that the increase, even
if justified, is still too much too suddenly. The
increase is considerable, and it must be if we
are to make any headway at all; the percentage increases appear large but are so only
because the base rates until now have been so
low. I am aware, and sympathetically so, that
certain publications, simply because they
have assumed a privilege was a right and was
therefore immutable, have perhaps allowed
themselves to become over-extended in certain areas. This is the reason why the
increase is proposed to come into effect in

October 29, 1968

stages, rather than on passage of this legislation, as is the case with first-class mail. As
for the allegation that the increase is sudden,
I wish to say that this issue was raised in the
House of Commons in 1964 and again during
consideration of legislation last year. The
publishing industry, I submit, has been well
aware for some time that changes were coming and were long overdue.
The legislation before you will continue the
subsidy on second-class mail, not eliminate it.
In the fiscal year 1969-70 the sum, because of
the increased rates, will be about $39 million.
At that figure it will comprise all but about
$1 million of the total deficit of the Post
Office on all its operation; also at the $39
million figure it will be substantially larger
than sums dispersed by the Government to
other industries in the private sectors such as
ship building and gold mining. I am convinced that the amount of the increase, after
a close study of all individual cases, is equitable both to the industry and to the general
public. The timing of the increase will, I
believe, allow all publications enough time to
take any action that may be needed to absorb
the increased cost in the same manner as they
regularly absorb unplanned increases in the
costs of such items as wages and newsprint.
In the legislation before Parliament other
amendments to sections 11 and 12 of the act
have been proposed which would: (a) restrict
the conditions for statutory mail rates (b)
reduce and simplify rate categories; (c) establish minimum piece charges; (d) increase
rates; (e) restrict the free zone to weekly
newspapers with circulation of less than 10,000 and to the copies of these papers that are
addressed to post offices with no letter carrier
delivery service; (f) abolish the preferred
rates; (g) repeal existing local second class
rate; (h) discontinue statutory rates for sample copies or specimens of newspapers and
periodicals and publications of newspapers
and periodicals mailed by news dealers, evidently for advertising purposes.

Other proposed changes would restrict
statutory rates to those newspapers and periodicals that, (a) have not more than 70 per
cent of the paper devoted to advertising; (b)
have a subscription price of not less than 50
cents per annum; (c) have a paid circulation
of not less than 50 per cent of the total circulation; and (d) are registered for second-class
rates with the Post Office Department.
Another purpose of the amendment is to
exclude from the statutory rate publications

October 29, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

published as an auxiliary to, or for the purpose of, publicizing the main purpose or calling of the publisher. Excluded would be
house organs, church bulletins, trade, fraternal, professional and other association
publications.
Honourable senators, there are now 10 rate
groups of newspapers and periodicals based
on frequency of issue and size of circulation.
Since neither factor is related to the cost, rate
anomalies exist that cannot be explained
within the context of postal operations. For
example, a large weekly periodical is currently subject to a rate of three cents per pound,
but a monthly periodical pays only 1.75 cents
per pound. Furthermore, the number of rate
categories is in excess of what is required for
efficient administration and accounting.
The new legislation provides for three rate
groups: (a) daily newspapers; (b) weekly
newspapers, and (c) other newspapers and
periodicals.
At the moment, rates on newspapers and
periodicals are bulk or pound rates covering
an entire mailing. This results in sorting,
transporting and delivering some newspapers
and periodicals for as little as 1/20 and 1/30
of a cent per copy. The new minimum per
item rate of two cents per piece will result in
a more equitable distribution of postal
charges among the users of second-class mail.
The rate change for a daily newspaper
which includes all newspapers published
more frequently than weekly will be five
cents a pound on the news content and 15
cents a pound on the advertising content.
The rate for a weekly newspaper will be
five cents a pound, and if the weekly newspaper has a circulation of 10,000 or less and is
published and mailed in a community of not
more than 10,000 persons, 2,500 copies of each
issue will be handled free of postage to nonletter carrier offices within a 40-mile radius of
the place of publication. This weekly rate is
recognized support of the little weekly newspapers that continue to play an important
role in local news dissemination in rural parts
of our country.
The third rate which applies to all other
newspapers and periodicals will be five cents
per pound with a minimum charge of two
cents per item.
Honourable senators, I have spoken at
length, and I wish to thank you for having
listened to me with such attention. I am
aware of your interest in this legislation,
affecting, as it does, literally every Canadian.
I am also aware that we are attempting to

correct a situation which has been unchanged
for 17 years and which, because of that long
span, requires some relatively drastic steps.
This legislation will reduce the projected
Post Office deficit for 1969-70 to $40 million
from the $130 million it would have been
without this bill. We will be back in the land
of common sense, and of equity, since it will
mean that, with specified exceptions, users
will pay for what they use and non-users will
not bear a burden they did not create.
Honourable senators, it is my intention
when this bill has received second reading, to
move that it be referred to the Standing
Committee on Transport and Communications. I am informed that the Postmaster
General will be in attendance to supply any
information honourable senators may wish to
have.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
would the honourable senator answer one
question? If he cannot answer it now perhaps
he could make the answer available some
time before third reading.
As honourable senators are aware, Christmas is approaching, and in previous years a
Christmas card sent in a sealed envelope
went as first-class mail, while a card in a
non-sealed envelope was carried at a lesser
rate. Under the new rates will a Christmas
card, whether in a sealed or unsealed
envelope, require the six-cent rate?
Hon. Paul Desruisseaux: Honourable senators, I possibly would not have spoken on this
bill because of my past connection in the
newspaper field; however, I want to clarify
my position as it is now. I have been a director of the Canadian Press and Canadian Daily
Newspapers Association for a number of
years, and have published a French daily
newspaper in Sherbrooke, which had a circulation of some 4,000; and also I have published an English-language newspaper.
I would like to point out what is in fact
happening by the passage of this bill, and I
would like to make known the ideas and
views of the small town newspaper.
Let me take as an example the Sherbrooke
Daily Record, a well known newspaper
which has served the community in the Eastern Townships exceptionally well. Because of
what has been said here about the ending of
subsidies to newspapers, I want to point out
some of the things that should be pointed out
to the Senate and that should be considered
in committee.

SENATE DEBATES

First, this small newspaper I am talking
about has a circulation this year of 8,856, and
there is postage involved in delivering 6,357
to subscribers. That is 72 per cent of the total
net paid circulation. Of this amount, 3,179 go
to lock boxes, 1,782 to rural routes, and 1,396
to small dealers and carriers in isolated areas
who receive their bundles through the mail
service.
The mail is pre-sorted into 77 direct bags
and 11 sortation bags for regional offices. Our
trucks travel more than 40,000 miles per
annum to deliver 1,051 copies each day. The
balance travels on post office trucks for an
average of 25 miles. All mail is sorted to the
convenience of the Post Office, the service
they give being minimal. Papers for boxholders in towns are in box order, rural routes
in alphabetical order in separate packages.
The present cost of mailing to subscribers
is $10,400 per annum. The estimated cost of
the proposed rates is $41,600, an increase of
$31,200, or about 400 per cent. The increased
cost per mail subscriber will be about $6.50
per annum.
Some may say that the subsidies may be
outdated in these regions, but remember that
we have been subsidizing culture in one form
or another ever since we have had a Parliament. We build cultural centres that cost
from $75 million to $85 million, and think
nothing of it.
I am pleading for the survival of small
newspapers. The case of the Sherbrooke Daily
Record is not an isolated one; it could just as
well be L'Action in Quebec, the most of
whose subscribers are serviced by mail, or
L'Evangéline, in Moncton, where the circulation is widely scattered.
Some references were made to the postal
arrangements that were to be made, and
some comparisons were ventured with United
States postal rates. In comparing the two, I
would like to bring to your attention that the
United States postal authorities have instituted a zone system which enables small
dailies to serve their markets but pay higher
rates when they mail to other markets. This is
quite different from what we have before us,
and I believe we have an over-simplification
of the situation. We should take the precaution of considering what might happen to
many newspapers, because if their circulation
is adversely affected, they would not have
sufficient funds to meet their expenses; it
would have an adverse effect on their
revenues.

October 29, 1968

In the county of origin a U.S. newspaper
pays 1.3 cents per pound in next zone-that is,
within a 150-mile radius-4.6 cents on advertising content and 3 cents on news. The
proposed rate in Canada is 5 cents on newsjumping from 1.3 cents to 5 cents-and 15
cents on advertising-a jump from 4.6 cents
to 15 cents. This will not render a service to
the rural communities, but it is my belief that
the metropolitan centres might be indifferent.
I would like to quote a paragraph from the
letter that the editor writes to me:
It would seem the proposed increase in
newspaper mail rates was designed to
eliminate the main source of news to
rural residents. Local radio and TV are
unable to fill the gap, leaving state radio
and television a captive news audience.
This is an example of a small city newspaper, and I, for one, would regret its closing
down. I am sure that it is not the intention of
anyone to try to suppress the dissemination of
information in Canada.
We must realize that newspapers are able
to raise the rates as necessary; and, of course,
if this legislation passes, they will have to
raise the rate by at least $6.50 per subscriber.
In my region, honourable senators, this would
represent a heavy burden, because most of
the farmers are not operating large farms.
If this is to be referred to committee, T
would suggest that the comparative Canadian
and U.S. rates should be brought out. Further,
I suggest that, before we pass this legislation we should ascertain what would happen
to a number of existing newspapers which we
need to contribute to Canada's growth.
Hon. M. Gratan O'Leary: Honourable senators, before moving the adjournment of the
debate, I would like to ask Senator Langlois,
the sponsor of the bill, two questions.
First, how much of the Post Office deficit
last year was attributable to the carriage of
daily and weekly newspapers, as opposed to
magazines and other second-class matter?
Second, how was this figure arrived at?
If the honourable senator does not have
that information now, I can ask the question
tomorrow.
The Hon. the Speaker: Do I understand that
the honourable senator has moved the
adjournment of the debate?
Hon. Mr. O'Leary (Carleton): I wished to
ask the questions before moving the adjournment of the debate. However, if Senator Langlois would prefer to reply tomorrow, I will

REPORTS OF COMMITTEE PRESENTED
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck, Chairman of the

October 29, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

In my opinion the sponsor of this bill (Hon.
Mr. McDonald) gave a comprehensive explanation of its purposes and of the various
types of loans that will be provided when this
legislation is passed. However, I think a fundamental error has been made in the legislation. I refer to the interest rate. Agricultural
producers in Canada have for over 20 years
enjoyed a Farm Improvement Loans Act
which has carried a five per cent interest, and
this moderate interest rate has enabled
agricultural producers to improve their
agricultural plant in such a way as to benefit
themselves and the nation.
I am opposed to Bill C-111, the passage of
which will lead to increased interest rates for
farm machinery and other loans made under
this legislation. This bill as it now stands is
directly contrary to other beneficial government actions and policies. The Government
favours lower farm machinery prices and bas
demonstrated this by establishing a royal
commission on this important question. But in
this measure it provides for a drastic increase
in farm machinery costs by means of an
increase in the interest rates. On the one
hand we see the Government spending hundreds of millions of dollars to eradicate rural
poverty, and on the other hand by this bill it
curtails the opportunity of many farmers to
eradicate their own poverty through their
own efforts by improved mechanization and
production facilities.
The Farm Improvements Loans Act bas
over the years been of great value to Canadian agriculture. Almost one and a half million
loans have been made, with an average value
of over $1,500 per loan. This legislation has
been of far-reaching benefit by making it
possible for farmers to mechanize production
and increase efficiency. It bas enabled the
farmers to compete in a more satisfactory
way in world markets, and has assisted farmers in the provision of cheaper food for
Canadian consumers. Any investment by government in legislation that results in
increased agricultural efficiency provides a
manifold return to the nation.
The timing of this bill seems particularly
inappropriate. Farm production costs have
been rising rapidly while agricultural production prices have in the main remained stable,
or in some instances, such as wheat have actually fallen. Certainly an emergency agricultural situation prevails in Western Canada at
this time. Exports are down, grain delivery
quotas are the lowest in years, and all this is
further complicated by the worst harvesting
conditions since 1951.

I have in my hand the latest farm delivery
quotas, prevailing as of yesterday, which
show that as of October 28 this year, of 1,827
marketing points on the Prairies, 779, or
about 43 per cent, were still on the basic unit
quota. The unit quota, as honourable senators
will know, is a quota of 400 bushels of wheat,
which means a gross return of about $550, a
very small return indeed. A year ago at this
time there were only 11 per cent of the points
on the unit quota. Two years ago there were
only 5 per cent of the points on this tiny
quota. If you take the number of points on a
quota above a one bushel quota-that is a
quota of two bushels per acre or more-this
year only 13 per cent as of October 28 were
on this larger quota. One year ago 47 per cent
of the points were on that larger quota. Two
years ago during that same time 75 per cent
of the marketing points were on this larger
quota. That demonstrates very vividly the
severe emergency facing western agricultural
producers, the severe shortage of cash and
the terrible effect this is having on the general economy in western Canada.
Of course, as part of the answer to this
serious situation-and I compliment the Government-we will shortly be dealing with a
measure to provide certain cash advances,
but I should like to point out to honourable
senators that, important as this cash advance
legislation will be, providing a cash advance
of some $6 per specified acreThe Hon. the Speaker: I understand the
honourable Senator Fournier (De Lanaudière)
wishes to ask a question.
Hon. Sarto Fournier: I am very sorry to
interrupt the honourable senator. He bas
quoted figures for western Canada and I hope
the honourable senator has the same figures
for eastern Canada. What about the production in Ontario and Quebec? I would like the
honourable senator to balance the loss in the
west against the loss in the east, and the gain
in the west against the gain in the east. I
hope the honourable gentleman will have the
intellectual honesty to give to the Canadian
nation the figures of the production, and of
the benefit of everything, concerning both
parts of the country.
Hon. Mr. Argue: Honourable senators, I
thank Senator Fournier for his important
question. I hope I have intellectual honesty. I
am not sure that I have the intellectual faculties to carry around with me all the statistics
which would be involved in that important
and far-reaching question. However, I would

SENATE DEBATES
like to point out that the figures I have
referred to apply only to the production of
wheat in the prairie provinces and could not
possibly apply to wheat production in any
other province, because it is not at all
comparable.
Perhaps I should ask the honourable senator at some later stage in this debate to provide us with some figures as to how the eastern wheat producer is doing, and the corn
producer, about whom I have heard some
rumblings lately, and other agricultural
producers across the country. I should like to
say that this evening I shall have some references to make about some agricultural aspects
which affect all parts of Canada.
The cash advances legislation will provide
a maximum cash advance of $6 per specified
acre. I would like to point out something that
many senators I know are aware of, that it is
estimated that the cost of producing wheat is
some $20 per acre, so that the cash advance
in relation to overall cost of production is still
quite a conservative figure. I add at once that
the doubling of cash advances is an important
and worthwhile step.
Honourable senators, I would suggest that
the Government's agricultural policies are in
many ways contradictory. One department
takes steps to reduce farm machinery prices,
while another department takes steps to
increase the cost of machinery. On the one
hand, hundreds of millions of dollars, soon
reaching half a billion dollars, are poured
into ARDA, the Agricultural Rehabilitation
and Development Act; into FRED, the Fund
for Regional Economic Development; into
ADA, the Area Development Act, in an
imaginative war on real poverty. On the other
hand, the butterfat subsidy to thousands of
small cream shippers is removed. The only
sin of these cream shippers is that they are
small, instead of being large producers. Hundreds of millions of dollars are spent on a
grandiose war on poverty, but poverty for
thousands of farmers is increased by a policy
which cuts off their meagre butterfat subsidy.
On the one hand, hundreds of millions of
dollars are spent on ARDA and FRED, with
their expensive programs to encourage greater beef production. On the other hand, last
spring the Government announced that the
small $300 subsidy for stock watering dugouts,
essential to beef production in many parts
of the country, is to be reduced to $150.
One of the chief reasons that this bill is
before the Senate today in its present form is
the absolute failure individually of members

October 29, 1968

of the Opposition in the other place. In my
opinion, had they been half as determined to
prevent an increase in interest rates as they
were to prevent the dropping of Saturday
rural mail delivery, this bill with its increase
in interest rates would not now be before the
Senate. Their tactics were to make noisy
sporadic complaints that interest rates should
not be increased, and quietly acquiesce in
high interest rates by voting for the bill. On
second and third readings, the vote in the
other place for this bill was unanimous. No
sooner had they voted for a bigger interest
burden for the farmers than they wanted a
debate on the emergency agricultural situation in western Canada. Where was the emergency agricultural situation when they voted
to increase the interest burdens by perhaps
$25 million a year, by this measure alone?
Never in my experience have members
representing rural Canada done such an
incompetent, inconsistent and lousy job as
that performed by the Opposition members
with regard to Bill C-111.

I am inclined to share the legal opinion of
the honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Flynn). I think he has stated what
is in fact the practice of this chamber. I
would ask the Honourable Mr. Argue to
confine himself to this practice and not to
refer again to the other house in the way he
did. The honourable gentleman knows very
well what I mean, because he was a member
of the other house for so many years. He
should comply with our parliamentary
practices.
The Hon. the Speaker: The point was
raised by the honourable Leader of the Opposition. I said that the point was well taken. I
invited honourable Senator Argue to comply
with it and I understood that he was through
with any such reference. We might now consider the incident as closed.
Hon. Mr. Argue: Honourable senators, I
was going on to make some general remarks
about the agricultural situation in Canada and
to say that I feelHon. Mr. Everett: The honourable senator
makes a point that the increased cost relating
to the increased rates will be $25 million. I
wonder how he arrives at that figure of $25
million?
Hon. Mr. Argue: Honourable senators, I
said "approximately"-that was an approximate figure-but if I read the bill correctly
the maximum loans can go up to some $1,200
million. However, I would think that if the
final interest rate is only some 2 per cent
higher than the 5 per cent which farmers had
previously enjoyed under this measure, then
they will be fortunate. I am not looking to
quibble about a particular figure, but certainly any increase in interest charges is a major
burden on the agricultural industry.

Hon. Mr. Evereit: The honourable senator
Is not suggesting that this bill increases the
interest rate by 2 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Argue: No. It could be by three or
four per cent or one and a half or one per
cent. I read the debates in the other place-I
am not supposed to refer to them here-and
the minister was questioned time and time
again but in everything I saw he failed to say
what the interest rate would be. It will be a
varying interest rate and it will be a changing
interest rate and it will be one that has been
taken out of the authority of Parliament and
put in the authority of the cabinet. I think
that is a retrograde step, to say nothing about
the retrograde step of increasing the interest
rate.
If an interest rate increase were necessary-and I say it was not-then I think the
correct thing to have done was to put the interest rate in the legislation and not leave the
agricultural producers on the tender hooks of
a floating, varying interest rate. They have
enough varying costs without being subjected
to an additional one. However, these things
were not in my notes and the honourable
senator has elicited this reply, but I personally would far rather have seen a specific
interest rate in this bill so that agricultural
producers would know where they stand.
I think the Senate of Canada can play an
important role in looking at an industry
which is in great difficulty in many parts of
Canada, whether it be corn production in the
area from which the distinguished Leader of
the Government comes, or whether it be in
cream production where small cream producers have been removed entirely from the
subsidy. In any of these areas I think the
Senate might perform a very useful function.
I suggest that there is something positive the
Senate should do. I suggest we establish an
emergency Senate committee whose duty
shall be to tour agricultural areas across
Canada, to hear witnesses, to assess the current agricultural price-cost squeeze, to examine into the incidents of rural poverty, to
examine pre-agricultural policies and particularly those policies that tend to discourage
individual thrift, initiative and self-help; further, to consider, in particular, whether all
farmers, small as well as large, should be
eligible for support prices on an equitable
basis under Government legislation. The committee should further consider the social and
economic impact of various levels of interest
rates when applied to agricultural needs; and

SENATE DEBATES
in particular what interest rates, types and
amounts of credit are best suited to the
agricultural industry; to make such recommendation on all these questions as in the
opinion of this committee will contribute to a
healthy, efficient and prosperous agricultural
industry.
Such a Senate committee, I suggest, would
make a valuable and lasting contribution to
agriculture and to the whole Canadian nation.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Would the honourable
senator have in mind any proposal of a specific amendment to the present bill?
Hon. Mr. Argue: I have not endeavoured to
bring any particular amendment on second
reading. I am not particularly acquainted
with the rules here. I know in the other place
that that kind of an amendment is not in
order.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It could be made in committee at least, if there is any specific amendment that you have in mind.
Hon. Mr. Argue: I shall be very happy to
take this into consideration at the next sitting, if I feel that there is an amendment that
can usefully be brought forward. If so, I will
be very happy to do so. I would like the
honourable senator who is asking the question, and who has had great experience, to do
the same.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I am not as well aware of
the problems as is my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. Fournier (De Lanaudière): Honourable senators, perhaps it will look as if I
am sitting on the side of the Opposition when
I say that I share the feelings of the honourable Leader of the Opposition in asking Senator Argue for a specific amendment. After the
speech Senator Argue has made, it would
seem to follow that, if he is not satisfied with
the legislation that is before Parliament, he
should move a specific amendment which we
can then decide upon. However, if he is not
prepared to offer some alternative, there
seems little point in making a speech against
the Government, against society, against the
universities and municipal governments, and
so on.
Let the honourable gentleman come clean.
Let him deliver himself of his opinion and
take the responsibility for what he has to say.
Let me reiterate that I share the opinion of
the honourable Leader of the Opposition in

October 29, 1968

hoping that Senator Argue will put in concrete form by way of specific amendment the
criticism which he levels at the bill.
Hon. Arthur M. Pearson: Honourable senators, I would first like to congratulate you,
Mr. Speaker, on having been named Speaker
of this chamber. Many illustrious Speakers
have occupied the Chair before you, but from
your conduct of the business of this Chamber
so far, I do not think we have ever had a
better Speaker in the chair.
Also, I would like to congratulate the Leader of the Government in the Senate on his
appointment to this chamber. He has had a
most remarkable political career, not only in
this country but in many foreign lands. His
experience has been outstanding in dealing
with foreign nations and in foreign affairs,
and with all his experience I am sure he will
give us great service in this chamber. I an
sure we will benefit from his very fine work
before the year is out.
Now, honourable senators, there is little I
would criticize in this bill, which is mostly a
renewal of an act first brought out in 1945.
The purpose of this act was to assist farmers
in obtaining credit, wherewith they could
purchase machinery, livestock, and do some
small improvement work around their farms
so as to make a successful farm operation.
The act has been most successful and has
been renewed from time to time during the
intervening years.
During the latter part of the winter of 19671968, two things were taking place. First, we
were reaching the end of a three-year period,
and, second, the banks which had administered the fund under the act were becoming
increasingly disenchanted with the 5 per cent
interest rate which was written into the act.
As a result, there was a considerable falling
off in the purchase of machinery and livestock, and in other improvements, in this past
summer.
The Opposition held this bill up on second
reading in the committee in the other place,
because they were fighting to hold the
interest rate at the 5 per cent it had been at
previously. Failing that, they wanted at least
to have the interest rate set out in the bill so
that a farmer might know what he was obligating himself to do.
I am in no hurry to see this bill passed in
its present form. The interest rate worries
me, as I know it will worry a good many
farmers who may be making use of its lending privileges. I realize that it must be very
difficult for the Government to have to bring

October 29, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

in this bill at an increased interest rate,
because they know, without a doubt, that it
will not go down very well with those who
will be borrowing.
I would ask the honourable senators to
allow me the privilege of placing on record
some figures taken from the 1967 Annual
Report of the Farm Improvement Loans Act.
Table 3 on page 8 of this report was referred
to by the sponsor of the bill. There are a
number of headings in that table. For example, the first heading is "Purchase of Agricultural Implements;" the second is "Construction, Repair or Alteration to Farm Buildings";
the third, "Purchase of Livestock; and the
fourth, "Other Improvements."
Now, I will not give any more than
two of those columns, and I might say that
they are divided off according to provinces.
Under the first heading Purchase of Agricultural Implements we have the amounts borrowed by farmers during 1967 in each of the
separate provinces. These amount are given
in round figures, as follows:
$ 3,894,000
British Columbia
Alberta
48,456,000
48,982,000
Saskatchewan
18,626,000
Manitoba
24,808,000
Ontario
Quebec
658,000
776,000
New Brunswick
Nova Scotia
798,000
1,813,000
Prince Edward Island
Newfoundland
7,000
Honourable senators, those were the figures
with respect to the purchase of agricultural
machinery. The figures in respect of livestock
purchases by farmers of all provinces are as
follows:
British Columbia
$ 1,229,000
5,725,000
Alberta
Saskatchewan
2,709,000
Manitoba
1,383,000
Ontario
3,164,000
Quebec
88,000
60,000
New Brunswick
131,000
Nova Scotia
Prince Edward Island
73,000
12,000
Newfoundland
Incidentally, I might say that with respect
to the Province of Quebec they have a provincial loaning system of their own which
probably accounts for the small amounts borrowed through this Farm Improvement Loans
Act by farmers from that province.
Turning to the Maritime provinces, I would
like to point out that the farmers in those

four provinces spend $3,394,000 for the purchase of machinery as compared with one
province, British Columbia, which shows
$3,894,000, or practically the same amount.
Then, for the purchase of livestock the total
in the four Maritime Provinces is only
$276,000; that is about one-fifth of what
Manitoba farmers borrowed.
Honourable senators, to me the question is,
what is going to happen to the Maritime
Provinces? At the present time they have
borrowed very little of these guaranteed
funds, even at an interest rate of 5 per cent.
If we have the interest rate set at the prescribed rate which the bill calls for, and which
will probably mean current commercial rates
which might run anywhere from 7j to 91 per
cent, my view is that lending to the Maritimes will probably dry up completely. There
seems to be something wrong when the area
from Ontario west, including Ontario, borrows large sums of money for farming operations, and yet the area east of Quebec borrows so very little. I would have thought that
the idea of the 5 per cent interest would have
encouraged farmers in that area to go in more
for livestock than they have done.
As I said before, the real problem is the
interest rates. What is to be the rate on the
loan to purchase land? You will notice that in
the bill the total loan a farmer can have now
is $25,000, and $15,000 of that will be allocated to purchase land, if that is his wish, but
there is no indication of what the interest rate
would be on the money for the purchase of
this land if the farmer borrows through farm
improvement loans. What will be the interest
rate on loans for the purchase of machinery,
or livestock, or improvements on buildings
or land?
It has been said in the other place that
there are two rates of interest. No one knows
what this means. It is also suggested that
these interest rates will have to be negotiated.
Does this mean that the minister is going to
negotiate with the banks and the near banks,
or has each individual farmer to negotiate? If
the latter is the case, then the farmer who
has good credit and is a substantial farmer
will be able to go to his bank, negotiate a
loan, and because he is a good risk, will be
able to get the money at a more favourable
rate than the small farmer who is not such a
good risk, and who may have to pay the high
rates of 8j to 9j per cent.
On the other hand, what is the value of the
bill to farmers of Ontario, Western Canada or
British Columbia? They can go into the bank

SENATE DEBATES
now and borrow money at the regular rates
without having to go through the Farm
Improvement Loans Act. What is the situation if interest rates are to fluctuate? One
farmer I know quite well, in discussing the
matter with me, said that he could buy a
tractor or other farm implement in the fall
from an implement dealer without any payment, either principal or interest, until the
following April or May. At that time, as he
was a member of a credit union, he could get
a loan from the credit union and pay off the
implement dealer and extend his payments
for six months. When this six months is up,
he could go to the bank and borrow money
there at the going rate and pay off the credit
union, and get another extended period, so he
could not see why he need worry about the
government-guaranteed loans.
Honourable senators, I have a suggestion to
make which I think the Government might
well consider. First, cancel the government
guarantee of 10 per cent on these loans.
Second, make a deal with the banks and near
banks to advance money at 6 per cent or 7
per cent and have the Government underwrite the interest rate at one per cent. In
other words, the Government would pay one
per cent simple interest on all current loans. I
mention 6 per cent or 7 per cent interest
because there is now a trend for interest rates
to go lower. You will notice that the Chase
Manhattan Bank in New York has cut down
interest rates to 6 per cent. At least, that is
what I understand. The other banks have to
follow suit, but have not yet come close to
that.
I think the Government would be justified
in setting these rates for the following reasons. First, the Agricultural Stabilization
Board during the last 10 years of its existence, has paid out $544,504,693, or an average
of $54,450,469 per year. This was by way of
being a direct subsidy on farm products
which were mostly produce for our table, but
very little subsidy was paid to farmers
engaged in producing wheat and cereals for
export. I would add that wheat is one of the
better aids to our foreign trade balance.
If the Government would pay this subsidy
of one per ccnt interest on loans made under
the Farm Improvement Loans Act, based on
the last year's loans of $203,604,856, they
would subsidize the best farmers to the
extent of some $2,036,048. That is what it
would cost at one per cent. If they hold the
interest rate at an even rate for all farmers,
there would be some value to the Farm
Improvement Loans Act. The guarantee is not

October 29, 1968

of any great value as most of the loans made
have been gilt-edged. There is very little loss
on the Farm Improvement loans or Farm
Credit Corporation loans. As I say, they are
practically gilt-edged.
Referring to Bill C-111, I notice that it calls
for an amount of $900 million, the maximum
to be lent under the guarantee for the next
three years by the banks, and a maximum of
$300 million to be lent by credit unions,
caisses populaires, insurance companies and
trust companies, making a total of $1,200 million which is an increase of some $500 million
over the last three-year period.
I am glad to see that the Government is so
optimistic about farming in this country,
However, to my way of thinking the increase
in interest rates will greatly reduce the
amount of loans taken out by farmers during
the next three years, unless the Government
can come through with a much better proposition than merely saying that the interest
rate will be simple interest at a rate prescribed, and leave it up to the farmer to
negotiate his own interest rate on his own
particular loan.
Hon. J. Harper Prowse: Honourable senators, it is not my intention to keep you long,
but there have been some things said that I
believe should be clarified as soon as possible.
This is not an act by which the Government of Canada lends money to farmers. You
have a Farm Credit Act and Farm Machinery
Act, which we will probably be getting a look
at one of these days whereby actual loans
are made by government organizations. This
bill is merely intended to provide some
encouragement to lending institutions to lend
money to farmers who otherwise might not
be considered as sound banking risks. Originally, it was brought in for the purpose of
encouraging the banks to make loans they
otherwise would not have made-the same as
the small business loans and others-by guaranteeing them against losses in aggregate
up to 10 per cent of the total loans made.
The Government, in effect said to the banks:
If you will be a little more optimistic about
this fellow's ability to repay than you would
be in the ordinary business transaction, we
will underwrite your losses up to 10 per cent
of the total loans that you make. In other
words, if you lend $1 million, we will underwrite your losses up to $100,000.
Now, this bill goes a little further than that.
What has not been mentioned, and in
fairness I think should be said, is that the
previous act applied just to the chartered

October 29, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

banks, and it was introduced at a time when
5 per cent was about the prime bank rate. In
other words, that was the rate that the banks'
best customers probably could get at the time
this act was originally passed, based on the 5
per cent. Banks do not have any good 5 per
cent customers today. The banks are paying
6, 7 and 7j per cent for money to lend.
By this bill we have gone ahead, not only
to extend the provision of guarantees to the
banks. The first section provides that the
caisses populaires, the credit unions and trust
companies, any of these organizations that are
in the business of taking deposits and making
loans, can apply to the minister for certification under th!s particular act. They too will
be able to lend money and be guaranteed
against losses.
Not only that, but to encourage the smaller
institutions to come in-particularly credit
unions-they are going to guarantee 90 per
cent of the aggregate principal amount of the
loans not exceeding $125,000. And on the next
$125,000 they will guarantee them against 50
per cent loss; and then 10 per cent of everything over $250,000. In other words, this is to
deal with the situation that Senator Pearson
was talking about, to bring in the small credit
unions and those smaller organizations in
areas that are not served by or are not used
to getting the services of the bigger banking
institutions that, up until now, have been servicing the large centres in western Canada
where big loans are made. This measure provides that they can borrow, not $15,000 in
gross, but a total of $25,000. Further, they are
not limited to buying certain things, but they
can buy land to enlarge their holdings.
I have complete sympathy with the honourable Senator Argue and the honourable
Senator Pearson; I am sure every other
honourable senator agrees with them and
with me when we say that we weep for people who have to pay 9 per cent interest. I
weep when I have to pay it myself, and so do
you. The fact remains that if we had left the
5 per cent interest figure in, we would have
been deliberately and viciously deceiving the
farmer into thinking we were doing something for him, when we were only making
a hollow and transparent gesture which would
not do anything, because that legislation, with
the 5 per cent interest rate, would not make
one dollar available for farm loans.

Hon. Mr. Argue: It could be subsidized.
Hon. Mr. Prowse: That is not what the bill
is about. If you want subsidized interest, that
is fine. When we are dealing with a piece of
legislation, then let us deal with that legislation. If all we want is an investigation into
interest rates in Canada-as they apply to
farmers, fishermen, little businessmen, big
businessmen, primary producers, secondary
industry, or other activity-that is another
matter. We have vast numbers of people
unable to buy houses in this country because money was not even available at
81 per cent. Certainly, we have a problem
regarding interest rates, but let us not confuse it by saying it is just the farmers who
are affected or that the problem applies only
to this act. Let us not say that a bill, which is
an honest and a responsible attempt to deal
with a particular problem, is dishonest
because it realistically faces up to a problem
that had to be faced.
If we are to make money available to
farmers for the things they need, if we are
to encourage competition from other lending institutions which we hope will force
interest rates down-and that, in the long run
is all that can do it-then this legislation will
accomplish that. But, if we left the rate at 5
per cent there would be no available money
and there would be no new competition. The
guarantees and promises would be hollow,
because who is going to lend money at 5 per
cent when they have to pay 6½, 7 or 7j
per cent to obtain it to lend?

POST OFFICE ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND

READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. Langlois for the second reading of
Bill C-116, to amend the Post Office Act.
Hon. M. Grattan O'Leary: Honourable senators, yesterday ini moving the adjournment I
asked if the honourable Senator Langlois
would answer two questions which I posed. Is
he prepared to answer them now?

applied to the total cost each year. The formulae established yield average costs for each
group of newspapers and periodicals.
Because the cost formulae should be simple
to apply, the mail operations of the department were divided into three essentialiy distinguishable areas and the costs in each area
were related to the dominant variables in
each area. The three areas are: (a) sortation;
(b) transportation; and, (c) delivery.
Sortation costs are predominantly a function of the number of pieces, size of each
piece, and the degree to which the total mailing of a publication was "made up" by the
publisher before it was brought to a Post
Office. The effect of makeup has been included in the cost allocation process by means of
the flow test samples which yield actual sortation times per piece.
Transportation costs are priniarily a function of distance travelled and is also a coinplex function of weight and cubage. Weight
was selected as the second variable, both
because specific gravity was assumed uniform
and because weight has been the main basis
for the definition of revenue.
Delivery costs are assumed to, be a function
of the number of pieces only and apportioned
uniformnly on a per piece basis because it was
found there is no significant difference in the
delivery costs whether it is by letter carrier,
rural route, lock box or general delivery.
It is assumed that the second class mail
services shali bear their full direct cost and a
proportion of fixed costs. This is based on the
premise that second-class mail is an integral
part of the services provided by the Post
Office Department and should therefore bear
its part of establishment costs. This principle
is consistent with recomimendations made by
several study teams and commissions on Governmnent-for example, the Glassco Commission Report, volume 3, page 383, which
recommend that charges made for services
rendered should be designed to recover the
full cost of the service.
A question was asked yesterday by honourable Senator Macdonald (Cape Breton) which
1 answered at the time, but apparently I did
not; speak loudly enough and my answer was
flot recorded. His question referred to the
rate for the mailing of Christmnas cards,
whether sealed or unsealed. I answered that
the rate is five cents if in unsealed envelopes
and six cents if in sealed envelopes.

Han. Leopold Langlois: Yes, I arn.Th
questions were: 1. How much of the Post
Office deficit last year was attributable to the
carniage of daily and weekly newspapers, as
opposed to magazines and other second class
matter? 2. How was this figure arrived at?
I assume the honourable senator was referring to the fiscal year 1966-67. The total deficit of the Post Office Department for dailies
and weeklies amounted to $6,976,000. The
answer to the question as to how this figure
was arrived at is fairly long, but in view of
the remarks which were made in several
quarters, questioning the exactness of the
deficits which were given, I think I should
give the answer in f ull. The system of determining revenues and costs of various categories of second class mail is as foilows.
Second-class mail is one category for which
revenues are maintained separately and accurately. For each publication, whether statutory or regulatory, the annual revenue is
recorded because of the system. of accountmng
used for this class of mail.
There are two stages in the determination
of costs of any category of second-class mail
and any particular publication within each
category.
The first stage is the cost ascertainmient
system used to aliocate ail cost factors to the

SENATE DEBATES
last week against the use of comfortable
phrases of mutual praise, I do not hesitate at
all in saying that, after having listened to
Senator Langlois last evening and having
read his speech in Hansard today, he certainly made the best of a very bad job. I also
read the presentation made in the other
place, and I say that Senator Langlois's presentation was made in better style and in a
more thorough manner than it was in the
other place.
Now, this is a very complicated bill. I want
first to speak of it from the standpoint of
newspapers, about which I am supposed te
know a little. I wish to say at once that I
have had no communication whatsoever with
the Canadian Publishers Association. I have
not communicated with them, nor have they
had any communication with me. I have not
read any of the briefs that they presented to
the Postmaster General. I will speak for
myself.
First, I want to talk about the figures just
given by Senator Langlois. I have no means,
nor has any other senator in this chamber the
means by which to examine those figures.
The Postmaster General in the other place
and the sponsor of the bill here say these are
our figures and these are the means by which
we arrived at them, but I want to know more
than that. I want to know what criteria they
used in arriving at or sorting out these
figures. One of the reasons given in answer to
this question was given three years ago by
the Royal Commission on Government Organization, Volume III, page 320. The annual
statements of the Post Office were dealt with,
and this is what Mr. Glassceo said:
As in all departments of government,
the operating figures are incomplete and
misleading,They are dealing with the Post Office. The
report goes on to say:
-because
of the omission from the
accounts of a number of charges that are
borne by common service agencies and
not passed on to the users. The Post
Office figures are more than ordinarily
incomplete because substantial charges
are omitted and for certain services rendered to other departments, mainly the
carriage of mail, no revenues are earned.
The principal expenses of the Post Office
not refiected in its accounts are the cost
of accommodation, 8.8 million square feet
of floor space provided by the Department of Public Works and worth about

October 30, 1968

$25 million per annum, and the superannuation costs for its employees, about $15
million, now charged to the Department
of Finance.
The report further states at page 323:
-The operating results of the Post Office,
based on present incomplete accounting,
were shown in the preceding chapterFurther down it states:
Determination of unit costs and revenues presents considerable difficulty. This
arises from the mix of different classes of
postal matter, common transportation,
common handling of all classes and
groups of services by single work forces,
and other complexities.
Honourable senators, it seems to me that
that is enough to cause us to ask: How did
you arrive at these cost figures that are
attributed to the carrying of newspapers? I
am not questioning the good faith of Senator
Langlois, but there was one statement that
surprised me a little, and which I challenge
absolutely. He said that over the past ten
years the Post Office-the taxpayers of Canada, in other words-have paid $300 million
into the pockets of newspaper publishers by
way of subsidies.
Honourable senators, as I say, I do not
challenge the good faith of Senator Langlois,
but I challenge that figure absolutely, and I
say here without fear of contradiction that it
is absolutely incorrect.
That money may have been lost in the carrying of second-class mail, but it was not
paid into the coffers of the so-called newspaper barons. That money, so far as it could be
charged to newspaper carriage, was passed on
to the mail subscribers of the newspapers.
Let me give you an example of a newspaper
about which I happen to know something, the
Ottawa Journal. It has a circulation of 77,000
copies, and of that total only 7,000 copies go
to mail subscribers-about 6 per cent. The
abolition or the loss of the so-called subsidy
for those mail subscribers will mean absolutely nothing to the Ottawa Journal. It will
mean a saving instead of a gain. These people
are charged $17 a year for the newspaper,
and the newspaper bears all the cost of delivery to their homes through the mails. We lose
on every rural subscriber an average of $10 a
year. That is all it means to us, and this is
true of every metropolitan newspaper.
We do not deliver the bulk of our newspapers by mail. We have them delivered in the

October 30. 1968

Octabr 30,1968SENATE
DEBATES

cities by newsboys. As to towns such as
Smiths Falls, Carleton Place and Arnprior we
ship our papers by truck and have them
delivered there by newsboys. The only people
who are going to lose by this are the mail
subscribers, because I have seen statements:
to the effect that we will have to treble our
rates. That is flot quite correct, but we shal
have to more than double them. And when we
do that we will be charging $35 a year for a
subscription to the Ottawa Journal. The same
will apply to the Ottawa Citizen and to the
French language newspaper Le Droit. This
means that the fariner in the rural areas of
Eastern Ontario may well be deprived of a
daily newspaper.
I arn sure there will be some who will say:
"So what? What will they lose?" Well, honourable senators, as was remarked here yesterday, ever since Confederation we have gone
on the principle-and I think it is a right
principle-that the man living in the rural
parts of Canada is as much entitled as is the
man living in the city to the information and
the education hie can derîve from a newspaper. You may ask me what education he
derives from a newspaper. This, of course, is
a question that we hear asked by the advocates of televîsion.
Honourable senators, I will tell you what
they get in our newspapers. This afternoon
the two Ottawa newspapers will publish more
world news than the two evening newspapers
in London or the two evening newspapers in
the City of New York. If you would challenge
that statement I would invite you to buy the
two London evening newspapers of todaythe Evening News and the Evening Standard.and compare their world coverage with what
appears in the Ottawa Journal and the Ottawa Citizen and Le Droit. Go to New York
and buy the Evening Post or the Evening
World Telegram, which are the only two
evening newspapers left there, and compare
their world coverage with that of the Ottawa
Journal and the Ottawa Citizen.
This is what we give the rural subscriber.
We give him the best of the Manchester
Guardian. We give him the best of the New
York Times. We give him James Reston. We
give hirn ail of these things. I say to honourabie senators that if this bill passes-and I arn
sure it will-many of the people who are
getting those services in the rural communities will be deprived of a newspaper because
they cannot aff ord to pay $35 a year for it.
You may say: "Well, this is costing money.")
0f course, it is costing somebody money, but
I can assure you that money is not going into
29234-252'

the coffers of the Ottawa Journal. We loe
money on every subscription we seil i the
country, and s0 does our competitor, the
Ottawa Citizen. So does the Globe and Mail,
and so does every daily newspaper in every
metropolitan area of Canada. Every newspaper sent to a rural subscriber entails loss.
Yet, they talk about $300 million being
poured into the treasuries of the newspaper
barons over the past ten years. This, honourable senators, is nonsense. It is absolutely
incorrect.
The curious thing is that the people who
talk that way-the people who say, "Oh, well,
if they lose their newspapers they will not
lose much"ý-are the people who are ail for
television, which we have subsidized over the
past ten years by perhaps far more than $300
million. Television has been subsidized by
that amount in order to give the people not;
world news, not; news covering the activîties
of the Senate or of the Parliament of Canada,
but Bonanza, the Smothers Brothers, and Ed
Sullivan.
I know that people are now saying: "Oh,
but look at the educational value of TV." I
read the other day that Marshall McLuhan
said that a four-year-old child said she did
not want to go to school because it would
înterrupt her education on TV. This is what
we are coming to in this country!
There is ail this talk about television, and
what do we get from television on the
activities of this Parliament? We see television taking advantage of every means it can
to bring Parliament into contempt. We get
unsophisticated, young people who every
night of the week gîve us what they call
Viewpoint. If this is the sort of education
television is giving in Canada, then I say,
"God help Canada." Yet we pay out $145
million to the television, and not a word is
said about it. But, to pay $300 million-if that
fgure is accurate, and I doubt it-to enable
our rural population to know what is going
on in the world and in their own country is a
crime.
Where is this money goîng? We have heard
mention in the other place, and indeed here,
of the Winnipeg Free Press Weell. Honourable senators, I happen to know that that
paper lost money last year. What happened to
the old Family Herald and Weekly Star, a
paper which I believe nearly ail of us read as
boys?
Hon. Mr. Raebuck: Hear, hear.

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. Mr. O'Leary (Carleton): That was a

highly respected paper. What happened to it?
It went broke, and went out of business. This
is what is happening to all the newspapers in
Canada which are supposed to get these tremendous subsidies. Today we have amalgamation after amalgamation, and we have
come-and I think it is a bad thing-to the
one-newspaper town. All over Canada newspapers are going out of business. They are
not run by newspaper barons. They have not
pocketed $300 million over the past ten years.
This is utter nonsense, and this is why I
challenge the figures given to us by this Government. We cannot usefully debate this matter if it is general. I think the only way to do
it, to get at the truth, is to bring the Postmaster General and his principal officials
before our Standing Committee on Banking
and Commerce and ask him questions about
how they arrived at these figures.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Would the honourable
senator permit me to point out that the Postmaster General and his officials will appear
before the committee.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary (Carleton): I am very

glad to hear it. In the meantime, I think that
certain statements made in the other place
and in this house should be challenged here,
at least in principle.
I am against this bill, because when you
get down to it, it is nothing more than a new
tax, an indirect tax on people least able to
afford it, another tax which will increase the
cost of living, another indirect tax to earn
revenue to rescue the present Government
from the amount of deficit which it cannot
control. That is all this bill is.
If the Postmaster General wants to cut
down expenditures in his department, to make
the Post Office pay-and I doubt whether it
will ever pay, because it is a service for
which we should be prepared to pay-for
heaven's sake do not come along and say that
if it were not for the newspapers the Post
Office would wipe out its deficit, or nearly
wipe it out. Do not say, "You are the devils,
you newspaper barons, taking $300 million
from the Post Office in 10 years."
Honourable senators, I do not know who
supplied the honourable Senator Langlois
with a statement like that, but that is the sort
of statement I should like to see analyzed in
our Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce. More than that, I would bring to
that committee the publishers and ask thern
to present their case and to answer questions

October 30, 1968

as well-not only the Postmaster General, but
the other side too.
I think this is a bad bill, but there is something else to be said about it. When this bill
was before the other place there were complaints about these steps being taken too fast,
too much at one time. One day the Postmaster General said he had taken note of
these complaints and remarked, "Having
taken account of these various complaints
I will ask a colleague of mine to move an
amendment with respect to paragraphs (a),
(b) and (c) of subclause 2 on page 4 of the
bill". Whereupon Mr. Mcllraith rose and
moved this amendment. I will not read the
amendment; it is a long one and you have
seen it. He felt this would satisfy public
opinion.
I have the report now before me and it
quotes the amendments moved by Mr.
McIlraith, giving the new impositions by easy
stages, or at any rate by stages rather than
all at once. This is dealt with on page 5 of the
bill, clause 3. This apparently was stuck into
the bill after these assurances were given in
the other place that the matter would be
moved into by stages. The bill now says:
Notwithstanding subsection (2), (a) the
minimum postage for a piece of mail consisting of one or more Canadian newspapers or Canadian periodicals described in
paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of that subsection is two cents;
What does that "notwithstanding" mean?
What does the two cents mean? Do these
things mean that the two cents rate is going
into effect at once or by stages? No stage is
mentioned there. Notwithstanding the amendments he moved about this going into effect
by stages, it says:
Notwithstanding subsection (2) the
minimum postage for a piece of mail consisting of one or more Canadian newspapers or Canadian periodicals described in
paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of that subsection is two cents.
Honourable senators, that two cents seems
small, but I am told it represents a very
considerable increase, and it goes into effect
at once; it nullifies the amendments moved by
Mr. McIlraith and accepted by the other place
in good faith, because when they accepted
those amendments in good faith and said that
this greatly improved the bill, they did not
know about these words, "notwithstanding
subsection (2)".

October 30, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Honourable senators, these are things we
must bring to the attention of the Postmaster
General. Exactly what does he mean by the
two cents? I do not have the exact figures,
but I believe there will be a tremendous
increase on what is being paid now.
There is another consideration. Small weekly newspapers have no home deliveries in
their city. Practically ail their papers are
delivered by mail. God knows, these papers
are not owned by wealthy publishers. These
papers will be affected, I think, to the point
of destruction.
What about the religious press? Al their
subscribers are mail subscribers. Do honourable senators think the religious press is prosperous in this country? I know personally
that they have a difficult time making ends
meet, yet if these rates, representing a 25, 30
and 40 per cent increase in their costs, go into
effect at once they will be affected to the
point of destruction.
It is not good enough to say that the newspapers knew this was coming. They did not
know it was coming in this destructive form.
But the big dailies will not be hit; they will
go on as before; they may even have savings.
But the little fellow, the small newspapers,
the religious papers, will all be hit, and hit
hard, I believe hit to the point of death.
Honourable senators, I could argue about
other things in this bill, which is a very complicated measure, but I believe that the only
way to discuss this bill is in committee,
where the responsible people will come and
answer questions. They will be compelled to
answer questions, compelled to tell us how
they arrived at the figures. I believe that if
we do that, although I doubt that we will
change the bill, we will at least do something
to enlighten public opinion.
I repeat what I said at the beginning. I
think this is a bad bill. It is a new form of
taxation. That is ail it is, and if this house
had the power and the wit it should amend or
reject it.
Hon. J. Harper Prowse: Honourable senators, I do not think anybody in this chamber
will disagree with the statements we have
heard from the honourable Senator O'Leary
(Carleton) concerning the necessity of having
the press of this country made available to
the people of this country. The success or
failure of a democracy surely depends on the
availability of the widest possible spectrum of
views and information to the people who

must make the decisions. If we as a Parliament should do something to deny to the people of Canada the widest possible access to
the widest possible spectrum of views, then
we have done a disservice to the democracy
in which we say we believe.
I think it would be a great pity and a
tragedy if the people of Canada, for the information on which they must depend in order
to decide what things they should and should
not believe, what things they should support
or oppose, should be left to the unbelievable
bias which we hear every Sunday night on
two network programs which all Canadians
must look at, and which pass under the guise
of public information but which are poorly
disguised and badly presented propaganda
programs.
So, the only thing I would say as to the
principle of the bill before us is this: Do we,
as a Parliament, think that a particular Government department which provides services
ought to collect from the people who benefit
from those services the cost of those services?
This is what the bill attempts to do. Unfortunately, when we have to deal with it we find
ourselves confused by the fact that some of
those services are not merely the carrying of
newspapers, but are also the dissemination of
information.
I suggest that probably what ought to be
done is that these two problems should be
separated. When we vote for the principle of
the bill, we should bear in mind that the
principle with which we are dealing is a decision which has been made at the governmental level that the Post Office ought to collect
revenues from somewhere in order that the
revenues should equal the cost of the services
provided.
If, on the other hand, we feel that part of
those services are necessary and in the public
interest, then we should deal with it by way
of providing for the papers a kind of subsidy
assistance similar to that which we presently
provide for the C.B.C., in order to serve the
areas to which Senator O'Leary (Carleton)
specifically referred. In other words, in discussing this bill let us not confuse two principles. First, should a Government department which provides a specific service of carrying parcels for people from one part of the
country to another, collect the cost of that
service from those people whose parcels it
carries? That is what we are dealing with
basically in this bill. Secondly, there is the
principle of the responsibility we may have,
as the Parliament of Canada, of subsidizing
agencies which perform certain functions

SENATE DEBATES
which we may or may not consider important
but which, with Senator O'Leary (Carleton), I
agree fulfil the most important function of
providing information to the public.
I suggest that what we have here is not a
difference of opinion about the principle of
the bill. The principle is, as Senator O'Leary
would be the first to say, and did say-in fact
he quoted the Glassco Commission as saying
so-that services which are provided ought to
be paid for, unless there is an area where
obviously they cannot be paid for and are
carried purely on the basis of public service
and necessity.
Therefore, I suggest that we should support
the principle of the bill we are now discussing on second reading. Then, if as a result of
our discussions and the inquiry which will be
conducted in committee, we decide that there
is an injustice being done-and I am not concerned about the newspaper publishers; I am
only concerned about the people of Canadaif we decide that in our attempt to apply the
principle of this bill we are denying certain
sections of the public the information which
they ought to be able to get at a price which
they can afford, then, surely that presents to
us, as the Senate, the responsibility of initiating the kind of discussion which will result in
making the other adjustments necessary to
make those services available.
The fact is there is a problem which ought
to be concerning every one of us today, that
in practically every metropolitan centre in
Canada there is only one daily available from
which people can obtain information. Except
for Toronto and Montreal, I believe that to be
true. These are the things that ought to be
concerning us, because they strike at the very
principle of the freedom of the press.
Here the simple question is: Do we want
the Post Office to pay its way? If we do, we
vote for the bill in principle, and then we
fight about it in committee.
I am prepared to accept the bill in principle; I think we all are. I suggest that in our
discussions we reserve our dissension for the
proper place in which to disapprove, namely,
in the committee.
Hon.
Leopold
senators,-

Langlois:

Honourable

The Hon. the Speaker: I remind honourable
senators that if the honourable Senator Langlois speaks now, it will have the effect of
closing the debate.

October 30, 1968

Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, 1
only want to make some brief remarks on
what was said by the honourable Senator
Desruisseaux and the honourable Senator
O'Leary (Carleton).
Starting
with
Senator
Desruisseaux's
remarks, I will use my mother tongue.
[Translation]
Honourable senators, yesterday the honourable Mr. Desruisseaux mentioned the case of
one newspaper in particular, the Sherbrooke
Daily Record. Although I have here statistics
on several Canadian newspapers, unfortunately I do not have any for the paper in
question.
Still, in the course of his remarks, the
honourable senator mentioned two other
papers, the Moncton L'Evangéline and the
Montreal Le Devoir I believe. In the case of
L'Evangéline the total circulation is now 8,405
of which 6,262 copies are sent by mail. The
annual subscription by mail costs $15 while
home delivery costs $26, or $11 more than
by mail. The increase in postal rate will
represent an additional annual cost of $5.31.
Adding $5.31 to the present cost of the
subscription by mail, you get a total cost for
subscription by mail of $20.31, as compared
with the subscription for home delivery which
costs $26, that is, $4.69 more.
Here are the statistics I have on the Le
Devoir: total circulation, 41,152; subscriptions
by mail, 18,432; the subscription by mail is
$20, whereas home delivery costs $31.20, that
is, $11.20 more. The annual cost at the new
postal rate will amount to $3.57. That is to
say that to compensate for this increase in the
postal rate the paper only has to increase the
cost of its subscription by mail by $3.57. Even
then the cost will be less than home delivery.
In this regard, I must add that the figures I
have just given on the cost of the new tariff
over a one year period is based on applying
the new rate to the mail subscriptions only.
Now, it is easy to understand that if the
additional cost of the increased rates is
spread over the total circulation, the figures I
have given would be much lower.
Honourable senators, it should also be
noted that only about 10 per cent of the
whole circulation of newspapers is mailed
out. That means that the other 90 per cent is
delivered at home or sold at newsstands.
[English]
Honourable senators, now I wish to make a
few comments on the remarks of the honourable Senator O'Leary (Carleton). I first wish
to thank him for his kind words, but I feel

October 30, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

way you like-the publisher can pass it along
that he should have reversed his sentence
when he said that I made the best of a bad
job. He should have said that I made the
worst of a good bill, but his kindness of heart
made him change it, and so I shall not complain-far from it. He referred to the Glassco
Report in which it is stated that the annual
report of the Post Office Department is
incomplete because many important charges
are omitted. This was probably true at the
time the Glassco report was made.
As I said yesterday, the Post Office Department balance sheet now includes charges for
accommodation and depreciation of equipment which was not the case before, and its
annual report now reflects the actual situation
and gives a true picture of the operations of
the Post Office Department for the year.
I understand that Senator O'Leary (Carleton) did not challenge the figure of $300 million which I gave yesterday, but I wish to
remind him that I did not state that this was a
subsidy to the publishers, because this covers
the total deficit for a period of ten years for
all second-class mail.
Now, he made reference to television and I
assume that he was referring to state-owned
and state-controlled television, and the remark
I made yesterday about a similar comment
made by Senator Flynn applies, that is, that
the content of publicity on television is controlled by Government regulations, whereas
we have no similar regulations with regard to
the newspapers, which are free to have the
advertising content they desire. In this respect I wish to point out that some newspapers have an advertising content as high as
75 per cent and 80 per cent.
Senator O'Leary also referred to the subsidy that should be paid to the newspapers
and/or the public in order to encourage the
dissemination of information. I am in favour
of this, and I touched on that point yesterday,
but I feel that if we are going to subsidize the
Canadian people on news, then we should do
it through a direct subsidy, by a fixed amount
in the Estimates which could be debated each
year. As it is now, we have a subsidy which
is hidden in the deficit of the operations of a
department. It is hardly ever discussed in this
or the other house, as I said yesterday. I do
not think this is the way a subsidy should be
paid.
There is another point which is worth mentioning. As it is now, by letting the Post
Office Department operate at a very high
deficit in the form of a subsidy to the publishers or to the public-you can put it the

to the public in their newspaper and other
publication subscriptions. We are asking the
taxpayers of Canada, whether or not they are
readers of these publications, to pay part of
that deficit. If we increase the rates, as we
are doing by the present legislation, we are
distributing more fairly the burden of the
subsidy to the readers. I think this is a principle which must be borne in mind.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, it is moved by the honourable Senator
LangloisHon. Mr. Desruisseaux: Mr. Speaker, on a
question of privilege, I would like to point
out that the figures given by me are at odds
with those given by the honourable Senator
Langlois. I have a brief here which quotes the
Sherbrooke Daily Record, and it is the saine as
I have given. This is not an important point
but I do want to mention it because of what
was said about the Evangéline, a maritime
paper. I feel it necessary to add that to keep
it alive financial support by subscription was
given to this paper, and the supporters were
headed by citizens from all parts of Canada.
They received subscriptions of over $100,000
at one time, because they had to cover a
deficit. They also received from the Government of France, for cultural reasons, an
amount of approximately $100,000 to make up
a new deficit. I understand there is a further amount to be given by France.
Mention was also made of Le Devoir and to
certain figures contained in a brief submitted
to the Postmaster. There were 18,300 mail
subscribers. The newspaper actually paid
$58,000 odd. The proposed rate, according to
Le Devoir's figures, would increase the amount
to be paid to $124,000. The rate per subscriber
is therefore moving from $3.21 to $6.79. These
are the figures I have. The brief was presented
to the Postmaster General, and it was not
contested.
Motion agreed to, and bill read second
time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, as
I indicated yeterday in introducing the bill,
it was my intention to move that it be
referred to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications. That is still my
intention, but I would ask now for leave to

operations under this act where the recovery

October 30, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

of advance payments throughout the elevenyear period has been 99.5 per cent.
The interest costs on advancing this money
to the fariner have been borne by the Government, and the total over the eleven-year
period is $7.5 million. The defaults of 0.5 per
cent comprise a total amount of $49,845 for
the eleven years. That is a very small amount
of money by which the farmers of Canada,
primarily the western farmers, have defaulted in those payments.
The benefits derived from this act have
gone mainly to the small producer, because
the average advance per year has been under
$1,000. The low average was $698, and the
high average was $992 up until this past year,
when that average went up to $1,032.
The main features of the proposed amendments are as follows. As I hope you are all
aware, the maximum advance allowable
under the previous act was $3,000. The
amendment is designed to increase that
amount to a maximum of $6,000. The rate of
advance will benefit both the larger and
smaller producer, as not only is the amount
of $3,000 doubled to $6,000, but the amount
per bushel allowable will also be doubled.
The previous rate on wheat of 50 cents per
bushel advance has now increased to $1; on
oats, from 20 cents to 40 cents, and on barley,
from 35 cents to 70 cents.
There is also a change in the unit quota. I
assume most honourable senators know the
quota system. Initially at the beginning of a
crop year each fariner in the wheat business
who has a quota book, regardless of the acres
he may have seeded, is allowed a unit quota
of 400 bushels. Originally this unit quota was
left out of the act so that the fariner could
borrow only on the unit quota on the basis of
six bushels per acre. Now he can borrow on
that initial quota as well as a six-bushel
quota per acre.
In the pay-back period on advance payments there is basically no change, as each
fariner who delivers grain to an elevator will
receive half of the amount he would normally
get at the delivery time, and the other half
goes to pay back the advance he has received.
As an example, if a fariner were fortunate
enough to deliver a bushel of No. 1 wheat
today he would receive-this is an average
figure in the west-$1.50 a bushel at the delivery point and he would pay back half of that,
or 75 cents for each bushel on the advance he
would previously have obtained.
Under the act-and there is no change in
this regard-there is only one advance made
29234-26

payable to a fariner throughout a crop year.
This is not changed. However, under these
amendments a fariner will be able to get the
increased amount of the advance even though
he has already applied and received an
advance for this year; in other words, the
increased amount will apply and he will be
able to receive that increased amount.
The Canadian Wheat Board administers
this act and the elevator companies, through
their agents, advance and collect the payments on behalf of the board.
Honourable senators, those are my remarks
on the bill at this time. I have additional
information if it should be required later.
Hon. Walter M. Aseltine: Honourable senators, I am very much in favour of this bill. I
should be, because I sponsored the original
bill in this chamber in 1957. For many years
prior to 1957 the farmers in the Prairie provinces advocated some legislation of this
nature. They repeatedly requested that there
should be some system of advance payments
made to them by the Government if the quota
system was in effect, and if under the quota
system they were unable to market any
considerable amount of grain after they had
threshed it and put it in their bins on the
farm. Nothing was done at that time because
the governiment of the day was of the opinion
that it would not work satisfactorily.
However, when the administration changed
in 1957 and the Progressive-Conservative
government took charge of the affairs of this
Canada of ours, one of the first things they
did was to introduce a bill known as the
Prairie Grain Advancements Act. That act
was assented to on November 2, 1957. As the
honourable sponsor (Hon. Mr. Sparrow) of
this amending bill said a few moments ago, it
proved very satisfactory and worked to the
great advantage of the prairie farmers. The
honourable Senator Pearson also had something to do with the Prairie Grain Advancements Act at a later date, because he sponsored the first amending bill to the original
act passed in 1957.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Two good sponsors.
Hon. Mr. Smith (Queens-Shelburne): Both
farmers.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I am not so sure about
being good sponsors, but we did the best we
could under the circumstances. We had no
difficulty getting the original bill passed
through the Senate, and later the amending

SENATE DEBATES
bills which were required to make the act
function more satisfactorily.
The new honourable senator from Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Sparrow) gave a very full
description of exactly what Bill C-113 is
intended to do. However, he did not tell us
that it is the Canadian Wheat Board which
acts as the agent for the Government and
arranges for the payment of the money to the
farmers when their applications have been
accepted. He has told us that the amount of
the 400-bushel unit quota, which is given to
every farmer as soon as threshing is over on
or about September 1, will not in future be
subtracted from the amount of grain the
farmer has on hand. That is a big advantage.
I am sorry that the farmers require this
double advance. On two previous occasions I
have explained the condition that prevails in
the western provinces which make it necessary for farmers with such a small delivery
quota to carry on without doubling the
advance provided for under the original act.
The farmers' costs have doubled in recent
years. A few years ago a combine could be
bought for about $3,000; today it costs $12,000.
A week ago I was talking to a farmer at
Kindersley who bas a combine which cost
$15,000. He is a big farmer and of course
requires a big machine. He said that when
the weather was good he threshed about 500
bushels an hour with that machine. Other
machines which farmers use out there-such
as seeders, discers, trucks, cultivaters-all
have increased in price. Indeed, the prices
have not only doubled but have increased by
several times, with the result that a farmer
with an economic unit of, say, a couple of
sections or more requires about $50,000- or
$60,000-worth of machinery. Those farmers,
and the smaller ones too, require this additional advance at this time.
Honourable senators, these advances have
to be repaid in the crop year. I would like to
give you three examples of just how this is
worked out. Take, for example, the farmer
with a 500-acre farm. If he is growing wheat,
his specified acreage is 500 acres. When he
applies for an advance on his 500-acre farm
he can obtain $3,000. The quota is six bushels
to the specified acre, and by multiplying the
specified acreage by six you get the amount
of money he can receive by way of an
advance under this act. If it is No. 4 wheatas most of the wheat we are threshing there
now is-he receives an initial payment of
$1.30 per bushel. As he markets his grain the
farmer will pay back 65 cents a bushel, and

October 30, 1968

when he has marketed his six-bushel quota of
3,000 bushels he will have paid back only
$1,950 during the crop year, and will be in
debt $1,050 to the Wheat Board, because his
advance was originally $3,000. If he applies
for an advance the next year he will receive
only $1,950 because he already owes $1,050 on
his previous advance. That is not a very satisfactory situation, because he will be a long
time getting out of debt.
Take the same farm, but with No. 1 wheat.
As was stated a moment ago, the initial payment is $1.50 per bushel. The farmer will pay
back 75 cents a bushel in the first crop year.
He will have paid back $2,250 on his advance
at the end of that crop year, and will owe
$750 to the Wheat Board, which will be carried over and deducted from the advance he
obtains in the next crop year.
Take another farm where the specified
acreage is 800 acres. A 500-acre farm is not a
large one in our country, but an 800-acre
farm is a section-and-a-quarter of land and it
is getting nearer to the economic unit. The
six-bushel quota at $1 a bushel advance will
give the farmer $4,800. He pays back half of
the price he receives for each quota delivered
by him as and when quotas are authorized by
the Wheat Board. He will pay back 65 cents a
bushel if the wheat is No. 4, and when he
markets the total six-bushel quota of 4,800
bushels that he is allowed, he will have paid
back only $3,120, and will be in debt $1,600,
which will have to be deducted from his next
year's advance, leaving him only $3,200 for
the second year. So, if the quota remains at
six bushels per specified acre, he will be a
long time getting out of debt. However, if he
grows No. 1 wheat he gets an initial payment
of $1.50 a bushel, and pays back 75 cents a
bushel. So that when he bas marketed his
4,800 bushels he will have paid back only
$3,600, and will still owe $1,200.
I want to deal next with the larger farm,
one of 1,000 acres. A farmer who has a 1000acre farm on which he grows wheat only will
receive a six-bushel quota, and will get an
advance of $1 per acre. His advance would be
the full $6,000, which would be double what
he could get previously. He will be in a better
position than the other two farmers I have
mentioned, because when he markets his
grain he will have paid back 75 cents a bushel, or $4,500, and will still owe $1,500, leaving
him $4,500 on the second year's advance.
That is the situation, and it is unfortunate
that with a quota of six bushels per acre it is
impossible for a farmer to pay back his

October 30, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

advance in the year in which he obtains it.
What be still owes is carried over into the
next crop year and is deducted from the
advance which he is allowed to obtain in that
year, but no interest is charged. If the Wheat
Board decides that he is in default, he is
charged 6 per cent interest on the amount in
default until it is repaid. In my opinion,
therefore, the quota should be at least eight
bushels per specified acre. That would give
the farmer $8,000 on a 1,000-acre farm, and
with wheat at an initial payment of $1.50 a
bushel be would pay back his full $6,000
advance.
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: That is if it is No. 1.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: But, as I said before, in
none of the examples I have given will he be
able to do so. I understand an amendment to
raise the quota to eight bushels was moved in
the other place, but it was defeated by quite
a substantial majority.
It is obvious from what I have said that the
farmers cannot make a living if they can only
sell six bushels per specified acre in a given
crop year. However, this amendment will
help the farmers greatly, until such time as
the markets open up and they are able to sel
more grain.
However, the fact that this is of some
assistance does not free the Government from
the responsibility of selling wheat. I urge
them to get out and sell. This is just temporary legislation, and I do not see that the
setting up of the Grain Coundil at the expense
of the farmers will do very much good. What
can it do that the Wheat Board and the Government cannot do at the present time?
That is all I wish to say with regard to Bill
C-113. I am glad this advance has been doubled and I know that many farmers will take
advantage of it. In the district where I carry
on my operations, a great many farmers have
not been taking advances at all. They have
been able to finance their own operations
despite the fact that the quotas have been
lowered.
Before concluding I may say that I had a
telephone message yesterday and the sun was
shining once more, the temperature was 70
degrees Fahrenheit and the farmers were
back on the land and combining their grain.
It was grading about grade No. 4 or 4 tough,
but still they were able to pick it up in the
combines fairly dry-about 15 per cent
moisture, which is what the elevators will
accept. If this continues for another week we
will be in fine shape.
29234--26J

Hon. Hazen Argue: Honourable senators,
this bill is an excellent step forward and a
bill that I am sure will receive the full support of this chamber. However, I want to say
one or two things about it because I feel that
there is a flaw in the bill itself. I may be
mistaken, but since I feel that that flaw is
there I wish to express my opinion, and one
year from now we shall know whether those of
us who think there is such a flaw in this bill
were correct or whether the bill itself was
drawn in the best possible terms.
As has been said, some years ago it was
felt that interest-free cash advances were an
impossible thing. Now we have a bill which is
increasing and doubling them and I think
that is a good thing, but I am afraid that the
method of repayment is going to place the
farmer a year from now in a worse position
than be needs to be. With the glut of wheat
on the prairies and the difficulties that everyone admits in obtaining markets, I can see
no hope whatsoever-I hope I am wrong-of
the Wheat Board getting a quota above six
bushels an acre. If they get a quota generally
across western Canada of six bushels an acre
with the room to accept it, they will be very
fortunate indeed.
If this should be correct, and I think Senator Aseltine agrees with me, then it means
that a farmer who has borrowed $6,000 or any
other sum, will have repaid under the terms
of this bill about two-thirds of the amount.
Therefore, if lie has borrowed $6,000 and
repays $4,000, a year from now be will still
owe $2,000. There could be exactly the same
kind of situation next year, at which time he
would no longer be eligible for a $6,000 loan.
Actually he would be eligible for a $6,000
loan less the $2,000 he still owes from the
previous year. So he would be in the position
of being able to obtain only a $4,000 loan. I
think it would have been a sounder position
to have had the repayments in keeping with
the likely quotas rather than basing them on
unlikely quotas. It would have been a better
business proposition for the farmer. It seems
to me that, in a sense, under the present bill
the Government and the Wheat Board are
really guaranteeing an eight-bushel quota.
This they cannot do, but they are trying to do
it. As I see it, next year they will have to
amend the act so the farmer can still get
$6,000 clear. Then they will have to go one
step further and actually purchase the grain
on the farms. That is probably what is coming and perhaps it should, but as a grain
producer and as one who ha- had some

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. M. Gralian O'Leary: Honourable senators, before this motion is adopted and we
take leave of this bill, I would like to ask a
question of Senator Langlois, the sponsor of
the bill. Despite our confrontation last evening with the Postmaster General, which I am
afraid was more lively than enlightening,
there is still some confusion in the public
mind about the effect of the clause which says
that the minimum mail postage of newspapers
will be two cents. I wish to ask Senator Langlois, does this mean that the two-cent rate
will take effect immediately after the passage
of this bill or will it be held over until April
1, as is the case with other increases?
Hon. Leopold Langlois: Honourable senators, I am pleased that the honourable
Senator O'Leary (Carleton) has risen to ask
this question. Apparently in the heat of the
very interesting exchange between the Postmaster General and the honourable senator
yesterday before the Standing Committee on
Transport and Communications some confusion arose. Senator O'Leary asked whether
the Government had made clear to the publishers that the new two cents minimum rate
increase on each piece of mail would be put
into effect immediately. The answer of the
Postmaster General was: "No, nobody in the
Opposition bas asked me the kind of question
that you ask me now." This answer was interpreted as meaning that the two cents minimum piece rate provided for under subsection (3) of clause 4 of the bill would come
into force immediately. That is not so. Honourable senators will note that clause 12 of
the bill reads as follows:
Section 3 shall come into force on the
lst day of November, 1968 and sections 2
and 4 shall come into force on the lst day
of April, 1969.
Consequently, this two cent minimum charge
will come into effect on April 1, 1969 only.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary (Carleton): I thank the
honourable senator for his reply. Although it
is still a bad bill, it is not quite as bad as I
had first thought.
Hon. Hazen Argue: Honourable senators, I
wish to read from the record of the meeting
of the Standing Committee on Transport and
Communications of last evening. At that time
I had asked a number of questions in relation
to the possible effect of this legislation on the
rural or agricultural weekly newspapers of
the country, with particular reference to the
Western Producer.

Honourable senators will know that the
Western Producer is a farm publication,
published in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Last
year, it had a circulationThe Hon. the Speaker: Order, please.
Would the honourable Senator Argue tell the
house whether he is rising on a question of
privilege, or to correct a statement, or is he
speaking on third reading?
Hon. Mr. Argue: Mr. Speaker, I am speaking on the third reading but my only purpose
in speaking now is due to certain events
which took place in the committee last
evening, in regard to the information we
were to get and which subsequently we are
informed by the officers was incorrect. This
information was given last evening. I feel I
should speak now to correct my own position,
to clear the record and to put the facts on the
record.
I referred to the publication, Western Producer, which had a distribution last year of a
total of 8,561,000 copies of the publication.
That publication contained an editorial on
September 19, 1968, complaining that the postal rates appearing in the Government's
proposal would seriously jeopardize its ability
to survive. They were protesting against this
step in the strongest possible terms.
My questions to the Postmaster General
last evening were an endeavour to obtain
information as to whether the increase in postal rates would be likely to damage this publication seriously. I think it is a particularly
good publication and one which al honourable senators would wish to see remain in a
healthy position, carrying on its work of
providing technical information to farmers,
news coverage, and of course the promotion
of the co-operative movement.
Having referred to this editorial, I asked
the Honourable Mr. Kierans, the Postmaster
General, whether or not the Western Producer
itself had made any representation to the
Government about this question, and his
answer was "No."
I asked him further whether the Canadian
Federation of Agriculture, which takes an
interest in these matters, had made representations in regard to rural publications, and
his answer was "No."
I asked whether Mr. Charles Gibbings,
President of the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool,
which organization owns the Western
Producer,had made any representations to the
Government protesting against what was
proposed to be done, and his answer again
was "No."

My comment was to the effect that if they
had not protested to the minister, even previously, it was not a very serious thing. However, I have been handed since then a copy of a
telegram addressed to the Postmaster General
on October 15 and, in fairness, I think it
should be in the record.
The telegram reads:
Proposed postal rate on second-class
mail will have disastrous effects all farm
newspapers. In case of our own publication, the Western Producer, now in serious deficit position, an increase of more
than two hundred percent in bulk postage
charge will seriously threaten continued

Hon. Mr. Molson: I move, seconded by
Senator Lang, that the report be referred to a

Wednesday next, November 6, 1968.
Honourable senators, perhaps I should say
a few words about the report.

This is the third report of the Special Committee on the Rules. It deals with only two
subjects, Divorce, and the number, size and
function of our committees. It is being presented by way of an interim report.
The subject of Divorce, as we are all well
aware, is now dealt with by court action rather than by parliamentary action as a result of
a decision already taken by Parliament.
The second subject, that of our committees,
reflects the intention of the special committee
to revise the whole structure of these committees, to modernize them and bring them up to
date so that this vital part of the functions of
the Senate may be in tune with the age in
which we live. We might say it is the first
fruits of a very active, diligent and interested
committee that is fully seized of the importance of the task given it, to bring the Senate
into the modern world.
Motion agreed to.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators,
before I indicate the proposed adjournment I
would like to give a résumé of our work for
next week.
We will resume the debate on Bill S-14, an
Act to amend the Aeronautics Act, and on
Bill S-15, an Act to amend the Food and
Drugs Act and the Narcotic Control Act and
to make a consequential amendment to the
Criminal Code.
I anticipate that Bill C-111, an Act to
amend the Farm Improvement Loans Act,
and Bill C-113, an Act to amend the Prairie
Grain Advance Payments Act, will be considered in committee and reported.
We shall continue the debate on Senator
Croll's motion for the appointment of a Special Committee of the Senate to investigate
and report upon all aspects of poverty in
Canada. We may be able to proceed with Bill
S-3, an Act to amend the Canada Evidence
Act; and I expect that we will have Bill
C-110, an Act to amend the Farm Credit Act,
from the other place.
As we have just been advised by Senator
Molson, the Third Report of the Special Committee on the Rules of the Senate will be
considered in Committee of the Whole on
Wednesday next. In addition, there are
divorce resolutions on the Order Paper for
consideration.

SENATE DEBATES

Honourable senators, those are the proposed changes. The mechanics of how they
are put into effect would require lengthy
explanation. Therefore, I intend, if this bill
receives second reading, to move that it be
referred to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications, where the officials
from the department or I will be glad to
explain how these changes are effected.
In concluding, I urge upon honourable
senators to bear in mind that the words "Air
Transport Board" now mean "The Canadian
Transport Commission". As a matter of
interest I should mention that the Commission operates through committees. The particular committee in this instance is the Air
Transport Committee, which, in effect,
replaces the Air Transport Board.
If any honourable senator wishes me to go
into further detail of the mechanics of bringing these changes about I shall be glad to
endeavour to do so, but I reiterate that it is
my intention at the appropriate time to refer
the bill to a committee.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Haig, debate
adjourned.
FOOD AND DRUGS ACT,
NARCOTIC CONTROL ACT, AND
CRIMINAL CODE
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READINGDEBATE ADJOURNED
Hon. Fred A. McGrand moved the second
reading of Bill S-15, to amend the Food and
Drugs Act and the Narcotic Control Act and
to make a consequential amendment to the
Criminal Code.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to amend the Food and Drugs
Act and the Narcotic Control Act, and to
make a consequential amendment to the
Criminal Code.
The first amendment to the Food and Drugs
Act is to implement a recommendation of the
Standing Committee on Health and Welfare
of the House of Commons to the effect that
contraceptive devices be brought under the
Food and Drugs Act, and that the Criminal
Code, which prohibits the sale and advertising of contraceptive devices, be amended
accordingly by deleting from section 150(2)(c)
the words "preventing conception or".
It was considered desirable to amend the
definition of "device" so that it includes not
only any instrument, apparatus or contrivance, but also any article that may not come
strictly within the meaning of the present

definition. For example, hearing aids and eye
glasses may not strictly be within the present
language of the amendment, and the intention
is to broaden the definition in order to make
it clear that all articles of a medical character
that are devices in the healing art should be
clearly included.
In accordance with the recommendation of
the Standing Committee on Health and Welfare of the House of Commons, advertising to
the general public of contraceptive devices
should be brought under control. Clauses 2
and 3 of the bill are for this purpose, and
they deal with the control of advertising
through regulation. It is expected that regulations will be developed which will not interfere in any way with the advertising to the
general public by responsible agencies or
organizations concerned with family planning
or the dissemination of birth control information. These amendments, therefore, will permit the legal sale of contraceptive devices to
the general public, but will limit the advertising thereof in accordance with the proposed
regulations. There are two sections in the act
that presently refer to analyst certificates for
use in court, and Part 4 to the Food and
Drugs Act, which is also contained in the
present bill, will make similar provision.
The purpose of these amendments involving certificates of analysis is to make them
uniform under the act. To illustrate, an inspector will pick up a sample of an article
which is subject to the Food and Drugs Act.
He will then submit it to an analyst for
analysis. To avoid the necessity for the analyst personally to appear in court in every
instance to explain his finding, the law permits him to issue a certificate showing the
results of his analysis.
Section 29 (1) and Section 35 of the Food
and Drugs Act, which presently deal with
certificates of analysis, will be made uniform
by giving evidential value to the certificate,
provided a copy has first been furnished to
the accused, and with leave of the court will
permit the analyst to be called for crossexamination.
A similar provision will also be made in
the case of a certificate of analysis for a restricted drug. The same will also apply to the
use of a certificate of analysis under the
Narcotic Control Act which is also being
amended by this bill. The result, therefore, of
the above explained amendments will make
uniform the use of certificates of analysis
under the Food and Drugs Act and the

SENATE DEBATES
Narcotic Control Act. The effect of the amendments will, therefore, give evidential value to
the certificate, subject to a copy being made
available to the accused and subject to the
analyst being called for cross-examination on
this certificate with leave of the court.
The next amendment to the Food and
Drugs Act is contained in Section 6 of the
bill, the effect of which will not permit a
controlled drug or a restricted drug manufactured for export to be exempted from the
requirements of the act. The controlled drugs
under the act are barbiturates and amphetamines, and the restricted drugs under the
proposed bill are lysergic acid diethylamide,
popularly known as LSD, and several other
drugs known as DET, DMT and STP. I will
not attempt to pronounce them in full.
Honourable senators will recall the thalidomide tragedy, and at that time the Food and
Drug Act was amended to set up a schedule
of drugs, the sale of which would be prohibited. The drugs so listed at that time were
thalidomide and lysergic acid diethylamide,
referred to as LSD.
This drug was added because it was recognized that it possessed very special dangers
and its medical value was far from proven.
Provision was made for the experimental
evaluation of this drug in certain approved
institutions and this was considered at that
time to be quite sufficient to control the drug.
Within the last three years or so, however,
this particular drug has become popular with
teenagers and a number of students, not only
in Canada but elsewhere, in America and
even in Europe. When the sale of the drug
was prohibited there was no evidence of any
such improper use.
The police have frequently encountered this
drug in their enforcement activities, because
it may be and often is used in conjunction
with other drugs, particularly marijuana. It
was therefore thought appropriate to complete the control picture by enacting special
legislation which would deal not only with
this drug but with other dangerous drugs, the
medical value of which has still to be
assessed. In order to provide the complete
control which the authorities require, it is
necessary to prohibit unauthorized possession,
in addition to the offences of trafficking and
possession for the purpose of trafficking, until
there is a better understanding of the dangers
of this drug on the part of users.
Since the bill was previously before the
Senate three additional drugs have been
added to the schedule. These drugs were

October 3L, 1968

included because there was evidence of their
improper use and some trafficking in them.
The legislation is so developed that other
drugs can be added in the light of need and
experience, and when a drug has been sufficiently proven to permit of other action being
taken with it the schedule can be amended by
its deletion. The regulations for which there is
ample authority will be designed to cover
legitimate research under competent and
careful supervision.
It is perhaps unnecessary to say that the
drugs which are presently listed are of a kind
whose medical value is far from being
demonstrated and it would be quite unsafe to
have them available for general use. The purpose of the control measure that is before you
is, therefore, to prohibit the unauthorized
use, including trafficking in these drugs, but
to permit legitimate scientific and medical
investigation into them.
Section 7 adds the words "or other substance" to the definition of the controlled
drug. This is in order that an essential chemical which may not be a drug can also be
subject to control.
Section 8 deals with the offence of possession of a controlled drug for the purpose of
trafficking. It amends the present section by
removing a defence where the accused has
acquired the drug legally but has it for the
purpose of trafficking. The old section made it
a defence for an accused charged with possession for the purpose of trafficking to show
that he had acquired the drug legally. Experience has shown that many traffickers were
able to persuade members of the medical
profession to prescribe these drugs for medical reasons when the real purpose of the
individual was to obtain a supply for trafficking. This amendment will eliminate that as a
defence. This is contained in subsection (3) of
section 8, which amends section 33 of the act.
Section 9 repeals section 35, which dealt
with a certificate of analysis, and an explanation is already given of how certificates of
analysis will be covered in the bill. This
brings us to section 10 of the bill, which adds
a new part of the Food and Drugs Act, described as Part IV, entitled "Restricted
Drugs".
A weakness of the present control lies in
the fact that unauthorized possession is not an
offence. The purpose of the amendment is to
make unauthorized possession an offence, and
also to make it an offence to traffic in these
drugs or to have them in possession for the
purpose of trafficking. It should, however, be

october 31, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

pointed out that while these offences closely
correspond to similar offences in the Narcotic
Control Act for possession and trafflcking, the
penalties under this part are less severe than
under the Narcotic Control Act. As LSD is
not regarded as a narcotic drug, the penalties
for possession or trafficking are not as severe,
but they are considered to be adequate.
Section 44 adopts by reference certain
provisions of the Food and Drugs Act, namely
sections 36 and 37, with the necessary
changes in language to make some conform to
restricted drugs. A special note is required
under subsection 3, which authorizes the
Governor in Council to make regulations respecting possession of a restricted drug. The
regulations when enacted will cover legal
posssession by scientists for the purpose of
approved research.
The effect of section 12 has already been
dealt with in discussion of the question of
analyst certificates. The purpose is to bring
this into harmony with the other provisions
of the Food and Drugs Act in this connection.
Section 13 makes the consequential amendment to the Criminal Code by deleting the
words "preventing conception or" as contained in subsection 2 paragraph (c) of section 150 of the Criminal Code. These amendments will prevent a manufacturer from
advertising a contraceptive device but will
permit an organization engaged in family
planning to advertise its use. It will not be
necessary for an analyst to appear in court
every time he has made an analysis of a
sample under the Food and Drugs Act. The
accused will be furnished with a copy of the
analyst's certificate and, with leave of the
court, the analyst may be called in
cross-examination.
These amendments provide that a certain
chemical not recognized as a drug may be
subject to control. Under the present act, if a
person is charged with possession for the purpose of trafficking he would have a complete
defence by producing a medical prescription.
These amendments will remove that defence
and give him only the defence of establishing
to the satisfaction of the court that he was not
in possession of the drug for the purpose of
trafficking.
Hon. Lionel Choquette: Honourable senators, I wish to adj ourn the debate on behalf of
honourable Senator Sullivan, but I should
like to ask the sponsor of the bill (Hon.
Mr. McGrand) one question.
In view of the deaths of two teenagers in
the last month, one caused by glue sniffing

and the other, a young girl of 16, by sniffing
some liquid used for polishing nails, this matter is of an urgent nature. In the circumstances, wil the bill take care of those situations under the heading that the sponsor
explained, that products not recognized as
drugs may be controlled by the Government?
Hon. Mr. McGrand: Substances or chemicals that are not recognized as drugs will
come under this legislation.

Hon. Mr. MacKenzie: Honourable senators,
I have very little to add to what has been

poverty; but there are two or three points or
thoughts which have not been brought out
and which I would like to present to you,
they being somewhat different from the
approach taken by other speakers on this
matter.
I agree that poverty is one of the major
problems of our society, and I wish to congratulate Senator Croll on this motion to establish a special committee of the Senate to
study the question. I hope that the committee
will ask and try to answer two or three basic
questions.
Honourable senators, the first question is,
what is poverty? How does one define it? I
ask this because in my experience poverty
may be a relative term and may vary from

control.

October 31, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Honourable senators, my own definition or
goal is somewhat similar-adequate food,
pure water, clean air, a satisfactory house,
home or shelter, clothing appropriate for the
climate or conditions in which the individual
lives, modern health services and educational
opportunities and facilities. All of these are
basic for every human being everywhere.
However, it is here that the difficulties and
the complications really begin.
More than half of the world's population
exists just above or on the subsistence level.
The world's population is increasing more
rapidly than its food supplies and other
basic requirements as I have defined them.
This is the first and almost insoluble world
problem.
I suspect that while doing all we can to
assist in solving the world problem of poverty, we must concern ourselves in the first
instance and in the main with our own country, Canada, where we are told there is much
poverty, despite our surplus of food and our
great natural resources.
The solution of the problem in Canada is
mainly one for the individual and for the
state-federal, provincial and municipal. An
easy solution, it might seem, would be a
minimum annual income of, say, $3,000 per
adult individual. But to whom should this go?
At what age would it begin? Would those in
the country get the same amount as those in
the city? Who would provide this money?
Would this enable large numbers of people to
do nothing and, being bored, to seek undesirable escapes from boredom in drugs and in
violence and other forms of anti-social
behaviour? For believe me, as we have discovered to our dismay, affluence does not
automatically ensure happiness. The problem
we face is much more difficult and complicated than the material or physical one of
"bread and circuses."
Human nature requires and demands more
and different things than an adequate standard of living alone, though that is essential.
And while we must strive for this, we must
also realize that this is the easiest and perhaps the only answer we can give to the
problem of human welfare and the good life.
Perhaps part of the answer lies in education. Certainly, a basic education is a must,
but ideas and values must be added to this,
and, I suspect, if it can be achieved, a scientific understanding of human nature, in all its
aspects: biological, psychological, as well as
physical. But we have not begun to cope with

this, and because we are dealing with human
nature and human beings, it is extremely
difficult to solve or cope with it in scientific
ways. Some scientists are claiming that by
manipulating the genes, the chromosones and
acid contents, or whatever it is, that sex and
characteristics in human beings can be predetermined before or at the time of birth. Personally, I doubt this, perhaps because I fear it,
for such power in the hands of the wrong
people would be a dangerous and possibly an
evil thing. But certainly this will be one line
of further scientific exploration.
But the point I want to make and leave
with this special committee is this: do not
expect that the elimination of physical poverty will bring a new heaven and a new earth
or, necessarily, even happiness. Neither will
it solve the problem of who is to pay for it,
or what to do about those who do not work
because they are not needed.
But, having sounded these warnings or
notes of caution, I want to go on and state
again, and emphatically, that we must provide a decent standard of living for every
Canadian citizen in the physical and material
senses. And I believe we can do that. We
must eliminate slums. We must ensure the
opportunity to obtain a reasonable minimum
income, preferably in payment for work done.
We must provide in our cities, or adjacent to
them, good housing at rents and costs that
can be met by everyone. We must strive to
provide, through parks and open spaces,
necessary facilities for recreation. We must
strive, through education and in other ways,
to give to what we have termed loosely and
without reflection upon them the "down and
out", the slum dwellers, opportunities at least
to improve themselves and their conditions to
the point that others enjoy, so that they will
no longer be at a different level or in a different class from the rest of the more fortunate
of the population. In brief, we would give
them the opportunity to become men and
women who can stand on their own feet and
can be proud of themselves and of their
achievements.
On motion of Hon. Mr. McDonald, for Hon.
Mr. Cameron, debate adjourned.

SENATE DEBATES

and subdivision occurred in families. Originally they served the population by providing
a decent living to the owners up to my generation, but today farms usually consist of subdivision over subdivision. In the past a farmer was able to cut a few logs and a few cords
of pulpwood in the fall and he was the proud
owner of some eight to 10 cows, a teai of
horses, five or six hogs, a dozen sheep, a
couple of dozen hens, and sometimes a dozen
children. Working five or six months of the
year at manual occupations such as logging,
lumber camps, driving and so on, he was able
to provide a decent means of raising his family. Taxes were low, the cost of living was
next to nothing, as most of the necessary food
was provided by the farm, most of the clothing was made in the home, and education
costs were limited to the upkeep of a small
school and an underpaid teacher.
But, honourable senators, all this has
changed during the last few years of so-called
evolution. The small farm cannot produce the
necessary revenue to meet the increased cost
of living, of education, of clothing and high
taxes. In my own family I have seen these
changes taking place. For example, my greatgrandfather had a large farm, much too large
for his needs; my grandfather had a farm just
the right size; my father had a garden-and I
have a can opener. This illustrates how drastic are the changes taking place, with the
result that eight of 10 farms in my region are
now reverting to bush. Over the past 15 years
over 35,000 small farms in New Brunswick
have been abandoned. Our population, especially the younger generation, has moved to
larger centres where some are living under
conditions of extreme hardship and others are
creating problems.
So, honourable senators, you will agree
with me that many of the bills related to
farm improvement which we have passed in
the last few years have done very little for
small farmers. I am not blaming anybody, but
it is a sad situation which the administrators
seem to have overlooked.
As a further example, honourable senators
will recall that last session we passed a bill
dealing with the dairy commission whereby
any milk producer not producing over 420
pounds of fat or 12,000 pounds of milk would
not benefit from the subvention. This bill was
a serious blow to the few farmers left in my
region, and is a clear example of the foresight
of some of the administrators in the Department of Agriculture.

My honourable friend Senator Argue
fought very hard to bring an amendment to
that bill in the interest of the small farmers,
and I congratulate him on his efforts. He
knew what the consequences would be.
However, I regret he was not successful in
his attempt.
Honourable senators, I do not have the
answer to this problem, and I know it is not
an easy one. However, I am confident that a
second, sober look at the reality of the problem could, perhaps for the time being, assist
the few who are today still trying to hold on
to what they now have, instead of becoming
in the near future public charges.
During the last two years in my area we
have heard much of ARDA. It was presented
to us as the saviour of the country. Our people grabbed it as a drowning man would
grasp at a straw or anything that would save
his life. It received much publicity at public
expense from the government in power. But
so far there is nothing constructive to show
for it. Meetings have been held al over the
region; eloquent speakers were brought indreamers, most of them--not knowing what
they were talking about.
In closing, honourable senators, let me say
that it is not a group of strangers-a few
members of the Company of Young Canadians, with long hair and whiskers living in
hotel suites, eating T-bone steaks at public
expense and writing reports of their findings
while they are waiting for transfer to a more
joyful region-who will solve the problems of
the small farmer. When we hear these outsiders, they have all the answers. For a time
they make us look very stupid-until we ask
them some concrete questions, and then the
roles are reversed.
I am confident that the people who have
lived there all their lives know best what the
situation is, and if their local organizations,
and some of thein are very active, have not
arrived at a solution, I am sure that those
long-haired dollies who have so little to offer
will not be able to do so. Furthermore, most
of them could not care less about what will
happen to the small farmer. This is my answer to Senator Pearson when he asks what
wil the Maritimes do. I am asking myself
what the small farmers in the Maritimes will
do.
Hon. Mr. Rattenbury: Honourable senators,
like the honourable senator across the chamber, I, too, come from New Brunswick and
like him, I support the bill. However, there is

SENATE DEBATES

one question I would like to ask him about
the hundreds of abandoned farms down there.
Is it not true that most of these farms now,
and particularly in his own area, are growing
potatoes and have been taken up as large
operations?
Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Res±igouche): I would like to answer that question by inviting my honourable friend to pay
a visit to my region of Madawaska. I think he
would find that the potato-growing area is
between Woodstock and Grand Falls where
they have large farms. But they do not produce potatoes from Grand Falls up to my
region in Madawaska County. He would find
that this is what would be called a distressed
area. If you travel from Edmundston to my
home, a distance of 36 miles, which 25 years
ago was inhabited by a number of small
farmers each with his own residence on his
own farm, you will find that now there are
possibly two in five miles. The rest are gone.
Hon. Mr. Ratenbury: Without getting into
a regional discussion, across the so-called
Stewart Highway are there not large farms
under potatoes? It seems to me as I drive
through there I see them.

October 31, 1968

used, and that will probably be used in the
future, chiefly by western Canadian farmers.
I would like to say to my honourable friend
Senator Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche)
that despite the fact that this particular piece
of legislation has not been used extensively in
the Maritime Provinces, there are other
agricultural programs that are being used
extensively in the Maritimes. I want to assure
him that as far as I am concerned, as a western representative, we are certainly in full
agreement with the expenditures of money
that are being made by the Department of
Agriculture in his province and other Maritime provinces.
I would refer to the programs which are
commonly known as ARDA, FRED and ADA.
If my information is correct, there is now a
program in northern New Brunswick under
FRED in which some hundred million dollars
will be spent in an effort to help agriculture
and other industries in that area of the province. I also understand there are negotiations
going on between the Government of Prince
Edward Island and the Federal Government
to adopt a similar program for that Island.
However, I do not want to press this any
further than to say that we thank you for
your support of the particular piece of legislation that is before us now, and we assure
you of our support for federal Government
expenditures to help agriculture in New
Brunswick and the other Maritime areas.

Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche): I am going back to my same answer,
that the potato belt starts at Grand Falls,
and if you travel between Fredericton and
Woodstock you will see many farms abandoned and reverting to bush. The potato belt

SENATE DEBATES

surprised if that happened. I am sure my
honourable friend Senator Aseltine would
.expect to pay a different interest rate if he
had a loan for 10 years than he would pay if
the repayment period was 15 years. I am
-only saying I would not be surprised if there
are two different interest rates.
Hon. Mr. Martin: There are not many
things that Senator McDonald does not know!
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I would not say that
too soon; I am not finished yet.
The senator also inquired as to whether a
formula had been set up for the interest rate.
It is most difficult to set up a formula until
such time as you have had an opportunity to
carry on discussions with the lending
institutions.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: One question I asked
the honourable senator was whether there
were any consultations with the lending institutions before this bill was presented.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Again, I am not in a
position to say yes or no, but I would be very
surprised if there had been, because the first
clause of the bill gives the definition of
"banks", and in that definition we are now
including not only chartered banks, but virtually all the lending institutions of this nation.
Until such time as this bill has been passed, I
do not see how anyone could negotiate the
terms of interest or anything else, because
until it becomes law you have no authority to
negotiate with the banks, which are the only
authorized lenders under the existing legislation, or with insurance companies, trust companies, caisses populaires or credit unions. I
would be doubtful if conversations have
taken place, although I do not know. However, I think that if I were the minister responsible for this legislation, I would be very
hesitant about carrying on negotiations with
lending institutions that had no legislative
powers to make loans. So, again, I cannot say
yes or no, but I would not be surprised if
there had not been such negotiations.

rate, the banks and everyone else have
refused to make loans at that rate. If we were
including only banks in this legislation, and
not enlarging the meaning of "bank" for the
purpose of this act, then I could quite understand that there could have been some conversations and negotiations with them. But I
repeat that because the definition of "bank",
for the purposes of this act, is now to be so
broad, I doubt very much if any conversations have taken place, although I do not
know whether they have or not.
Because of this, I think it would be impossible to set up any formula that could be used
to calculate interest rates this year, next year
or any year in the future.
Once the bill is given third reading,
receives Royal Assent and becomes the law, I
have no doubt the negotiations will be finalized. It is my sincere hope that they can be
finalized at as early a date as possible, to give
farmers the opportunity to take advantage of
the legislation to the extent they have the
capability of doing so.
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: I would think the chartered banks, which have been putting up the
money from the beginning, would want to
know at what rate they should lend money
when this bill becomes law. The Government
should have inquired before this bill was
introduced to find out how the banks regarded this and what kind of formula they
would envisage with respect to the interest
rate.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I am not saying the
departmental officials have not had conversations with the banks. In all probability they
have, although I do not know. However,
before you can set up a formula you must
have consultation, not only with the banks.
You must have consultation with the other
lending institutions that are classed as banks
for the purposes of this act. That is all I have
to say on the second reading of this bill.

Hon. Mr. Aselline: Do you not think they
should have consulted the chartered banks
which have been putting up this money all
along, to find out why they are not lending
money now and what they think about this?

The Hon. ihe Speaker: Honourable senators,
it is moved by the honourable Senator
McDonald, seconded by the honourable Senator Beaubien (Provencher), that this bill be
now read a second time. Is it your pleasure to
adopt the motion?

Hon. Mr. McDonald: I am sure the honourable senator recognizes that one of the reasons we have the bill before us today is
because with the present 5 per cent interest

tion with Order No. 7, and while it might
seem more appropriate to wait until that
order is called, there is a likelihood it may
not be reached this afternoon. Therefore, I
ask my question now.
Can the house be informed as to whether
it is proposed to proceed with this resolution?
I have heard rumours to the effect that it
may be abandoned. It bas been my intention
to speak on this resolution, but there would
be no purpose to do so if it is to be abandoned.
Hon. Mr. Croll: May I say that the suggestion that this resolution may be abandoned
comes as a great shock and surprise to me. I
intend that the resolution which I placed
before this house, should proceed and I hope
that in due course it will be adopted.
Hon. Mr. Martin: The situation is that the
resolution is before the Senate, that Senator
Croll has spoken to it, and that the debate
has been adjourned. On behalf of the Government, I may say that this matter is now being
examined.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: The debate on the
resolution has stood adjourned for about a
month, and that is the reason for my inquiry.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: When the Leader of the
Government says that the matter is being
examined, has he in mind the declaration
made by the Prime Minister some days ago,
to the effect that he was not considering
bringing in legislation on this question?
Hon. Mr. Martin: I am certainly thinking of
Government policy.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Senator Cameron, of
course, will speak later.
Honaurable senators, I should like to commence, if I do flot offend anybody in doing Sa,
by making a reference to my deskmate who
is, in my opinion, a great humanitarian. I
suggest that he has made for himself a place
in the history of Canada by placing on the
Order Paper of this house a motion that cails
attention ta paverty, and asks for the
appamntment af a committee ta investigate al
aspects af paverty in Canada, and ta define
and elucidate the problemn of paverty andnote the point-to recomrnend remedial measures. If Senatar Croli's propased cammittee
makes the investigation suggested in his
motion, and really brings forward solutions ta
the tremendous problems that face us in this
regard, he will justify a position in the history of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Hear, hear. He has
already dane that, and you have aiso.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, he has already a
position in aur history books. But he will
occupy a greater position if this hause tackles
this prablem and recommends-because we
can do no more than that at the momentremediai measures.
The motion is sufficiently comprehensive ta
enable the committee ta enumerate the causes
of poverty in the midst of pienty. I repeat the
words used by several hanourable senators
who have preceded me-poverty li the midst
of plenty. Poverty i the midst of plenty is
the enigma of aur age. It is the problem mast
pressing for solution, or, ta use mare classical
language, it is the riddle of the sphinx, which
not ta answer it is ta be destrayed.

in revoit against the lack of apportunities it
faces upon graduation, against the massive
unemploymnent in aur country, and against
poverty in the midst of plenty.
Now, I want ta read again the clause that
seems ta have initiated aur present thought. I
read from the Fifth Annual Review of the
Econamic Cauncil of Canada at page 103:
Poverty in Canada is real. Its numbers
are nat in the thousands, but the millions.
There is more of it than aur society can
tolerate, mare than aur economy can
afford, and far mare than existing measures and efforts can cape with. Its persistence, at a time when the bulk of
Canadians enjoy one of the highest standards of living in the world, is a disgrace.
I know that this passage has been quoted
before in this debate, but I would like it to
head the record of what I have ta say taday.
Senator Croli said that we have nat yet
came up with the answer ta what should be
done about insufficiency of earnings. He
speaks of aur low-paid, fuli-time workers.
The Econamic Council has stated that at least
one in every five has suif ered from povertythis daes flot seem to be a wild exaggeratian.
I amrn ot goig into the statistics; ta the
extent that they are available, they are set
out in the Ecanomic Council's repart which
you have received and, I hope, have read.
You have heard a nurnber of very well
prepared and moving addresses by honourable senators who have preceded me. They
have impressed upon us the seriousness of the
poverty question in our country. They have
spoken of defects and isuffciencies in aur
welfare system, but, hanaurable senators will
note that nat one of them, including the Economic Cauncil, even attempted ta discuss the
causes of the paverty which they deplore. Not
one of them said a word about the causes of
poverty, except, perhaps on not getting enaugh
by way of a handout; and nat one even mentianed a possible solution of the problem.
1 think the Economic Coundil camnes closest
ta the point when it says, at page 132:

policies ta foster regional and area develapment and ta accelerate national ecanamic growth.
That is to say, the anti-poverty problems are

expenditures have not prevented substandard
housing, malnutrition or the extensive privation endured by thousands of our fellow citizens. Fifth, I point out that Canada has been
free from the riots and violence that have
terrorized and disgraced the cities to our
south, but this might not have been the case
had it not been for the expenditures of the
large sums of money to which I have
referred.
Now, Senator Croll proposed a guaranteed
income which, though costly, would displace
many of our halfway measures.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: May I ask a question, honourable senators? The honourable
senator referred a while ago to the report of
the National Welfare Council to the effect
that the cost of shelter was 47 per cent of the
income of large numbers of people. That is a
shockingly high percentage of income to go
for shelter. I would like to know what is
included in that cost of shelter.

Hon. Norman A. MacKenzie: Honourable
senators, I apologize for interrupting Senator
Roebuck in this very interesting and appropriate speech, but I have to leave immediately to attend the Senate Committee on Science
Policy. Before leaving I would like to call the
attention of the honourable senators to a
group of young men from British Columbia,
students at St. George's School, who are in
our visitors' gallery. They are here with one
of their masters, the Reverend Mr. Robertson,
and the wives of two members of the staff of
that school. I am sure we are all delighted to
have them with us this afternoon. They have
come a long way to see something of the

This morning His Honour the Speaker was
good enough to welcome them in his chambers and to answer a great many interesting

engaged in a big way in banishing poverty in
his home province. Despite difficulties of
which there were many, he has organized a
plant to transform the forests of New Brunswick into plywood. His operations have
employed some 200 men who of course have
families, and as a consequence they are taxpayers rather than tax spenders. For them
he has solved the problem of poverty.
I apologize for using the Senator's activities
to illustrate what I intend to say. Senator
Burchill has brought the natural resources of
his province into productive use. That is an
effective way to abolish poverty. He has
reached or at least touched the cause of
poverty.
Canada has unlimited natural resources
from coast to coast, and if you will inquire
into it you will find that for the most part
they are half used or completely unused and
are awaiting development. But are they available for developing? Are they available at a
price which leaves a profit to the developer?
When the Economic Council said that poverty in Canada is a disgrace, it really meant
that the under-use or misuse of our natural
resources is a disgrace. If you will allow me I
will go further and say that the Economic
Council implied that our system of taxation in
Canada which encourages the nonuse of our
natural resources and discourages and penalizes their use and development is a disgrace.
Let me give some obvious examples. I can
give only a few, but each senator here has his
own experiences.
If you inquire you will find around our
great cities very large sections of idle land.
These are our natural resources, made valuable by the community and the desire of people to own homes. For as long as I can
remember-and that is a long time now-you
could buy a serviced building lot in the City
of Toronto for about $1,000. That situation
applied until recent years. Today to obtain
space for a house, a family must travel two
or three miles into the country, and then face
a price, according to a recent survey, of $11,000 for a single lot. The ordinary man is
unable to pay such a price. However, should
he inquire into the circumstances, he will find
that lands held at these excessively large
prices are grossly under-assessed in relation to
the asking price. This applies as long as they
lie idle, but as soon as they are used and
built upon they are overburdened with taxes.
All Canada is suffering from a shortage of
housing, and housing locations are unlimited
in this country. The building industry is a

November 5, 1968

potent factor in the matter of employment.
Were land not undertaxed it could not long
be withheld from use by excessive prices.
Were the idle land forced into use, the building industry would take over; the construction workers would be employed; the labourers and suppliers would be employed in very
large numbers, and for them the problem of
poverty would be solved. Poverty would
disappear with the housing shortage and
without draining the revenues of the
municipalities or the provinces.
We are spending huge sums of money on
what we call urban renewal, the rebuilding of
slum areas and the replacement of shacks
unfit for human habitation. If these slum
areas were properly assessed-they are grossly underassessed and undertaxed-the slums
would naturally and rapidly disappear. With
the promotion of employment, the number of
tenants available for dilapidated housing
would also disappear. There are numerous
other examples, honourable senators, of
which each one of you will have knowledge.
I lived in Northern Ontario some 50 years
ago when there were vast areas of potential
mining lands open for staking. I saw the
prospectors-and it was a picturesque army
in those days-strike off into the woods with
a prospector's hammer in their hands and a
pack on their backs looking for signs of
metal, gold, silver, copper and so forth. Where
are they today? They are gone with the wind.
There is no such army today. The holdings
are staked and square miles of our mineral
lands are lying idle, taxed at what rate-at
$2 per 40-acre claim. That has been the rate
in the past and I think it is the rate in
Ontario today. That is 5 cents per acre for a
possible mining location. Multiply by ten that
amount and a principality of mining lands
would be thrown open for development.
It is not the shortage of natural resources
that makes our people poor, but rather the
misuse or under-use of the riches that nature
has placed at our disposal.
I put to you the proposition, honourable
senators, that you could travel from Halifax
to Vancouver and I venture to predict that
you would not find a natural resource capable
of development which is not held for more
than its value in use.
Senator Burchill, the businessman, remarked to me recently that our resources
must be available. Of course, they must.
You may answer that what I have said lies
within municipal or provincial jurisdiction
and, perhaps, in part, it does. But Senator

November 5, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Croll's resolution raises this whole question of
poverty and its causes. The truth, honourable
senators, has no jurisdictional limitations.
Were the earth and its riches open to industry, there would be no poverty other than the
kind I have described, that of the widow and
her children, and so on. There would be no
poverty, no enforced and unwilling unemployment such as we suffer from at present.
New Zealand levies a national land tax, a
tax upon the value of all land in the country.
It is not quite scientifically arranged, but it is
effective.
The City of Sydney, Australia-a metropolis as big as the City of Toronto-raises
its whole revenue by the taxation of land
values. I have stood in the City of Sydney
and have admired its development. There is
no wasteland surrounding that city, and
there is no serious unemployment in either
Australia or New Zealand. In this I speak
from personal knowledge.
So this is the challenge, honourable senators. This is the challenge to Senator Croll's
prospective committee: Why are Canada's
abundant natural resources undeveloped to
the extent that thousands of citizens are
unemployed and hundreds of thousands of
them are living in poverty?
We want the truth about this matter. There
are personal interests involved, but we in this
senior legislative chamber want the truth
about poverty. I am not satisfied with handing out more and yet more money. Where has
it gone? Well, it has gone in two ways: first,
there is the erosion of the value of money.
Money is not as valuable now, per dollar, as
it was and apparently it is still decreasing in
value. So, first, there is the erosion of money.
But much more important is the steady
Increase in the rents that these poor people
must pay; and, with the increase in rents is
the advance in land values. We must attack
this problem realistically and propose such
measures as may effect a remedy.
I have some clippings from which I would
like to read. The first is one from the Toronto
Globe and Mail of February 3, 1967. It is
headed:
New houses average $29,666, up $5,866
im year, ...

The article reads in part:
New houses for sale in Metropolitan
Toronto have an average price of $29,666,
compared with $23,800 a year ago and
$21,914 in January, 1965.

These are the figures supplied by the Toronto
Real Estate Board, and they show a steady
advance in the price of houses, making it less
and less possible for the ordinary man to own
his own home.
A little further on the article states:
The house-price survey this week
showed only 1.7 per cent of the houses at
$16,000 or below, compared with 9 per
cent a year ago and 12 per cent two years
ago.
That is to say, houses of a lower price are
disappearing.
... land accounted for about one-third
of the house prices quoted... a house
priced at $24,000 probably would represent $8,000 for the land...

Eight thousand dollars for a piece of land
that until recently was agricultural land and
which is made valuable, not by the owner but
by the activities and expenditures of the particular municipality.
I now quote from an article in the Globe
and Mail of Tuesday, April 4, 1967, a statement by June Marks. She is a Controller of
the City of Toronto, and is very lively. She
says:
...

if 8,000 to 10,000 serviced vacant lots

in the three outer municipalities were
developed it would ease the housing
shortage "like taking the lid off a pressure cooker."
Of course, it would.
We are spending thousands of dollars of
public money to get houses built while we
allow the land speculators about our great
cities to charge $8,000 for sufficient ground on
which to build a house.
The article continues:
Controller Marks said a report presented to Metro Council indicated there are
up to 10,000 serviced lots-the majority
in Scarborough-that had not been built
on.
In closing, I would like to quote the Mayor
of the City of Toronto, Mayor Dennison. He
says:
I would like to have this city grow in
such a way that we do not have great
wasteland areas on the perimeter of the
city... so that there isn't a 6- or 7-mile
wasteland around the perimeter of the
Metro area.

hoping to make a fast buck out of it and
he lets it grow weeds or he cuts it.

industries.
To come back to potash for a moment, I
should like to point out that if the areas of
the world which are in the greatest need of
potash had the ability to pay for it we could
then put every mill in Saskatchewan into
high gear. But, this has not been the case. A
resource, for which there is no market in the
world today, is being depleted.
Some Government projects, in my opinion,
have been misdirected. Just a year ago I had
the opportunity of introducing a Government
bill in this house to provide for increasing the
amount of money that may be spent under
ARDA. If my memory serves me correctly, I
said at that time that I did not care how much
money it took to do the things that ARDA
wanted to do in Canada in co-operation with
the provinces, provided something was done
for the people who needed help. I am still of
that belief. Any money that is spent to create employment and cut down relief is
money well spent, but we must always be
aware of the danger of over-production. Some
of the moneys, both federal and provincial,
that have been spent on ARDA programs
have not accomplished the intention of the
governments
when the legislation was
introduced.
In this connection I should like to refer to
my own province, because I know it better
than any other. For a short time, as honourable senators know, I served as the Minister of
Agriculture for Saskatchewan. I was sold on
the idea of buying submarginal land, putting
it into community pasture, and making both
summer pasture and hay available to our
small farmers so that they could increase
their herds of cattle and thus, improve their
net return. But, what happened? We provided
the pastures with federal and provincial
money, but forgot to provide the little farmer, who needed help, with the money with
which he could buy another cow. The end
result has been that the farmer who did not
need any help, and who had 200 or 300 cows,
now has 400 or 500, and the farmer who had
eight or nine cows is now out of business
altogether. The people we were seeking to
help were actually harmed, and would have
been better off had we done nothing.
I am not saying that this has harmed the
economy of the country-it certainly has not.
There is a need in this country for an

increased production of red meats, and any
policy that will bring that about is beneficial
to the nation. But, it was not the intention of
ARDA programs to increase red meat production. The main purpose was to help the little
farmer, and this has not been accomplished. I
want to repeat that the people who did not
need help, got it, and ones who needed help
desperately have received nothing.
Many Canadians seem to be of the opinion
that you can draw a line based upon income.
Many refer to the level of $3,000, and say that
anyone with an income of less than that
figure lives in poverty. Personally, I think
that is utter nonsense. I know many Canadians who live in Saskatchewan whose gross
annual income is less than $3,000, and yet
they are living happily and quite well. On the
other hand, there are people living in other
parts of Canada, and in other parts of Saskatchewan, with incomes of almost double
$3,000 who have financial problems.
All one need do is walk five or six blocks
from these buildings, here in our capital city,
to find people living in poverty on incomes I
am sure of much in excess of $3,000. You can
go to some of the farms in the prairie region
where the gross annual income of a farmer is
less than $3,000, and find that some of the
people are living well. They are the people
that programs such as ARDA were designed
to help, but I say to you this has not been the
result.
I think all our expansion programs, as several senators have already mentioned, with
regard to relief, to help the under-employed
and the under-privileged, should be reviewed.
I do not believe that any one of them is
working to its full capacity to accomplish the
job that it was intended to do. Therefore, I
give my support to this resolution.
I was at one time in the construction business and know a bit about housing-probably not much because times have changedand I believe that one of the great problems
with housing is created by governments.
There are many regulations still in existence
that were outdated 50 years ago, and they are
increasing the cost of our housing by as much
as 25 per cent.
We have a situation in Ottawa where the
City Council, according to what I read in the
press, would like to see some high-rise development in the downtown area of the city.
The problem was referred to the Ontario
Municipal Board, but apparently it has been
delayed. I do not know whether we should

SENATE DEBATES
have high-rise buildings in Ottawa, or, if so,
to what height they should be allowed, but
surely we should be in a position today either
to proceed with programs or to drop them.
This country is a hundred years old. Surely
now we should not have to delay the expenditure of private money. Many hundreds of
people in this city would be employed if they
were allowed to proceed with these building
projects. I am reminded of Expo and the
great lessons that it was attempting to teach
the world on how to rebuild the dying and
rotting cores of our cities. This was not just
for Canada, but throughout the world. They
showed an example through their efforts in
Habitat. This pointed up one of the great
problems in the cost of housing today. Suburbia is not the answer. How far can a city
the size of Toronto, Montreal or even Ottawa
spread? It seems to me that we have to
rebuild the dying cores of our cities, and to
have a larger percentage of our total city
population live downtown rather than move
further out of town.
Another reason that urban land costs are so
high is that every time you move a mile out
of town you build another mile of sewer,
water line, road, and sidewalk-at unbelievably high costs. The further out you move the
more expensive it becomes. So I suggest to
you that the regulations, regardless of what
level of government is responsible for them,
ought to be reviewed and updated and made
applicable in 1969-70, not in 1928-29. If we
are to do this I think it will be found that
private industry itself will be prepared to put
far more money into not only housing but
business construction as well.
I hope that this committee will review all
the matters that have been suggested by
honourable senators on both sides of the
house. If we do that, surely to goodness in a
country such as ours, a country with 20 million people, that is now 100 years old, a country that is probably the most wealthy in natural resources of any in the world, why should
we have poverty?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes! Why?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: One of the reasons is
our educational system. We find, or at least I
do, that the vast majority of those who are
living in poverty are either under-educated or
have no education at all. We are spending
millions of dollars on education at every level
of government but we do not seem to be able

November 5, 1968

to solve this problem of so many of our people being either under-trained or having no
training at all. I hope this matter also will be
taken under consideration by this committee.
Before resuming my seat I want to repeat
that I am one of those who believe that if we
give private industry the opportunity and the
initiative it can cure a lot of the problems
that today the people are looking to government to cure. In many instances we have
strangled private enterprise through taxation,
regulations, and the outmoded laws of our
country. I hope these matters will be
reviewed by the committee, because it seems
to me that where there is a demand for a
product on world markets or home markets,
private industry can in most cases meet that
demand.
I reiterate that the housing and poverty
problems with which we find ourselves confronted today have been in part brought
about by governments at all three levels.
Therefore, I hope we will loosen the reins
and let those who are willing and would like
to develop our resources, do so at a price that
we as a nation can afford and that our customers can afford. By doing that we will have
gone a long way towards solving much of the
poverty problem, not only of our own country
but probably of some countries who import
from us as well.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: May I ask the honourable senator a question? What are we to do
with the over-production of wheat? You will
have farmers in poverty if they cannot sell it.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: If I knew the answer
to that I would be one of the wisest men in
Canada.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: And the wealthiest.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: And probably the
wealthiest. There is only one remark I would
make about the over-supply of wheat. It
seems to me that with the changed methods
of milling and baking, probably the day is no
longer with us when we can continue to sell
Canadian wheat simply as No. 1 Northern,
No. 2 Northern, No. 3 Northern, No. 4 Northern, or whatever grade you make it, and
which your customers never look at.
Because of the improved methods of milling and baking today most areas of the world
can produce a bread which is very satisfactory to their people from wheat that is not of
these high grades. We have made some

progress in increasing our production of hard
wheats in Canada, and undoubtedly we will
make further progress in the future. We cannot sell wheat for any less than it is being
sold today or the farm economy would be flat
on its back, but scientists who have conducted research into the production of wheat have
convinced me that we can produce soft
wheats which would give a yield of, not 30 or
40 bushels an acre, but maybe 130 or 140
bushels an acre. It may be therefore that we
shall have to take another look at whether we
can continue to produce a variety or a class
of hard spring wheat, for which there seems
to be a shrinking market. Perhaps we shall
have to take a better look at some of the
proposals which scientists are making for the
production of a lower quality wheat, but in
more abundance, which we can sell cheaper
and consequently to more people.
I do not know whether this is the answer,
but many people in whom I have some confidence are making these suggestions. I recognize that we are in trouble with our present
methods and I therefore think they should be
reviewed to see what can be done.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: May I ask a supplementary question on wheat? The honourable
senator speaks of producing lower grade
wheat. Is the cost per bushel of producing
lower grade wheat any less than the cost per
bushel of producing No. 1 Northern?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Yes. The cost of producing 130 bushels per acre of lower grade
wheat is less than the cost of producing 30
bushels per acre of high grade wheat.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Croll, for Hon. Mr.
Cameron, debate adjourned.

RULES OF THE SENATE
SPECIAL COMMITTEE'S REPORT CONSIDERED
IN COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE-

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, pursuant to the order of your honourable
house, I leave the Chair. The honourable
Senator Macnaughton, P.C. will please take
the chair of the committee.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Mr. Speaker,
would you not give us a little more information than just a bare order of that kind? This
means that we are going into Committee of
the Whole on these rules, does it not? I have

SENATE DEBATES
seen this document that has been distributed
for not more than five minutes.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It was printed as an appendix to Debates of Thursday, October 31.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I do not always read the
appendix. This is not the usual way we proceed. I have on occasion moved the Senate
into Committee of the Whole-a long time
ago, I will admit. This report was brought to
my attention just a few minutes ago. In the
past, the chairman of the committee who
takes the responsibility of reporting on behalf
of the committee has usually explained his
report, and after that has been considered we
have ordered the house into Committee of the
Whole, where there is more freedom of discussion. Of course, in this house we are not
as strict perhaps as in the other place or the
United Kingdom.
If I may express my own thoughts in this
matter, I would think that the chairman of
this special committee should make a statement as to what has been done. I see that several of the rules are to be repealed and other
rules substituted therefor. I would like to hear
a general statement from the chairman as to
what the committee has been doing and why,
and then any replies may be made. Then we
can move into Committee of the Whole for
particular discussion. I think that is the proper way to proceed.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I intervene at this point to remind the
honourable senators that a motion was carried on October 31 regarding the study of the
report of the Special Committee on the Rules
of the Senate by the Committee of the Whole.
I do not have the motion at hand now, but I
think it appears in the Minutes of the Proceedings at page 301.
Without going into all the details, I think
the request of honourable Senator Roebuck is
reasonable, that the chairman of the committee make a statement. Of course if any
honourable senators wish to express their
views at this time I would be happy to hear
them before the chairman makes his statement.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Honourable senators, I
am under the impression that if we are
allowed to proceed as His Honour has suggested, and that we move into the Committee
of the Whole to discuss this report, the chairman of the committee will at an early point
make such a statement as honourable Senator
Roebuck has requested. It seems to me that

November 6, 1968

when the Chairman of the Committee of the
Whole takes the chair he will call item 1, and
I would hope that he would then request the
Chairman of the Rules Committee to give a
general explanation of this report before proceeding further. Therefore, I believe that
Senator Roebuck's request can be met
through the procedures which have been suggested by Your Honour.
The Hon. the Speaker: Before the Chairman of the Rules Committee is invited to
make a statement, may I read from page 301
of the Minutes of the Proceedings,as follows:
The Honourable Senator Molson, from
the Special Committee of the Senate on
the Rules of the Senate, presented the
Third Report of the aforementioned
Special Committee.
The
Honourable
Senator
Molson
moved, seconded by the Honourable
Senator Lang, that the Report be referred
to a Committee of the Whole for consideration on Wednesday next, 6th November, 1968.
Would honourable Senator Molson care to
make a statement at this time?
Hon. Mr. Croll: Mr. Speaker and honourable senatorsHon. Mr. Aselline: We must first appoint a
chairman of the Committee of the Whole.
Hon. Mr. Croll: On page 401 of the Debates
of the Senate I read:
Hon. Mr. Molson: I move, seconded by
Senator Lang, that the report be referred
to a Committee of the Whole for consideration on Wednesday next, November 6,
1968.
I too missed this item. It is the second time in
my experience here that that sort of motion
has been placed before the members of the
Senate. The usual motion is that a report be
considered. I have not seen the Senate go into
Committee of the Whole-except during the
Pipe Line debate-and notice was given. I
missed this too, and it was brought to my
attention this morning.
I see no objection to proceeding in this way,
but when such a motion is made the chairman of the committee should make a statement, not later but now, telling us exactly
why the report is being presented in the present form. Then we could move into Committee of the Whole.

November 6, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators
I have said this before and I think I shall
have to repeat it often-honourable senators
are masters of their own rules. I am faced
with a motion which has been adopted in the
course of our proceedings, calling for a Committee of the Whole to consider this report
today. This is all I have to say now. Perhaps
the honourable Leader of the Government
would like to speak?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, we
are all anxious to proceed efficiently and in
compliance with the rules. At the same time,
we would like to meet the wishes of all
honourable senators, and in this instance to
meet the request by Senator Roebuck.
A motion for reference to Committee of the
Whole was duly passed by this house. Therefore, it seems to me that our course in
accordance with that motion is to go into
Committee of the Whole. I understand that
the chairman of the committee intends to
make a statement along the lines specifically
mentioned by Senator Roebuck. I have such
respect for the senior member of this house
that I would hope that this arrangement
would be regarded by him as in full compliance with his wishes.

he has in this house.
Pursuant to an order of the day, the Senate
went into committee to consider the third
report from the Special Committee on Rules
of the Senate.
Hon. Alan Macnaughton in the Chair.
Report read by the Clerk Assistant:
The Special Committee on the Rules of
the Senate makes its Third Report:
Your Committee recommends that the
Standing Rules and Orders of the Senate
of Canada be amended as follows:
1. Standing Rules 78 to 82, both inclusive, are repealed and the following substituted therefor:
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Dispense.
The Chairman: Honourable senators, in
directing your attention to paragraph 1 of the
report, may I make a suggestion which I hope
will meet with your unanimous approval,
namely, that the chairman of the committee
make an opening statement so that honourable senators will be able to appreciate the
value of the report in due course.

SENATE DEBATES
informed him in general terms that we proposed to make a number of recommendations
regarding committees. He asked me if that
part of the report dealing with committees
would await the presentation of the final
report. At that moment I thought this would
be so, but going back to the committee I
brought this subject up and the committee
was very favourable to dealing with the rules
governing committees right away for what
seemed like a useful purpose. If the committees were to be changed, and if the house
supported the recommendations which we
made, then those committees should be reformed immediately and get on with the tasks
allotted to them, rather than waiting until the
Special Committee on the Rules presents its
final report.
For that reason we took section 78, which
deals with committees, first and we went on
from there. That action is what has given rise
to this interim report, called the Third Report,
dealing with the committees and the matter
of Divorce.
If you will turn to your copy of the report
you will see that paragraph 1 sets forth the
committees which are now recommended to
replace the 19 presently listed in our book of
rules. You will note that the total number is
reduced to eleven. The first three, numbered
1, 2 and 3, are joint committees which now
exist. Your committee considered the necessity for these committees, but was satisfied that
as the House of Commons continues its participation, it naturally required that the
Senate should appoint its representatives also.
Nos. 4 and 5 are committees which deal
with internal matters of the Senate. They
have been described as housekeeping committees. No. 4 has had the name changed by the
addition of the word "Rules", and its composition increased to a membership of 20, with a
quorum of five. It is now listed as the Committee on Standing Rules and Orders, whereas previously it was called the Committee
on Standing Orders.
No. 5, the Committee on Internal Economy
and Contingent Accounts, is unchanged. Then
we come to the six main committees of the
Senate numbered 6 to 11, inclusive.
Hon. Mr. Holleti: May I ask a question?
The senator said No. 5 was unchanged, but I
notice that the number for the committee
was 50 senators and here we have 25.
Hon. Mr. Molson: I am sorry. I called attention to the numbers on the report which you
have in your hand. Twenty-five is the number
in No. 5 in the rule book.

Hon. Mr. Croll: It is 25 in the rule book
and it is 25 here.
Hon. Mr. Molson: The Committee on Internal Economy had 25 members as it existed,
and that is unchanged. The quorum was seven, and that is unchanged.
Then, honourable senators, as I have said,
we come to the six main committees of the
Senate, numbered 6 to 11, inclusive. These
are recommended to replace the balance of
the committees now existing. Your committee
is unanimously of the opinion that the committee work of the Senate is without doubt
the most useful contribution which the Senate
makes to the legislative process. I doubt if
there is any senator who has not been told by
an outsider who attended one of our committee meetings how impressed he was with the
thoroughness and competence demonstrated
and how well its performance stands up in
comparison with any other body. We suggest
a new approach to these committees in that
certain specific matters or subjects will, by
rule, be referred to them for consideration,
with the expectation that as a result the matters most commonly dealt with will be referred without question to one of these six.
Your committee is fully aware of a very
long list of subjects which have not been
allocated. We are of the opinion that these
should be left to be referred to the committee
considered appropriate
by the Senate,
depending upon the nature or form of the
matter being referred. This is covered in
subparagraph 2 at the top of page 3 of the
report.
Rule 78A is unchanged.
Rule 79 is changed only in that one-third of
the members would constitute a quorum
instead of the words now used "a majority of
the members".
Rule No. 80 has been repealed. That rule
states:
80. Senators speak uncovered, but may
remain seated.
A new Rule 80 has been suggested in its
stead.

DEBATES

Hon. Mr. Molson: Yes. The new Rule 80
which has been suggested invites senators
who are flot members to attend cornmittee
meetings. This will replace the old Rule 81
which was anything but an invitation to
non-members to attend and, having left it at
that stage, made it rather less desirable to
attend by adding the words, "They sit behind
those who are of the cornmittee." That
seemed rather unnecessary.
A new rule 81 replaces the previous Rule
82. It states that the public may attend
comrnittee meetings, whereas previously the
public was excluded under Rule 82. This no
longer seemed appropriate to your cornrittee.

necessary s0 that there would flot be any
hiatus between the completion of the work of
old committees and the beginning of the work
of newly constituted ones.
Paragraph 3 merely ensures that the terrm
"Standing Rules and Orders" takes the place
of the older terrn "Standing
Orders".*
In paragraphs 4 and 5 we have the
recommendation of the committee that ail the
rules covering the subject of petitions for
divorce or annulments shahl now be repealed.
This is because Parliarnent in its wisdom bas
decided that divorces and annulments of
marriage should, in future, be dealt with in
the courts, including those from the provinces
of Quebec and Newfoundland.
Paragraph 6, which refers to divorce, is a
consequential arnendment.
Paragraph 7 is necessary i order that any
petition. for divorce or annulment now before
the Divorce Corniittee can be carried to
completion under the existing rules.
Your committee is well aware that nothing
should suggest that Parliament is no longer
prepared to receive petitions for any purpose,
including divorce and annulment. Consequently, provision is made for such matters
to be deait with by the new Comrnittee
on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Being
fully conscious of the valuable and effective
work carried on i the past by the Divorce
Comrnittee, it is hoped that the Comrnittee on
Legal and Constitutional Aif airs will be so
composed and organized that it wiil be capable of dealing with matters of divorce and
annulinent in the same way as has pertained
i the past, ini the event that any such petition is received.
Paragraphs 8 and 9 rnerely insert the word
"Rules" in the Cornmittee on Standing Rules

and Orders, and elirninate "Divorce" where
that word occurs.
I think, Mr. Chairman, that that gives a
general rundown on the changes proposed by
the committee, and I, along with the other
members of the cornrittee, would be pleased
to answer any questions addressed to us.
Hon. Saller A. Hayden: Honourable senators, I would like to make a few general
comments before we get into a paragraph-byparagraph consideration of this report.
However, before doing that I would highly
commend the ability and the industry this
comrnittee bas displayed in the way i which
it bas tackled the job assigned to it, its steady
and intelligent application to the task, and
the intelligent consideration apparent in the
report we now have before us. I arn sure we
can ail look forward to later reports dealing
with otber portions of our rules, in the
knowledge that they will be equally commendable.
Having said that, I have sorne general
observations to make in relation to where in
the scheme of things these ruies fit into the
conduct of the proceedigs of the Senate.
My concept of rules in the Senate, or rules
anywhere, is that they are designed and are
intended to provide orderly procedures for
the consideration and for the dispatch of the
work that cornes before the Senate. Under the
rules as they exist now, before any changes
are rnade, there has been full scope for
debate. There has been no lirnitation on
debate, in the sense that members are prevented frorn discussing, in an orderly presentation under our rules, ail matters that corne
before us.
We have additional procedures, one of
which 1 followed today by giving notice that
on a certain date I proposed to cail the attention of the Senate to certain matters. 'Under
this procedure any matter of public importance, or any issue which in the opinion of
theSenate is worthy of consideration, rnay
be brought forward.
We also have procedures-and we have
sorne instances of thern before us now, such
as the motion put on the Order Paper by
Senator Crol-in relation to sorne matter of
importance, which may lead to the formation
of a special cominittee or the use of a standing comniittee for full consideration of the
issues, the calling of evidence, the assessrnent
0f the situation and its importance to the way
of 111e of the people of Canada, and to recornmendations, if any, which the conimittee may

SENATE DEBATES
make to the Senate as to how it should deal
with such subject matter. I cite that example
to show that within the scope of the rules as
they now exist, there is ample opportunity
for debate.
As far as my concept of the rules is concerned, I never thought they were designed
to promote debate. I thought the rules were
designed for orderly procedures in relation to
the debate on any issue. Therefore, when we
change these rules, one should not expect that
the new rules will promote more or greater
debate than can now take place under existing rules.
The amount of debate depends on the quality of the subject before us; and the duration
of debate, and the duration of a succession of
debates, will depend upon the amount of
work that is before us. That work may also
take on the character of legislation initiated
in the Senate, or it may take on the character
of work in the form of bills which have
already been considered in the Commons and
which come to us in the Senate.
I was a little concerned when I read a
report in the Toronto Star yesterday about a
speech the Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Martin) made the other day to the Rotary
Club in Kitchener. I am not sure whether he
was misquoted or not, but, if I may paraphrase, I think the effect of it was that the
Senate is now engaged in the revision of its
rules, which revision is intended to lead,
or may lead, to elaboration of debate.
I hold no such view with respect to the
rules. Under the present rules there are no
limitations. Under the existing rules, and
within the guidelines laid down, debate may
freely proceed, subject only to the intelligence of the senators as to when the subject
has been well debated. There is no necessity
for repetition in the presentation of argument.
In saying that I am not reflecting on what
may go on anywhere else, because the concept of the function of the Senate, in my
book, is entirely different from the concept of
the function of the House of Commons. The
House of Commons is still struggling with the
question of consumption of time, and how it
should regulate its debates. This is at the
opposite end of the piece, because the House
of Commons is seeking to find ways of limiting the scope and time of debate.
Some years ago the House of Commons
established a limitation in time on individual
speeches. Now they are working and struggling towards establishing a factor as to the
length of time that should be devoted to a

November 6, 1968

particular subject matter. Fortunately for us
in the Senate, and in the approaches we make
to all the questions that come before us, we
have not run into the situation where there is
such verbosity that we have to consider rules
in terms of limiting debate.
On the other hand, I think the debate
which has proceeded has been intelligent and
concentrated, and it has dealt with all the
principal phases of the legislation. Therefore,
we need no spurs to make us take more time
just for the sake of taking time in respect of
matters that come before us.
Having said that, I want to proceed to
another suggestion that has been made and
discussed, namely, that the Senate in addition
to considering legislation, both initiated here
and coming from the Commons, should
assume unto itself powers to generate debate,
and perhaps substantial debate, on public
questions. I have pointed out that all the authority is available now to do that. But if this
is a phase that requires to be stated and set
out in the form of guidelines or rules relating
to the type of subject matter which may come
into the Senate, then I think it would have
been wise-and perhaps it is not too late
now-to enlarge the scope of the authority
that was given to this committee so that it
could study this question of the area of discussion and introduction of subject matter of
public importance and public issues, such as
we presently carry out under the forms and
methods I have described. Perhaps it would
be wise to have some clearer definition of
how this shall proceed, and the extent in
those areas to which the Senate should inject
itself. Should these things be considered?
The reason I say that is because I have
been concerned from time to time when there
have arisen questions such as, for instance,
whether we should have more discussion in
the Senate on foreign policy. In principle one
would subscribe to that. It is an important
part of the national life of Canada. But, I
have then looked at this situation-and I
think this committee might do good work if it
looked at it-that if we decide to study what
should be, in our opinion, the foreign policy
of Canada in relation to some other country
and issues that have arisen there, and what
our position and attitude should be, and
we refer that to a committee, the committee
then makes an exhaustive study and calls
witnesses et cetera, and formulates a report.
In those circumstances the thing that worries
me is that at the stage of the formulation of
the substance of a report the committee may

November 6, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

have moved ahead of what is Government
policy at that moment.
I am wondering as to the extent to which
we should go in the consideration of such
questions, having regard to the layout of government in Canada. Is it such that we should
or can afford to move as a committee of one
house that far into a subject matter where the
conclusion might leave us in an area where
we are differing from, or are ahead of or
behind, the immediate Government policy on
that issue. I have mentioned foreign policy,
but no doubt there are other issues in respect
of which for various reasons-and undoubtedly justifiable reasons-Government policy has
not proceeded that far.
Are we to reach out, and to that extent
take the leadership, and invite that conflict of
thought? I have my own views on it, but I
think this is a subject matter which might
well have been referred to, and be considered
at some stage by this committee before we go
too far on some of these issues.
After the last war a committee of the
Senate dealt with and reviewed fully the
income tax legislation at that time. It studied
the matter for two or three years, and even
went so far as to prepare a draft bill. This
bill was accepted as the basis of subsequent
legislation on this field.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: That was a special
committee appointed for that purpose, was it
not?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That was a special committee appointed by the Senate for that purpose, yes.
As I go down the years from that time I
can recall a motion which Senator Croll introduced in this house with respect to the
appointment of a special committee to study
disclosure of finance charges. He and I in the
course of debates in the Senate expressed
differing points of view on that. This was a
matter of public issue, and it got to the stage
of where the Government moved ahead in its
thinking; the subject was referred to a joint
committee, and its deliberations led to a
report which was open to acceptance or adoption by both the Senate and the House of
Commons.
In those circumstances I do not see the
same possibility of conflict as there is in respect of reports and recommendations of the
Senate acting on its own, and reports and
recommendations of the House of Commons
acting on its own. We must keep in mind at
all times that the Government is responsible

for government policy, and while we may try
to influence it or query it, being the senior
house, whether we should publicly and without their co-operation move ahead in all the
fields is open to question. There may be some
fields in respect of which this is a perfectly
reasonable thing to do.
So, this is a suggestion that I make generally for the consideration of the Senate, that
the scope of the authority of the committee
should be enlarged so as to permit it to examine this area in order to see how far it is
feasible for us to go.
I mention foreign policy particularly
because this is a subject matter which is dear
to the heart of the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Indeed, in his speech in
Kitchener the other day, as the newspapers
report it, he did refer to the question of
foreign policy, and how important it was that
discussion of foreign policy should take place
in Parliament rather than in panels on television. I agree heartily with that, but I would
think that the initiation of that over the years
should have taken place in the House of Commons. To some extent the Senate has functioned in studying various aspects of foreign
policy, but I think mainly in order to obtain
an understanding of what the situation is and
what our foreign policy is in relation to it.
At the present time under the existing
rules there is nothing which would prevent us
in the Senate, by way of a motion, or notice
calling the attention of the Senate to certain
conditions in relation to foreign policy, setting up a committee to inquire into foreign
policy. These rules, when they are changed,
will not change that position in any particular. There will still be the same scope of
authority on what we may cover and the time
we may spend on it. My own feeling is that if
we can intelligently and thoroughly accomplish consideration of a subject-matter in
three days, we should not take six days. The
test of the quality of our work is not the
length of time we take to do it; the test
remains the intelligence that we bring to bear
and the analysis we make. Slow moving in
those circumstances should not be extolled as
a virtue.
Those are my general observations. I have
read the recommendations in the report and I
am in agreement with them.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, it is a little unfortunate for me that I
became actively engaged in the study of this
report only 25 or 30 minutes ago. No doubt

SENATE DEBATES

that was my fault. I did not realize the report
had been made, and I fancy from what I
have heard that others are in the same position. I therefore hope that we will not conclude consideration of this matter today, and
that I may have a little time to study the
effect of some of the proposals. On the other
hand, I wish to commend the chairman and
the members of this Special Committee on the
Rules of the Senate, as Senator Hayden has
done, for the very careful work they have
performed
and
for
what
they have
accomplished.
In the short time that I have been able to
look over the report, I have noticed several
things with a great deal of pleasure. One is
that in future the committees will have the
same right and privilege as the Standing
Committee on Divorce has had through all
the years, that of choosing its own chairmen.
In the past the administration has named the
chairmen, and in a general committee of all
the house, the members have usually
approved whatever was suggested to them. I
think the result has not always been the very
best. I am sure that more active chairmen
would have been selected over the years had
the committees themselves chosen their chairmen without any influence from outside. As I
read this report, that will now be the case.
My special interest, of course, is in the
rules applying to divorce. I see from the
report that it is proposed to repeal rules 133
to 195. Honourable senators, under all the
circumstances, I do hope you will give me a
little time to study what is being lost in the
repeal of all these rules, although perhaps it
is all right.
I thank the chairman of this special committee for his courtesy in calling upon me
and telling me what the committee was doing,
although he did not give me a copy of the
report they were intending to make. He told
me that it was not the will of the committee to
keep constituted the Standing Committee on
Divorce, and I agreed with him in that,
although he realized, as we all do, that the
doors of Parliament must always be open for
a petition of any kind, including a divorce
petition, and that we must be in a position to
deal with it.
The chairman of the special committee told
me about the proposed legal committee,
which seems to me to be a wise move. I said
to him, as I say to you now, that I am quite
satisfied to have possible applications for a
bill of divorce, which may be lodged in the
future, referred to a legal committee, but I

November 6, 1968

would ask that all members who have served
over all these years on the Standing Committee on Divorce be members of that legal committee. It would not, of course, be put in the
rules, but I think it should be understood
among us that since divorces are to be
referred to the legal committee, the members
now constituting the Standing Committee on
Divorce shall be members of that legal
committee.
There are several reasons for that. One is
that the present members of the Standing
Committee on Divorce have had a long training in this regard. All of them are thoroughly
familiar with the practice, rules and law on
this matter. The second reason is that during
these years in which we have been engaged
in an important task such as has been ours,
we have developed a certain esprit de corps.
We have become the closest of friends as a
result of the many sessions we have held
together, the many problems we have met
and the many solutions we have proposed. It
is natural that we should wish to stay
together.
I should very much like to have an opportunity to discuss the effect of these rules with
the whole Standing Committee on Divorce. I
think we are entitled to a meeting at which
we can consider what this means to us personally, to the standing committee which will
disappear, and to the Senate itself.
I hope we will not conclude consideration
of this matter this afternoon. I should like a
couple of days to study the question, and
there is no great rush over this report. I
would not delay unless it were for some purpose. I should like to call the Standing Committee on Divorce together to discuss what is
being proposed with regard to the duties we
have so long discharged.
It would seem that the subject-matter of
the rules has been well considered by this
special committee. They are now doing with
our rules what Parliament did with the laws
of divorce, which are now repealed. The new
Divorce Act specified that all those petitions
which were lodged with the Senate prior to
the coming into effect of the new act should
be dealt with by the Senate as though the
new act had not been passed, so that to the
extent of those applications, the old act and
its rules and practice remained in effect.
It is under that regulation that we are now
hearing a very large number of cases which
we hope to conclude by Christmas. The
proposed rules fall within that category. They

November 6, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

provide that those matters now under consideration shall be dealt with according to the
rules as they were rather than under the new
rules, so that I foresee no difficulty. We will
be able to conclude this work efficiently and
satisfactorily under the report. However, I
have not had the opportunity to give a
detailed study to the report which I think its
importance justifies. Do not forget, honourable senators, that I have been engaged in
other matters. I made a major address to you
only yesterday. I would not have done so if I
had known this was to be studied. So I hope
you will give me that consideration before
closing this debate.
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, I
would like to make a few general observations. I assume at this stage of our proceedings we will confine ourselves to general
statements, and that the opportunity for detailed examination of the report will be available to us after general statements have been
made.
It may be that when we do come to this
detailed examination we would want to give
consideration as to whether we should proceed with a paragraph-by-paragraph consideration or an enumerated consideration. I
think it might be more valuable, even though
it would mean a longer discussion, to deal
with each clause through the various subclauses. However, that is something which I
am prepared to leave in the hands of the
Chairman, with his great experience as a presiding officer over the affairs of one of the
Houses of Parliament.
I want to associate myself at once with the
tribute paid to the Special Committee on the
Rules of the Senate by Senators Hayden and
Roebuck. I should like to pay a special tribute
to the chairman, for I know he has dedicated
himself to the work of the committee in an
admirable way. I had not known Senator
Molson too well before, but I know the naine
quite well. I must say that I have been greatly impressed by the way in which he has
presided over the deliberations of the committee, and the knowledge that he and his
colleagues have brought to bear on the very
important work we assigned them.
I think we all recognize that this is an
important discussion. As Senator Hayden has
said, rules are made to provide for the orderly work of our deliberations. While we have a
residuary right to meet any situation
unanimously, that is, without relying on a
particular rule, nevertheless for orderly

debate it is essential in a deliberative assembly that there be agreed upon rules. It is
these rules that we are considering today.
It is not that we argue that the rules of the
past did not serve their purpose. I was rather
impressed with what Senator Molson said on
October 31, that the purpose underlying the
work of the committee is to endeavour to
bring our procedures as close as possible to
the exigencies of the modern day. I agree that
the committee work of this house is most
important. This was underlined by Senator
Molson in his introductory remarks. We know
from the work of the Committee on Science
Policy, under Senator Lamontagne, how true
this is. I wish to say to Senator Lamontagne
that I am grateful to him, if I may express
the view of an individual senator, and to
those of his colleagues in the Committee on
Science Policy, in that they adjourned their
session this afternoon in order to be present
and participate in this afternoon's debate. I
understand the Committee on Science Policy
will sit tonight.
It may be that the committee will wish to
give consideration to a problem which arises
out of the fact that the Committee on Science
Policy does sit simultaneously with the sessions of this house, this power having been
given to it by honourable senators. It seems
to me that this creates a problem. It is a
problem which is not new and with which
most honourable senators are more familiar
than I. I believe that the general debates in
this chamber have a great importance. The
widest participation in our debates is desirable. This is not always possible if attendance
elsewhere is necessary because of the requirement to fulfil one's obligation in a committee.
There have been some valuable debates in
the short time I have been here. Some took
place when committees were meeting in our
Senate committee rooms.
It is not that we fail to recognize the
importance of committee work. Indeed, when
I had the honour of first speaking in this
house, I thought that an improvement in our
activities-if that is a correct characterization-could come by a greater emphasis in
the area of scrutiny and inquiry. I say that
with a full appreciation of what our legislative responsibilities are-and we do have a
legislative responsibility, of reviewing work
which comes to us from the other house, or to
initiate bills ourselves.
I note with satisfaction that in the first
measure we dealt with in this house, the
legislation in regard to the publication of statutes, notwithstanding the discussion which

the Senate itself had given to the measure

o'clock-but that is the very thing I am urging that we should do.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I believe in wide discussion. I will give the house an example of
what I have in mind. The senator from
Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Lazarus Phillips) introduced a bill providing for certain amendments
to an act relating to the Supreme Court of
Canada. This was an important bill. I am
sure, from my own experience that, had it
not been for the intervention of Senator
Roebuck, the particular debate would have
been limited. The bill would certainly have
been exhaustively dealt with in the committee to which it was referred. However, it
seemed to me that whether one agreed with
the position taken by Senator Roebuck-and I
may say that I told him frankly that I did not
agree with his main thesis-all would agree
that there was value in the debate which took
place.
The Supreme Court of Canada is one of our
important institutions. A wide debate on the
principle of those amendments, prior to the
bill being considered in committee, was not, in
my judgment, a waste of the time of this
house.
These are matters which are examined in
committee to make sure that the drafting is
correct, that nothing is left out of a bill which
should be included. If we share the view that
discussion in a free society is valuable, then it
is worthwhile promoting debate prior to referring these bills to committees. I interpret
Senator Hayden's remarks as not being in
disagreement with this view. I took the occasion, because of what he said, to emphasize
my own view, not as the Government Leader
but as a senator, that our general debates can
enhance considerably the position which this
Senate occupies and the position which it
maintains in the view of the Canadian people
at the present time.

Hon. Mr. Choquette: Then, let us go ahead.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I should say to Senator
Hayden that I have not seen the report to
which he referred. I will look at it. It is not
the first time I have had to face reports
which did not represent what I said. I will
look at the report. What I had in mind was
that at the present time there were general
debates taking place in the country, between
the news media and the public, on vital matters of foreign policy; that the time of Government in the other place was being taxed
severely because of the need to implement its
programs, sometimes in the face of archaic
procedures. There should be a dialogue on
international problems, between Parliament
and the Government and the Canadian people,
and this should be done through Parliament.
It is not a question of being ahead of the
executive in a particular area of policy. Certainly, as a member of the Government in
this Senate I would not want, whatever may
be the views of senators acting independently, this Senate to act contrary to Government
policy. That is my responsibility as Leader of
the Government. But I should think that each
senator would consider it his duty to bring
his point of view to bear on matters of concern. It is not so much a matter of formulating policy that I had in mind. The External
Affairs Committee under Senator Thorvaldson did not necessarily formulate policy, but
in the committee hearings held on external
aid it did provide for the elucidation of what
the Government was doing in that field. It
gave others the opportunity to say what they
thought should be done. This was educative
and valuable, and that is the purpose, it seems
to me, of committees.
In the Committee on Foreign Policy that
will be set up under the recommendations of

November 6, 1968

Novemer 6,1968SENATE
DEBATES

this committee, I hope that we will seek not
Sa rnuch to make policy. That is essentially an
executive act under our systern of Government. It is the Government that makes
foreign policy. It is Parliarnent that can reject
that policy or accept it. But I do believe that,
if we are going to have a better understanding of same of the problems involved in this
field of foreign relations, committees of this
house as well as of the other bouse can serve
a useful purpose. This was ernphasized the
other day i a speech made by Senator Grosart, when he reviewed what be canceîved to
be the position of Canada in relation to the
Caribbean countries.
I wish to congratulate the cornmittee and
its chaîrman. I arn sure that it would be the
wish of ail of us that those who have constituted the Divorce Comrnittee should, if
possible, find themselves as members of the
committee. I cannot conceive of the new coinmittee on legal and constitutional affairs
omitting frorn its membership s0 distinguished a lawyer as Senator Roebuck, a former Attorney General.
Borne Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Han. Mr. Roebuck: Tbank you.
Hon. Mr. Martin: It would seemi to me that
this is sometbing so axiornatic that I need not
have emphasized it.
Honourable senators, as an individual senator I arn looking forward to the discussion on
these rules. They are part of the process of
our seeking to improve our functional position. This is the nature of an act from within
the Senate. I arn sure that, as Senator O'Leary
(Carleton) said, wbat we do ourselves may
possibly be the rnost effective contribution to
improvernent of ou.r procedures and in the
work that we do.
This does not mean that the Senate has not
perforrned well. It bas. I outlined this when I
first spoke. I pointed to the estinate of the
Senate's work by Professor Kunz. We al
agree that there is room for improvement.
The purpose of the comittee recommendations is to enable us ta improve our work, to
make it more valuable and lasting.
The Chairmnan: Honourable Senator Hays.

fact most trnes-I have become very frustrated with the way we operate. It was true
of the other place and it is alsa true here.
I have listened with great interest to what
Senator Hayden bad ta say, and to Senator
Roebuck and ta the Leader of the Government. I comrnend and congratulate Senator
Maison on bis cbairing of this comrnittee. I
think we are fortunate to have had a businessman do this, and not a politician. He has
got down to cases and has cut the number of
committees down. He bas done an excellent
job.*
I think this bouse should be used more for
committees and less for debate. I do flot agree
witb the Leader of the Goverment. I think it
is tirne we started putting words into action.
Sometimes we have too much scrutiny and
inquiry, and not enough action.
Borne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hays: There is a lot of debate in
teother place too. We have 20 million people in Canada-one-tenth the population of
the United States. I bave often thought that if
the United States were to operate the way
Canada does, they would be 10 years behind
each year.
I would just like to leave a story witb you
that might illustrate why this bouse sbould
spend more tîrne in committees and less Urne
in tbis chamber, assurning tbat the committees did a thorough job. Actuaily, we are
tbresbing old straw. We have already done a
pretty good job on legislation in the other
house.
In 1942, when the Low Cauntries were averrun by the enemy, tbey were supplying Great
Britain with 600 million pounds of bacon, and
it became Canada's job ta do this, and do it
in a hurry. At that Urne I was president of
the organization charged with that responsibility. With us was a chap wbo had been one
of the deputy ministers in the federal Governrnent. I weil remember something that he
said ta me-in fact, I will neyer forget it. I
was quite a yaung man at the trne. He said,
"Now, you are going out there, kid-" He
called me kid---"and there is sometbing I
want you ta remember. You go out and give
them bell. But, if you bave nathing to say,
don't cover it up with a lot of words."

SENATE DEBATES
attention to a more specific problem in relation to this report. I understand that this is
the stage at which we should have a general
debate, but if I make my specific points now,
it might prevent delaying our future deliberations when we come to consider the report
item by item.
I want to speak more specifically about
section 1, item 11, concerning the Committee
on Health, Welfare and Science. I am of
the strong view that we should have a
special standing committee on science policy.
Since the Special Committee on Science
Policy has started its sittings, we have had
unanimous representations from various
agencies and organizations telling us that
they were delighted that the Senate was
interested at last in science policy and that
they hoped this would not be a one-stage
operation but would continue. Indeed, it
should be a continuing operation because
science policy will inevitably be a strategic
factor in the over-all, long-term development
of this country.
Moreover, as some honourable senators are
already aware, our country is now spending
over $800 million annually on research and
development. So that science, even in terms
of expenditure, is becoming a more and more
important area of spending in Canada. We
have already heard representations that this
amount should be doubled in the next five
years so as to reach a round figure of approximately $1,500 million. This is one reason why
we should have a continuing investigation in
this field.
As I said, we have received representations
from various agencies, including an appeal
this morning from the chairman of the
Science Council who came before us and
pleaded that our special committee should
become a standing committee.
As we go on with our inquiry we are discovering gradually that there is a gap in
Canada in terms of the formulation of science
policy. This does not exist in other countries
because they have already provided a public
forum, and some link between the public
servants involved in science policy and their
parliaments. We do not have that here. I
would hope that in the future we would certainly have this kind of public forum, and it
should be located in the Senate. In this way
we may be able over the years to develop an
expertise because in science policy we are
dealing with a very complex and increasingly
difficult aspect of public policy.

November 6, 1968

For all these reasons I would hope that the
Senate would agree to consider the possibility
of having a special standing committee on
science policy. I am sure that we will have
much to do in future years in such a committee when we will be called upon to consider
immediate and specifie problems, and to
review annually certain areas of our science
policy, such as the physical science one year,
the life sciences the following year, and the
social sciences in a subsequent year. I do not
think that this would disrupt in any way the
proposal already made with regard to the
Committee on Health and Welfare. I think
that committee, under its proposed terms of
reference, would have a lot to do, and I
would propose that it consider two additional
items.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Mr. Chairman, at the
risk of appearing disagreeable, I would
remind the honourable chairman that we are
here in Committee of the Whole to consider
this report on the rules. Now we are getting
into a debate that sounds like a debate on the
Speech from the Throne. If we continue like
this, we will never complete our business.
Sone Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: Mr. Chairman, I
think I am perfectly in order. I am doing this
now in order to shorten our debate when we
come to this item, because if I were to move
an amendment at that time without proper
notice, we might have a long discussion.
But if at this stage we can reach some
agreement on what should be the terms of
reference of these two committees, I would
be very pleased and satisfied to work in collaboration with Senator Molson in preparing
the appropriate amendments, so that when
we reach this item we will be able to proceed
much more rapidly than otherwise would be
possible.
The Chairman: Honourable senators, in
calling your attention to the proposed new
Rule 78 (1), I was going to suggest to honourable senators, that as 78 (1) is a very extensive paragraph and contains many suggestions, we should deal with each subparagraph
or item by itself. If we adopt that procedure,
the remarks of the honourable Senator
Lamontagne would of course fit into section
11. I recall to your attention that we are on
general paragraph No. 1 and that your
remarks should be general, keeping your
detailed observations for the separate subparagraphs for all items to be discussed later.

November 6, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

If that meets with your general approval, I
suggest we proceed in that fashion. Is it
agreed, honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators,
Mr. Chairman, I have every sympathy with
the impatience at the moment of my Acting
Leader and his desire to get on with the
debate item by item. However, I very much
doubt if we are going to get through with this
today. I agree completely with Senator
Roebuck, that this is not a matter of such
unimportance that we should attempt to rush
through it this afternoon. Some of us have
had time to go through the proposals before
us, and personally I have not any great quarrel with them. However, I merely point out
that I would hope that no honourable senator
would be at all reluctant to make his views
known at this stage of the debate on paragraph 1. As the chairman has already pointed
out, it is perfectly proper to discuss what is
in effect the principle of the amendment
before us.
I join with others in congratulating Senator
Molson and his committee on the work they
have done and the expedition with which
they have brought some results of their deliberations before us. I accept his explanation as
to why we start at this particular point in the
rules, because obviously the terms of reference of the committee are much broader than
merely the status of our committees. I would
hope that the terms of reference, as Senator
Hayden suggested, might in due course be
greatly expanded to go beyond the rules and
to consider the whole conduct of our business
in this chamber.
Personally, I am delighted that for the first
time since I have been here, the Senate is
now in Committee of the Whole. On a number of occasions I urged this as one of the
"improvements", to use the Government
Leader's words, that might be needed. Usually it has been said that we are in a different
position to the House of Commons-and to
government representatives in that house-in
that it is not convenient to have public servants here to assist in answering the questions.
However, I think the reference of these particular amendments to the rules to Committee
of the Whole indicates that there are subjects
that can quite properly, and I think profitably, be referred to Committee of the Whole of
this house. I would hope that this would
become a common practice rather than an
uncommon one, as it is at the moment. I am

not making any specific comment on the rules
or the amendments proposed to the rules, but
with your permission I will have something
to say on one or two specific items when they
come before us.
The reconstitution of our committees, I
take to be necessary. I have no particular
reason to believe that that is so, but I have
every respect for the committee. I know of
the long hours it has put in, and I take for
granted that some such reconstitution is, in
their judgment, necessary. I hope that as the
discussion goes on the chairman or some
members of the committee will explain to us,
in a little more detail, why certain of these
reconstitutions are regarded as necessary.
Obviously, the main change seems to be in
the function of the Banking and Commerce
Committee which, over the years, I think by
general consent, has been regarded as the
outstanding committee of the Senate. In saying that, I do not derogate for one moment
some of the other committees. Perhaps I may
be allowed to say that, because up until
recently I was not a member of that committee. It has been an outstanding committee,
and I must say I am a little perplexed about
some of the rearrangements of functions that
are contemplated. I hope they will be
explained to us in detail as we go along, as
no doubt they will be.
A question has been raised as to the functions of the committees of the Senate. Particular reference has been made to the existing committee on External Relations. The
suggestion is that it be renamed the Committee on External Affairs. No doubt there is
good reason for that change.
I am not concerned, as some other honourable senators appear to be, that the Senate as
a whole or a committee of the Senate, should
find itself ahead of Government policy.
Hon. Mr. Aird: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I do not quite understand what the objection is, particularly from
some of my very good friends on the other
side who quite properly, on an earlier occasion, seemed to have no compunction about
opposing Government policy. If it is quite
appropriate for the Senate to oppose Government policy-and I think it is-it is perhaps a
truism to say that the Senate has been most
effective, over the long haul when it has been
in that position, due perhaps to a majority on
this side of the house, to be able to oppose
Government policy. There have been times
when opposition to government policy has

SENATE DEBATES
come even when there has been a Government majority here. I believe Senator Hayden
deserves credit for the very great distinction,
according to the memoirs of a former Prime
Minister I have read, in that he was named
as one of a "band of rebels", although at that
time he was on the Government side. I think
that is one of the great distinctions of his
career-the work that he did at that time.
Therefore, as I say, I am not greatly concerned about the Senate getting ahead of
Government policy.
The Leader of the Government was good
enough to refer to the speech I made on
Canadian-Caribbean relations. Of course it
was ahead of Government policy, or I would
not have made the speech. The whole purpose
of my making it was to suggest that the Government might take that next step, and I do
not see that any great harm would be done if
our own Committee on Foreign Affairs,
External Relations, External Affairs, or whatever it may be called, were actually to
recommend the proposal I made then to the
Government. It would be ahead of Government policy, but the Government, as the
Leader has said, is of course the only body
that can make the executive decision that
would be necessary to implement that as
policy.
Again, I say I am not at all concerned that
any of our committees will at any time find
themselves making recommendations or presenting reports that are ahead of Government
policy. On the contrary, I think perhaps one
of the omissions of the past was that we were
a little afraid to do it. What is wrong with it?
A very good example is Senator Croll's
Committee on Aging. It actually made a
recommendation which was way ahead of
Government policy at the time, the recommendation that there be an income supplement. That was later adopted by the Government. I do not think the Government was
embarrassed-and at the moment it would
not concern me too greatly if it were! However, I saw no indication of embarrassment, and
I think Senator Croll probably would be the
last one here to wish to embarrass the Government. But as I remember, he had no compunction, in going ahead and saying, "This
should be your policy in this very important
area of supplementing the incomes of our
senior citizens."
I will have some comments to make in support of the position that Senator Lamontagne
has taken. I may say, Mr. Chairman, though
it is not my business to say so, that I think he
had a very good reason for giving you his

November 6, 1968

comments at the time he did, and I hope he
will now go home and go to bed and take
care of himself.
Hon. Mr. Holleit: Honourable senators, I
move that the Chairman now leave the Chair
to report progress and ask leave to sit again.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I second the motion.
The Chairman: It has been moved and
seconded that the Chairman do now leave the
Chair and report progress and ask leave to sit
again.
Honourable senators is it your pleasure to
adopt the motion? Those in favour say "Aye".
Some Hon. Senators: Aye.
The Chairman: Those against say "Nay".
Some Hon. Senalors: Nay.
The Chairman: In my opinion, the "Nays"
have it.
Hon. Keith Davey: Mr. Chairman, as
honourable senators will appreciate, this is
not the first time I have followed Senator
Grosart, nor will it be the first time I have
agreed with much that he has said. I hasten
to assure his acting Leader that this will be
only a very brief intervention.
Some of us are still inclined to regard ourselves as "new senators." This includes those
of us who arrived in the Senate at the same
time as my friend Senator Hays, and while I
certainly do not share his views on politics or
politicians, I do agree with many of the
things he said today.
I want to assure Senator Molson of the
keen interest of all honourable senators with
whom I have spoken-and it has been evidenced in the discussion today-in the work
that his committee is doing.
I would like to recall briefly what really
happens to a person appointed to the Senate
and, if you will forgive me, what happened to
me when I arrived in the Senate. It seems to
me that you arrive here with the public
stereotype of the Senate of Canada, and
quickly acquire this public stereotype of senators in general. You arrive with some reluctance and with a great deal of concern about
what the Senate is really like and what its
usefulness will be. I think that many of the
newer senators would agree with me that you
are at first stunned and then delighted to
understand what goes on in this place, to
realize how effective the chamber is.

November 6, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

I certainly soon came to realize that in this
chamber we have many of the most brilliant
speakers and debaters I have heard anywhere
in my travels in Canada. Certainly there are
none more so than Senator Hayden. I do not
think Senator Hayden has spoken in this
chamber when I have been present that I
have not been-if he wi forgive the wordthrilled by his remarks and his approach.
While singling him out, I should mention also
that there are many other honourable senators of the same calibre. I think it is fair to
say that debate in this chamber is on the
average better than the debate which takes
place in the other place.
We arrived here perhaps not disillusioned
but certainly concerned, but not long after we
arrived we became very impressed by our
colleagues, and by the Senate itself.
However, honourable senators, the simple
fact is that the press of Canada is not
impressed, nor are the people of Canada
impressed, by what happens here day after
day. Perhaps it is simply because of the fact
that they do not realize what takes place in
this chamber day after day. The net result I
suggest to you is that the reputation and, if
you will, the image of the Senate sinks ever
lower, and I think we must face the tact that
we have a very serious crisis in respect of the
confidence of the people of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: May I ask if you are
a member of the Special Committee on the
Rules, Senator Davey?
Hon. Mr. Davey: No, I am not.
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: I am listening to you
with great interest.
Hon. Mr. Davey: I am not a member of
Senator Molson's committee.
Some senators would have us believe that
the problem in respect of the reputation of
the Senate, or its so-called image that I have
been talking about, is to be solved simply by
there being an improvement in our public
relations. I think any public relations professional will tell you that while a program of
good public relations would certainly assist
the Senate, the best public relations in the
world will be as nothing if there is not substantive reform in what takes place here day
by day. This is one more reason why I think
the kind of committee which Senator Molson
heads is so vitally important, and must come
first before we progress in the other directions I have been mentioning.

So, I repeat my view, that although the
work that goes on here day after day is
steady, substantial, solid and commendable,
there are not too many more people than
ourselves who are aware of just how effective
it is.
Yet, there are times when our good works
do come to the attention of the press and the
public of Canada. It seems to me that this
very often occurs-perhaps more often than
not-because of the work of the committees
of the Senate. As Senator Grosart has suggested, in the work of the committees we are
ahead of the House of Commons and, if you
will allow it, ahead of the Government. Senator Grosart has given some examples, and I
shall not repeat them.
Senator Hayden expressed some concern
about the future involvement of the Senate in
external affairs. In my opinion, this would be
an excellent subject matter for us as senators
to become involved in, because as this nation
grows what happens in the world is of increasing concern and interest to all the people
of Canada. I honestly believe, that if we can
lead the way-indeed, even if we can point
the way for the House of Commons, for the
Government of Canada, for the people of
Canada, or anyone else-in this or any other
area we will have done a very great service.
I read the speech made in Kitchener by the
Honourable Leader of the Government, to
which Senator Hayden referred to, and I prepared myself to commend the leader on his
speech. Naturally, I am concerned if in the
remarks he made today he seems to be prepared to back away from the remarks he
made in Kitchener. I hope that that will not
be the case.
My final remark is in respect of the reconstitution of the Senate committees themselves.
I do not want to take issue with Senator
Grosart, but he did question the continuing
role and function of the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce. I am one of those
who agrees that this has been an outstanding
committee, but why should it not have been
an outstanding committee when we have
referred every manner of matter to it? We
have referred to the Banking and Commerce
Committee matters which have no remote
relation to banking or to commerce. I would
hope that we shal have some assurance from
the chairman of the committee, or from some
of its members, that these matters which I do
not really think lie within the jurisdiction of
a committee on banking and commerce will
be referred to other committees; that the

SENATE DEBATES
workload will be divided among other
committees.
I thank all honourable senators for their
kind indulgence.

we used this system of Committee of the

we should do it right here in Committee of

SENATE DEBATES

Senate in 1955, this is only the second occasion I can recall upon which we have met in
Committee of the Whole since that time. I
have felt for many years that this practice
should have been followed more often. At the
risk of provoking Senator Choquette's displeasure for prolonging the discussion in a
general wayHon. Mr. Choquette: Filibustering!
Hon. Mr. Cameron: -there are certain general remarks that have to be made. If they
are not made now they will be made later.
There is an appropriate time at which these
general statements should be made and I
think this is the time.
I always listen to Senator Hayden with the
greatest care, and being very much concerned
about the public image of the Senate and the
kind of image that is promulgated by certain
members of the press, on the basis of the
most monumental lack of knowledge, I have
suggested that all one need do was to attend
the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce and watch Senator Hayden in
action to get some appreciation of the quality
of work done in that branch of the Senate
and in many others. I do not want to embarrass him, but I have on many occasions listened with fascination and delight to the
lucidity with which he has gone through very
involved and 'complicated bills. I know of no
one else in this chamber who has had that
capacity since I have been here.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Cameron: Therefore, when I find
myself disagreeing with him I like to take a
second look at the reasons he put forward. He
said he had some reservations about the
speech made by the Leader of the Government at Kitchener. As a matter of fact, I read
the newspaper report of Senator Martin's
speech at Kitchener and I wrote him a letter
this morning commending him for it. I also
suggested that already in this session there
has been a new mood and a new feeling of
accomplishment in the chamber. There are
two reasons for that. One is the Leader of the
Government himself; the other is the exoellent performance of His Honour the Speaker
of the Senate.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Cameron: We have in the Leader
of the Government a man with a life of experience in the field of international affairs. On
a number of occasions in this session questions on international affairs have been asked

of him and he has answered thern in the
chamber. To me this has been a very fine
thing to have happened, and I hope it will
happen more frequently. I should like honourable senators to feel that they can at any
time ask the Leader of the Government questions in the area of his own expertise.
This would add greatly to the interest and
effectiveness of this chamber. There are other
members of the Senate with expert knowledge
who could be questioned in the same way.
Senator Hayden did make one point which
I think we should examine. Under the existing rules, through the technique of a senator
saying that he will move a certain motion or
call attention to some matter, we are provided with an opportunity to discuss problems
that are important and timely. However, over
the years my experience has been that until
the last year or so this device has not been
used nearly as much or as effectively as it
should have been. Nevertheless, it is there
and we should use it more than we have
done.
With respect to the fear of Senate committees being ahead of government policy
without reflecting on government policy, I
would say this is one of the reasons we
should be here. For example, in the Special
Committee on Science Policy we are blazing a
trail into the future and unless we are ahead
of government policy we are wasting our
time. I am sure we are performing a service
for the people of Canada that will pay great
dividends in the future. Undoubtedly this is
true of many other committees. I therefore
say there is nothing wrong with the Senate or
a Senate committee being ahead of government policy. If for its own good reasons the
Government is unable to implement the
recommendations of the Senate or a Senate
committee, it will have to justify turning
them down. Our role can be an advocative
role, a role of communication to the public,
communicating what needs to be emphasized
to a much greater extent than at the present
time. I will say no more about that.
It is proposed to reduce the number of
Senate committees from 19 to 11. I am one of
those who have viewed with some concern
the encroachment on space in this building,
or the lack of space for Senate committees to
meet, the lack of facilities and the difficulty
of providing adequate staff for Hansard and
so on. Many honourable senators have sat idle
for 20 minutes or half an hour in a committee
because of a lack of quorum as three or four
other committees were meeting at the same
time, or because another Senate committee

SENATE DEBATES
required the room, or because the Senate
reporting staff was required for other committees. The reduction of the number of committees is one way of making more effective
use of and modernizing our resources. Therefore, in terms of using the space available
and of making more effective use of the
reporting staff, this is a good thing.
While on the subject, I should like to add
this comment for the benefit of the Leader of
the Government and what has been the
Senate Committee on Internal Economy and
Contingent Accounts. I have viewed with
some concern the continual encroachment by
the other place on the space required for the
Senate, and I think it is time that we say,
"Thus far and no farther." Maybe they have
gone too far now and it is time we started
pushing them out. I understand from the
chairman of the committee that steps have
been taken in this direction, and I commend
them for it.
By having fewer and larger committees
with freedom to deal with all subjects, we
can increase the effectiveness of the Senate
and its committees in the Parliament of Canada, and we can acquire the same status as the
Senate committees in our sister country to the
south. This is all to the good, but it does not
mean in any sense of the word that we should
emulate in all respects the policies they follow. I would not wish to think of a Senate
committee on un-Canadian activities. That is
one we can do without.
I have one other brief observation. It has to
do with a general rule, and I will have more
to say about it later. But I am one of those
who is very jealous, as I know the rest of you
are, of the image of the Senate, of the acceptance of senators and the work they do.
Sometimes when I read derogatory accounts
in the newspapers about this "senile, doddering institution" I point out to these people
publicly that some of my colleagues in this
chamber are directors of some of the largest
and most successful businesses in Canada.
They are doing their work with efficiency and
credit to themselves and their country. Anyone who expresses that kind of nonsense simply does not know what he is talking about.
There are many senators here who are not
involved in large business corporations, but
in other activities equally important. There
are probably two dozen senators who are also
members of Senates and boards of governors
of universities and other similar public
bodies.

November 6, 1968

Participation in these bodies is a good thing
for the Senate and it is welcomed by the
bodies of which these sentors are members.
But it does take time. Therefore, I think consideration must be given under our rules,
when people like my friend Senator MacKenzie and myself and others have to travel to
the far end of Canada-we have to leave
Ottawa on Thursday night or Friday morning, and probably will work through the
weekend; and it is practically impossible to
do any work out there and return to Ottawa
in time for a Monday sitting. This does not
mean the Senate cannot sit on a Monday, but
consideration should be given to senators who
are absent on public business of that kind. It
may not be directly government business, but
it is the people's business, and it is good for
the people of Canada as well as for the
Senate. This is one of the means of impressing on the people that senators are active
members of the community of which they are
a part. It is an essential part of a senator's
responsibility to participate in public offices
and in public affairs, provided he does not
make it an excuse for not paying attention to
the work of the Senate. I am sure no one
would do that. But he should not be penalized
in terms of time, and I believe the rules
committee is doing something to recognize
this.
In regard to the matter that Senator
Lamontagne brought up about making the
Committee on Science Policy a continuing
committee, I simply want to say that in terms
of the knowledge we have now, this is going
to be one of the most important areas of
public service in this country. The more you
listen to what is going on in the scientific
world today, the more impressed you are that
you cannot neglect the activities that are taking place in the field of science. We must
allow ourselves a lead time of not less than
ten years, and in many cases fifteen and
twenty years, in formulating policies, which
means that today we must be formulating
policies that will be brought to fruition in a
minimum of ten, fifteen years or twenty years
from now. This is one of the biggest tasks any
committee of the Senate could tackle, and I
hope that the Committee on the Rules of the
Senate will make provision for continuing
this work.
My final word is one of commendation to
my friend and former room-mate, Senator
Molson, and to his associates, for the excellent job which they are doing. It is a firstclass job, but it is only the beginning.

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. John J. Kinley: Honourable senators,
I have been coming here a long time and I
have had some experience in Parliament. I
must say that when I first came to the Houses
of Parliament as a young man, I was fascinated by the interest in the rules of the house. I
understood it was a study in itself. The
Speaker would refer to Parliamentary
authorities such as Bourinot and others, who
were quoted by members on both sides of the
house. There were members who gained high
reputations in Parliament for their knowledge
of the rules.
The rules of Parliament have been changed
a great deal since I came here. I remember
there was a Minister of Marine and Fisheries,
but when we came to discuss matters affecting the merchant marine we had to go to the
railway committee. Later on it was the Committee on Transport and Communications to
which marine matters were referred. I always
thought that railway and marine interests
were in conflict. We have lost the merchant
marine but we still have the railways.
Canada is such a broad country with such
long coastlines both east and west that we
used to feel we should not leave all these
matters to be dealt with by the railway committee. The interests of our marine were surrendered. We were told that we could sell
more grain and other products if we shipped
our freight on foreign vessels. So the ships of
our West Indies fleet were sold. On the other
hand, our lakes were then land-locked
because of the lack of depth of water at the
sills of the locks. Today it is different.
It was my impression that legislation dealing with our ferries operating between Nova
Scotia and Newfoundland, between Prince
Edward Island and the mainland, and over
the Bay of Fundy, should come under a committee on marine matters. We thought that
this should be dealt with separately and not
be controlled by our railways. The directors
of the merchant marine were also directors of
the railroads. I felt that with this interlocking
management, the interests of the merchant
marine were in jeopardy. Now we find this
important industry tacked onto a committee
of international affairs, and this new committee is to deal with "territorial and offshore
matters." It seems to me that this is a poor
allocation for our marine affairs and that
there should be a special committee of the
Senate where the merchant marine service
can be discussed on its merits. At the same
time, I think marine and fisheries are two
services which by their nature should come

under one committee. I would put a lot of
faith in such a conmittee. It would have a
maritime atmosphere, and legislation affecting activities on the sea could be entrusted to
it.
I agree with Senator Roebuck that there
should be some delay in these deliberations,
that we should have some opportunity to consider the proposed amendments and to discuss them later. These amendments came into
my hand only an hour or two ago, and I find,
for example, that the Standing Rules with
respect to divorce are referred to. In order to
understand the amendments, one must
understand the rules; so it would be wise to
have sufficient time to study both the rules
and the amendments. We should take our
time and give this important matter the consideration it deserves.
Honourable senators, I have been a member of Parliamentary committees for 32 years,
and I have been an active member of the
Senate Divorce Committee since coming to
the Senate. I have not always agreed with
Senator Roebuck, but he has been an industrious chairman and has done valuable work.
The parliamentary divorce procedure was
not changed because of the Rules of the
Senate but because certain people in the
House of Commons used the rules of that
house to filibuster and delay the passage of
legislation. That is what led to the change in
the first place, and now these divorce cases
have been transferred, with the approval of a
certain minority, to the Exchequer Court of
Canada. While I admit that the Exchequer
Court is the appropriate place for the handling of these divorce cases, I did not like the
way the other place treated this matter and
surrendered its authority to two or three of
its members.
Senator Hayden has served as chairman of
one of our most important committees, the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce. He is a leading lawyer in this country,
and I am sure that everyone in this house
will agree that he is a splendid chairman.
Senator Hugessen was an outstanding chairman of the Standing Committee on Transport
and Communications, as anyone who served
under him well knows. I also served under
Senator Aseltine who was a very capable
chairman of the Divorce Committee. He and
the late Senator Haig were the leading
members of that committee for some years.
At times some of us are a little slack in our
attendance. We from the Maritimes and from
the west must stay in Ottawa over the weekends-it is too long a journey home. As

him and the other members of the committee
because they have met so frequently.
I always appreciate very much the sound
remarks by Senator Cameron. He has given a
great contribution to the Senate. He is busy at
the moment on another worthy committee,
the Science Committee. I agree with what he
said, that we are often ahead of government
policy here.
Is that not so, honourable senators? When we
look at some of the worthwhile Senate committees and their results we must appreciate
that that is true. For example, the Committee
on Land Use resulted in many millions of

to do and we should make it our duty to do

house was in session. In the case of the

SENATE DEBATES
Science Policy Committee the right was given. It is our intention to proceed with this
matter tomorrow. Senator Molson and his
committee have been meeting at difficult
hours in order to complete their work. I think
they are right in trying to complete this work
as early as possible to anticipate other meetings that will be taking place, and also
because the committee's efforts may well
have a bearing on what is being done here.
Therefore, it is proposed that we go on again
tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Honourable senators, I
have no special interest, and I support the
report of the committee. I had intended to say
something about it, but I am very much concerned that we are working under pressure
and with undue haste. Senator Roebuck,
Senator Hollett and Senator Benidickson have
all asked that the matter be put over.
Now, it has always been the practice of the
Senate to extend courtesy to members who
ask for these not unreasonable considerations.
I think if the Senate wants to make progress
on this report or on any other report, one of
the first things they can do is extend consideration to the members of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, I
think we are all anxious to be courteous to
one another but, at the same time, we have ta
recognize that we have problems. It is not
that we are trying to be discourteous or that
there is any intention on the part of anyone
to preclude participation in debate. We are
certainly anxious to hear Senator Roebuck
speak on these matters because of his chairmanship of the Divorce Committee, but the
work ahead of us is undoubtedly extensive. It
seems to me it would be very unfair to this
committee, which has sat at most unusual
hours in order to bring in this interim report,
if we were not to try to give its chairman and
members as prompt a decision as possible. It
does not mean that we will preclude any
senator from expressing his views.
We have had this general debate all afternoon. I think it has been useful, but the time
is now approaching when we want to examine the various items. If the Senate does not
wish to pursue this course tomorrow, despite
the urgent request being made of us by the
chairman and the committee, the Senate can
take another course. There is no lack of
courtesy towards anyone. The fact remains
that we have obligations and we want to discharge those obligations in the best way
possible.

AERONAUTICS ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from. Thursday, October 31, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Honourable Mr. Laird for the second reading
of Bill S-14, to amend the Aeronautics Act.
Hom. J. Campbell Haig: Honourable senators, this is the first time this session, I have
had the opportunity of speaking in this house.
At the outset I want to extend my sincere
and honest congratulations to the Honourable
Paul Martin, the new Goverrment Leader,
and to wish him continued success in this
new Une of endeavour and duties.
To you, Sir, aur presiding officer, may I
wish you well in your new position. If past
performance is any indication, we are going
to have a weli-run chamber. To you also I
offer my congratulations and best wishes.
I might; add here after the long discussion
on the Rules of the Senate this afternoon that
I hope they will get through our business
before the end of the year.
Coming now to Bill S-14 Senator Laird on
Thursday last gave us a concise and clear
explanation of the measure. He said in the
course of his remarks that it was purely a
housekeeping matter or a tidying-up process
because of the transfer of the Air Transport
Board to Canadian Transport Commission.
Honourabie senators I was pleased to see
that minor matters such as parking fees at
airports can now be deait with by regulation
instead of by order in coundil. I think it was
a good move on these somewhat minor matters. Furthermore I arn pleased to see that
this bill provides for a more clear-cut position
s0 that our air industry wili have less combersome methods of operation in the conduct
of the industry.
Honourable senators I recommend favourable conisideration of Bill S-14.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

BUSINESS 0F THE SENATE
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, in
accordance with recent custom, I wish to give
an indication of what I envisage to be our
timetable for next week.
The Senate wül be in Committee of the
Whole on the third report of the Special Committee on the Rules of the Senate; the debate
will continue on the motion of Honourable
Mr. Croil for the appointment of a special
committee to study ail aspects o! poverty in
Canada.
We should conclude the debate on the
motion for the second reading o! Bill S-15, to
amend the Food and Drugs Act and the Narcotic Control Act and to make a consequential
amendment to the Criminal Code, after which
the bill will be referred to committee.
Debate on the motion for second reading oi
Bull C-li0 to amend the Farm Credit Act, wil
continue, at the conclusion of which the bull
will be referred to coxnmittee.
Honourable senators will note on the Order
Paper the second reading of a bill to amend
the Canada Evidence Act. I indicated on a
previous occasion that after the judges had
completed their meeting at Quebec on
November 4 we would be in a position to
proceed with this bull. We are able to proceed
29234-291

with it now, and I hope we shahl do that next
week. This is a voluminous and important
bill, and my expectation is that its second
reading will be moved on Thursday next.
It is expected also that we shahl receive
from the other place Bill C-124, the C.N.R.
Financing and Guarantee Act, 1968, and Bull
C-i112, to amend the Farm Machinery Syndicates Credit Act. It is possible that we shail
also be in a position to proceed with a bill
concerning hate iterature, which was before
this house hast year. I cannot give a positive
indication that that will be done next week,
but 1 wouhd hope so.
There wîll be divorce petitions, reports and
resohutions to be dealt with.
The Special Committee on the Rules of the
Senate will continue its examination of the
ruhes, and it is expected that the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce wîll
have legishation to consider. I understand that
the Special Committee on Science Policy will
not be meeting next week.
1 would propose that the Senate itsehf
should not be in session in the chamber on
Wednesday next but that we give the Special
Committee on the Rules of the Senate an
opportunity of sitting ail that day and having
a continuous run, something I think it
deserves because of the very unusual effort
made by its members to conchude its agenda.
In summary, we wihh meet on Tuesday, we
will give Wednesday to the Standing Committee on the Rules o! the Senate, and the
Standing Committee on Banking and Comnmerce will likehy meet at 9.30 that morning,
but the house will not sit.

under the monopolization of the great
landowners. The sturdy yeomen of the
past who formed the legions of Rome
passed away. They became the unemployed of the great cities, corrupted by
bread and circuses, and the lands of
Rome-in the words of Gibbon's Decline
and Fall of the Roman Empire-became
cultivated by gangs of slaves.
This is the most relevant portion:
The barbarians who attacked Rome
after this economic situation had developed in Rome have their counterparts
today in the huns and vandals who are
disrupting conditions in the cities to the
south. So far we have escaped these
troubles, but Canadian youth is in revolt
against the lack of opportunities.. .
There is no justification whatsoever in that
paragraph for the statement that I called land
speculators barbarians. Not only so, but I
would not use that kind of language. In so far
as the speculators in lands are concerned,
they are living in the world as we have made
it and of course must abide according to the
rules which we have laid down. I have no
insults to throw at any of them.
Therefore, I want it clearly understood, in
the Hansard of today, that I made no such
statement, no such charges. Had I done so I
would withdraw them and apologize.

as a credit and in terms of its cost. As in the
case of most other businesses, the farm business in Canada over the last few years has
been replacing its labour by capital. Evidence
of this is the fact that farmers have been
enlarging a great deal the size of their enterprises. Between 1961 and 1966 farms with
sales of under $5,000 have decreased 30 per
cent, while in the same period farms with
sales of over $10,000 have increased 90 per
cent. Therefore, there is an ever-increasing
need in the farming community for long-term
capital. When one considers that prices have
not been rising as quickly as expenses in
farm operations, one can realize it is very
difficult for the operations themselves to generate the additional capital required to
enlarge the size of the undertaking.
The Farm Credit Act extends long-term
credit to farmers for several reasons. Primarily, it is to enable them to purchase additional
land to their present holding. It is also used
to purchase entire farming units, to purchase
fixed improvements which are added in the
form of buildings et cetera, for debt consolidation, and for miscellaneous items such as the
purchase of livestock and equipment. In 196768, roughly 50 per cent of the money paid out
under the Farm Credit Act was used for the
purchase of additional land; 14 per cent for
the purchase of entirely new farm units;
another 14 per cent for the purchase of fixed
improvements; 17 per cent for debt consolidation; and 4.5 per cent for miscellaneous
reasons.
Under the Farm Credit Act there are two
types of loans. The ordinary loan is under
Part II of the act and some 11,107 such loans
were made in the year 1967-68. Those loans
are available on 75 per cent of the appraised
value of the land up to a maximum of $40,000
on a first mortgage over a maximum 30-year
term. There are also loans under Part III
which are meant to encourage young farmers
to undertake the business of farming and,
more specifically, to encourage fathers to pass
their farming operations on to their sons. In
1967-68 some 847 loans were under Part III.
Those loans are given only to farmers who
are between the ages of 21 and 45, with five
years' experience in farming and who propose
to farm an economic farm unit. The loan is
up to 75 per cent of the appraised value of
both the land and the chattels on the farm.

That loan can be to a maximum of $55,000
and, like Part II loans, it is a first mortgage
for a maximum 30-year term. Because the
loan is on both land and chattels as opposed
to land only under Part II, and because the
amount is $55,000 as opposed to $40,000, and
because we are dealing with a young farmer,
the corporation naturally wants additional
protection. It gets that protection by having
the young farmer submit a plan of operation
approved by the corporation and by having
him agree that he will accept the supervision
of the officers of the corporation during the
time that the loan is in excess of 75 per cent
of the value of the land. In addition, the
corporation requires that the value of the
loan be covered by life insurance.
Honourable senators, the Farm Credit Act
is administered by the Farm Credit Corporation. This corporation has a staff of 630 persons. Of that number, 265 members are field
officers who operate out of 125 farm credit
offices throughout the Dominion of Canada.
Since its inception in 1959 under the Farm
Credit Act, the Farm Credit Corporation has
extended 75,000 loans for a total amount of
$1.2 billion. Of that total, loan losses have
amounted to $160,000 only, and as of the end
of the year the amount left in reserve to
cover loan losses is $1.5 million. At the end of
the year the amount of arrears in payments is
less than 7 per cent of the total outstanding
loans. The administration costs of the corporation are .76 per cent-less than one per cent
of the total outstanding loans of the corporation. When you compare that to a commercial
operation you will see that the corporation's
administrative costs are low.
The services provided by the Farm Credit
Corporation are, of course, a normal mortgage business, but it is not a small mortgage
business which the staff undertakes. In 1968
the corporation approved $263 million worth
of loans, and it administered total outstanding
loans of $915 million. In addition to the operation of a normal mortgage business, the corporation provides its own group life plan. It
also provides advisory services to farmers,
including a rather novel electronic farm
accounting program which may have the
effect of revolutionizing farm accounting in
Canada. I might mention in passing that the
group life plan and the advisory services,
while they are mandatory in Part III loans,
are also available to any borrower under Part
II on request.
What are the shortcomings of the present
Farm Credit Act? First, the Farm Credit Cor-

SENATE DEBATES
poration is losing money. In 1967 and 1968 it
lost $3,800,000. It is losing money because the
interest rate it charges on its loans, sufficient
to cover the interest cost it is paying, is not
sufficient to cover the interest cost plus the
costs of operations which are increasing at a
rapid rate.
Another shortcoming is that the loans at
present have reached the ceiling. I am given
to understand that as of the middle of
November the corporation will have no
money to lend unless these amendments are
passed. Indians on reservations are unable to
borrow money from the Farm Credit Corporation under the Farm Credit Act. There is no
provision in the present act for a farming
corporation. The act does have provision for
what is called a family farm corporation, but
that is a corporation whose shareholders are
related. But it bas been found in recent times
that an individual farmer may want to ally
himself with another individual farmer or
farmers to create a corporation that will enable them to compete more efficiently with the
large commercial farming enterprises that are
now invading the agricultural sector. In the
present situation, the moment those individuals incorporate they are unable to borrow
money from the Farm Credit Corporation
under the act. Additionally, the size of loans
needs to be enlarged. Young people need to
be encouraged to undertake farming as a
livelihood. This is one of the main reasons for
the Farm Credit Act, and in this respect I
think that act has probably succeeded admirably. It is a fact that in 1967 and 1968, 34.9
per cent of the borrowings under the act were
by people in the 21 to 34 age group, whereas
in the 1966 census it is shown that that same
group as a percentage of the total farm population is only 15.3 per cent. So it is a fact that
the act has encouraged young people to take
over their father's farm and undertake farming as an occupation. But, even so, more
should be done to encourage this trend.
What are the amendments that are proposed? First, there are amendments which
will increase the funds available to the corporation. The present capital of the corporation
is $40 million. Under the terms of the Farm
Credit Act the corporation is entitled to borrow 25 times its present capitalization. So the
corporation is entitled to borrow $1 billion
which, if added to its capital of $40 million,
means that the corporation presently has $1,040 million available for lending. As I stated
earlier, by the middle of this month the outstandings of the corporation will exceed that

November 7, 1968

amount and the corporation will have to stop
lending money. Therefore, it is proposed in
this amendment that the capital be increased
to $56 million. That will enable the corporation ta borrow $1.4 billion from the Minister
of Finance which, if added to the $56 million
of capital, will mean that the corporation has
available for lending $1,456 million.
Another series of amendments will change
the interest provisions. At the present time
there is an interest limitation of 5 per cent on
loans up to $20,000 under Par II, and up to
$27,500 under Part III. Over those amounts in
the present act the excess interest rate is the
cost of the money to the corporation, plus the
corporation's expenses. The 5 per cent rate,
in relation to rates being charged today, is an
uneconomic one.
What are the difficulties of an uneconomic
rate? First, if we have an uneconomic rate it
tends to channel funds to the purchase of
land that might otherwise not be channelled
there. The result is inflation of land values
which creates a cost that is probably greater
than that caused by any increase in interest
rate we would have to undertake. Secondly,
such an uneconomic rate is a discriminatory
subsidy when you consider that 25 per cent of
the farmers take advantage of the Farm
Credit Act and the other 75 per cent,
therefore, are not enjoying that subsidy.
Thirdly, the Farm Credit Corporation should
stand on its own feet, and every attempt
should be made to overcome the deficit of
1967-1968 of $3,800,000 which, if action is not
taken, will grow this year. Therefore, the
new rate proposed in the amendment is one
to be prescribed by the Governor in Council;
and the Minister of Agriculture has stated
that that rate will not be more than 1 per
cent over the borrowing rate of the Government. That should help, over a period of
time, to overcome the deficit of the corporation, if you recall that its expenses do not
exceed 0.76 per cent of the outstandings. I
would just say that although it may worry
people that there will be an increase in interest from 5 per cent on amounts under $20,000
and $27,500, I think any businessman would
be pleased to have an arrangement in which
he was assured 30-year money on the basis of
1 per cent over the net cost to the Government of Canada.
There are other amendments, honourable
senators, which will enable farmers who
incorporate to borrow from the Farm Credit
Corporation under the act. As I have stated,
under the present act those farmers are unable to borrow unless they have a family farm

November 7, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

corporation which is composed of shareholders who are related. Then they can only
borrow under Part II of the act. Under the
amendments it is proposed that a farm corporation, composed of shareholders who may
not be related, could borrow under both Parts
II and III of the act. So that large commercial
enterprises will not be able to take advantage
of the act, there will be a requirement that
the principal shareholder of the farm corporation will be actively engaged in the business of farming, will be over 21 years of age,
and will be the principal shareholder to the
extent of more than 51 per cent of the shares
of the corporation.
Other amendments increase the present
limitations on the size of the loan. Under Part
II the present limitation is $40,000. The
amendment would provide that one farmer,
under Part II, could borrow $40,000; two
farmers operating jointly, $80,000; and three
or more, $100,000. Under Part III the present
limitation is $55,000. Under the amendment
one farmer would be permitted to borrow
$55,000; but two or more, operating jointly,
would be able to borrow $100,000. These borrowings would be available not only to
individuals as such, but to individuals who
form themselves into either farming corporations or co-operatives.
There are other amendments that bring the
Indians in farming reservations under the
Farm Credit Act. As I have stated, at present
they are not able to borrow from the corporation. The reason is that there is no provision
for the mortgaging of Indian reservations.
Therefore, this amendment proposes that the
Farm Credit Corporation, through the Governor in Council, may enter into an agreement with the Minister of Indian Affairs and
Northern Development, extending to Indians
on reservations all the provisions of the Farm
Credit Act as they relate to other persons,
plus a special provision that, in effect, would
permit Indian bands to be defined as co-operatives, allowing them to borrow up to

$100,000.
Finally, there are a series of amendments
which are designed to bring young people
into farming and to encourage farmers to
pass their farming operations down to their
sons. Those amendments will be found in
both Part III and Part Il.
Part III deals with loans to younger people.
The rule requiring experience of five years
before anyone can borrow money under Part
III would be removed and replaced by the
provision that officials of the corporation

would determine whether or not to lend
money to the young farmer, based entirely on
his experience, ability and character. You
will recall that under Part III, in a farm
corporation every member of that corporation
has to be between the ages of 21 and 45 in
order to enjoy the amounts available. This
amendment would provide that one of the
shareholders could be over the age of 45, if
the principal shareholder is under the age of
35. You will also recail in Part III that the
amount of the loan is limited to 75 per cent of
the value of the land and chattels. The
amendment would permit that limit to be
increased to 90 per cent, if the corporation
finds the applicant bas a high degree of
managerial skill. Honourable senators will
also recall that under Part III life insurance
is required on the full value of the loan. It is
felt that this is unnecessary, and the cost
rather onerous. Therefore, it is proposed to
reduce the amount of the life insurance to the
value of the chattels that are mortgaged.
Money borrowed under Part II for a loan
to a relative can be used only for the acquisition of land. The amendment contained in
this bill will permit that relative to use the
money for the improvement of land as well.
This bill will also permit a family farm corporation to borrow money from the Farm
Credit Corporation for the redemption of its
own shares, or for the lending of money to a
shareholder to enable him to buy shares of
the Corporation itself. The purpose of these
last two amendments is purely and simply to
enable young farmers to obtain funds in
order to take over their fathers' farms. I
should like also to mention in reference to
these amendments that they are extremely
attractive. We should encourage young farners to stay on the land. We should encourage
fathers to develop operations which can be
passed on to their sons. In my view, it will be
very difficult to argue against these particular
amendments.
I wondered, when I looked at the amendments proposed to the Estate Tax Act and
to the gift tax sections of the Income Tax
Act, which struck me as making the passing
on of a farm from generation to generation
very difficult, whether the Government bas
realized that, on the one hand, it is saying it
is encouraging a farmer to pass his farm on
from generation to generation, and to see that
it grows, and, on the other hand, it is erecting
an almost insurmountable barrier against that
in the form of gift taxes and estate taxes. I do
not want to pursue that matter any further at
this time, honourable senators, but it is a

Hon. Mr. Evereil: I can assure honourable
senators that the problem that obtains today
is the fact that we have in the farming area
the large commercial corporation. If we do
not provide some sort of incentive for young
farmers to get into the farming business, then
I think we shall find that the family farm
corporation will disappear. The family farm
corporation in its present size cannot exist. It
will have to become almost as large as
the commercial corporation. We have to make
a decision as to whether we want our farms
to be run by public corporations as commercial enterprises, or whether we want the concept of the family farm, but a larger family
farm, to continue. Frankly, I opt for the
enlarged family farm.

RULES OF THE SENATE
SPECIAL COMMITTEE'S REPORT FURTHER
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE OF THE
WHOLE

Pursuant to an order of the day, the Senate
resumed from yesterday consideration of the
third Report of the Special Committee on the
Rules of the Senate.
Hon. Alan Macnaughton in the Chair.
The Chairman: Honourable senators, I call
your attention to paragraph 1 of the report.
Yesterday we had a general discussion. Are
honourable senators now ready to deal with
the subparagraphs one by one of the proposed
new rule 78, subsection 1?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Muriel McQ. Fergusson: Honourable
senators, I did not have the opportunity to
speak yesterday and I should like to make a
general contribution, unless the intention is to
go directly to the report clause by clause.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Honourable senators,
I wish to congratulate Senator Molson and his
committee on the work they have done. The
Rules of the Senate need to be streamlined,
and I know the committee is making a very
good attempt to do that. I certainly agree
with a great many of the recommendations
they have brought before us, and I appreciate
the time they have spent in meeting at very
inconvenient hours. However, when I remember the years during which the Standing
Committee on Divorce sat for five days a
week, including Mondays and Fridays, and
when I remember that the Joint Committee

November 7. 1968

DEBATES
Novemer 7.1968SENATE

on the Canada Pension Plan sat during a
Christmas recess, although I appreciate wbat
this Special Cominittee on the Rules bas
done, I think we should not overlook those
other committees which also met at very
inconvenient hours and worked hard and long
at their tasks.
Like other honourable senators who have
spoken before me, I find it hard to understand the lack of esteem. the Senate of Canada
receive.s from the Canadian publie and the
Canadian press. I have visited upper cbambers in other countries, and I have neyer noticed a similar attitude taken there. There
may be a reason why in other countries te
attitude towards their upper chamber is different. As you know, there are different ways
of appointing members to the upper chamber,
and it may be that the system in other countries is better than ours. This is sometbing we
sbould consider. In any case, the senators in
other countries seemn to be much more bighly
regarded by both the public and the press.
I believe that an upper chamber is essential
to good government, and that the Fathers of
Confederation were very wise wben tbey
decided that the Government of Canada
should be made up of the Monarch, an upper
chamber called the Senate and a lower cbamber called the House of Commons. Although
at that time we followed the pattern of Britain, we should remember that Britain is not
the only country which bas an upper chamber. The United States of America and
France have them. It may be remembered
that both Brîtain and France have in the past
abolished their upper chambers and then set
them. up again. The House of Lords in Britain
was abolished by Cromwell and only four
years later he said himself of the one-house
Parliament that followed:
It was the horridest arbitrariness that
ever existed on earth.
France twice abolished ber upper chamber
but returned to the bicameral systemn in the
belief, I understand, that having a one chamber legisiature provided greater opportunity
for revolutionists. Italy, Belgium, Ireland,
Holland and Sweden have senates, as have
most of the Commonwealth countries except
New Zealand. Although New Zealand bas
abolished its upper chamber, I understand
there is a great deal of discussion there as to
the wisdom of re-establishing it.
The majority of countries that have only
one chamber are not federal states, and are
not made up of a number of provinoes, as
Canada is. They are unitary states in which
29234-30

one government controls everytbing throughout the country.
Many honourable senators probably know
from my attitude in the past that I believe
Canadian women receive from the Canadian
public and press a similar lack of proper
recognition. If I were the only one in Canada
who believes this, we would not now have a
Royal Commission on the Status of Women,
which has travelled througbout the country,
made a study of this subject and will, we
hope, be making a report in 1969.
Many of us older Canadian women in public life, when speaking to younger women
have advised themHon. Mr. Martin: You are certainly not one
of the older women.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: The bonourable senator is very ktad, but I really feel I amn.
When we speak to younger women we
advise them that the way to overcome the
present prevalent attitude of the public is not
to complain about it but to work bard, to
make the public and the press realize that
their attitude is often wrong. We urge tbem
to do things of interest so that the public and
the press will be aware of our activities, and
the reports of wbat we are dotag will reach
the front pages of the papers rather than -be
assigned to the women's pages covering the
parties and social events. This is where most
of the reports of our activities appear in the
press today.
When talking to these young and often very
frustrated women one bit of advice I bave
frequently given is tbat to succeed in this
man-orientated world a woman must look like
a girl, act like a lady, tbtak like a man and
work like a beaver. I think the spirit of that
advice might be applied to tbe Senate. If the
Senate is to receive the proper recognition to
wbich it is entitled, senators must have a
youtbful point of view, tbey must not be too
bound by custom or tradition; tbey sbould act
in a dignified manner, as becomes members
of an upper chamber, and not lower our prestige tbrough debates on merely a partisan
level. I thiak bonourable senators sbould
think as they did when they were carrying on
whatever business or profession occupied
them prior to their appointment, for tbey
must bave conducted themselves in such a
way as to have made people recognize themn
as men and women possesstag a great deal of
intelligence and ability.
The last bit of advice wbicb I gave to the
young women-to work like beavers-is per-

SENATE DEBATES
haps the one we should think of most seriously. Certainly the public and the press do not
have the impression that we work very hard,
despite our repeated protests in this chamber
that we do. I doubt if working from Tuesday
to Thursday would ever be considered by
either public or press as working like
beavers.
Like Senator Roebuck, I did not realize that
the report of the Special Committee on Rules
of the Senate was appended to the Senate
Hansardof October 31. The first time I saw it
was Tuesday afternoon. I regret that I have
not been able to give it an adequate study
since I first saw it yesterday. I probably will
want to make some comment on various
clauses when the report is being discussed
clause by clause, but I would like to make a
general comment regarding paragraph 4
which does away with standing rules from
133 to 152. These rules have been set up with
great care and they have operated very
successfully.
At the present time we do not know what
will be the result of the new Divorce Act. It
is still possible for persons to petition for a
bill of divorce from Parliament and we may
have many such petitions; on the other hand,
we may have none. However, we do not know
that we will have none, and in case we do
have many petitions I cannot see why we
should throw away existing rules which have
governed us in the past, and operate in a
vacuum.
I remember very well that no rules were
set up to cover appeals at the time the Dissolution and Annulment of Marriages Act was
passed. I remember also that when the first
appeal was received, for I was on the subcommittee that sat in appeal to deal with it,
and there was much confusion as to what the
proper procedure would be. No rules had
been set up and a formula had to be worked
out. We now have a formula under which we
can operate when we receive a petition for a
bill on divorce. If it should turn out after
some years of experience that we do not
receive any such applications, then I think it
might be time enough to abolish these rules.
At the present time I am very much opposed
to abolishing Standing Rules 133 to 152.
The Chairman: Are honourable senators
ready to proceed to a detailed discussion on
the various policies?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
The Chairman: Does subparagraph 1 dealing with the Joint Committee of the Library
of Parliament carry?

November 7, 1968

Hon. Senators: Carried.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Mr. Chairman, I should
like to ask the honourable senator if it is
clear now that all these joint committees
mentioned in subclause 1 are in fact going to
be joint committees. Is it agreed in the other
place that these committees are going to be
set up?
Hon. Mr. Molson: Mr. Chairman, I have
been informed that the House of Commons
either have appointed their members to each
of these first three committees or is in the
process of doing so, and that they intend to
continue the existence of their part of these
committees. Under those circumstances I do
not see how the Senate has any option but to
appoint its members to these committees.
The Chairman: Shall the item carry?
Hon. Senators: Carried.
The Chairman: Does subparagraph 2, the
Joint Committee on the Printing of Parliament, carry?
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I would like to ask the
sponsor of the report whether that committee
will have responsibility for debates and
reporting. If not, what committee will consider any question arising out of a matter concerned with debates and reporting?
Hon. Mr. Molson: I am not sure, Mr. Chairman, how frequently we have ever had matters on debates and reporting referred to a
committee. It has been a rare exercise.
That cornmittee in the past has been inactive.
I would suggest that, should any specific
problem in connection with that subject come
up, it should then be referred, by a decision
of the Senate, to whichever committee the
Senate may choose. I would suggest, for
example, it should go to the Committee on
Standing Rules and Orders.
The Chairman: Does subparagraph 2 carry?
Hon. Senalors: Carried.
The Chairman: Does subparagraph 3, dealing with the Joint Committee on the Restaurant of Parliament, carry?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Mr. Chairman, this may
be a little irrelevant. I would like to see some
method taken of disposing of those horrible
pictures which hang in the restaurant. They
are drab, uninteresting and, I think, disgraceful. There is not a single good picture in the
whole lot. They are supposed to come from

November 7, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

the National Gallery, where there are very
many excellent pictures which cost much
money to purchase and to maintain. Yet the
National Gallery sends over stuff of which
nobody knows the meaning. It is not even
colourful; it has no perspective in it or, if it
has, it is that of a boy in his first year in art
school. It is disgraceful to have those pictures
hanging there. Our visitors and guests must
wonder what kind of people we are to have
our walls decorated in that fashion.
Hon. Mr. Molson: May I suggest that Senator Roebuck might wish to refer that item to
the committee we are now discussing, the
Joint Committee on the Restaurant.

rise in defence of that picture, because it is
painted by a British Columbia painter. I do
not know whether Senator Roebuck is as
familiar with that part of the world as I am,
but I do know that practically everyone
we take to the restaurant and who sees
that picture, admires it. I also know that the
artist is one of the most expensive in the
country, in terms of the prices his paintings
bring. When I was interested, some years
ago, in making a purchase for a friend, I
found it could be done only through an agent
in Montreal. There were none of this artist's
paintings available in British Columbia.
Incidentally, I wish Senator Nichol were
here, as the painting Senator Roebuck is talking about was painted from the beach on
Savery Island where he bas his summer
home, and he has spoken of this picture with
appreciation.
I am not an artist and I have no claim to
being a critic or an accurate appraiser of art.
But art is a very delicate field into which to
wander, because there are as many opinions
about art as there are artists and, by and
large, as there are human beings. I feel that
it is wise for the amateur to stay out of this
area of often bitter controversy.

Hon. Mr. Grosart: Mr. Chairman, with
great reluctance I must disassociate myself
from the views expressed by Senator
Roebuck. I have the same difficulty in comprehending the artistic merit of many of
those paintings. However, as he said, they
do come from the National Gallery. I know
that Senator Roebuck is, in his own right, a
painter and a good one, and I can understand the difficulty he has in appreciating
some of those pictures which he says appear
to have little or no perspective. On the other
hand, I would not like the impression to get
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: Mr. Chairman, I

as a disgrace to hang those pictures. Person- merely wish to point out that the difference

the arts generally.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Mr. Chairman, let me
withdraw
the
word
"disgrace".
That
phraseology was probably too strong. But my
other comments stand.
Take one such picture as hangs on one of
the walls and let me say something about it
as an illustration of the kind of pictures that
are being hung there. You will find the colour
of the water close to the front of the picture
Is exactly the same as the colour of the water
as far away as you can see. You will find no
suggestion of sunlight in the picture. Furthermore, any scientist knows that the horizon
rises and falls always with the level of your

Hon. Paul Martin: Mr. Chairman, I would
like to make a suggestion to the committee,
through its chairman. We now have a committee on external affairs. In the other place,
in the restructuring of its committee system,
provision for a new title of their committee
has been made. It is being called the Committee on External Affairs and Defence. I am
suggesting that it might be of value if we
were to call our committee the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs. This would not
preclude that committee from dealing with

These could be included in the way in which
they are included in subelause 6.
The phrase "foreign affairs" is one with
which we will, I think, become more officially
cognizant as months go on. I do not want to
say any more than that. I believe that will be
the case. Most foreign ministers in the western world bear the title "Secretary of State
for Foreign Affairs." Every one of the foreign
ministers in NATO, for instance, is designated as Minister for Foreign Affairs. In the
United Kingdom the Foreign Minister bears
the title "Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs and Commonwealth Affairs?' We
could not possibly have the adjunct "and
Commonwealth Affairs" because we do not
have any such department. The Commonwealth affairs designation in the case of the
United Kingdom largely incorporates responsibility for colonial matters. I believe that the
suggestion to call our committee the Senate
Committee on Foreign Affairs would prove to
be timely and consistent with what I think
will be a growing tradition in our country.
I will say no more on that aspect of the
problem. I make that suggestion and I ask the
chairman of the committee to take these
observations into account when the committee
resumes its sessions.

November 7, 1968

If the name were changed from "international affairs" to "foreign affairs", I see no
reason why we could not continue to include
Roman numerals (i) to (vi) as the responsibilities of that committee. I for one, in view of
the information just given to us, would be in
favour of adopting the name "foreign affairs".
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Mr. Chairman, my inclination is to support the Leader of the Government in his suggestion. Although, obviously, he could not say so, I may say that there
is a rather strong rumour going the rounds of
the corridors that the present Department of
External Affairs will shortly seek to change
its name to the Department of Foreign
Affairs.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Would my friend permit
me to intervene? I hope it will not be construed that I as a member of the Government
had indicated that to be the case.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: I thought I was being
careful.
Hon. Mr. Martin: You were being very
careful and very decent.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I shall be ultra-careful
and say that the rumour, so far as I know,
was not circulated by or passed on by any
member of the Government. I just heard the
rumour in the corridor.
Of course, we all know how our committee
came to be called the Committee on External
Relations. Actually, the committee in the
House of Commons was known as the Committee on External Affairs and there was a
suggestion at one time that the word "affairs"
was not quite an appropriate association for a
Senate committee.

Hon. Mr. Molson: Mr. Chairman, I think
the Senate must take the honourable leader's
observations into account. The committee has
dealt with this matter at some considerable
length. There was considerable discussion
over the name "foreign affairs", and I think it
was well regarded by a good many members.
On balance, however, they chose the name
"international affairs", and this became a part
of their recommendations contained in this
report. At this stage I would suggest that the
decision is for the Senate, in that the report

SENATE DEBATES

technically do not include such things as conventions. Under (iii) we have "Foreign Aid".
But today foreign aid is not the designated
name. Our Department of External Aid is
now the Canadian International Development
Agency.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Yes; that is right.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: That change might well
be incorporated here to bring us in line with
the official nomenclature. Furthermore, I
think there must be a typographical error in
subsection (vi). I would suggest to the chairman of the committee that it should read
"Territorial and Offshore Waters". It should
not read "Territorial and Offshore Matters".
Hon. Mr. Molson: May I remark at this
stage, Mr. Chairman, that we started out with
matters of territorial and offshore waters, but
there was also the question of boundaries and
other areas that came into the picture and it
was felt that "waters" ceased to be a sufficiently wide term, and the word "matters"
was substituted therefor. If you want a precise but rather long title, perhaps you could
have it read, "Matters Relating to Territories
and Offshore Areas". That does seem cumbersome, however.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Well, it looked like an
error to me. In fact, it seemed obvious that
"matters" should be "waters", because territorial matters would take in anything having to do with the territory of Canada. It does
seem inexplicit. Here we are changing the
rules in order to make them as explicit as
possible, and yet we have this inexplicit
terminology.
Hon. Mr. Molson: This is underlining the
offshore aspect, which is the problem that is
likely to arise.
Hon. Mr. Martin: It would, for instance,
include the continental shelf.
Hon. Mr. Molson: Yes, the continental shelf.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: I am fully aware of that.
In fact, some provinces claim and some international lawyers say that the continental shelf
is still land, not "waters". I am fully aware of
that. But I reiterate that if you read that
subsection with any normal English interpretation-and I am not going to suggest what
might be substituted for it-the meaning that
will be taken from it will surely be that
somehow a stenographer misheard "waters"
for "matters".

Perhaps the committee might take that
under consideration. I will not discuss what
might be done. I say merely that here it is
rather inexplicit and even clumsy language.
Without moving an amendment, I will merely
leave that to the committee to discuss. Perhaps they might pass it now and later wish to
change it. The question is whether we draft
these things explicitly or not. For example, I
can refer back to item (i), "Treaties". That
is not too explicit a word because if it
was "international agreements" it would take
in international agreements and conventions,
and those are not treaties. It is a very important consideration for those who are interested in this particular aspect of our international relations.
Again, Mr. Chairman, I am quite prepared
to leave it with the connittee.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Would you mind repeating the title of (iii)-Foreign Aid. You gave
the right title, but I missed one word.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: The new department is
now called the Canadian International Development Agency-CIDA.
Hon. Mr. Cameron: Mr. Chairman, I was
interested in the explanation of the chairman
of the committee with respect to the title-the
Committee on International Affairs. I do not
have any serious quarrel with that, but I
must confess that my own preference is for a
committee on "Foreign Affairs". I think it is
more in keeping with present usage, and it is
also a little shorter. Therefore as a matter of
personal preference I would like to substitute
the words "Foreign Affairs" for "International Affairs". I do not know what the procedure
is with respect to making a change in this or
whether it is simply that the comnittee will
take note of the suggestions made.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Mr. Chairman, I am
impressed with the desirability of changing
the name from "International Affairs" to
"Foreign Affairs" for this reason: "International" connotes affairs as between nations,
while "Foreign" is a much wider term. That
term would take in such matters as sending
relief to some place, quite irrespective of any
international relations that might exist as between ourselves and that country. The use of
the term "International Affairs" would usually
mean as between two nations, ourselves and
somebody else; perhaps between England and
France, whereas we might want to deal with
either one. I think "Foreign Affairs" is much
better literally than "International Affairs".

SENATE DEBATES

referred to that committee. It takes the
emphasis off the name and places some
emphasis on the general nature of the matters
which should be referred to it. This is a complete change for us.
I would just like to say that as far as the
name of the committee is concerned, if it is
the wish of the Senate to make it "Foreign
Affairs", I would suggest that a motion be
moved to that effect. I have no quarrel with
calling treaties "International Agreements". I
do not see any merit in taking out "Foreign
Aid", because I do not care what they call a
department of Government if it has no bearing on the subject matter. We are talking
about foreign aid, and I do not know of any
term that would be any simpler or allembracing than "Foreign Aid". This relates to
our giving assistance outside of Canada.
However, I agree with the suggestion of
Senator Grosart that perhaps "International
Agreements" would be better than "Treaties".

SENATE DEBATES
The other reason for the committee acting
was to effect some condensation of the committees which had been previously set up,
and, in the course of their work, to allocate in
rather specific fashion, but with enough generality to cover the situation so that it will be
self-evident from this time on, if we adopt a
report of this nature, that if a bill is being
considered before this house there will no
longer be the screaming that has occurred
ever since I have been here, "Why not send it
to some other committee-everything goes to
the Banking and Commerce Committee?"
The core and the most important part of
this whole report is being overlooked. I think
that in giving our attention at some length to
the titles of this new committee structurewhich, to my mind, is the least important
aspect of our considerations-we are losing
sight of the work that has been done and the
intentions of the Senate that have been carried out so well by this special committee.
So that I will not be accused of taking too
long in talking about small subjects, I will
just state that I may be one of few opposed to
changing the name of the Committee on
International Affairs to something else. I
believe Senator Grosart suggested he had an
inkling that the Department of External
Aff airs would be known by some other name
in the future, perhaps the Department of
Foreign Affairs. I do not think that is any
reason why we should change the title. It still
does not make sense to me to change it when
I read on down in subclause 6, which commences with the words, "The Committee on
International Affairs," because the final sentence in that paragraph reads:
And other matters relating to foreign
and Commonwealth relations
generally,...
And then they are specified.
I think there is a great number of people in
this country who do not want to assume that
by any formal action a great many or even
some of the Commonwealth countries should
be put in exactly the same basket as all other
foreign countries. We do not treat Commonwealth countries, or all of them, the same
way as we treat foreign countries which are
in a completely different category. For example, when people from Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand and some other Commonwealth countries come to this country, they
do not have to be Canadian citizens, as I
understand it, in order to be able to be elected members of the House of Commons. So,
when we are talking about foreign countries I

November 7, 1969

do not think we should put Great Britain in
that category; neither do I think we should
put the other Commonwealth countries, such
as Australia and New Zealand, in that category. As long as there is a Commonwealth, I
would like to perpetuate some reference to it,
to underline the fact that there is a distinction in the minds of those of us who sit here
as between what we all understand, in the
back of our minds, is the meaning of "foreign" countries and "Commonwealth" countries.
The title, "The Committee on International
Affairs" is a general one and it covers my
grievance. Personally, I would be pleased if
we just left it as it is.
I make the same remark I made at the
begining. I think we are spending too much
time on titles, and are losing sight of the
great improvement there will be in the funetioning of the Senate in the future.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I should like to make it
clear that I agree with the philosophy behind
what Senator Smith (Queens-Shelburne) has
just said. No one is suggesting for one
moment that we are designating any Commonwealth country as a foreign country. This
is made clear in the phraseology of paragraph
6. Senator Phillips (Rigaud) has pointed out
that these matters relate to foreign and Commonwealth relations. A distinction is made
between a Commonwealth country, and a
country which is not a Commonwealth country or a country outside the Commonwealth.
We are not taking any step that has not been
already taken by a number of Commonwealth
countries, including the United Kingdom,
which has a Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs.
I want to make it clear that we are not
using the phrase "foreign affairs" to indicate
a departure from the tradition of the appellation we have extended to Commonwealth
countries. The phrase "foreign affairs" is a
general term, as is the phrase "international
affairs".
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Mr. Chairman, as one
who has made some suggestions for minor
changes, I would have to take exception to
Senator Smith's (Queens-Shelburne) phrase
"wholesale slaughter." He suggested that by
these amendments we were engaging in
wholesale slaughter.
Every one who has risen to speak on these
amendments has paid tribute to the committee, and I do not think any of us are losing
sight of the overall importance of the work

November 7, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

that has been done. I would not like to see go
without contradiction the suggestion that I or
anybody else in suggesting possible improvements mean, in any way, an offence to the
committee. I would point out to Senator
Smith (Queens-Shelburne) that if he feels as
strongly as he does about retaining the title
"International Affairs" rather than "Foreign
Affairs", he will have to be the first to suggest that the phrase "foreign aid" be amended, because it so happens that the bulk of our
so-called foreign aid goes to Commonwealth
countries.
I cite these matters to indicate to Senator
Smith (Queens-Shelburne) that the fact that
we suggest some changes is not meant as an
offence to the committee. Indeed, if we are
not going to suggest changes when we think
them applicable, then this whole exercise of
yesterday and today in Committee of the
Whole is useless.
I share with Senator Smith (Queens-Shelburne) his belief in the Commonwealth. I am
a Commonwealth man. I happen to be the
vice-chairman of the Canadian Branch of the
Commonwealth Parliamentary Association,
and if I saw any offence whatsoever to any
Commonwealth country in the change of
name proposed by Senator Martin, I would
oppose it as strongly as I could.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Hear, hear. So would I.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I think there is no
offence. In seconding Senator Martin's
motion, I had in mind the very fact to which
he has drawn attention, that this brings us
into line with the customs of other countries
whose affection for, and connection with, the
Commonwealth is every bit as great as ours.
If that were not the case, I would support
immediately the objection taken by Senator
Smith (Queens-Shelburne).
Hon. Mr. Smith (Queens-Shelburne): Mr.
Chairman, may I have the privilege of saying
to my friend Senator Grosart, that if it will
make him feel better I will withdraw the
phrase "wholesale slaughter" and substitute
for it the phrase "retail slaughter".

port its recommendations. As soon as such a
matter is on the floor of the house it is in a
state of flux, and every senator has the same
right to think it out and to be as satisfied as
the members of the committee themselves.
I have expressed my appreciation of this
committee. I hold it in great respect, but I
have not abdicated my right to think, or left
my thinking entirely to somebody else. In so
far as there is confusion between "foreign
affairs" and "Commonwealth relations" I
would point to the phraseology of the first
and governing sentence which reads, in part:
-and other matters relating to foreign
and Commonwealth relations generallyThere cannot be any confusion at all in the
minds of the people who will read this in the
future but that those matters are separate, or
that we had in our minds any hodgepodge of
the two.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Mr. Chairman, I have
been listening to the explanations of the difference between "international" and "foreign".
I think we know what "international aff airs"
means. It refers to arrangements between our
country and another country. But, when I
come to the phrase "foreign aff airs" I am not
so sure that I know what it means. For
instance, foreign aid is our own concern. We
decide what foreign aid we give. It may be
that "international" is a better word but I am
not sure, and I am inclined to leave it to the
experts here to say.
Subparagraph (vi) is "Territorial and
Offshore Matters". In paragraph 8, which I
did not see yesterday because this document
came to us rather late, there is "Navigation,
shipping, and navigable waters". It seems to
me that those two terms are almost
synonymous.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: No; it is "matters". We
discussed that. It is "matters", not "waters".

Hon. Mr. Kinley: It is "Territorial and
Offshore Matters". Well, does it make much
difference? Offshore matters would include
navigation, communications, and things of
that kind, and then we have "Navigation,

it would be considered by the Committee on

POVERTY
0F SPECIAL
MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT
COMMITrEE-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Tuesday, November 5, the adjourned debate on the motion of
the honourable Senator Croîl that a special
committee of the Senate be appointed to
investigate and report upon all aspects of
poverty in Canada.
Hon. Donald Cameron: Honourable senators,
I welcome the opportunity to participate in
this discussion. It seems that this topic of
poverty is receiving more and more attention
day by day in the press, on the radio and in
public speeches, so that Senator Croîl was
very much on the wave of the times when he
suggested that we have a full discussion on
the subject.
1 will begin by defining the meaning of the
termo "poverty" and then go on to relate poverty to a special aspect of living conditions
affecting between 25 per cent and 30 per cent
of our population.
It has been stated that in the period
between 1961-the last census-and 1980, the
urban share of Canada's national total population is expected to rise from 70 per cent to
over 80 per cent. This shift in population will
be more pronounced in the big cities with the
result that, by 1980, 60 per cent of all Canadians will live and work in some 29 major city
complexes. This projected increase in the
urban population by 1980 would be a very
severe straîn on the major cities, even if they
were models of efficiency and attractiveness,
which. they are not.
I do flot propose to go into the various
factors which today are making it impossible
for 25 per cent of our population to enjoy
decent housing, but the factors that go
to make up this complex problem are: a current deficiency of housing; traffic and transdecaying
pollution,
problems;
portation

neighbourhoods, poverty, social disturbances,
tax loads, and the frustrations of conflicting
areas of jurisdiction between provincial, federal and municipal governments. These problems are compounded by an anticipated
urban growth rate of 4 per cent per annum.
It is projected that we will need to build
750,000 new homes in the next four years,
and this growth rate will have to continue
beyond 1970, probably until 1980. In the same
period of time urban renewal and public
housing activity will require accelerated
action to prevent the economic and social
costs of poor housing and urban decay from
mounting very sharply and offsetting the net
gain from new housing.
It seems to me that there is something radically wrong with our scheme of values when
over 50 per cent of our wage earners do not
earn enough money to be able to qualify for a
National Housing Act boan. Surely we should
take a look at the road blocks that are in the
way of making it possible for so many of oui
lower-income people to own their own homes.
But ti this discussion today I do not want to
get into that phase of the argument. I want to
deal briefly with the enormous hidden costs
to our society of the prevalance of poverty in
the midst of affluence. I intend to stick fairly
closely to my notes because 1 shaîl be quoting
many people and some statistics.
It is for this reason I want to examine what
we mean when we talk about poverty, and to
try to translate that meaning into real flesh
and blood terms.
Poverty, according to Webster's dictionary,
is the condition of being poor or without
means; it means indigence or the want of
means of subsistence, or it may be defined as
being the quality or state of being deficient in
ail or any of these qualities or properties
which inake anything desirable or excellent.
It la synonymous with want, penury, indigence, need, pauperism, dearth or destitution.
In the period 1949 to 1968 the cost of housing increased by more than 56 per cent, and
the present annual increase in cost is more
than 4 per cent, but in spite of this we made
over 200,000 housing starts in the current
year. I want you to keep in mind, too, that in
January 1965 the average prîce o! homes in
metropolitan Toronto was $21,900 while today
it is over $30,000. Just the other day the task
force on housing was suggesting that the cefiing on home boans be raised to $35,000. To mie
it is meaningless; 50 per cent of the people
cannot afford the price.

SENATE DEBATES
These rapidly infiating costs are a challenge
to both Government and private enterprise
and I do not think we have been very
imaginative in finding solutions to the problems involved, but there are signs on the
positive side such as public land acquisition
and servicing, prefabrication and factory
built components, and so on. Obviously people
below the poverty line, $3,000 annual income
in some cases, $4,000 in others, just cannot be
interested in acquiring an average-cost home
in Toronto or anywhere else. This brings me
to what will be the main concern of this
address-the inter-relationship of poverty and
slums.
According to the Concise Oxford Dictionary
a slum is defined as an "overcrowded and
squalid back street or alley or district in a
city". Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary
defines a slum as "a highly congested area
marked by deteriorated unsanitary buildings,
poverty and social disorganization". Slums
may be rural as well as urban and is not
merely an area of bad housing but is also a
symptom of social malady.
There are other terms for a slum such as
blighted area, deteriorated neighbourhood,
grey area, lower class district or low income
area. Poverty, however it be measured or
defined, appears to have been the prime
cause of slums, rural or urban. Once they
have taken root their tendency is to spread,
their population changing as ambition, opportunity or misfortune dictates the movements
of citizens.
The cycle of economic movement begins
when residents can afford to move out of
cities to suburbs. Some return after their children have left home, but the return never
equals the exodus. Those who flee poorer districts are the ones who get better jobs, earn
more money, have the urge to "get on in
life". In United States cities they often
include those with less skin pigmentation.
Hunter in his book, Slums: Challenge and
Response says:
They are replaced in the city proper by
people of lower everything: social status,
income, occupational level, education and
future expectations.
The newcomers not only fill gaps in the
slums but establish themselves in "grey
areas"-districts on their way down composed
sometimes of larger houses, once the pride of
the well-to-do but later divided into apartments. There are many rows of closely-packed
one- or two-family dwellings interspersed

November 7, 1968

with such establishments as funeral parlours,
beauty salons, auto parts stores or bus depots,
second-hand stores, and greasy-spoon lunch
counters. These grey areas have a run-down
air; they are near the centre of cities, and by
a process of economic osmosis absorb the
blight and dejection of the slums they
surround.
Not only do people move from city centres,
but large manufacturing and distributing
firms-big taxpayers and employers-are in
the trek to suburbia. Those of you who drive
from the Royal York Hotel in Toronto to Malton Airport can see what has happened in the
last few years. Look at the large number of
manufacturing and business concerns whose
head offices have been moved all the way out
to Etobicoke. There is less money-especially
tax money-left in the city centres and in the
older parts of the city. Its core becomes victim of a downward spiral. Civic files fatten
with problems of blight, crime, declining
revenue and increasing outlays on police and
fire protection.
Charles Stokes, of the University of Bridgeport, speaks of "slums of hope" and "slums of
despair". The former serve as way stations
for people who are going somewhere. Those
in the "slum of despair" are at the end of the
line.
Of one such area in Boston, Hunter says:
"Boston's South End ... is a slum of

despair. On casual first impression it has
an air of rundown gentility. The second
impression is more real and lasting. It is,
in fact, an area where the social residue
lives; the old, poor, once wealthy, cast-off
Bostonians; shady characters; prostitutes
....

it is unlikely that most of the inhab-

itants of this type of slum will ever
leave, but movement into the area is
steady.
It bas been estimated that more than
twelve million persons live in urban slums in
the United States-as many as the combined
population of Sweden and Denmark.
Michael Harrington, in his book, The Other
America, notes:
"The 1960 (United States) census
reported that 15.6 million of the 58 million occupied dwelling units in the United
States were substandard. This represented 27 per cent of the nation's total housing supply. Of these, some 3,000,000 were

Nevertheless, despite all the qualifications that have to be made, there is a
clear indication that the shortage of
acceptable dwellings is some hundreds of
thousands. It cannot be put at less than
300,000 units. It may be judged to be
much more.

SENATE DEBATES
Poverty is the predominant characteristic
of the slums. Conditions have not changed
markedly since Charles Abrams wrote in
1946:
There is nothing mysterious about the
reasons the slums are still with us. Sometimes it is argued that people choose to
live in them out of the same perverseness
that impels an eccentric to take up lodgings in a tree or cave. The way these
slum families have taken to their new
surroundings in every city where public
housing was opened for occupancy should
be a sufficient answer. But the argument
persists.
The slums continue simply because
their inhabitants cannot afford good bousing and because private enterprise will
not supply it at prices they can afford.
In other words, they stay there because of
poverty.
We have noted that of Canada's 32 million
families in 1961, 756,882 were earning less
than $3,000. Whatever norm is used to measure poverty, it is reasonable to assume that
three-quarters of a million Canadian families
were poor at the time of the last census.
Many more were "deprived," a condition one
step higher on the economic ladder.
Hunter, thinking in terms of the United
States, commented in 1964:
Down around the $4,000 and below
family income level is real, indisputable
poverty. At this level it is possible to use
words like misery, defeat, terror and
chaos.. .The poor contribute very little in
terms of stimulation for economic
growth, intellectual leadership, scientific
or cultural creativity, and just plain good
citizenship. And yet there is no evidence
that such people, as a group, inherently
have less to offer than any other group.
The problem is that it is difficult for
human productivity to sprout from the
barren soil of poverty.
The slum is the locus of poverty, and
poverty is one of the potent forces that
maintains the vicious circle and makes it
so difficult for people to break out.
In considering the evils of poverty, there is
a regular chain of disintegration. In other
words, poverty leads to slums; slums lead to
overcrowding. In the matter of overcrowding, a house may be considered crowded if it
affords less than one room per person. At the
1961 census it was calculated that three quarters of a million dwellings in Canada were
crowded.

November 7, 1968

High densities, that is, the number of persons living in bouses or apartments per square
foot of ground measurement, are typical of
both slums and expensive areas. In the latter,
high density may be desirable in terms of
generating social relationships, variety in life,
interest and excitement deriving from many
people and activities, and a sense of society.
Well kept homes in crowded and affluent sections of our cities afford privacy, are quiet,
healthy and peaceful. In slums the converse is
true. High density there comes from the need
to find cheap housing; it means cramming too
many poor people into rooms in shabby
neighbourhoods without proper services for
cleaning, maintenance and repair.
Schorr writes that "study of animals bas
confirmed that illness and even death result
from crowding". He quotes Leonard Duhl in
his book, The Human Measure: Man and
Family in Megalopolis as follows:
Animals brought up in situations of
high density, incapable of eating, sleeping, or procreating without large numbers of other individuals being present,
have an increased incidence of a wide
variety of pathology... This finding in
animais confirms findings on input overload in human individuals and groups.
We must therefore protect ouselves as
much from over-stimulation as from isolation.
Hunter comments:
We still have a way to go in reducing
densities and overcrowding in slum areas.
Michael Harrington dramatized this by
pointing out that if the densities of some
of Harlem's worst blocks obtained in the
rest of New York City, the entire population of the United States could fit into
three of New York's boroughs.
On crime, Hunter writes, "the fact that
most crime originates in slums has been
known for a long time". He refers to "reasonable estimates" that in the slums which make
up about a fifth of the average United States
city's residential area occur 45 per cent of the
major crimes, 55 per cent of the juvenile
delinquency and half the total number of
arrests. On the origins of organized crime,
Gus Tyler had this to say:
Poverty breeds revolt-and where a
gang of youth is raised in poverty, it is
doubly destined to organize against the
outside world. To the struggle of young
versus old is added the further dimension
of poor versus rich. The world becomes

many things: the rich and the virtuous,
the cops and the courts, the folks on the
other side of the tracks or other side of
the street. The "they" represents money,
power, and the dress and manners that
go with these posts of status. The "they"
is a thing to imitate in burlesque, for to

62% of the adult arrests and 68% of the

The Ontario Division of the Community
Planning Association of Canada in its brief to
the Royal Commission on Canada's Economie
Prospects in 1956 noted that crime and delinquency had "all but disappeared" among residents of a slum area after they had moved to
the Regent Park (North) project in Toronto. It
had hopes that similar good results would
result from the clearance of a Montreal slum
district whose residents were to be moved
into public housing. The brief said of the

Concluding that "people in the slums are
sicker," Hunter notes that in late 1963 tuberculosis began a comeback especially in the
"disadvantaged areas" particularly among
children under the age of ten.
The Tax Drain: The same writer agrees
with other experts that "slums cost taxpayers
more money". Although difficult to prove
down to the last decimal point, he says, "the
basic truth is well established" that slums are
a serious drain on civic revenues. He quotes
studies made in the 1930s:
In Indianapolis, in a slum area of 1,500
population, health, crime and fire costs
totalled $92,775 as against property tax
revenues of $11,312-a net outflow of
$81,462.
In Cleveland, six slum census tracts
were analyzed. For this population of 22,000 the cost of direct services was $1,356,988, while the tax income, all of which
was not paid, was $225,035-a net cost of
$1,131,953.
A study by the Boston City Planning
Board in 1934 concluded that the business
district and high rental residential dis-

trict gave the city a large surplus; the
industrial and medium rent districts a
small one; the suburban district, with
detached houses, showed a small deficit;
and the low rent area showed a large
one-all of these studies are deficient to
some degree, in that completely unassailable methods of analysis and allocation of
costs have not yet been developed. But
methods are sound enough so that it can
be said confidently that slums are an economic drain on municipal resources.
The Ontario Division of the Community
Planning Association of Canada told the
Royal Commission on Canada's Economic
Prospects in 1956 that Canadians "seem unaware that the present existence of slum and
blighted areas in our midst involves a
prodigious economic and social cost". It spoke
of the fantastic waste of economic and human
resources involved in supplying protective
and social services to persons or families living in or near substandard areas.
In concluding this aspect of the discussion,
the same association warned of the serious
danger that urban renewal schemes may
ignore the "present residents of blighted
areas". Dr. Prince shares their fear:
Although urban renewal is an exceedingly complex subject involving economics and aesthetics, politics and sociology,
the ethics of urban renewal can be formulated in a very few words: Don't forget the people! This may seem trite to
those who, when they think of urban
renewal, equate it with better housing for
the poor. The point that should be
emphasized, however, is that the recent
interest in urban renewal springs largely
from economic, rather than humanitarian
concerns.
He comments that demolition may disperse
the labour and life savings of small shopkeepers, that the psychological effects of massive
destruction and uprooting may be "devastating". He urges that the economic interests of
dispossessed tenants must be protected, the
destruction of entire neighbourhoods "should
be kept to a minimum," and that special
funds should be applied to research into techniques of management of anomic urban areas.
Harrington speaks of the need to forge
neighbouring communities when residents are
moved into public housing from slums. He
says:

SENATE DEBATES
You cannot take people out of an oldfashioned slum, where reality has been
giving them a grim, distorted education
for years, place them in a project, and
expect them to exhibit all kinds of gentle, middle-class virtues. This transition is
a crucial moment. If the people are left to
themselves, then the chances are that
they will import the culture of poverty
into the public housing...
Many of the public-housing administrators are sincere and imaginative public
servants, but they have been frustrated
at every turn by the inadequacy of funds
and by the fact that the nation (the United States) has yet to make a real commitment to build a human environment... at
this writing one must sadly report that it
does not seem likely that there will be an
adequate crusade to end the misery of
the millions of Americans who live in
sub-standard housing. The figures have
all been tabulated; the reports are in; and
the direction of human advance is clear.
But, as the sixties open, there is not yet
the political will to get at the root of the
problem.
So the new form of the old slums will
continue; the inadequacies and tragedies
of our past public housing policy will
remain with us; and that tenacious
organism, the culture of poverty, will settle down comfortably in our urban rot.
Harrington rejects the idea that because
some public housing projects have not succeeded, the nation should not get involved in
the problem. Such a retreat would merely
lead to enlargement of the slums, he suggests.
Instead, determination and imagination are
needed.
He notes that the concerned citizen who
sees tenements torn down may be satisfied
because he does not know that the number of
new units built is less than the number of
tenements destroyed. Nor does he realize that
some slum-dwellers refuse to go into new
low-cost housing projects because of the violence and tendency towards juvenile crime
transplanted there from the old slum.
Harrington says criticisms of U.S. low-cost
projects "have too much of a tabloid simplicity". Many such projects have no violent gangs
but they do "tend to be huge, impersonal,
bureaucratie environments". This leads to
confusion and fear-"it is an enormous jump
from the teeming slum street to this modern
administered existence. Indeed, some of the

November 7, 1968

project dwellers are literally terrified at first
by their new advantages".
He urges that public housing be conceived
of as:
something more than improved physical
shelter with heat and plumbing. It must
be seen as an important organism for the
creation of community life in the cities...
public housing should avoid segregating the poor off in some corner of the
metropolis. That is the "modern poorfarm mentality," as one critic described
it. The projects and subsidized homes
should be located as parts of neighbourhoods, so that income groups, races and
cultures will mingle.
Canadian experience, as shown by appraisals of Toronto's Regent Park (North) completed in 1956, appear, in the view of the Ontario
division of the Community Planning Association, to have been happier. The organization's
brief to the Royal Commission on Canada's
Economic Prospects gave this "preliminary"
view after an assessment of the new project:
Crime and delinquency have all but
disappeared among the residents of the
new housing. The fire hazard has been
eliminated. There is some evidence that
the health of both adults and children has
improved, particularly among asthmatics
and post-tubercular patients. Children
appear to be progressing well in elementary school and are said by teachers to be
better clothed, more rested and more
regular in attendance. Mothers are more
fastidious in housekeeping and families
appear to be spending more on home furnishings and less on alcoholic beverages-in short, a relatively normal
healthful environment has been substituted for one of the acknowledged slum
areas in an older section of the city with
consequent social effects of profound
significance.
Subsidized housing in this instance had
apparently given slum dwellers enough of a
head start on their economic difficulties to
enable them to overcome the slum psychology
which, together with iron poverty, is the
main evil social workers have to eradicate in
slums.
In conclusion, poverty and the effects of
poverty are among the most costly elements
of our modern society. All authorities are
agreed that poverty is the main cause of slum
conditions in both rural and urban communities. In urban communities, in particular,

SENATE DEBATES

Canadian Farm Loan Board, and there was
great demand on the Progressive Conservative
government of the day to bring in a new act
to provide for more credit, particularly more
long-term credit. The government had promised to do so. It had already brought in two
other farm bills, the Crop Insurance Act
and the Farm Improvement Loans Act, which
we discussed only last week.
The Farm Credit Act was introduced in the
fall of 1959. It took over the assets of the
Canadian Farm Loan Board and set up a corporation known as the Farm Credit Corporation, which commenced business in October,
1959. The original capital of the Farm Credit
Corporation was $8 million and the interest
rate for loans was 5 per cent. The act was
amended from time to time until the capital
reached $40 million. Bill C-110 would increase that capital to $56 million. It will
give the corporation the power to borrow and
lend 25 times that amount, or $1,400 million
plus the original $56 million of capital, and
that money is to be provided by the Minister
of Finance for the purposes set out in the act.
The Government lends the money to the
corporation; that is different from the way
the money is obtained under the Farm
Improvement Loans Act. Under that act the
banks lend the money, whereas in this case
the money is lent to the corporation and the
corporation lends it to the farmers.
The chief objection to the bill and to the
act as a whole, as it will stand if these
amendments are made, is that under clause 5
the interest rate of 5 per cent is repealed. No
new rate is set by the bill, nor is there any
formula in the bill stating how the new rate
will be arrived at. However, there is this
difference: when we were dealing with the
Farm Improvement Loans Act we tried to
find out what the formula would be, but we
could not get the Government to commit
itself and tell us how the rate would be
arrived at. In this case we have the assurance
of the minister in the other place, and of the
sponsor of this bill here, that the rate will be
not more than 1 per cent above the cost of
the money to the Minister of Finance. That,
in my opinion, is very much more satisfactory
than having to depend on things as they stood
when we were considering the other bill. In
fact, the last loan to the corporation was
6a per cent made on October 1, 1968.

November 12, 1968

Finance, how do they differentiate between
one borrower and another when considering
the cost of the money?

Hon. Mr. Aselline: Every person applying
for a loan to the Farm Credit Corporation
will get the money at the same rate. Senator
Everett, the sponsor of the bill, told us that
many loans have been made and that the
$1,040,000,000 which was available to the corporation will be more than used up when the
current applications have been taken care of,
and hence the necessity for the increase in
capital.
Honourable senators, another mild objection that I have to the manner in which the
money will be loaned is one which I may deal
with here later in my remarks or when the
bill is considered in committee. The objection
is that a large number of $100,000 loans may
be made under this bill to corporations and
others. In that event, this increase in capital
and available money to be loaned will not last
very long. I hope that the number of large
loans will be kept as low as possible and that
each loan will be kept to a reasonable
amount.
Honourable senators, the other objection I
have to the legislation is that small farms as
such have practically disappeared. The number of family farms is fewer in number and is
being reduced every year. When this bill is
passed, the small farms and family farms will
be replaced by corporate farms, co-operative
farms and possibly co-operative family farms.
To illustrate what bas been going on, I
would like to refer honourable senators to the
annual report of the Farm Credit Corporation
for the year 1967-68. I read from page 7 of
that report as follows:
Reacting to economic pressures which
have been growing rapidly, particularly
since the mid 1950s, farmers who intend
to stay in farming are expanding and
improving their farm businesses. In contrast, an even greater number of those on
smaller farms are making the choice
against farming. The number of farms
with annual farm product sales of less
than $5,000 decreased by more than 100,000 or over 30 per cent between 1961 and
1966. In the same period the number of
farms with sales of over $10,000 increased
by over 45,000 or more than 90 per cent.
These larger farm businesses, numbering

SENATE DEBATES
Another matter that I wish to mention has
to do with the question raised by Senator
Thorvaldson with regard to gift taxes. The
gift taxes at rates of 10 to 28 per cent are
repealed. The new rates are 15 to 75 per cent.
In my opinion, that amounts almost to
confiscation.
I said a while ago that in Alberta and Saskatchewan much of the capital was leaving
the country. In an attempt to prevent that,
the Province of Alberta has passed a bill
doing away with its share of the estate tax.
Moreover, the Premier of Saskatchewan has
promised that in the next sitting of the legislature Saskatchewan will do the same thing.
That will bring a great deal of relief to people in Alberta and Saskatchewan. The premiers of those two provinces claim that the
estate taxes, as they were-and now they will
be worse-were responsible for a great deal
of capital leaving the country. They think
that under the new formula this capital will
remain at home.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Also, the people are
leaving the country.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Yes-I thought I mentioned that. When these small farmers sold
their farms, either they moved into the cities
or left the country and took their money with
them.
I was quite pleased to hear the sponsor of
the bill conclude his remarks with these
words. He said:
I wondered, when I looked at the
amendments proposed to the Estate Tax
Act and to the gift tax sections of the
Income Tax Act, which struck me as
making the passing on of a farm from
generation to generation very difficult,
whether the Government has realized
that, on the one hand, it is saying it is
encouraging a farmer to pass on from
generation to generation, and to see that
it grows, and, on the other hand, it is
erecting an almost insurmountable barrier against that in the form of gift taxes
and estate taxes.

November 12, 1968

take it over and carry it on without losing
such a large portion of its value to estate
taxes and/or gift taxes.
Honourable senators, there is no incentive
now for anyone to try to build up an estate of
any size. All incentive of that kind is gone
with the wind. As a result of the amendments
referred to, most estate planning is out of
date and new planning will have to be done.
Also most wills will have to be redrawn. The
new era in taxation will be hard on the taxpayer, but will inure to the benefit of chartered accountants, estate planners and
lawyers.
I will have more to say on that when the
Budget bills come to us for consideration.

Pursuant to an order of the day, the Senate

Committee on the Rules of the Senate.
Hon. Alan Macnaugh±on in the Chair.
The Chairman: Honourable senators, when
the committee rose last Thursday, November
7, paragraph 1 of proposed new rule 78, subsection 1, subparagraph 6, was under discussion. The Committee of the Whole had just
voted to change the name to "The Senate

of the subparagraph, however, still remains
to be dealt with. Senator Molson?
Hon. Mr. Molson: Mr. Chairman, with respect to item (i) of subparagraph 6, the suggestion was made by Senator Roebuck that the
wording should be changed to "Treaties and

motion to that effect, I think the committee
would welcome it because there is no recommendation otherwise with regard to item (i)
of subparagraph 6.

Ever since the Budget came down this very

Hon. Mr. McDonald: Mr. Chairman, I wonder if you would refer to the items by Roman

I would call the attention of the Senate to
the fact that among the committees in existence before any amendments to the Rules
were made, was the Comrnmittee on Immigration and Labour. That committee has apparently met only once since 1963. So, the subject matter under the heading of "Immigration", which is brought before the Senate for
consideration, is not of large volume.

Hon. Mr. Croll: Mr. Chairman, I would like
to hear an explanation from the chairman as
to why Immigration was included in Foreign
Affairs. It seems to me that this subject is
about as far removed from Foreign Affairs as
one could possibly measure. In my view the
matter of immigration is very much more an
internal matter than a part of foreign affairs,
and I would like to hear the explanation.

young men from Poland under the Commonwealth Air Training Program, she and one of
the Polish flyers became friendly, and later
became engaged. The flyer after the completion of his training returned to England to
take his part in the defence of that country.
After the war this young lady wanted to
bring him to Canada in order to marry him.
I went to Mr. King who, as all honourable
senators know, was unmarried, and therefore,
I presume had some of that chivalry that we
old married men had unfortunately lost, and
be understood her position perfectly. The law
was changed, and women were given the
same right as men of bringing their fiance to
Canada. I wrote to the young lady and told
her the good news, but I received no reply.
Some months later I was sitting in my
office when the father of the young lady came
in, wiping his brow. It was a hot July day.
He was tremendously worked up, and be
said: "You know that flyer who is coming to
Canada to marry my daughter? Well, he is
here." I said, "That's good. What of it?" He
replied, "My daughter bas another beau.
What is going to happen now?" I laughed,
and said, "What is that to you? We bring up
a child, and when she gets to marrying age
we are not even consulted in the matter of
her marriage. All you have to do is to sit
back and let the best man win." I sent him
away pretty well satisfied. Not long after the
flyer arrived, and he was told that his fiancée
had another beau whom she liked better than
she liked hlm. He said, "What of it? There
are lots of other girls." That was that.
A few months later I attended the funeral
of the father, and there I saw the flyer with
his new girl, and my client with her new
husband, and they were the best of friends. I
could go on to tell you much more about
them, but that would concern persônal
matters.
I apologize for reminiscing, but that story
is interesting and right in point. It illustrates
the fact that when an immigrant arrives in
Canada be is no longer the concern of foreign
affairs; be is the concern of local affairs. In
my opinion, to indicate that fact in the rules
for years to come, the proper forum for the
discussion of matters relating to immigrants
is the Committee on Health, Welfare and
Science. Immigrants come under welfare, and
immigration comes under foreign affairs. It
seems to me that would be a complete answer
to what both Senator McDonald and Senator
Croll have said. It is also the position I took
29234-311

when we were discussing this matter some
time ago.
When we come to paragraph 11, I hope
somebody will move that the word "Immigrants" will be added as (vi). That, I think,
should satisfy everyone.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: You would leave "(v)
Immigration" in paragraph 6 without change?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, This would make it
clear that immigrants are not included in
Immigration.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: I do not know whether
it is because of the honourable senator's pronunciation or my hearing, but he seemed to
refer always to "emigrant" instead of
"immigrant".
You did mean "immigrant" did you not?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Of course, I did. If I
made that mistake, I apologize for it. I understand the difference.
Hon. G. Percival Burchill: Honourable
senators, my object in rising is to remind
Senator Croll that at the time the Immigration and Labour Committee of this chamber
was so active was just after the last war
when its chairman was Senator Wilson, whom
we all respected and regarded so highly. She
accomplished some wonderful work as chairman of that committee. Whether a committee
is active or not depends very much upon who
is its chairman.
My feeling is that whatever we do later on
with immigrants, we should leave Immigration where it is.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Hear, hear.
Hon. David A. Croll: Honourable senators,
I was a member of the other place in 1946
when this house was dealing with immigration, but we knew of the amount of work that
was being done. I should like to point out
that Senator McDonald, when he said that the
Czechoslovakian situation was handled under
foreign affairs, was mistaken. Anything that
was done was done through the department of Immigration. They carried out the
work that had to be done in another land.
They had to get permission, or whatever was
required, from the Secretary of State for
External Affairs. Despite the compromise that
is offered, I think it is a mistake to put "Immigration" where it is.
I should like also to remind the committee
that last year the Joint Committee on Immigration, of which I and other senators were

too important a matter to be left unallocated.
It is one of the really important matters we
have to deal with in this country; to us,
immigrants are the very life blood of our
existence.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Then, are we to accept
the compromise?
Hon. Mr. Croll: No. Senator Molson thought
it might be left in the air.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: I was referring to
Senator Roebuck's suggestion. Perhaps I
might be permitted to add this comment to
what I have already said. To snatch Immigration from its international context is to strip
it of all its true meaning. Immigration into
Canada creates emigration from another
country and hence becomes international
affairs. My suggestion is to leave it there and
accept the compromise suggested by Senator
Roebuck.
Hon. Mr. Carter: Honourable senators, I
think this is a problem that can be easily
solved. I agree with Senator Croll and others
that one of the purposes of revising the rules
is to make sure that the workload is shared as
evenly as possible among the standing committees. To insure that, I think it is desirable
to list the duties of committees whenever possible. Immigration policy is certainly an aspect
of our foreign policy. It is part of our foreign
policy to determine what ratios, percentages
or quotas of people we will admit into Canada, and once that policy has been decided by
the Secretary of State for External Affairs the
mechanics of carrying out the policy is undertaken by the Department of Manpower and
Immigration. I do not see why we cannot
make that distinction in our rules by simply
putting "Foreign Aspects" in brackets after
"immigration", and if you want to make it
doubly clear add "Citizenship and Immigration" to No. 11.

treaties made overseas with some countries,
but that we also think of that period which
Senator Croll mentioned, the five-year period
before they come out of immigrant status and
become citizens of Canada.
This applies to a number of facilities which
are divided across Canada. I am thinking
of such things as provisions for health, welfare and language training. I, like Senator
Croll, feel that the whole source of the vitality of Canada is really the kind of people we
are bringing into this country.
I accept the fact that we do make treaties
in certain cases. The world is aware of who
are the receiving countries of immigrants,
and those who do not want immigrants, but I
say that in relation to Canada this is really a
small part of the whole spectrum of immigration. There is the aspect of the influence it
has on the economy and on the procedures
with respect to language courses, and so on. I
personally have some reluctance to see immigration split up between what takes place
overseas and what takes place when immigrants get to Canada. However, if that is the
compromise, I am quite happy with it. I
would hate to think we are just making this
another item on the agenda so it will not be
forgotten. I would hope the Senate would take
an active part in examining immigration
which is so vital to our nation.
Hon. Mr. Molson: I wonder if Senator
Roebuck would like the term "new Canadians" put in that later section, because once
these persons arrive here and they are under
the auspices of the Department of Immigration we like to forget they are immigrants.
They then become new Canadians.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I do not think they become
new Canadians; they become Canadians.

SENATE DEBATES

The word "incongruous" might sum up the
consensus of the discussion as I heard it,
although I am not suggesting that there was
any formal meeting of the Science Policy
Committee. Neither am I expressing views
that were agreed to by all members that committee. That would not be fair. I -am merely
saying that my understanding of the consensus of the informal discussion was that the
members of the Science Policy Committee felt
the same way as the Chairman of the Committee on Rules has indicated Senator Lamontagne felt when he discussed the matter with
him.
I do not see any particular point in my
making an issue of it at this time, largely
because the Science Policy Comimittee is continuing its work as a special committee of the
Senate.
I appreciate the suggestion by the chairman, that, if it would make members happier,
the word Science might be moved up. On
the other hand, it seems to me that Health
and Welfare is a very important subject, and
I would not want to suggest that science
should particularly take precedence. If I may
just register the viewpoint of some of the
members of the Science Policy Committee
and say that perhaps in due course, if the
work of that committee reaches the point
where it seems appropriate to have a standing committee of the Senate to deal with
Science Policy, then that committee might so
report.
I think the reason for this feeling on the
part of so many members of the Science Policy Committee is that witness after witness
has said to us that we are doing a job that
has never been done in Canada before. I
think there is no entity in Canada that has
ever brought forth the extensive type of evidence that has been brought forth before this
committee, and some of the top minds in the
field of science in Canada have urged that the
committee should carry on its work because
the problems in Science Policy and its input
into government decision-making are so great
today that there is every likelihood, and I
would almost say certainty, that they will
continue. I say that because the chairman of
that committee is not here at the moment,
and I think he would expect some member of
the committee to put that view before this
committee at this time.

Hon. Mr. Grosart: I do not quite understand
the question, because if I in any way implied
that I was putting the committee ahead of anybody, then I must have said something I did
not intend to say. I do not think I said anything of that nature. I hope I was not
immodest in calling attention to the work of
the committee. I was doing it really as a
tribute to the chairman rather than to any
other members. In direct reply to the question, the answer of course is "No", because
the Science Policy Committee and the National Research Council, or the Science Council,
if you like, or the Science Secretariat, or
other bodies, are not in competition with each
other. Therefore, there is no reason for me to
put the Committee on Science Policy ahead of
any government body such as the National
Research Council. It will be obvious, I
believe, in the course of time that the work of
the National Research Council will be
referred to in terms of the very highest praise
by our committee.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There is a clause in the
Judicature Act which says that when the
rules of common law and equity conflict, the
rules of equity shall prevail. I would say here
that when science conflicts with humanity,
the rules of humanity shall prevail. For that
reason I am satisfied to leave the matter as it
stands. This chamber, I think, has a different
approach to matters of this kind from what it
had in the long past. I think we are credited
today with a humanitarian aspect that may
not have been the case 50 years ago when we
were thought to be the protectors of the big
interests and so on. Today we have done so
much work in connection with human affairs
that I would like to see Health and Welfare
take precedence over almost everything else.
With regard to aging, Senator Molson has
said that they have a long list of subjects that
are not included in these Roman numeral
paragraphs. I personally would like to see
that list because, honourable senators, the
longer a list of that kind we have, the more
notice we give to the people of Canada of our
Interest in the matters which may be troubling them. I do not think there is any objection to having long lists of subjects. Therefore, I am quite satisfied to accept Senator
Croll's suggestion that we put in "Aging"
because that is one of the things in which we
have played a real part in the past, and we
should play a part in it in the future.

Hon. Mr. McDonald: I do not think they do.
My experience with people coming into western Canada, not only recently but in the very
early days, has been that they have objected
very strongly to being referred to as immigrants. Many of them have felt that when
they came to this country they had come to a
new life in which they would not be looked
upon as a different type of person from the
immigrant who came 10, 50 or a hundred
years before. I am just wondering if the word

word "Immigrants", I do know that the sooner a person who comes to this country from a
foreign land can get away from the status of
"immigrant" or from being called an immigrant, the better he likes it. In other words, I
am not saying there is a stigma attaching to
the word "immigrant", nevertheless they do
want to get away from that description.
My next point is this, that after an immigrant becomes a citizen of this country, he
becomes a citizen of the community, the

SENATE DEBATES

municipality or city, and the province in
which he lives; and only finally does the federal Government really have much jurisdiction over the immigrant, as such, having
become a resident of this country. Consequently, I wonder just what we mean when
we say we should put the word "Immigrants"
under the heading of the Committee on
Health, Welfare and Science. The interest
that the federal Government takes in the
immigrant, once he settles here, is infinitesimal compared to the fact that he becomes
adopted in his community and province and
is subject to the social welfare laws of the
municipality, city and province. He has no
contact as such in his daily life with the Government of Canada. Consequently, I see no
reason why we should burden these committees with affairs that are really no part of
their business.

in Montreal and died by the thousands from
typhoid fever and the plague. They were also
corrupted by the people of this country at
that time. That was a terrible episode in the
history of our country. I want this house to
bear in mind the fact that when someone
arrives here he is no longer under the
Foreign Affairs department. He is looked
after by the welfare people, and we should
take an interest in his welfare. If we had
today such conditions as existed a hundred
years ago we would be very much concerned
indeed. I am certain that in such circumstances the Welfare department would be on
the job with plenty of supplies.
It is those people about whom I am concerned-the immigrants, people who arrive
here and who are still considered immigrants,
and talked about as such for some little time
after their arrival. They are denizens of
Canada.

entry of immigrants into Canada. I like to
think that we have a special interest in these
people who chose Canada for their future
home, and that if there are problems connected with their assimilation into Canada before
citizenship, there would be a committee of
the Senate with special concern on their
behalf.
Hon. Mr. Evereti: Mr. Chairman, it seems
to me that we are trying to establish
standing committees that have expertise in
particular subjects. To divide a subject
between two committees means that there is
not as much expertise as there would be
available to one committee concentrating on
one subject.
For that reason I do not think it is wise to
talk about immigration as a matter of foreign
policy, and immigration as a matter of health
and welfare. I suggest that we need one committee that is expert in the whole field of
immigration. Therefore, it is my opinion that
the amendment should be left in its present
form, and that immigration should be under
the aegis of one committee, namely, the
Foreign Affairs Committee.

Hon. Senators: Question.

Hon. Mr. Davey: Mr. Chairman, I have
been sitting here all this afternoon, and I am
not perfectly clear on the last vote. I understand it was defeated, but I am not sure what
was defeated.
The Chairman: I think I can explain that.
It was proposed that the word "Immigrants"
be added as item (viii) to subparagraph 11.
Hon. Mr. Davey: Then I would return to
the point raised by Senator Roebuck. Was
this not conditional upon the discussion we
had when dealing with immigration in paragraph 6 (v)? It was my understanding that
the discussion at that time was dependent
upon the inclusion of Immigration in paragraph Il. Am I wrong in that?
Hon. Mr. McDonald: You are right.
The Chairman: There is no doubt the discussion implied that, but I do not think the
chair and the committee meant by implication
that we would so deal with it.
Hon. Mr. Davey: In paragraph (6), did we
let that stand as "Immigration" or did we
change it to "Emigration"?
The Chairman: It stands as "Immigration".
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: On the understanding
that "immigrants" should be under Welfare.
Hon. Mr. Phillips (Rigaud): I do not know
whether I am in order, but I should like to
support the honourable Senator Davey, in
that I think there was an implied commitment to Senator Roebuck that there would be
included in pararaph 11 some reference to
the subject-matter of immigration. I am not
clear whether there was agreement that the
actual word "immigration" be inserted, but
there is no doubt in my mind that there was
a commitment that something be inserted to
deal with immigrants after they had landed
in Canada. In order to cover what I believe to
be such a commitment, I should now like
formally to move the addition of a subheading. Following a suggestion I made earlier, I
move that the subheading read: "Canadians
awaiting citizenship".

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Then, I think we should
return to the previous section in respect of

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I rather take exception
to the thought that consent has to be given,
Mr. Chairman. A senator has a perfect right,
even after we have rejected "immigrants", to
make another motion for another word
instead of "immigrants". It is a substantive
motion.
The Chairman: The question is not an easy
one and I am suggesting that this second
motion almost negatives the first.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Oh no.
The Chairman: Perhaps it would be helpful
to the Chair if we could have a little argument on the point.

The Chairman: Is it agreeable

Hon. Mr. Moison: Would a heading of

have health and welfare, and social and cultural matters. Would social, cultural and
"post-immigration matters" have any virtue?
The Chairman: I have a motion before me
and unless there is some objection to it I
suggest that the motion be put to the committee now and we try and reach a decision. It is
moved by Senator Phillips (Rigaud), seconded
by Senator Davey, that "Canadians awaiting
citizenship" be added as item No. (viii) under
subparagraph 11. Those in favour of the said
amendment will please say, content.
Some Hon. Senators: Content.
The Chairman: Those against will please
say, non-content.
Some Hon. Senators: Non-content.

The Chairman: Would you please proceed.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I am in the fullest possible agreement with Senators Roebuck, Davey
and Phillips (Rigaud) about the importance of
the fullest possible recognition being given to
immigrants, whatever they may be called,
but I am opposed to adding "Canadians
awaiting citizenship" to this particular clause.
I think it is unnecessary. We can go on forever adding people who might come under the
purview of this Committee on Health, Welfare and Science. I would suggest for the
consideration of those who are in favour of
this that we are possibly discriminating
against immigrants or Canadians waiting citizenship by singling them out as people who
will be given special consideration by this
committee. Of course, they will be given consideration by the Committee on Health, Welfare and Science. The question has a reason as
to whether an undertaking has been given, so
may I quote the words, Mr. Chairman? May I
respectfully suggest that you call for orderThe Chairman: Order please!
Hon. Mr. Grosari: -because I think it is
important that the whole committee be
reminded of Senator Molson's words. I think
he was incorrectly reported in his opening
sentence. He said, "Mr. Chairman, I do not
think he did make that suggestion." That does
not sound like Senator Molson's words. He
probably said, "I think he made that suggestion," but I leave that to him. In any event,
referring to what Senator Roebuck had had to
say, Senator Molson commented:
He suggested that it be split, that the

committee, and that the external aspect
go to another.

SENATE DEBATES

At 8 p.m. the sitting was resumed.
POVERTY
MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL
COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday,
November 7, the adjourned debate on the
motion of the honourable Senator Croll that a
special committee of the Senate be appointed
to investigate and report upon all aspects of
poverty in Canada.
Hon. John J. Kinley: Honourable senators,
when we rise to speak we usually address the
members of the Senate, but I would now like
to take this first opportunity to salute his
Honour the Speaker and to congratulate him
on being appointed presiding officer of the
Senate. He came to us from the Commons
where he had a successful career, including a
period as a Minister of the Crown. We have
now seen him in action and we know that he
will perform his functions successfully and
that he will make a great Speaker. We also
know that the Government made an excellent
appointment.
I would also like to extend my greetings to
the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Flynn). We have already learned that he is a
very friendly and competent man, and I
know that he will uphold the traditions of his
party in this chamber. We wish him well, and
we hope that he will long continue to be with
us in the Senate.
With regard to our leader, the Honourable
Paul Martin, he was an associate of mine in
the Commons. He early became prominent as
a member of that house. He was appointed to
the Cabinet and eventually became Secretary
of State for External Affairs, in which capacity he performed great services. I think that
he led us through many difficult situations
during his term as Secretary of State for
External Affairs. He comes to the Senate
highly recommended, and we know that he
will make a great chief in this chamber. I had
the pleasure of being with him at the United
Nations, where he had great influence, and he
attracted the attention of that assembly to a
greater extent than one would expect would
the representative of a small country like
Canada. I came away from the United
Nations with the impression that he was one
of our great Canadians.
With so many of our leaders being immortalized by having their pictures painted and
hung on the walls of this building-I attended
two such ceremonies only recently-it seems

to me that we should break with precedent
and have Paul Martin's picture painted and
hung in the hall outside this chamber, so that
those of future generations who will come in
their thousands every day will be able to see
the likeness of a man who has been prominent in the Government of this country.
We are also in the process of becoming
acquainted with our new Clerk. He is following an illustrious predecessor, John MacNeill,
who las now retired after distinguished service. From what we have already seen of our
new Clerk, we are led to believe that he will
be equal to his task and that he will perform
with modesty, quietly but efficiently. We wish
him well.
Honourable senators, the resolution before
the Senate is a product of the fertile mind of
the honourable Senator Croll. He has an
excellent reputation within and without Parliament. He has always been doing good work
for his people, and he is now running true to
form, because this resolution is one that is
timely and good. He wants to extend social
justice, and that is what people are thinking
about at the present time.
I do not like this word "poverty". It does
not appeal to me, for a reason about which I
shall say something later, but it has attracted
the attention of the richest country in the
world. The United States regards it as a problem, and we have gone to the extent of saying that it is a serious problem. It is a problem
that must be solved, because everybody talks
about it. For myself, coming from the Maritime provinces which are supposed to be
second-class provinces and in need, the word
"poverty" is hateful.
A few weeks ago my grandchildren visited
me, and I took them down to the basement to
show them some works of men in concrete
and metals; to show them some examples of
work that was done by hand. I came across a
plaque which looked like something that
might have been put up by a nation to enthuse
the people. It may have come from the old
Parliament buildings here after they were
destroyed by fire during the war. However,
the motto on this stone plaque was "Industry,
Intelligence, and Integrity". I think that that
is a splendid theme for this special committee
on poverty.
We are proud of the position of our country
among the nations of the world, and we
should approach this problem with a feeling
of strength. Of course, no one knows the cure
for poverty. Even the honourable sponsor of
this motion says that he has no cure to sug-

SENATE DEBATES
gest, and it will be very difficult for the committee to find a cure.
Senator Fergusson, in her very optimistic
speech, summed up some of the things that
have been done by governments in this century. It is certain that more has been done
during this century than ever before. I liked
what she said because, having been in public
life for about 50 years, it seemed to me that I
was present when those things took place. It
made me feel that during that time I was able
to be of some service to the people.
We have heard excellent speeches from
many members of this house. Each told a
story to the effect that the condition in which
we find ourselves can be attributed to other
and surrounding conditions. I listened to
Senator MacKenzie's speech with much
interest. I could not hear it all, but I read it
afterwards, and it is my opinion that he made
a valuable and balanced survey of the whole
subject. He is a Nova Scotian and I thought
we should get a very balanced appraisal from
him. He told us an interesting story of the
early days of Nova Scotia. His father was a
minister who received only a small salary. He
said they had no amenities and that their life
then was not what people expect at the present time. What people now call poverty, we
in Nova Scotia at that time did not think of
as poverty. Many lived in need; we were all
alike and we were all happy.
I was born in Nova Scotia too. My parents
had nine children. My father was a deep-sea
fisherman, and later became a master mariner. My mother was a schoolteacher. We had
few amenities. We had a big washtub by the
kitchen stove in which on Saturday nights she
scrubbed us all. We got hot water from the
kitchen stove. She said that cleanliness was
next to Godliness, and I think that is an
excellent philosophy to which the committee
should give some thought. We must clean up
the slums; we must clean the homes. Until
they are clean we will not be happy; until
they are clean we can do very little with
them.
In my day people were poor, but to some
of us this was not poverty. The insane were
sent to the county home, but the duty of
children towards their parents was strongly
felt. The children usually looked after their
parents when they got old and they all lived
in the same place. Nowadays everyone wants
a house of his own, and the situation is
becoming difficult.

November 12, 1968

hard to find somebody who would accept charity. They had an independence, which all of
us like. Independence comes from work. What
we are comes from what our forefathers did,
from their faith and their work. The fact that
we are part of the country, that we believe
the faith and work of our fathers lives still is
one of the big things that makes us happy
and successful.
Senator MacKenzie said that the teachers
were good in Nova Scotia in his time. My
mother was a teacher there a hundred years
ago, so I am glad he said the teachers were
good. There were ten of us around the table
at every meal and my mother had a difficult
job. As we go along I feel that the family is
the bulwark of the nation; the family is the
place where children are started, where they
get their faith, where they get their first education. My mother believed in the philosophy
of Dickens as expressed in David Copperfield.
If I may paraphrase: If you earn a dollar and
spend a dollar and a quarter you are in trouble, but if you earn a dollar and a quarter
and spend a dollar you may be happy.
I think that high living and too much luxury can destroy a nation. The decline and fall
of most nations of the world has resulted
from too much luxury and ease, not because
of poverty.
The late Governor General Vanier was a
happy warrior concerned about the sanctity,
development and preservation of the family,
and he formed a committee in Canada for
that purpose. The work of that committee
continues and we could well try to get that
committee to help the proposed committee of
Parliament.
When I was a boy at school I used to recite
a little poem by Ross, written over a hundred
years ago. Two of its lines read:
The hand that rocks the cradle
Is the hand that rules the world

I think that is still true. The home is the
place where citizens start to be strong.
Women have a tremendous influence; they
are a great force in this country and then
should be engaged as much as they can be, in
bringing up the family and making them good
citizens.
We talk of social justice, a "just society"
and that sort of thing. Some speak of it now
as something that should be done in a minute,
Although people were relatively poor, in others feel it should be done in a short time.
the town where I lived, it would have been That has been the desire of people for gener-

ations, even in Holy Writ. We are told in
Chapter 6, Verse 8 of Micah:
He hath shewed thee O man what is
good and what doth the Lord require of
thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy
and to walk humbly with thy God.
Then again I remember seeing on the wall
of the court house in Lunenburg, which was
remodeled, the beautiful motto under the British coat of arms:
Fiat justitia, ruat coelum
which, if I may interpret, means "Let justice
be done though the heavens fall."
Let us consider also the wording of the
Oath of Allegiance which is taken in the
United States of America:
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic
for which it stands, one nation under
God, indivisible, with liberty and justice
for all.
This has been the idea for generations. It is
like the star by which the mariner must be
guided if he is to be safe and reach his destination. We should have something like that. It
may be something that we cannot do at the
moment, but which we will achieve in the
end. We can offer our people an opportunity
to improve their place in life, something they
should strive for. That is what we will be
trying to do in this committee.
Senator Cameron made a point in his
speech about the number of poor people and
their difficulties and what it would cost to
maintain them. I agree with him. He dealt
with education; he is a great believer in it.
Honourable senators, I read in the Toronto
Globe and Mail yesterday that Dr. Deutsch,
the former Chairman of the Economic Council
of Canada said:
Universities have become essential to survival and prosperity, because 'knowledge,
not natural riches, not territory, is now
the real basis of well-being and power in
the world.'
About 45 years ago I was a member of the
Nova Scotia Government and I was also a
member of the council for public instruction.
We had to select the superintendents for the
province. A young professor from Boston came
to Nova Scotia seeking a job. He gave a lecture at the school for the blind. He defined
education as "the ability to survive". I
thought it was a strange definition of education, but as time went on I believe it was
true.

This is what Dr. Deutsch has told us, and it
is true. We know that the nation which will
survive will find its strength in education.
Last Thursday I attended a luncheon of the
Voluntary Committee on Health of the Senate
and House of Commons, which was addressed
by Dr. Unwin, Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at McGill University.
In discussing his subject, "Hazards of
Youth-Hippies and Drugs," he said that children today in their tender years spend more
time looking at television programs than they
would in college, and that that had a great
influence. He also said, with regard to drugs,
that the much discussed marijuana was not a
narcotic, but could be classed with alcohol as
a menace. He said, too, that there was a very
small percentage of young people who were
of the hippie type, or were dissipated.
However, things seem to be changing and we
see unrest in universities. Very often the
professors have queer ideas and the problem
of "youth" is becoming more serious. But, we
are told, this is not because of poverty.
We are told all men are born equal. Certainly, they are born equal in ignorance and
dependence. It is natural that people want to
be superior; this comes from effort and
achievement, and what we should strive for is
equal opportunity. In the race, of course, some
will falter but that is what is bound to happen in a free country. Yes, all men are born
equal, but care and enlightenment come from
the parents in the home, continue through
childhood and are strengthened by experience
that children get in education. But as students
they are still dependent on others, either
their parents, or the state or their friends. At
this stage they lack experience, and so it
seems to me that they should be more grateful for what they receive.
Today, if a boy is intelligent, he can get
through college practically without money,
whereas in other days his parents had to pay.
It seems to me that children should be
grateful for what they get and they should
wait until they have received experience and
have worked and produced before challenging
society. They should regard their superiors
and professors and teachers with the courtesy
they deserve.
We are told that in Canada there are two
million people in poverty. I cannot believe
that. There may be people in want, but I
cannot think that in Canada there are two
million people in poverty. I know that where
I live you will not find much poverty.
Although Nova Scotia is a province where we

SENATE DEBATES

do not get rich, nevertheless, the people usually live well. They believe that they should
work and save.
It may be that the Indians and Eskimos are
adding to the number of poverty-stricken
people. It is a real problem. Incidentally, I
have always been fascinated by the stories
about Indians, their good blood and the fact
that they can work as steeplejacks and hunting guides, and so on, jobs that are attractive
and glamourous, involving some danger.
Indians do not like to punch time clocks, and
instead of trying to get them to do so we
should be getting them to do these strenuous
jobs that they prefer. Perhaps the only way
we can achieve this end is to try working
with the new generations, try doing it with
the young people. Perhaps they could be
spread more across Canada and not left in
large numbers in any one place.
I think that the discussion we have had
proves that those who live in rural districts
and in the country have a better life than
those who live in big cities. You know, in the
city you are rather impersonal as regards
your neighbours, and it seems that if you do
not have a lot of money and influence you
may be quite lonely and without friends. Of
course, other problems in big cities are pollution, riots, crime, and the high cost of living-of course, it may be the cost of high
living.
The farmer now has all the amenities in the
country; he has the telephone and good roads
and television. He has a centrally heated
house. It seems to me it is better to live in
the country. City dwellers from many places
come to spend their lives in rural Nova Scotia.
One of the things that helped us in Nova
Scotia in other days was that if people became unemployed they would not stay at
home; they went down to the United States.
In the springtime you would see people in
large numbers going to the United States from
Nova Scotia. Even our college students would
go there in summer to earn money so that
they could carry on their education. I remember honourable Senator MacLennan, a member of this Senate, who once had to struggle
to get his education. He was a good looking
young fellow, and on one occasion he went to
Boston where he got a job taking tickets on a
streetcar. One day he saw a delicate young
lady on the streetcar and he overheard her
say to her friend in Gaelic, "How would you
like to kiss the conductor?" He spoke to her
in Gaelic and said, "I am on duty." The girl
was astonished to hear Gaelic in Boston. She
thought she was safe in speaking it.

November 12, 1968

Many young ladies from Nova Scotia went
there to become nurses and housemaids.
Senator MacLennan told me that the Canadian
influence in Massachusetts was so strong that
they paid special attention to it when there
was a presidential election. However, that
exodus from Nova Scotia was not good. Since
the last war some of our people have moved
to Toronto and Montreal. We do not like this
either, but they make the move because they
feel they will have better advantages than
they get at home.
I think our conclusions will be arrived at
by the assistance of the great voluntary agencies that we have in this country. We started
with the Red Cross, and we have the St. John
Ambulance, the Knights of Columbus, the
Women's Institute, the I.O.D.E. and the
V.O.N.; we also have the churches, and they
do splendid work. We must praise the churches, for if we had no churches, what would
Canada be like? It seems to me that that has
something to do with our prosperity. Our
fathers who came here were Christians, and
the Christian nations of the world are in the
forefront-and this is not a matter of luck or
a matter of chance. We believe there is an
overriding Providence which will look after
us, and our future is in His Hand. Sometimes
people say, "God helps those who help themselves." I hope we are able to do that. I hope
the committee will make a good report. If we
want social justice, and if we work for it, we
will be entitled to it. That I think is a good
subject
for the Senate
committee
to
explore. It is one of the things we can do,
because we have here men and women who
are experienced and talented, and who have a
knowledge of life; they have lived in this
country, and they want to improve it.

The Senate resumed from Thursday, October 31, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. McGrand for the second reading of Bill S-15, to amend the Food and
Drugs Act and the Narcotic Control Act and
to make a consequential amendment to the
Criminal Code.
Hon. Malcolm Hollett: Honourable senators,The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, is it agreed that the honourable Senator

SENATE DEBATES

Hollett will take the floor instead of the
honourable Senator Sullivan?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Hollelt: Honourable senators, the
only reason I am now participating in this
debate is because our friend the honourable
Senator Sullivan has been detained elsewhere
because of family illness. I do not know why
I was chosen to say a few words on this
subject, because I am about the least
qualified to speak to this important amendment.
However, before proceeding further I want
to say a few words regarding His Honour the
Speaker, the honourable Leader of the Government and the newly-appointed members.
To be brief, I wish to say that I concur in all
the complimentary remarks made to and
about each of you, and I will not enlarge on
them, except to say, to you, sir, that the office
of His Honour the Speaker is a very important function, and one which I am sure you
will discharge with ingenuity and skill.
Honourable senators, this amendment-an
act to amend the Food and Drugs Act and the
Narcotic Control Act and to make a consequential amendment to the Criminal Codeis a most important one and one to which
each senator should give very careful thought
before we say exactly how we are going to
vote on it. When I first saw this amending
legislation I hardly bothered to read it, but
when it was suggested that I might say a few
words on it, I read it and realized how
important it is and that we should consider it
carefully.
Before I go on any further I should like to
mention another subject. Yesterday was
November 11, and the fiftieth anniversary of
the Armistice of 1918. Over 100 young old
men of this country were invited by the Government to appear here in Ottawa to attend
certain ceremonies. I was fortunate in having
the pleasure of attending a ceremony that
was held in the West Block last evening. It
was the finest meeting I have ever attended. I
pay tribute and offer my congratulations to
the Government and the Honourable the
Minister of Veterans Affairs for having developed this plan of bringing these young fellows-some of them are older than I but they
are still young; one was 91 years old-to
Ottawa for this gathering. I think it was marvellous of the Honourable Mr. Dubé to have
asked some of our comrades, yours and mine,
to be here for the occasion of yesterday and
the day before.

November 12, 1968

I am sure every one enjoyed it very much.
I met a good many men whom I had met
before. I did not meet them in Canada; I met
them in France over 50 years ago. I can
assure all honourable senators that every one
of those men enjoyed himself to the full, and
thought of how thankful he was to Almighty
God for having spared him to celebrate this
fiftieth anniversary of the 1918 Armistice.
Honourable senators, the bill before us is a
very important measure. The second and
third parts of the bill have to do with controlled drugs. Clause 10 adds a new Part IV
to the Food and Drugs Act, which makes it
an offence for any person, except under the
authority of Part IV, to have a restricted drug
in his possession or to traffic in it. In
Schedule J four drugs, LSD-about which we
have heard much-DET, DMT, and STPwhatever they are-are set out as restricted
drugs.
Senator McGrand is to be congratulated for
explaining this bill so clearly. We are all
grateful to him for the way in which he did
it. I do not expect he believes in everything
that is contained in this bill-at least, I hope
he does not, but I will come to that later.
Drugs such as LSD should be restricted and
kept out of the hands of our youth, and out
of your hands and mine, because we all know
of the damage they do to the human being
who was created by Almighty God. I am sure
all honourable senators feel that the Government should do everything it can to restrict
the advertising and sale of these particular
drugs.
Honourable senators, I come now to the
parts of the bill that cause me, as I am sure
they cause you, a lot of worry. Those are the
parts that amend the Food and Drugs Act and
make a consequential amendment to the
Criminal Code, and which deal with contraceptives. It is unfortunate that an old man
like myself should have to talk about these
things, but if we do not take them into consideration somebody will get hurt. Everybody
knows about them now. Perhaps I could tell a
little story I heard to illustrate how everybody may know about these things. I do not
think there is anything wrong with the story.
Two little girls, one aged six and one aged
five, were playing in the garden. The six year
old picked up a contraceptive from the veranda and went in to her mother saying, "Look,
Mummy, what I found. I picked up a contraceptive off the veranda." The five year old
asked "Mummy, what is a veranda?" So you
see, even the very young are beginning to

November 12, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

know about these things. Perhaps we do not
know as much about them as the younger
generation.
The act which is being amended says:
Every one commits an offence who knowingly, without lawful justification or
excuse, (c) offers to sell, advertises, publishes an advertisement of, or has for sale
or disposal any means, instructions,
medicine, drug or article intended or
represented as a method of preventing
conception or causing abortion or miscarriage.
That is the wording of the act we are amending. How are we amending it? Merely by
striking out the words, "preventing conception".
The amendment of this act will make such
advertising and sale perfectly legal under certain regulations, but what the regulations are
we have yet to learn. I note on page 403 of
the Senate Hansard Senator McGrand said:
It is expected that regulations will be
developed which will not interfere in any
way with the advertising to the general
public by responsible agencies or organizations concerned with family planning
or the dissemination of birth control
information. These amendments, therefore, will permit the legal sale of contraceptive devices to the general public,
but will limit the advertising thereof in
accordance with the proposed regulations.
Honourable senators what will be the regulations and who is to make them? There is
much danger in that amendment, if we pass
it. I know I am not qualified to talk much
about it, so I do not intend to. I will come
back to that later.
I want to touch on something now which is
very important. I hold in my hand an important document, which I suspect many of you
have read. It is the encyclical of the Holy
Father, Pope Paul VI, on the use of contraceptives, which I commend to every
honourable member here. If you will allow
me I will quote a few paragraphs to show
how serious this question is and how careful
we must be before we pass that amendment.
The whole idea now seems to be to control
the population increase. Do not let it increase
too much. We will make regulations whereby
someone will be able to say that every man
and woman in Canada can buy contraceptives
and thus reduce the population growth and
reduce poverty in this world. That seems to

be the idea behind it. I say, honourable senators, that is not a sensible idea at all. Here we
are in Canada with 20 million people. The
population of the world is 3.4 billion and we,
a mere 20 million people, are here doing
something to prevent the growth of the population of this world by offering contraceptives
to all men and women. To me the idea is so
stupid-I almost hate to say it in this august
building-as to be terrible.
As honourable senators know, the question
of population and the over-populated areas of
the world has come before Pope Paul VI, who
set up a magisterium to examine the whole
question. They could not agree on the best
way to cope with the problem, so eventually
the Pope had to issue an encyclical. I will
read the first paragraph. It is headed:
"The transmission of life":
The most serious duty of transmitting
human life, for which married persons
are the free and responsible collaborators
of God the Creator, has always been a
source of great joys to them even if
sometimes accompanied by not a few
difficulties and by distress.
At all times the fulfilment of this duty
has posed grave problems to the conscience of married persons, but with the
recent evolution of society changes have
taken place that give rise to new questions which the church could not ignore,
having to do with the matter which so
closely touches upon the life and happiness of men.
That is the introduction to the encyclical.
Incidentally, here I should like to pay tribute to our librarian. I wanted to get this
copied and did not know how to have it done.
I went to the library and the assistants had
this prepared for me. I want to congratulate
them on doing a wonderful job there.
There are many headings in this. It reads:

fact noteworthy and of varied kind. In

SENATE DEBATES
The temptation is great.
Moreover, working and iodging conditions as well as increased exigencies both
in the economic field and in that of education, often makes the proper education
of an elevated number of children difficult today.
Honourable senators, I am not going to
read much, because I want you to read it for
yourselves. One other paragraph reads:
It is also asked whether, in view of the
increased sense of responsibility of modern man, the moment has not come for
him to entrust to his reason and his will,
rather than to the biological rhythms of
his organism, the task of regulating birth.

November 12, 1968

the teaching of the church in this field is
based, if they care to reflect upon the
consequences of methods of artificial
birth control. Let them consider, first of
all, how wide and easy a road would thus
be opened up toward conjugal infidelity
and the general lowering of morality. Not
much experience is needed in order to
know human weakness, and to understand that men-especially the young,
who are so vulnerable on this point-have
need of encouragement to be faithful to
the moral law, so that they must not be
offered some easy means of eluding its
observance. It is also to be feared that
the man, growing used to the employment of anticonceptive practices, may
finally lose respect for the woman.. . .

Then, His Holiness goes on with the doctrine
of principles. He speaks of conjugal love and
its characteristics. He speaks of responsible
parenthood and respect for the nature and
purpose of the marriage act. I wish I had
time to read it all. He deals with faithfulness-with God's design. Then lie goes on,
in section 14:
Illicit ways of regulating birth. In conformity with these landmarks in the
human and Christian vision of marriage,
we must once again declare that the
direct interruption of the generative
process already begun, and above all,
directly willed and procured abortion,
even if for therapeutic reasons, are to be
absolutely excluded as licit means of
regulating birth.

I am quite sure that you will agree that that
could be dangerous. It goes on:
Let it be considered also that a dangerous
weapon would thus be placed in the
hands of those public authorities who
take no heed of moral exigencies. Who
could blame a government for applying
to the solution of the problems of the
community those means acknowledged to
be licit for married couples in the solution of a family problem? Who will stop
rulers from favoring, from even imposing
upon their peoples, if they were to consider it necessary, the method of contraception which they judge to be most
efficacious? In such a way men, wishing
to avoid individual, family or social
difficulties encountered in the observance
of the divine law, would reach the point
of placing at the mercy of the intervention of public authorities the most personal and most reserved sector of conjugal
intimacy.
Consequently, if the mission of generating life is not to be exposed to the
arbitrary will of men, one must necessarily recognize insurmountable limits to
the possibility of man's domination over
his own body and its functions; ...

I am sure we all agree that we are very much
against abortion in any form, except for preserving the mother's life. There is much here
I would like to quote to you. It goes on-and
this is important:

customs, we say: Do not allow the morality of your peoples to be degraded; do
not permit that by legal means practices
contrary to the natural and divine law be
introduced into that fundamental cell, the
family. Quite other is the way in which
public authorities can and must contribute to the solution of the demographic
problem: namely, the way of a provident
policy for the family, of a wise education
of peoples in respect of the moral law
and the liberty of citizens.
There are many more paragraphs, and then
there is the "Final appeal." Oddly enough, in
the last couple of days I have seen more
articles in the newspapers about this question
than I ever noticed before. Possibly it is
because I did not take the trouble to bother
about the subject previously. At any rate, in
the Gazette of today, November 12, there is
an article entitled "Doctor warns against
effect of long term use of pill." The article
reads as follows:
A French physician says that women
who use "the pill" for more than five
years proceed at their own risk because
doctors have not been able to study its
effects over a longer period of time.
Dr. Jean Gueguen, writing in the
Gazette Medicale de France, says there is
no clear information "about the possible
effects several years after the pill is discontinued or the risks run by women who
continue to take the pill over extended
periods."
He recommends that women using the
birth control pill stop every two years for
tests.
In order not to prolong this debate, I cannot conceive of us, a part of the Government
of Canada, passing legislation of this sort in
this country. I agree that in certain countries
there is a terrifying increase in population. I
have here a quotation from the Gazette of
last Friday, November 8, which is as follows:
There were about 3,420,000,000 people
on this planet at mid-1967 and if the
present growth rate continues the number will double by 2006.
It says later:
The report shows the world population
jumped by 65,000,000 from mid-1966 to
mid-1967. This means that at last count
180,000 children were being born each
day.

Three-quarters of the earth's inhabitants live in what commonly are known
as underdeveloped areas, which is taken
to mean in relative poverty.
The thing that worries me, and I am reaching the end of my span of years, is the effect
of the continued and free use of these contraceptives and other forms of contraception
by our young people. I worry about the effect
it will have on this world, and in particular
upon this Canada of ours. If we do increase
our population considerably in Canada, what
effect is that going to have on the rest of the
world? Think of the many hundreds of thousands that come here every year. I believe
last year we had 173,000 immigrants from all
parts of the world. Sixty-six thousand came
from Great Britain, 19,000 or 20,000 from
France, and the remainder came from Africa,
Asia and other countries. Today we even
have people advocating that we should accept
children from Biafra. At the same time it is a
sin for our own women to have children.
The whole thing seems stupid to me, and I
cannot understand why the Government has
brought forward this amendment in this bill.
I do not think it is sensible for Canada. I
think that if we give our hearts and souls to
the study of this matter we could find better
means of controlling the population. But,
honourable senators, it is not only control of
the population you will have to think about,
but you will also have to consider the effect
this is going to have on the young male and
female of today and tomorrow. What young
man wants to find out or to know that his
best girl friend has a pocketful of contraceptives? And what young girl wants to know
that that her best boy friend has contraceptives to offer her? What effect is this going
to have on the morals and morale of our
people?
I am in favour of everything in this particular amending bill, except that one particular thing about contraceptives. And I hope
that when this goes to committee somebody
will move that that particular section of the
act be left as it is without being amended. I
do not think it is right or f air to ask this
house or to ask the other place to pass legislation which will allow the legal use-made
legal by this Government and this Senate-by
our young people of these things.
This statement by the Pope is one of the
finest and fairest statements I have ever
heard from anyone. I am glad I was asked to
speak in this debate, because otherwise I

.ny estimation the prestige of the Senate

Surely members of the Senate of Canada
are well disciplined people, and are devoted
ta their occupation. I cannot understand why
the senators of Canada should have to submit
an excuse when they do not attend a sitting
of the house. I hope the Special Committee on
the Rules, and the members of this house,
will do something ta rectify this matter
which, in my opinion, is childish and outrageaus. A fine of $120 per day for 21 days'
absence is very stiff. When the Senate used ta
meet three or four months out of the year it
was perhaps acceptable. With long sessions of
eight ta ten months I think it is tao much.
One has ta be extremely careful ta keep within the 21 days. I think that when the fine is
raised from $60 ta $120 per day the number
of days should be extended. I believe that the
members of the Senate are ail devoted ta
their cause and nobody wiil unavoidably miss

It is an essential part of a senator's responsibility ta participate in public offices

SENATE DEBATES

Therefore, I say to you, what is the use or
the purpose of keeping rules that will be outdated and outmoded? Surely, if anybody asks
for relief by way of divorce, by way of a
private bill, a committee which was organized
to work under the old rules certainly will not
operate under those old rules again?
I have all confidence in the Committee on
Legal and Constitutional Affairs to deal with
such rare cases as might corne to Parliament.
Let us look at the Senate Committee on
Legal and Constitutional Affairs:
9. The Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, composed of thirty
members, seven of whom shall constitute
a quorum, to which shall be referred on
motion all bills, messages, petitions,
inquiries, papers, and other matters
relating to legal and constitutional matters generally, including:
(i) Federal-Provincial relations.
(ii) Administration of Justice, Law
Reform, and all matters related thereto.
(iii) The Judiciary.
(iv) All essentially juridical matters.
(v) Private bills not otherwise specifically assigned to another committee,
including marriage and divorce.

to corne again before us to ask for relief by
way of divorce and annulment.
I say that by way of introduction. I will
have more to say about it later. But I do fail
to see why this house should adjourn and be
delayed for the purpose of hearing a speech
along these lines made by my good friend
Senator Roebuck-a speech that will last
probably an hour and a half or maybe more.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Well, on a point of
order, my friend Senator Choquette said he
should not impute motives, and that is right.
But if he thinks that I so enjoy the work that
we have been doing-and I may add just by
way of interest that on the 18th day of this
month I will have served as chairman of this
Divorce Committee for 15 years-if my friend
thinks that I am anxious to go on hearing
cases and that sort of thing, he is very much
mistaken. I have expressed it privately a
number of times, and I now express it here,
that I am delighted that we are through with
this big, long, arduous task in which I have
been engaged.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: On the other hand, I

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: And the commissioner.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Al right.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: And the commissioner.
The commissioner has nothing whatever to do
with this, now that the ten provinces have
accepted the jurisdiction of the federal
Parliament.
Honourable senators, I do not know what is
behind all this. I cannot attribute motives to
my friend Senator Roebuck who has been so
sincere in all his dealings in divorce, but I do
suspect that he would like again to continue
the old system of saying to the Canadian people, "It is your inalienable right to corne to
Parliament." I can see him again inviting
those people to corne to Parliament and ask
for relief: "If you feel that you must have
relief by way of annulment or divorce, then
corne to Parliament."
I say to you, honourable senators, that, if
we do that, we are inviting these people to
corne. If we keep the old committee and the
old rules, we are inviting Canadians at large

The Chairman: Is there a seconder?
Hon. Mr. Croll: I will second it.
The Chairman: Is it your pleasureHon. Mr. Molson: Mr. Chairman, may I ask
Senator Roebuck when he would be prepared
to deal with these questions? As you will
remember, Senator Roebuck, last week you
said you had not had an opportunity to see
the report which had been appended to Hansard on October 31, and we therefore agreed
that we would put it over the weekend until
Tuesday this week.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Molson: We have now done that
and you told me this evening that you would
speak and that you hoped the comrnittee
tomorrow would consider what you said.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: What is the hurry?
Hon. Mr. Molson: None whatsoever, sir. We
have all the time that the Senate wishes. I
would just like to say that the committee, as
always, is the servant of the Senate and its
members are in the hands of the Senate.
There is no suggestion of hurry whatsoever,
but it may be difficult to deal in sequence with
the matters with which it is faced, if this
Third Report is held up in the chamber for a
matter of a fortnight. That is all I am pointing out. There is no possibility that the committee can say to the Senate, "Hurry up"there should be none of that. But you yourself, sir, said that if we left this over the
weekend you would be prepared to go on
today.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: And I was prepared to
go on today. I have been sitting here since
three o'clock ready to go on, but I am not
ready to go on at half-past nine.
The Chairman: There is a motion before
the Chair.
Hon. Mr. Walker: May I ask if Senator
Roebuck is the only one who is going to discuss this matter? I know he is the most
important one.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No, no.
Hon. Mr. Walker: Is no one else going to
say anything about it? I see, there is no one
else. Senator Molson has discussed it earlier
and it seems a pity since we are all here, and
we will not be sitting tomorrow, that we cannot get on with this or at least with everything except Senator Roebuck's speech. If
there is no one else ready to proceed, perhaps
I am out of order in making the suggestion.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Perhaps we

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I will be glad to go on
tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Molson: But we have committee
meetings arranged for tomorrow.
The Chairman: There is a motion before
the Chair that progress be reported.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Mr. Chairman, I fully
understand the chairman's wish to get on
with the work of the committee and I understand the motives which guide the Acting
Leader of the Opposition, but are we not in
this position? Senator Roebuck, who has been
dealing with Divorce, feels keenly about a
particular aspect of the report and he wishes
to make an argument. I would be inclined on
the basis of my scanty knowledge to take the
position that the Acting Leader of the Opposition has taken, but at the same time Senator
Roebuck is a member of this house with long
experience in these matters, and he feels he
has something to contribute. Personally, I feel
we ought to go on, but in view of the fact
that Senator Roebuck at this hour of the
evening does not feel he is able to go on, I do
not think it would be sensible for us to proceed. I do not think anyone would want to
compel him at this time to proceed with his
argument.
I hope that in taking this position the chairman of the committee, for whom I have the
greatest respect and whose work in this committee has been most commendable, will not
think that I am letting him down. Someone

(See p. 476.)
REPORT OF THE ELEVENTH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE CANADA-UNITED
INTERPARLIAMENTARY GROUP

The Eleventh Annual Meeting of the Canada-United States Interparliamentary Group
was held from March 20-24, 1968, in Washington and New Orleans.
During the month preceding these meetings, the Canadian delegation held several
briefing sessions. Our Inter-Parliamentary
Relations Branch and the Department of
External Affairs organized the briefing of our
delegates and the preparation of background
papers on the various agenda topics. Officials
from the Departments of External Affairs,
Finance, Trade and Commerce, National
Defence, External Aid, and Energy, Mines
and Resources participated in the briefings.
We were also fortunate in having the Minister of Defence and the Minister of Trade and
Commerce devote an afternoon to discussing
items on the Agenda with members of our
delegation.
The Canadian delegation, led by the
Honourable Alan A. Macnaughton, P.C., Q.C.,
arrived in Washington on March 20th at 2.30
P.M., aboard a Canadian Forces Yukon. Mr.
Speaker Sydney J. Smith of the Senate, a
participant in all previous meetings of the
Group, was unable to attend due to illness.
Mr. Speaker Lamoureux was also unable to
take part as the House of Commons was in
session. Their places were taken by two former Speakers, Honourable Alan A. Macnaughton, P.C., Q.C., of the Senate and the
Honourable Marcel Lambert, P.C., M.P., of
the Commons. The delegation comprised, in
addition, the following parliamentarians:
from the Senate, Hon. Donald Cameron (Alberta), Hon. L. P. Gélinas (Quebec), Hon. D.

ELEVENTH MEETING
CANADA-'UNITED
STATES
INTERPARLIAMENTARY GROUP
REPORT 0F COMMITTEE I: TRADE AND
ECONOMIC MATTERS

1. Canada-UnitedStates Balance of Payments
A United States delegate opened the discussion by stating the unterdependence of Canada
and the United States on trade and monetary
matters. He pointed out that agreement had
been reached earlier this month exempting
Canada from new U.S. restrictions on investment abroad designed to ease the U.S. balance of payments problem, and expressed the
hope that the cooperation between the two
countries on monetary problems would continue and be effective. A Canadian delegate
replies that Canada had a $1.3 billion deficit
with the United States and welcomed the U.S.
government's action, also expressing the hope
that this type of cooperation would continue.
There was considerable discussion about
labor-management problems in the two countries. A Canadian delegate expressed the view
that the biggest worry for each country is
over the possibility of inflationary wage settiements. Members of the U.S. delegation
stressed that labor costs in both countries are
rising faster than productivity. Canadian
delegates pomnted out that the lower productivity rate in Canada-due in part to the narrower market base-would create more serious difficulties as the two countries move
dloser to freer trade relationships. They
referred to the recently announced intention
29234--331

of Canadian ministers to inaugurate measures
of voluntary restraint and indicated that these
would receive full support by the Canadian
public. There was discussion by members of
both delegations over the indirect impact on
Canada of certain U.S. trade and monetary
restrictions, such as the interest equalization
tax. Canadian delegates expressed appreciation of the special measures adopted by the
United States to mitigate the effects of these
policies on the Canadian economy, but pointed out that in return Canada has had to adopt
certain restraints which may affect its ability
to respond flexibly to future international
pressures. They stressed that the United
States should therefore consider very carefully before it acts how such measures would
affect Canada. It was also pointed out by
another Canadian delegate that Canada
finances a substantial. portion of its deficit
with the United States through its trade surplus with the rest of the world and not
entirely with inflows of U.S. capital. The consensus of both delegations appeared to be that
because of the inter-relationship of CanadianU.S. economic affairs there should continue ta
be close consultation and cooperation on al
matters affecting both countries' balance of
payment positions.
2. Post-Kennedy Round Developments
Members of both delegations devoted considerable attention to foreign trade problems,
giving particular attention to agricultural
trade problems. Several Canadian delegates
discussed the impact on Canada of the decuine
in U.S. f arm prices, emphasizing the need for
working out arrangements which will protect
Canadian farmers from repercussions due ta
U.S. price dedlines. It was also pointed out
that the U.S. Public Law 480 program has had
an impact on Canadian export markets.
A United States delegate stated that it was
not clear at this point what direction U.S.
trade policy will take now that the Kennedy
Round has been concluded but that trade liberalization remains the basic U.S. policy. A
comprehensive study of trade policy is now
under way in the Executive Branch, he said,
and this study will caver exploration o! possible special trade arrangements with Canada,
such as a North Atlantic Free Trade Area of
a Canada-U.S. Customs union. There was considerable discussion by members o! both delegations over possible rise of protectionist sentiment in the United States. Members of the
Canadian delegation expressed their hope
that the free trade movement would continue
uninterrupted and expressed fears that pas-

SENATE DEBATES
sage of protectionist type measures could
have a severe adverse effect on this trend.
Several U.S. delegates expressed the opinion
that protectionist measures are not likely to
become law, pointing out that the President
has stated publicly that he wrn veto such
bills.
A U.S. delegate said that American agriculture is in a depressed state and that farmers
are quite concerned about trade agreements
which seem to be working to their disadvantage. There was general agreement that, contrary to previous hopes, the Kennedy Round
had not resulted in freer access to European
Markets for U.S. and Canadian farmers.
A member of the Canadian delegation in
discussing the outlook for wheat pointed out
that there will be great pressure on world
wheat supplies in the next few years and that
the United States and Canada have a responsibility to work together to try to stabilize
wheat prices, since the United States and
Canada are the only producers with adequate
storage facilities. Talks for this purpose are
going on between the two countries now, he
stated. A U.S. delegate pointed out that the
United States had an unsatisfactory, inefficient arrangement for selling wheat abroad
which was neither governmental nor private.
To make the system work better, he said, the
government should either get more in or
more out of the picture. There was also discussion of a number of common agricultural
problems, such as those affecting the dairy
and beef industries.
A member of the Canadian delegation
pointed out that the Canadian government
has stated that it would take retaliatory
action if the United States imposed border
taxes or imposed similar measures and
expressed the hope that nothing would develop along these lines. In reply, a U.S. delegate
said he could not conceive any such action
coming to pass. There was general agreement
that movement in this direction would have a
very harmful effect on both countries.

November 12, 1968

appreciated the concern felt by many
Canadians over the issue of the extra territorial application of U.S. laws so far as
Canadian subsidiaries of U.S. firms are concerned. The basic law governing trade with
Communist countries is not likely to be
changed as long as the Vietnam war
continues.
The most serious aspect of the foreign
investment problem for Canada is the extraterritorial application of U.S. laws to U.S.
subsidiaries in Canada, a Canadian delegate
stated. The measures taken to ameliorate the
U.S. balance of payments problem have
shown that the U.S. can take steps to remedy
its own situation which have unintentional
repercussions on Canada. The U.S. should not
be surprised if Canada should take steps to
remedy Canadian situations which may have
repercussions in the U.S.
A U.S. delegate pointed out that large U.S.
corporations these days are in effect international or multinational. He said that they
often are better received abroad than U.S.
Government policies propounded by U.S.
diplomats. There followed some general discussion of the growth of large international
corporations which it was agreed creates serious problems of control for governments.
Several Canadian delegates indicated that
they are not opposed to U.S. investment in
Canada and cited beneficial results in specific
cases. Canadians accept the need for and
value foreign investments.

4. Resource Development
A Canadian delegate referred to the agreement reached in 1959 that Canada would continue to import oil, chiefly Venezuelan, but
would expect a roughly equivalent export
market in the Northwest United States. This
situation of parity has not yet been reached
but progress is satisfactory. In view of the
presently developing exports of Alaskan oil
into the Northwest, Canada will hope for
expanded markets in the Northeast. He
expressed confidence in the competitive

5. Automotive Agreement
A United States delegate opened the discussion by describing the benefits that have
accrued to both countries as a result of the
automotive agreement.
A Canadian spokesman also stressed the
benefits to bath countries. It has enlarged the
market for U.S. producers and thus protected
thousands of U.S. job-hoiders. If there had
not been such an agreement, Canada would
probably have had to move to higher tariffs,
quotas and other devices which would have
had bad effects ini the U.S.A. He suggested
that during the review which is now under
way ini accordance with the terns of the
agreement, sarne of his U.S. coileagues might
be tempted to suggest that the safeguards for
Canadian production incorparated ini the
agreement are now unnecessary or should at
any rate be modîfied. He gave three reasans
why they are stili necessary: (a) U.S. purchasing agents are stlill fot adjusted ta taking ful
advantage of Canadian production; (b) there
is stili a 20-30 per cent productivity-gap ini
Canada's disfavor; (c) Canadian producers
stili have not adjusted campletely ta different
U.S. pracedures for inspection, etc.
The U.S. spakesman replied that hie was flot
aware of seriaus pressure for removal or
modification of these safeguards, although it
is under consideration whether modification
would be desirable.
There followed a discussion of motor vehicie and highway safety standards. A Can-adian
delegate pointed out that smnce matar vehicle
design is centered ini the U.S., Canada is
dependent upon U.S. standards in this field.
He said that the 1966 Act is a good beginning
but that there is stili a long way ta go. A
U.S. delegate replied that the 1966 Act is anly
the first step. There wiil have ta be a twopranged attack an mator vehicle safety and
an highway safety as weil. The second is a
camplicated issue invalving mare than one
level of gavernment and uncluding probiems
bath of high design and iaw enforcernent. He
expressed confidence that progress is being
made in ail approaches.

there is concern that the global level of aid
has gone down at the same time as the GNP
ini the donor countries has gone up. Smnce
1960 Canada has stressed soft loans rather
than grants and has caordinated its aid with
other countries and thraugh the Warld Bank.
The Canadian aid target for 1970 is 1 per cent
of the grass national incarne. At present the
aid level is .6 per cent.
In the discussion af the U.S. foreign aid
pragram, it was agreed by the U.S. delegates
that the President's aid request for next year
would meet cansiderable apposition ini Congress due in,. part ta the heavy casts of the
Vietnam war. Thaugh one U.S. delegate
feared that the entire aid bil might be rejected, the consensus was that the authorization
would be passed at a substantiaily reduced
level.
A Canadian delegate introduced the idea
that the time has carne to adapt a "multilaterai pool" appraach ta aid. It was suggested
that under the bilateral system the donors
reap lU-will rather than goad and that ini a
multilateral system it wauld be possible ta
blur the distinction between donar and donee
since ail would contribute samething and aid
would becorne in a sense ananymaus. The
group displayed considerable interest in this
idea. U.S. delegates pointed out that rnuch of
the appasition ta further aid efforts now
expressed in the U.S. arises from sensitivity
at the seeming ingratitude of the recipients.
They agreed that the multilateral appraach,
probably through agencies of the United
Nations, would be helped in this regard. A
Canadian delegate described the successful
implementation of the World Food Pragram
by the FAO and suggested that a tough international administrator can often take a
stronger stand against local peculation or
incampetence than is passible for national
officiais. He suggested that the U.S. and Canada could cooperate in pressing for a multilaterally arganized program of international aid.

the war in Vietnam continues. He said that he
appreciated Canadian concern over the
impact of U.S. trade restrictions on Canadian
subsidiaries of U.S. firms. Another U.S. delegate said that the attitude of Congress on this
issue only reflects the thinking of their
constituents.
A Canadian delegate said that the Battle
Act did not bother Canadians so much as the
Cuban control regulations. He was unable to
understand why the U.S. should control the
actions of long-time Canadian residents.
There was considerable discussion about
trade with Communist China. A U.S. delegate
said he had not heard of any U.S. protests
over Canadian wheat sales to China and
pointed out that U.S wheat exports increased
after Canada began selling to China. A
Canadian delegate said that they had found
their traders very effective in their relationships with the Chinese. Another referred to
the effect of subsidized U.S. flour exports in
making inroads on traditional Canadian
markets expressing the hope that the grains
agreement will result in solving this problem.
Members of the Canadian delegation
stressed that trade with the Communist world
was in the political interests of both the U.S.
and Canada. Some members of the U.S. delegation expressed their agreement with this
view, stating that one of the most effective
means to combat Communism is to encourage
growth of consumer demand in the Communist world and a general expansion of
trade between East and West. It was said by
one U.S. delegate that our trade policy toward
China since the Communists gained control
had been very ill-advised. As to getting restrictions on trade with Communist countries
removed, U.S. delegates agreed that although
the President had requested Congress to Act,
there was little chance that the Congress
would move in this direction so long as the
Vietnam war goes on.
A U.S. delegate cited the 50-50 restriction
on shipping grain as a factor limiting any
wheat sales to the Soviet Union, and said that
the longshoremen's unions are very powerful
in preventing easing of East-West trade
restrictions.
Several Canadian delegates referred to the
extra-territorial effect of U.S. trade restrictions on Canadian firms seeking to expand
commercial markets with Communist countries. Canadian managers of many subsidiaries of U.S. concerns are reluctant to risk running afoul of U.S. trade regulations. Canadians, they said, believe that commercial

November 12, 1968

decisions should not be influenced by the
political policies of the country of the parent.
U.S. delegates agreed that U.S. policy should
not control actions of Canadian firms.
There was general agreement among
members of both delegations that expansion
of East-West trade worked to the political
and economic advantage of both countries,
but that the Vietnam war was a severely
limiting factor at present.
8. International Grain Agreement
A Canadian delegate opened the discussion
by saying that the principal question as Canada sees it is what action will be taken by the
United States before July 1 when the new
price range for wheat under the IGA comes
into effect. Present prices in the U.S are
about 22c below the new floor price and
Canada is interested to know how the U.S.
will approach the problem of getting its
prices up to the agreed level.
A U.S. delegate replied that the Senate
hearings on the IGA begin next week. There
seemed to be general agreement among U.S.
delegates that farm opinion in the U.S. is in
favor of the IGA and that it will consequently
be ratified. The view was, however,
expressed by one U.S. delegate that during
the past 18 months world wheat marketing
had not been working as far as the U.S. was
concerned. He thought that the importance of
the IGA had perhaps been exaggerated.
Another U.S. delegate asked whether an
increase of 22c per bushel in the wheat price
would be likely to lead to larger production
in other countries such as France and the
Argentine. Canadian delegates pointed out
that this did not happen some years ago when
wheat prices were considerably higher than
they are now. In their view, if the United
States and Canada stand together it is unlikely to happen at the present time.

SENATE DEBATES

The Committee considered the following
items on its Agenda:
1) State of the N.A.T.O. Alliance (with
particular reference to the Harmel study)
2) Co-operation for continental defense
3) Policies toward Communist China
4) Vietnam
5) Non-proliferation Treaty
ELEVENTH MEETING
STATES INTERPARLIAMENCANADA-UNITED
TARY GROUP
REPORT OF COMMITTEE II: DEFENSE AND
SECURITY MATTERS

The U.S. Chairman opened the first session
of the Committee on Defense and Security
Matters by emphasizing that 1968 was a year
and reassessment. He
for stock-taking
noted the current and forthcoming changes in
political leadership in both countries, the
urgent publie demands by the population for
re-examination of policies and the worldwide
phenomenon of challenge to the past. He also
noted that in 1968 it was necessary to consider the fact that the NATO treaty allowed for
reassessment of its existence after 20 years
and that the NORAD treaty between the U.S.
and Canada was expiring on May 12, 1968. He
then suggested that the Conmittee give its
first attention to NATO, to an examination of
the changing Soviet threat, the consequences
of this changing threat to NATO itself, the
demands for a reduction in troop levels, the
effects of the non-proliferation treaty and the
recommendations of the Harmel Report.
The majority of Canadian delegates supported the view that a new approach to the
NATO Alliance was required and had been
recommended by, among other things, the
Harmel Report which called for positive
action of NATO in the economic and political
fields in addition to its traditional military
role. It was pointed out that the Harmel
Report emphasized that one of NATO'S major
roles was to coordinate plans for promoting a
detente and the question was asked as to
whether or not NATO as it exists today can
be used for such a purpose.
A Canadian delegate pointed out that
although the official Canadian Government
position NATO had not changed, NATO had
become an alliance leading to considerable
moral questioning on the part of the Canadian people.
The U.S. delegation noted the increased
Soviet military threat in the Mediterranean;

particularly that the Soviet Union had
increased the number of submarines in that
area and was looking to NATO's defense in
southern Europe as the soft part of the world.
Italy particularly was reported to be very
fearful of the possibility of a Soviet threat.
The Soviet submarine fleet had developed
greatly increased strength on a worldwide
basis and was now able to extend its operations to long distances from its European
home base. The Soviets are developing shipborne surface-to-surface missiles and these
could be a threat to surface ships of the U.S.,
U.K. and Canada.
The Soviet Union was beginning to use
naval bases in the United Arab Republic and
Syria, and there was a real possibility that it
might be able to use bases in Algeria. Soviet
technological developments enabled Soviet
submarines to transit the exit from the Black
Sea without technically violating the SovietTurkish agreement concerning the use of the
Straits.
There was an interesting review of the
apparent Soviet desire to control Middle Eastern oil resources if not for its own use then to
deny it to the prime purchasers in Western

Europe.
delegation felt that while the Harmel report's
recommendations for a detente were helpful,
the new ingredient of an increased Soviet
threat in the Mediterranean was so important
that it could not be ignored.
Some concern was expressed by the
Canadian delegation as to the consequences of
control by the Soviet Union over the Middle
East oil resources. An agreement seemed to
have been reached that such control would
create a very significant threat to the economies of Western Europe.
Another member of the U.S. delegation
emphasized that the nature of the Soviet
threat must also be evaluated in ternis of the
failure of the Soviet Union to give any indication of a willingness to seek a mutual troop
reduction in central Europe despite proposais
on this matter. In this connection, members
of the U.S. delegation indicated that an
assessment of possible U.S. troop reductions
was currently in progress and would be discussed during the next few weeks.
One U.S. delegate noted that as far as U.S.
troops in Europe are concerned, the recent
development of large transport aircraft may
make it possible for the U.S. to withdraw
some of these troops from Europe and airlift
them very rapidly to that continent should
they be needed.

SENATE DEBATES

A Canadian delegate expressed deep concern about the attitude of the West German
Government at this time. It seemed to be
moving towards an attitude with respect to
NATO similar to that of France.
One member of the U.S. delegation emphasized that when NATO was established, it had
not been envisaged that the U.S. would supply the bulk of the ground forces but rather
that the U.S. would provide strategic air and
naval power with the European countries
supplying the bulk of the ground troops. This
has not worked out in practice.
It was emphasized that NATO was part of
the total defense against the worldwide Soviet
threat and the U.S. is required to maintain its
strength not only in NATO but elsewhere.
The NATO countries have been interested in
arms reduction to bring about a detente and
in weaning away some of the eastern European countries from central Communist domination. This was all to the good and NATO
should be used to lessen global tensions. The
U.S. interest in this was not only the interest
in lessening global tension but to free U.S.
military forces to accept responsibility
elsewhere.
The U.S. delegation emphasized that while
more could be done by NATO in the political
field, the NATO countries should not be
lulled into an unwarranted sense of security.
A member of the Canadian delegation mentioned that because of the nuclear stalemate
existing in the world today the Soviet Union
had shifted its approach and had concentrated
on political and economic strategy. It was felt
that if NATO remained exclusively military it
would not be in a position to respond to much
political or economic activity from the Soviet
Union.
In closing this discussion, one member of
the U.S. delegation said that a reduction of
U.S. troop strength in Europe, which would
be useful to the U.S. in carrying its worldwide responsibilities, might also be a meaningful gesture in the direction of a detente.
The U.S. Chairman opened the second session by suggesting a discussion of the North
American Air Defense Agreement (NORAD).
He recalled that the agreement expires on
May 12, 1968 and that it was desirable that
there be an evaluation of the threat and the
weapons available to meet that threat.
A Canadian delegate said that the Government of Canada made clear its intention to
renew the Agreement but also made clear
that it does not wish to participate in the
ABM system.

November 12, 1968

A Canadian delegate mentioned that he was
not opposed in principle to an anti-bomber
defense system but questioned whether or not
an active anti-bomber defense is warranted in
terms of its financial cost. Quoting a recent
speech by Secretary of Defense McNamara
which mentioned that anti-bomber defense
alone could not significantly reduce destruction if an attack occurred, it was mentioned
that if such were the case Canada did not
think that it could afford the continuation of
such an anti-bomber defense system.
It was also pointed out by a Canadian delegate that the major defense of the American
Continent was not any of the purely defense
measures that are taken but rather the tremendous offenseive power of the U.S. and
that therefore an anti-bomber defense system
might be quite obsolete in fact.
The members of the U.S. and Canadian
delegations reiterated the view that the
bomber threat from the Soviet Union continues to be an active threat against the North
American continent and that a defense
against this threat is as vital as defense
against more sophisticated weaponry. Indeed,
the U.S. had learned the lesson that a defense
against more conventional weapons, in this
case the manned bomber, was as important as
a defense against more advanced threats.
In this discussion, the members of the U.S.
delegation repeatedly emphasized that the
U.S. would want Canada to exercise complete
sovereignty over its territory; and that it
would not wish in any way to impose on that
sovereignty if Canada should choose to deny
the use of its territory to the joint defense of
the continent.
One Canadian delegate mentioned that the
East Coast of Canada had no defense system
to protect it against Soviet submarines and
suggested that the NORAD Agreement might
be modified to encompass not only air defense
systems but also measures against sea and
underwater threats. It was pointed out that
although there have been in the recent past
seven penetrations into Canadian controlled
air space from Soviet bombers there was also
evidence that Soviet submarines were positioned around the coast of Canada, perhaps
even in the Hudson Bay. This, in the opinion
of the Canadian delegate was a much greater
threat to Canada than bombers.
In the field of anti-submarine warfare, a
member of the U.S. delegation emphasized,
U.S.-Canadian cooperation was also essential. There needed to be a true joint effort in
the anti-submarine warfare field particularly

November 12. 1968

in light of the increasig Soviet submarie
threat.
The members of the U.S. delegation then
reviewed the air and space threat ta the
North American continent as they saw it.
They were convinced, and informed by the
U.S. military establishment, that the Soviet
bomber threat wauld continue ta exist at least
into the mid-70's. In addition ta this, the
Soviet Union would always have an effective
ICBM threat. While members of the U.S.
delegatian had seriaus reservations about an
ABM system, particularly because of its high
cost they recognized that the U.S. had ta
maintain its research and development in this
ifteld as well as in offensive weaponry and
considered that the deployment of the sacafled thin ABM systemn was primarily
designed ta continue effective U.S. development of thîs weapan. Otherwise, the Soviet
Union would have an oppartunity ta, be far
ahead of the U.S. in this field. In this connectian, the members of the U.S. delegation
emphasized that the Soviet Union had refused
on repeated occasions ta discuss the U.S.
proposed mutual limitation on the further
development af the ABM/ICBM systems.
In his opening statement a Canadian delegate mentioned that sonner or later the West
will have to narmalize its relations with
mainland China. Who will initiate this move
and when was the main question. It was suggested that Canada, because it already has a
toe in China because of its commercial relations, could be helpful ta the Western warld
i taking the initiative. The Canadian delegaflan was unanimaus in recommending that
formal recognition of mainland China should
be arrived at as soon as practicable. Although
some members of the Canadian delegatian
mentioned that Communist China should alsa
be admîtted ta the United Nations, the majority thought that admission ta the United
Nations of Peking at this Urne would be highly disruptive.
A member o! the U.S. delegation indicated
that hearings an the subject of the future U.S.
raie in Asia are now in progress and offered
tai make the record o! these hearings available ta the Canadian delegation. While the U.S.
does nat recognize Communist China and has
no present intentions ta do sa, there have been
a continuing series of diplomatic contacts between the two cauntries first at Geneva
and mast recently in Warsaw. The U.S. has
used this channel ta indicate ta the Comnmunist Chinese that it does nat contemplate
any mnilitary action against them. and daes nat
29234-34

intend ta intervene in their internai affairs.
The U.S. has attempted ta further these
contacts by establishïng relations i the cultural and journalistic fields but these have so
far flot met with any positive Communist
Chinese response.
The members of the U.S. delegation held
that the issue of seating Comxnunist China
was presently inappropriate, and untimely,
particularly since the efforts ta seat Coinmunist China at the United Nations were lasing support fromn other quarters including
frorn same of the African nations. It was also
necessary ta explore what the effects of
recognition would be an China's more
immediate neiglibors such as India and
Burina.
It was emphasized several times that there
was no visible indication on the part of China
of a desire ta establish relations with the U.S.
and indeed Communist China had made
numeraus demands befare it would be willing
ta enter the United Nations. Finally, it was
emphasized that in the minds of the Amenican people, any future steps toward recognition of Cummunist China were intimately
coupled with the events in Vietnam and there
was not llkely ta be any change until the
problems of Vietnam were settled.
There was also some discussion of a possible Canadian recognition of Communist China
and of the effeets that such a step would have
in the United States.
During the discussion on Communist China,
one of the members of the Canadian delegation suggested that the Committee seek the
knowledge and experience of one of the
members of the Canadian delegation wha was
not present at the time at the meeting. Later
in opening a discussion on the Vietnam question the Ca- chairman from the American
delegation mentioned that the crux of the
matter regarding Vietnam was that there
existed a number of alternatives or courses of
action that could be taken by the United
States Governnient, namely withdrawal of
forces, a continuation of the present effort, or
further escalation. The Ca-chairman called in
the Canadian expert ta relate his experiences
with China and try ta combine this discussion
with the Vietnam prablem. The Canadian
delegate mentioned that he was first in tauch
with the Chinese authorities in 1960 in connectian with the cash sale of wheat which
was finally ratified in January 1961. He mentianed that Chinese authorities at the time
were eager ta mave out of their self-isolatianismn and expand commercial relations

SENATE DEBATES

with other parts of the world. This was
viewed by the Canadian delegate as an opportunity for the American Government to come
in with the Canadian Government on the
grain sales to Communist China. The Canadian delegate at the time visited with President
Kennedy who was impressed by the proposal
but later said that the American Government
would be agreeable to give China all the
grain they wanted if they only asked for it.
This was felt unacceptable by the Chinese
authorities and the deal never came through.
The Canadian delegate stressed the considerable difference in China between the
"politicians" and the "trade" people." The
politicians were idealists, believing that the
nature of a whole generation could be
changed by political action and measures.
They were considered very dogmatic whereas
the trade people were much more practical
and down to earth in their beliefs and
dealings.
During a visit to Peking, the Canadian
delegate was called in by the Prime Minister,
Chou En-Lai, who exposed what were the
three main points in Communist China's
foreign policy. The first and most important
one was the recovery of all territories that
China possessed before 1900, namely, territories now held by Korea, Taiwan, and the
Soviet Union.
Another objective in their foreign policy
was to modify the relationship existing
between the major powers and the countries
on which they exerted their influence. This
applied ta both the Soviet Union and the
United States of America. The third objective
of Peking's foreign policy was to take over
the lead in the world Communist movement.
Chou En-Lai felt that they were best suited to
take that lead because he believed that no
white man could understand what it is to be a
colored man.
On the Taiwan question Chou En-Lai was
reported to have said that the crucial problem
was that Taiwan was inhabited by 10 million
original Taiwanese in addition to 2 million or
so refugees from mainland China. Chou EnLai accepted the principle of self-determination and mentioned that these 10 million
original Taiwanese should eventually have
the opportunity to express their views on the
question.
The Canadian representative mentioned
that mainland China at the moment is getting
ready for a big confrontation with the Soviet

November 12, 1968

Union. It was not contemplating any confrontation with the United States at this time but
feared it and was willing to flght if need be.
It was a significant fact, the Canadian delegate said, that the majority of young Chinese
children learned as their second language the
English language and also that Chinese have
never attacked the Americans, but rather the
ruling class of America which they considered imperialistic. The Canadian delegate
mentioned that the main difference between
Communist China and the great powers stems
from the fact that China traditionally has
considered itself the greatest culture and the
centre of the world and that it resents deeply
the cultural superiority of the other great
powers.
The Canadian delegate also mentioned and
in this also concurred with Americans and
other Canadian delegates who spoke earlier,
that the cultural revolution had been a failure
and that the managerial class seemed to be
progressively taking over from the politicians.
The discussion then turned to Vietnam and
the U.S. delegation inquired of the Canadian
delegate who had related his experience in
China whether he had any views that might
be helpful to the U.S. in arriving at a termination of the struggle in Vietnam. The
Canadian delegate responded by indicating
that he thought that the U.S. must establish a
dialogue with Communist China and that if
China thought that it could obtain what it
desired in Taiwan even if this was many
years away, it might then put pressure on
Hanoi by reducing military supplies to that
government and thereby helping to end the
war in Vietnam.
One of the Canadian delegates asked the
U.S. side to define the current U.S. objectives
in Vietnam. A U.S. delegate indicated that it
was the objective of the U.S. to find a way of
terminating the conflict but we have found no
set way of accomplishing this aim. In response to a suggestion as to the possibility of
a Korean-type settlement, the U.S. delegate
indicated that a Korean-type settlement was
entirely acceptable.
U.S. policy was then reviewed and a U.S.
delegate pointed out that the policy of the
U.S. in Vietnam to resist the aggression from
the north had not changed.
A Canadian delegate asked by the U.S.
could not accept the suggestion of U.N. Secretary General U Thant that the bombing be

terrninated and assume that the U.N. Secretary General was correct in his report that
discussions would follow within two weeks
thereafter. The U.S. delegate reviewed the
resuits of previous bombing pauses and the
frustration wbich these had meant for U.S.
efforts to obtain a peaceful solution. In ahl
cases, North Vietnam had taken efforts to
obtain a peaceful solution. In ahl cases, North
Vietnam had taken advantage of the bombing
pauses to resupply its own people and the long
bombing pause in early 1966 had failed to lead
to any meaningful discussions in spite of the
fact that ail possible intermediaries had been
urged to seek a solution. One U.S. delegate
pointed out that peace was di.fflcult to obtain
with the Communist world. Even ini Korea
there was no negotiated peace 15 years after
the war had ended. Every proposai which had
been made bad been flatly rejected. One
member of the U.S. delegation wanted to
clarify that in spite of the dissent and debate
currently in progress in the U.S. and particularly in the U.S. Congress, not a single U.S.
Presidential candidate was advocating unilateral U.S. wîthdrawal. frorn Vietnam. This U.S.
delegate recapitulated the positions of fihe two
Democratic candidates for the Presidency
wbo are opposed to ]President Johnson's Vietnam policy and showed that the positions of
Senators Kennedy and McCarthy did not
involve a unilateral withdrawal but only a
reduction in the conflict and a cail for greater
activity by the South Vietnamese forces. It
was pomnted out that thxe major thrust of fixe
Administration's policy in Vietnam was also a
reduction in the conflict and a phasing out of
the war. So f ar Hanoi bas flot responded to
this desire.
One U.S. delegate clarified the cause of the
frustration of the American people and pointed out that millions of people were involved
both with the soldiers in Vietnam and the
potential draftees but in spite of these frustrations, it seemed clear to the members of
the U.S. delegation that there bas to be a
meaningful response from North Vietnam
before the bombing could simply be stopped.
The U.S., it was pointed out, cannot take fixe
intitiative if the other side does flot respond.
The suggestion that Canada could act as an
intermediary if through ber contacts she was
able to bring about discussions with the
North Vietnamese was again reiterated. One
member of the U.S. delegation also informed

the Committee of the plan suggested by a
number of Members of the U.S. Congress for
a phased de-escalation of the bombing provided there were verifiable reciprocal responses on the part of the North Vietnamese.
In conclusion, it was recognized that there
were no easy, ready solutions to be offered,
that it would be necessary to explore every
avenue of a possible termination to the conflict and that there was recognition of the
desirability, as suggested by one member of
the Canadian delegation, of reaching and
communicating directly with the Communist
Chinese government in Peking.
There was a concensus in the Committee on
the part of the U.S. delegation that the U.S.
has certainly the will to end the war in Vietnam. So far we have not summoned a way.
The mai ority of the Canadian delegates
indicated great sympathy with the difficulties
of the U.S. in Vietnam and indicated that if
Canada could be helpful in any way it would
be glad to do so.

the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Choquette) be chairman of the Senate
Committee on Divorce.
I think I have no reason ta apologize for
having a special înterest-not a personal
interest at all, but a special interest in tixis
matter. 1 have borne the burden of this committee for the past 15 years, and I have not
counted the hours I have spent.
During the last two sessions, Up until July
2 of this year, I was chairman of the special
committee that produced thxe monumental
report on divorce which has resulted in the
greatest social reform that has taken place
perhaps in the last hundred years. That
reform will affect the lives of more people in
Canada than any other legisiation passed in
Canada, witlx the exception of welfare
legisiation.
I have been rather proud of the fact that it
waa fixe Senate's initiative and drive which
carried this into effect and brought about
the situation wlxich naw exista, where fixe
administration of the laws of divorce of Canada are being carried out not inx this camber
but in the courts of the 10 provinces of
Canada. That is something which 20 years
ago, or even three or four yeara ago, would
have been considered absolutely impossible.
Honourable senators, in 1967 I had ta read
500 reporta of divorce cases. This year there
will probably be more than that. Any idea
that I want ta continue inx that work, is baselesa. Those reporta of fixe judges on an average occupy a page and a haîf of foolscap
paper, single spaced, and each lime must be
checked ta see that every point required is
covered properly anxd sufflciently before it la
approved and laid bef are tlxis house.
He would be very much mistaken who
would think I want ta carry on that work
just for fun. 0f course there is no remuneration in it, other than what we draw as aur
indemnity. We do it juat s0 that it will be a
properly done job, as it has been done for
the hast 15 years.
I amn very happy that we are now practically, if not fully, discharged of that heavy duty
carried by this chamber for the last 100
years, a duty which has grown inx intensity
and burden very greatly in recent yeara. I
hope I have made it understood that I have
no personal intereat whataoever, more tan
any other persan in this chamber, with
regard ta actions which the chamber may
take at this Urne. Sa far as fixe future la

concerned, I shall be very happy indeed to be
free of the heavy burden and responsibilityr
which I have so long borne.
Now, Mr. Chairman, I think we got as far
as paragraphs 4 of the report. But in order to
consider intell.igently the paragraphs that follow paragraph 4-which proposes to repeal
standing rules 133 ta 152 and the forma which
are subjoined with those rules-we must
necessarily consider also paragraph 5, which
repeals the balance of the standing rules,
being rules 153 to 195 and the forms that are
subjoined ta those rules. We must also consider paragraph 6, which repeals Standing Rule
No. 23, item (if) requiring two days' notice for
the adoption of reaolutions of the Senate dissolving or annulling a marriage pursuant to
the Dissolution and Annulment of Marriages
Act. In addition we must consider paragraph
7, which saves rules 153 ta 195 as they apply
to petitions filed under the Dissolution and
Annulmnent of Marriages Act-that is, prior ta
July 2, 1968. That wording ia made necessary
by sections 25 and 26 of the most recent
Divorce Act, which repeals the Dissolution
and Annulment of Marriages Act except as
applied to petitians flled before the coming
into force of that act and before the coming
into force of the Dissolution and Annuinxent
of Marriagea Act.
Some of you understand what I arn saying,
but it must go on the record; for the others
who are not so fa-miliar, I hope they will
follow me. It is under the saving grace of section 25(b) of the Divorce Act that I have been
presenting petitions and moving resolutions
by the hundreds since we assembled in Parliament on September 12 last.
We must also apparently consider paragraphs 8 and 9 of the report. Paragraph 8 repeals standing Rule 110, which consiats of two
parts. The firat paragraph which, according ta
the report, is ta be re-enacted is slightly
altered in language. It is not an important
change. The second paragraph is repealed
outright. It la not re-enacted in the recommendations. That paragraph which is ta be
repealed and not re-enacted provides that
certain standing rules do not apply ta bills of
divorce or ta petitions for such bills.
Let me state it again sa that you will get it
clearly in your minda. The second paragraph
of Rule 110 provides that certain rules shall
not apply ta petitions for divorce or bis of
divorce. Accordingly, were this report adopted as it stands, these rules would tlxereafter
apply ta divorce, and I presume would subatitute for those standing rules which the
report suggests we repeal.

SENATE DEBATES

Now the standing rules thus made applicable to divorce are Rules 107, 110 and 111 to
122. Let me pause to consider paragraph 4,
which would repeal Standing Rules 133 to 152
and the subjoined forms. These are the rules
which were in force prior to the passage of
the Dissolution and Annulment of Marriages
Act in 1963. These rules were with respect to
petitions for private bills of divorce, as they
remained in force concurrently with the Dissolution and Annulment of Marriages Act,
and are still in force and have been in force
for many years prior to the passage of that
act.
Senator Fergusson, to whom I wish to pay
tribute because she has so often assisted me
as chairman, said in a speech on the subject
that we may in the future have petitions for
bills of divorce with which we must deal, or
we may have none. That of course is the
situation. Nobody can see into the future. But
when you consider that we have 10 provinces
and each of those provinces has separate
courts acting under rules which they themselves have formulated, no one can say how
many times citizens of Canada may appeal, as
it were, from these courts to us, not having
had satisfaction in the lower courts. This form
of appeal has been the right of British citizens
for the last 300 or 400 years-the right to
appeal, as they say in rather picturesque language, to the foot of the Throne. The foot of
the Throne in this case is the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Why the Senate alone?

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Because that has been
the traditional way in which bills of divorce
have been dealt with.
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: They do not have to be
done that way. A private bill can be introduced in the other place.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I doubt it. I do not
know that we need to argue it, because it
does not come into the picture now. No one
has done that in the last fifteen years.
Hon. Mr. Asel±ine: It is cheaper to come to

this house.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck:

Then that is a good

reason for petitioners to come to this house in
the future. But whether they come to the
other house or to us, if they are passed by the
other house, then they come here and we
have to deal with them in the ordinary
course. So, I say that we must be prepared to
deal with bills of this kind which may come
to us because of eventualities which neither I

November 14, 1968

nor anyone can forecast. If they do come to
us, we must be prepared to deal with thern in
the future as efficiently as we have done in
the past.
I disagree with the idea which seems to
prevail in places, that there is something
unclean and undesirable in this family litigation called divorce, and that all we have to do
is to turn out the light and it will go away.
Hon. Mr. Croll: It happens that way, does it
not?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: We sometimes turn out

the light for them, and later on they turn on
the light, and perhaps a more brilliant light
for their future.
Honourable senators, for the last hundred
years this Senate has furnished a competent
divorce court, first for the Province of
Ontario and the Province of Quebec, and
then, more recently, since Newfoundland
joined Confederation, for the provinces of
Quebec and Newfoundland. With the passage
of the new Divorce Act the need for this
service has diminished but, as I have just
argued, it has not quite ended and we do not
know how close it is to ending. Everyone must
agree with me that the doors of Parliament
must be ever open to the citizens of Canada
for any form of petition, divorce included. It
has been so in the Parliament of Great
Britain; it has been so here. We must never
close the doors on our citizens for any grievance they may have, or think they possess.
Then, as I have said, should someone petition
the Senate for divorce, we must meet the
challenge efficiently.
The report itself recognizes marriage and
divorce to be within our jurisdiction, and it
refers such matters to the Legal and Constitutional Committee. But it seems to be the purpose of the report to wrap up petitions for
divorce and bills of divorce with all other
petitions for private bills in just one package.
Let me point out the difference between the
incorporation of a company and the dissolution of a marriage. We can amend the Bank
Act or we can approve a railroad extension
without notifying the respondent and the corespondent. In divorce proceedings, which
may proceed to an Act of Parliament, a court
trial must be held in which the parties and
their witnesses are heard under oath and, of
course, under rules of evidence and, under
rules of procedure. The rules of evidence are
laid down in the statutes; the rules of procedure we lay down. It is essential that we have
these rules if we wish to deal justly between

party and party-not forgetting the children.
This is a judicial proceeding and the courts
have always been guided and have guided
others with carefully drawn rules, and sa
have we.
The judges in ail the provinces have diligently formulated rules of procedure since
the passing of the recent Divorce Act. I said I
will let you see the rules adopted by the
Province of Ontario. The Chief Justice of
Ontario very kindly sent me a copy of tese
rules while they were bemng drawn, and I
answered his invitation ta discuss thema with
him. But yau see what the courts have
thought necessary for their guidance and for
the guidance of those who apply ta the courts
of the Province of Ontario under the new
divorce act, which is now in force ini that
province and elsewhere.
Under those circumstances, 1 submit ta the
house that for us ta repeal ail aur specially
designed and relevant ruies respecting
divorce, ta say the least, would be unrealistic.
It's my submission that, notwithstanding this
repart, we must flot repeal aur specially
designed and relevant rules. As Senatar Fergusson said, I arn apposed ta what paragraph
4 suggests-that is, the repeal of Rules 133 ta
152, inclusive, and the subjoined forms.
Honourable senators, let me take a moment
ta consider with you what we would do were
we ta repeal those rules. At page 74 of the
Ruies of the Senate there is provided a generai form. of petitian for those wha wish ta
apply ta the Senate of Canada for divorce
relief. This is for the guidance of members of
the profession and their clients. First they
must prove the marriage. That is usually the
first point that is cleared when the parties
appear before the committee or the Commissioner. The next point ta be proved is domicile; the third, where the parties reside and
their addresses-

and that sort of thing had ta be given. Ahl of
this specifies clearly the issue ta be tried. If
the adultery alleged is with a persan
unknown, we sometirnes allow a petitianer ta
proceed withaut narning a co-respandent;
otherwise the persan must be named.
Then, we require an affidavit verifying the
allegatians in the petitian.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That is nat done in the
courts any mare.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: We have always had
that.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: It is not necessary any
more in the courts of the country, so why
should we have it?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That might be considered in the revisians I arn going ta suggest.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I have handled several
cases in Saskatchewan, and I knaw that has
been done away with.
Hon. Mr. Raebuck: Saskatchewan,

In addition, there is the information which
the petitianer must give ta the respandent.
The petitioner must state the address at

address of the solicitor representing the petitioner, where ail notices and papers may be

SENATE DEBATES
When the petition is by a husband for a
divorce from his wife, and if the wife shows
to the satisfaction of the committee that she
has not the funds with which to pay for her
defence, or has, as it says here, "not sufficient
money to defend herself", the committee may
make an order that the husband shall provide
her with the necessary means to sustain her
defence.
Honourable senators, can you imagine
someone coming to us for a divorce when no
rules exist? Would we hop around like chickens with our heads off? What would we do
about it? Would we ask the chairman of the
committee responsible at that time to furnish
all of that information which we have found
to be essential in the conduct of our affairs
over the last many years? If so, how would
he provide it?
At present all members of the profession
have copies of the rule book, and they know
exactly what is required of them and of their
clients. It is suggested in this report that we
abolish all that, and leave ourselves open to
looking foolish when in the future someone
comes and asks us what is the procedure laid
down for an application to the Senate.
Honestly, honourable senators, it would make
the Senate look foolish. And why? What
would be the idea of abolishing rules such as
those when there is the slightest possibility of
an application coming to us which would
have to be dealt with?
I shall proceed on the assumption, and with
some little confidence, that this chamber will
not do what is suggested in this report; that
we will not abolish these rules, although we
may revise them to some extent, and I suggest that is a task for our experienced counsel
and some small select committee or subcommittee. I would also be bold enough to suggest that it be done in association with those
who have had some experience in the matter
of divorce, although not me necessarily. After
all, my honourable friends, I drew up the
rules under the Dissolution and Annulment of
Marriages Act in association with our counsel, and they have been effective during the
five years they have been in force. Now it
does seem to me unreasonable that I was not
consulted about this report and these
proposed changes in the rules. I saw them for
the first time when we moved into Committee
of the Whole. I can hardly imagine anyone
drawing up a new set of rules for divorce
with the chairman of the committee, of fifteen
years' standing, having no knowledge whatsoever of what was being done until a report is
on the floor of the house.

November 14, 1968

Hon. Mr. Molson: Would my honourable
friend permit a question?

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, but you will have
plenty of time for reply later.
Hon. Mr. Molson: It is not a question of
reply. It is merely that you remarked the
other day that I had had the courtesy to call
on you two days before the report and say
what the committee had done.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: My friend is perfectly
correct in that. He did come to my office, I
appreciated the courtesy, and stated so on a
previous occasion. He asked me what my
view would be on abolishing the Standing
Committee on Divorce and referring the matter to some other committee which he described. I agreed with that because I thought
it unwise to have a standing committee which
may or may not be utterly negative. I thought
it would be wise to have a committee with
plenty to do outside of divorce, if there were
no divorce. I agreed to it and said I would
like to have an understanding that the present members of the Standing Committee on
Divorce, who have served with me for so
very long, and among whom we have established a certain friendship and esprit de
corps, be members of that new committee.
Senator Molson, of course, had no authority
in that regard; that would be something for
the leader and others to take care of later. I
think he thought I was reasonable in that,
and saw no objection.
That is as far as we went. The question of
the rules now before us in a report and the
abolition of the rules to which I have been
speaking was never referred to, and I knew
nothing whatever about it until we were on
the floor of this chamber. However, I have no
complaint. I am only pointing out that I did
not take any responsibility for what is in that
report, and I think it was an extraordinary
thing that it should reach this house without
my knowing anything about it.
Hon. Mr. Molson: I am sorry, Senator
Roebuck, but you did know something about
it. I told you what the committee was proposing, and I said it was the elimination of these
rules in Part III and Part IV. You have forgotten, sir.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: We all forget at times
and I will let it rest at that, that I forgot it. It
does not seem likely, but I take my friend's
word for it.
Now let me read Rule 110. The rule as
re-drawn requires that all bills be filed with

November 14, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

the Clerk of the Senate within the first six
weeks of the session. I would point out that
Rule 138 also does that, so that feature of this
rule is redundant. Rule 110 as re-drawn
provides:
-every
private bill originating in the
Senate shall be presented to the Senate
within two weeks after the petition therefor has been favourably reported upon by
the Examiner of Petitions or by the Committee on Standing Orders.
We have all had a good deal of experience
in these matters. In the past, when a petition
was presented it was referred automatically
by Rule 133 to the Standing Committee on
Divorce. An officer of the Committee's
Branch, who is thoroughly trained in that
regard goes over the petition and if there is
any insufficiency or mistake he points it out.
If he and the lawyer filing the petition cannot
agree, over the last five years there has been
an appeal to the Commissioner and from the
Commissioner to the committee. Under the
old rules, which we are now discussing, if the
officer and the lawyer disagreed there was an
appeal to the Standing Committee on Divorce.
What has the Committee on Standing
Orders to do with a petition of divorce, which
according to this report is within the jurisdiction of the Senate Committee on Legal and
Constitutional Affairs? Can you imagine
dividing responsibility for divorce between
two standing committees, one of them to take
care of I don't know what and the other to
butt in when there is a disagreement between
an official and the lawyer. It is not realistic,
honourable senators.
Let me give you the substance of Rule 133,
under which we have acted for all these
years. Under that rule:
All petitions for divorce and all matters arising out of petitions for, or bills of
divorcewere referred automatically to the Standing
Committee on Divorce. This has been the
practice from time immemorial, and if the
proposed Senate Committee on Legal and
Constitutional Affairs is to have divorce jurisdiction, then divorce petitions and related
matters should go to that committee and not
to some other committee, and they should be
examined by somebody under the jurisdiction
of that committee.
Then what has this two-week limit to do
with divorce bills, two weeks after they are
favourably reported upon by the Examiner of
Petitions, who I presume is Mr. Batt, the

chief of the Committee's Branch? In the past
he appointed one of his staff, and that
arrangement has worked perfectly satisfactorily. This rule says that after he makes a
report of some kind to the Senate, the divorce
bill must be presented. As honourable senators
know, a divorce bill is frequently presented to the Senate months after the petition has
been filed and been approved by the officer in
question. A trial takes place in that interval
to which witnesses are called. The reports in
the old days were made by the committee to
the chamber, and the bill came after that.
What is the sense of this rule? It just has not
any application whatsoever to a system of
divorce.
Paragraph 8 of the report, dealing with
Rule 110, states:
... no motion for the suspension of this
standing order shall be entertained unless
a report has been first made by the Committee on Standing Rules and Orders
recommending such suspension.
Now, every person in this chamber knows
that I have moved for the suspension of rules
perfectly freely for years, and on many, many
occasions. The idea that I should first go from
the Divorce Committee, or the committee later
on having jurisdiction in divorce, to the Committee on Standing Rules and Orders, to obtain a recommendation from them before I
could move here in the house, is just positively ridiculous. The rule in question was
never intended to apply to divorce. It is altogether unfitted for the guidance of divorce
proceedings. Such a provision may be applicable to ordinary private bills, and that was
what it was intended for, but it is altogether
out of line with divorce procedure.
Let us pass on to Rule 111 (1). This makes
the Chief Clerk of Committees the Examiner.
That is perfectly all right. This is similar, but
much better drawn and covered as regards
divorce by Rule 142, so that the proposition is
being stated in two places, and in somewhat
different words. In Rule 111, as drawn in the
report, it is redundant and unnecessary and
should not be allowed. A special clerk in the
committees branch is specially assigned to this
work and should be so assigned in the future,
as he is well informed and well experienced.
Rule 111 (2), as it now stands, is made not
applicable to divorce.
It says so in the rule itself, or did before it
was redrawn. But this is dropped in the
report's redraft. So, if the report is adopted,
Rule 111 would in future apply to divorcethough it never has in the past. This report is

observe that-direct to the Senate, in each
case.
Then Rule 111 goes on to say that should
the examiner find insufficiency, or if the sufficiency is in doubt, he reports to the Committee on Standing Rules and Orders. Well,
could you fancy, honourable senators, being a
member of the Legal and Constitutional Committee, to which is referred all matters arising out of divorce petitions-could you imagine being a member of that committee and
finding, in the midst of your work, that some
question of doubt as to the sufficiency of a
document shall be referred to another standing committee? And that other committee
reports, not to the committee having jurisdiction but to the Senate with its recommendation. That is all right as far as private bills
are concerned-that is what this rule was
drawn for-but to drag it into a divorce rule
is just ridiculous.
Rule 142, as it stands at the moment, convers this situation completely. The chief clerk
of the committees examines the petition and
all other relevant documents and may
require, so the rule says, that the deficiencies
be remedied. Then, if there is a disagreement
between the applicant and the official, there
is an appeal at the present moment, under
the Dissolution and Annulment of Marriages
Act, to the commissioner, and from him again
to the committee. Under the rules which we
are now discussing there is an appeal from
the clerk to the committee-usually handled,
I presume, by the chairman-a very simple,
very effective and very proper procedure.
Not only so, but Rule 142 has its counterpart in Rule 165, that is, the rules under the
Dissolution and Annulment of Marriages Act.
I submit that Rule 142 should be continued,
with any corrections that may be necessary
because a new act has been passed and
should be taken into consideration when we
revise the rules. I do not know if any small
changes are necessary.
So, I submit that Rule 111 should not refer
to divorce.
Honourable senators, let me take up some
other rules which previously had no reference
to divorce and which are now read into this
report. The next one would be Rule 112. It
says:
No motion for the suspension of the
rules upon any Petition for a Private Bill
is in order, unless such suspension bas
been recommended by the Committee on
Standing Orders.

November 14, 1968

Well, gentlemen, as I have already said, this
rule did not in the past apply to bills of
divorce, and I have so moved on numbers of
occasions on behalf of the Divorce Committee.
This rule did not apply in the past: it should
not apply in the future.
According to Rule 113:
Every Private Bill is introduced on
Petition, and presented to the Senate
after the Petition bas been favourably
reported on by the Committee on Standing Orders, or the Examiner of Petitions.
I need hardly comment on it. What I have
said to the other rule is sufficient.
Rule 114 provides that:
Any person seeking to obtain a Private
Bill shall deposit with the Clerk of the
Senate, if it is intended that the Bill shall
originate in the Senate, a copy of such
Bill in the English or French language,
with a sum sufficient to pay for the translation of the same by the officers of the
Senate, and the printing of 600 copies in
English and 200 in French. The applicants
shall also pay the Clerk of the Senate, immediately after the second reading and
before the consideration of the Bill by the
Committee to which it is referred, a sum
of $200, with the cost of printing the Act
in the Statutes, and lodge the receipt for
the same with the Clerk of such
Committee...
Hon. Mr. Moison: Mr. Chairman, on a point
of order, the committee report does not contain any reference to a rule beyond Rule 111.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Oh, yes, it does. I read
the second paragraph of Rule 110:
This Rule,That is, Rule 110-Rule 107, and Rules 111 to 122, both
included do not apply to Bills of Divorce
or to Petitions for such Bills, except in
cases where no special provision is
hereafter made, and which fall under
Rule 151.
The last two lines mean little. I can go into
them, if necessary. But I call your attention
to the wording: "This Rule"-that is, Rule
110-"Rule 107, and Rules 111 to 122, both
included, do not apply to Bills of
Divorce.

. .".

Now, as I have already told you

Rule 110 is to be repealed, by the report. You
have the report before you and you can see it.
Then the first paragraph of Rule 110 is
redrawn. The second paragraph of Rule 110 is

It has been said that in spite of the passage

mons or to the Senate. Such a petition does
not have to be made to the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Croll: No, no.
The Chairman: In my opinion, yes, the
Senate has full capacity. I think it is so stated
in the rules, but I cannot put my finger on it
at the moment.

Hon. Mr. Martin: Yes, that is right. It says
that.
Hon. Walter M. Aseltine: Mr. Chairman, I
shall take only a moment or two. I am afraid
Senator Roebuck is taking this matter too
seriously. Apparently he thinks that the
world is going to come to an end if we do not
keep these rules. I agree with Senator MacKenzie, that if the occasion arises we can re-.
establish them in a moment. Senator Roebuck
seems to be of the opinion that this report
is some reflection upon him and the members
of the Standing Committee on Divorce. That
is far from what is behind the report.
I should like to say that I have been here
for nearly 35 yearsHon. Mr. Martin: In this house?
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: Yes. Before I came to
the Senate I had had considerable experience
in divorce matters in the Province of Saskatchewan. When that fact was known I was
asked to be a member of the Standing Committee on Divorce, and I remained a member
of that committee for some 30 years, during
ten of which I was the chairman. During
those ten years under my chairmanship the
committee disposed of some 4,000 divorce
petitions. I think I am responsible-partially,
at least-for the fact that Senator Roebuck
followed me'as chairman. I went to him and
suggested that he stand for the chairmanship,
and after giving it a lot of thought he agreed
to do so. He has been a wonderful chairman.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: And the committee
under him has done extremely valuable work.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Senator Roebuck just said
that you were a good chairman too.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: During all the time I
was a member of the committee the one thing
I had in mind was to get rid of divorce in the
Senate. Nothing will please me more than to
see these rules taken out of the rule book and
discarded. I do not want to see them again.

Hon. Mr. McDonald: May I ask the honourable senator a question? Such a bill would
have to be passed by both houses, would it
not?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Yes. I am coming to
that.
If the petition is made to the House of
Commons, that house will deal with it, and I
imagine it will get very short shrift there. I
doubt whether that house would pass it,
but if they did, it would then come to this
house in the usual way. If the petition is
made to the Senate, then the Senate will deal
with it, and after giving the bill three readings it would be sent to the other place. I do
not think a bill of divorce, even if it passed
the Senate, would get through the other
house very easily. In fact, honourable senators, I do not think we are going to have any
more of these petitions coming before us.
One of my reasons for saying so is that it is
a very costly matter to have a bill of divorce
passed by Parliament. Courts have now been
set up in all provinces, and it is much cheaper for the litigants to apply to a court for a
divorce than it is to come to Parliament, pay
the parliamentary fee and al the costs of
advertising, and bring counsel and all the
witnesses to Ottawa. I do not think it will
ever be done.
However, if a petition is presented it will
be referred to the Legal and Constitutional
Affairs Committee, and I have no doubt that
the chairman of that committee will be a
lawyer who has had experience in these matters. I know that if I were the chairman of
that committee, and a petition for divorce
came to the Senate, I could deal with it without any rules. I could arrange matters so
that people could come and present their
evidence. The Senate would require that that
evidence be taken under oath, and everything
would be in order. Of course the bill would
have to go to the House of Commons.
It is for these reasons that I am quite anxious that the committee's report be adopted.
As Senator Roebuck has said, there may be
certain other rules that will have to be amend-

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Donald Cameron: Honourable senators,
my interjection will be brief. As one who
has sat on the Standing Committee on
Divorce for nearly 13 years I share Senator
Aseltine's feelings, that I would like to see
divorce out of Parliament once and for all.
Having said that, I take this opportunity of
paying a very special tribute to Senator
Roebuck, under whose chairmanship I sat for
all these years, for doing a very difficult job
in a masterly, warm, human and understanding way. Nothing was too much trouble for
him, and he has exhibited a quality of public
service that should be a model for anyone to
follow in future.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Cameron: I was delighted to hear
him say that he too wants to get divorce out
of the Senate. For a time I was afraid that he
did not want to get rid of it. If I did him an
injustice in thinking that, I apologize. I think
we all want to get it out of the way.
Also, I take this opportunity to pay tribute
to Senator Aseltine for the work he did in the
years he was on the committee. I think particularly of a member of that committee, the
late Senator Gershaw, who carried a very
heavy responsibility with the same sincerity
and dedication as the others.
We have witnessed a magnificent tour de
force by Senator Roebuck this afternoon. I
think it was a useful exercise, because it has
caused us to examine this matter very carefully to see whether or not we are overlooking some important point, something which
frequently happens, as I have observed when
legislation comes before the Senate. At times
very obvious things get overlooked, and I
therefore think Senator Roebuck has this afternoon performed a great service in
meticulously examining this proposal in great
detail.
We all agree we should get this responsibility out of Parliament. We all hope we will
never have divorce petitions coming to Parliament, whether it be to the House of Conmons or the Senate. However, for the very
rare case that may occur, could we not dispose of this matter by an amendment to the
effect that when a petition does come here
the committee may be guided by the rules
that were in existence before we disposed of
the whole subject.

Hon. Mr. Cameron: I noticed that, but if
there is any reason to amplify it or spell it
out more precisely, let us do it.
Hon. Muriel McQ. Fergusson: I shall be
very brief. As you know, on November 7 in
this chamber I expressed my stand on paragraph 4 of the Third Report of the Special
Committee on the Rules of the Senate. I still
oppose paragraph 7, which would repeal
Rules 133 to 152 as they now stand. I might
add that I had not discussed this matter with
Senator Roebuck before I spoke on November
7, nor have I discussed it with him since. I
agree with his stand, although I found his
arguments a little difficult to follow sometimes, and before saying that I agree wholeheartedly with every one of them I should
like to read them again.
I support Senator Roebuck's complaint that
he was not sufficiently consulted. I think that
when the Special Committee on the Rules of
the Senate was making such drastic changes
in the rules on how to handle divorce there
should have been more consultation with the
Chairman of the Standing Committee on
Divorce. I understand that the Chairman of
the Special Committee on the Rules talked to
Senator Roebuck two days before the report
was presented here. From what Senator
Roebuck has said, it would seem he understood that the Standing Committee on Divorce
was to be abolished, but as I understood him
I do not think he had any idea that Rules 133
to 152 were to be done away with.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is right.
Hon Mr. Choquette: How can you abolish a
committee and keep the rules?
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Let me finish.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Go ahead. The chairman is not here. He explained his position
and you are repeating again what he was
accused of.

Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: He said he spoke to
the chairman of the Standing Committee on
Divorce two days before the report was put
in, and I do not think that in itself is sufficient consultation. I have looked at the names
of the members of both committees and I find
there are very few people who have had anything to do with the divorce committee, with
the exception of Senator Haig, who are on
the Committee on Standing Rules and Orders,
Mr. Martin: It is there.
Hon.
and I do not know what Senator Haig's

SENATE DEBATES
report. I did not mean to be quite so emphatic about it, but I still think that the Standing
Committee on Divorce is a very important
committee that has done a great deal of work,
and if another committee is going to be set up
and brush away all the rules that they had
had for dealing with divorce, then I think
there should have been a good deal of consultation between the two committees. This is
only my opinion.
It seems to me that in clearing up the Rules
of the Senate, which I admit we should do, I
agree with a great many things that are being
done. However, in so far as dealing with the
procedure of divorce, it seems to me that we
are proposing to throw out the baby with the
bath water. I would like to make one comment regarding the statement of Senator Choquette, which appears on page 511 of Hansard, where he says we invite people to come
to the Senate for divorces if we retain these
existing rules for dealing with the cases. And
Senator Aseltine has said we are not going to
have any more cases. He may be able to see
into the future; I cannot. I do not think any
of us knows if there are going to be more
cases. It seems to me Senator Choquette's
contention is no more logical and, may I say,
even no more sensibleHon. Mr. Choquelie: Thank you.

of the committee, who had worked on it for
all of these years, was told what was in the
report but was not consulted.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: He was not even told.
Hon. Mr. Croll: The words I have here are
that you were told but not consulted.
I urged Senator Roebuck not to make this
speech this afternoon, and to forget about the
whole business. The matters he brought
before us are of some concern, but it is the
general feeling that we want to be out of this
business. If someone else petitions us at a
future date, we will have to wrestle with it as
we have had to do with other things. I am
sure that if Senator Grosart finds someone a
lawyer and he puts in a petition, it will be
satisfactory and that will be the end of it.
I have thought we ought to get out of this
divorce business as soon as we possibly could.
I do not propose to say any more at the
moment. There are some valuable traditions
in this house that should not be cast aside
quickly. I am not going to say anything more
about it, because I want to get on with the
business of the house. I want to catch a plane
this afternoon-I will have another occasion.
For the present I say I favour getting out of
the divorce business as quickly as possible.

Hon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson: Mr. Chairman, I will be very brief in my remarks. I
was delighted to hear what Senator Croll said
about his first association with the Divorce
Committee. His introduction to that committee was very similar to my own. When I came
to the Senate some years ago, it was Senator
Roebuck himself who came to me and said,
Hon. David A. Croll: In view of the state- "Now, you are a lawyer, you have had some
ments that have been made, I think I should experience with divorce in western Canada,

Divorce Comrnittee, to the Senate itself and
to Parliament than Senator Roebuck. Indeed,
I was well aware that Senator Aseltine had
headed the Divorce Comrnittee with great distinction and ability for rnany years. 1 think
the first chairman I ever met was Senator
McMeans from Winnipeg. Many years ago,
even prior to Senator Aseltine's time, he was
the Chairman
of the Senate Divorce
Committee.
Also I wish ta say that Senator Roebuck
was very dedicated and worked as hard as, or
perhaps harder than, anyone in the Senate ta,
bring about the passage of the Dissolution
and Annulment of Marriages Act. That
indicated ta me that even Senator Roebuck
feit that divorces should be taken out of Parliament as soon as possible.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: They should.
Hon. Mr. Thorvadson: That being his view,
I would have hoped that he would be most
desirous that Parliament really should have
nothing to do with divorce. It has always
been my hope that we would be completely
rid of divorces now.
Consequently, I wondered what Senator
Roebuck meant when he said at the beginning of his remarks: "We must neyer close
the doors on our citizens in regard ta
divorce."
Hon. Mr. Roebucc: Petitions.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: In regard ta petitioning for divorce, I wonder if that is a very
sound position ta, take.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: That is an invitation.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: We have established
courts ta deal with divorce in every part of
Canada. Why should the Senate deal with any
petitions for divorce?
Hon. Mr. Aselfine: Parliament.
Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Why should Parliament deal with any petitions for divorce?
Hon. Mr. Croil: Every subject has a right ta
corne ta the Throne.

for that purpose, the Exchequer Court. Certainly, I would flot agree that anyone has a
right ta corne ini here on a copyright matter,
since it is a subject for courts.
After ail, the Senate Committee on Divorce
was really a court. And under the leadership
that it had it was a mighty good court.
Another matter of federal jurisdiction is
interest. We do not accept petitians here
relating ta interest. That is a subi ect for the
courts. There are courts i every province ta
deal with it, narnely, the common law courts
of this country.
In exactly the samne way, we have provided
courts i every part of Canada to hear
divorce applications. That is my whole argument, that we reaily do not need to, continue
the divorce rules in the Senate.
Surely paragraph 7, which is a transitional
provision, takes care of the whole problem by
ailowing these rules to be used for any petition that might came in here in the future.
We ail recagnize that Senator Roebuck has
been dedicated ta thîs wark, and I admit that
I, as a member of the Rules Committee, just
as well as the chairman, should have came ta
Senator Raebuck early, when we were dealing with this matter, and should have discussed it with him. I did flot do so and I
blame myseif for not having dane so. I quite
agree with Senator Croîl and others, that it
was an errar, it was a mistake, it was a
misunderstanding, it was something which
should have been done and was flot done. We
should have had a full discussion of this matter with Senator Roebuck early in the proceedings of the Rules Commnittee. It was not;
done and I hope that Senatar Raebuck wiil
fargive ail of us for this omission. I arn sure
he will do so, in his usual magnanimaus way.
I urge upon the members of this committee
to, adopt the point of view that the whale idea
of passing the Dissolution and Annulment of
Marriages Act was to take this whole subi ect
matter of divorce away from Parliament and
inta the courts. That being the case, I do not
see why we should not eliminate the divorce
rules, particularly when it has been approved
that any divorce petitions which might came
in here or that Parliament might wish ta deal
with can be deait with under the rules as we
propose ta have them.

I wish to answer the statement made by my

that the doors of Parliament must always be

THE SENATE
REPRINTING OF BROCHURE

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Keith Davey: Before the Orders of the
Day are called, I rise briefly on a point of
privilege. I have in my hand an illustrated
brochure of the Senate of Canada. Honourable senators will recognize it as the one
distributed daily to the visitors to the gallery
and elsewhere.
This brochure is attractive and informative;
it is well produced; and it is totally out of
date. Indeed, the seating plan contained in
this brochure is for the Second Session of the
27th Parliament and, of course, we are now
in the First Session of the 28th Parliament.
This seating plan is at least 15 months out of
date. There is a current seating plan which is
for internal use only. It is in mimeograph
form and is not distributed to our visitors.
What is the net result of this? In the folder
which our guests in the galleries receive day
after day-and as I am sure honourable senators will study with great interest-48 seats
are incorrectly identified, and 11 new senators are not even listed. One of the new senators who is not listed is the very Leader of the
Government. There are nine senators listed
who are no longer in the chamber. This could
be an advantage to us when you consider that
included are such luminaries as Wallace
McCutcheon and Ross Macdonald. It may be
to our advantage to have people think that
Senator Aird is Senator McElman. It could be
to Senator Hays' advantage to have people
think he is Senator Denis. However, it is also
possible that Senator Keith Laird may have
some misgivings when people think he is
Senator Kinnear. How can that charming lady
ever be content when people are thinking she
is Senator MacKenzie? I could go on. I hasten
to say, however, that I have absolutely no
objection to visitors in the galleries thinking
that I am Senator Jean-François Pouliot.
Indeed, it is a privilege. My main concern is
for my old friend Senator Andrew Thompson,
because when people referring to this out-

November 19, 1968

dated brochure look down from the galleries
they will, of course, assume he is the former
Commissioner of the Canadian Football
League. I would not wish that on anyone,
even at Grey Cup time.
In any event, I think honourable senators
will take my point: it is about time we had a
new brochure for distribution in the galleries
of the Senate.
The Hon. the Speaker: The question of
privilege just raised by honourable Senator
Davey is well taken. I will discuss the matter
with the appropriate authorities to see that an
up-to-date pamphlet is prepared for distribution as soon as possible.
NATO
CANADA'S PARTICIPATION-FURTHER INQUIRY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Allister Grosari: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are called, I
wish to direct a rather lengthy question to the
Leader of the Government. I have broken it
up into eight sub-questions. I may say that I
have given the Leader notice of these questions and provided him with a copy.
The questions, which refer to the recent
ministerial meeting of NATO in Brussels, are
as follows:
1. Did Canada undertake any new commitments or agree to assign any additional forces to NATO during last week's special Ministerial Meeting in Brussels?
2. Do the six ships (four destroyers and
two supply ships) which the Minister of
National Defence referred to at the special NATO Ministerial Meeting in Brussels last week constitute a Canadian commitment to the Alliance?
3. Paragraph 12 of the Communiqué
states that the Alliance is of "indefinite
duration" and that it is "more than ever
necessary". Has Canada in subscribing to
the Communiqué indicated that it will
remain in the Alliance?
4. Did NATO extend its protection to
any non-NATO states in Europe?
5. If not, does this mean that NATO
countries, particularly in Europe, assume
no responsibility for the security of their
neighbours which might come under
attack?
6. Is NATO developing contingency
plans which would involve extension of

before we allow it ta pass. The amendments
that I wish made have been read, and it will
be noticed that they concern the clauses dealing with the advertising and sale, et cetera,
of contraceptives.

countries where this same thing has been
done, and the results are not good. Suicides
and all sorts of illness have been caused by
these devices. We know nothing about these
contraceptives. We do not know how they are
made, or of what they are made. Are we
going to allow our young people to have free
access to such things? I am not particularly
concerned about married couples, because
they have had experience. Some of their
experiences may not have been good, and
they would like to avoid them in the future,
but this measure is not going to be in the best
interests of our young people, or of Canada.
In moving this amendrnent I am asking
honourable senators to consider again this
particular bill which amends the Criminal
Code. I ask you to consider it before you pass
it. I am sure that there are other honourable
senators who will have something to say on
this matter. For that reason, and because I
spoke on it at length a few days ago, I shall
say nothing more. It is my opinion that we
should not pass these particular clauses until

months. If I know anything about children,
they will put them in their pencil cases just
as they put packages of bubble gum now.
What can we expect of future generations?
Do we have to make things worse than they
are today? Some people will say, "But, they
are available now." Sure, they are available
now. So are all of these narcotics and LSD,
but they are not easy to obtain. Why should
we make it easier to obtain contraceptives? If
this bill passes in its present form, I can
visualize that in the near future these things
will be sold in the corner store, and advertised like hot dogs.

It is said that we will have regulations, but
what will those regulations be? I want to see
the regulations now. To be told that regulations will be passed three months from now
does not satisfy me. I want to know all about
those regulations now, including the attitude
and thinking of the persons who will draft
them.
Honourable senators, what have we to gain
by passing a bill that makes legal the sale of
the instruments of sin; instruments that break

Hon. Mr. Choquette: Honourable senators,

I do not think it would be proper to go on

which it could do this evening. The Committee of the Whole could then resume its

POVERTY
MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL
COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Tuesday, November 12, the adjourned debate on the motion of
the honourable Senator Croll that a special
committee of the Senate be appointed to
investigate and report upon all aspects of
poverty in Canada.
Hon. G. Percival Burchill: Honourable
senators, I do not feel that I can add very
much to this interesting debate, but the
speeches of some of the preceding speakers
have prompted me to make a few observations. I come from the Maritimes, a section of
Canada whose people were described some
years ago-that was before Newfoundland
came into Confederation-by a correspondent
of an Ottawa newspaper, in an article he
wrote after touring the area, by three letters
"P, P, and P,", which stand for "poor, proud
and patriotic."
Before dealing with the motion, I wish to
join with other speakers in congratulating
you, Sir, on your elevation to the very honourable position of Speaker of this chamber. I
endorse what Senator Cameron said a few
days ago, when he referred to the very dignified and capable manner in which you have
presided over the proceedings of the chamber
since you assumed office.
I also think that we should congratulate
ourselves that the responsibility of government leadership-which Senator John Connolly carried with such ability, earning the
high regard and respect of senators on both
sides of the house-has been assumed by a
most distinguished Canadian statesman, the
Honourable Paul Martin. Senator Martin has
had a brilliant career in public service during which he has played an important role in
moulding the Canadian nation.
I assume that what we want to achieve for
Canada is a highly developed society with
widespread economic well-being, character-

Novernber 19, 1968

DEBATES
Noveber19. 968SENATE

ized by an economic policy of full employment and an adequate system of social security. That is our objective as parliamentarians,
and in that concept no political party, whatever its economic policy, can close its eyes to
the problem of poverty.
The state is no longer concerned, as it was
at the beginning of the century, merely with
maintaining law and order. Economic aid i
one form or another is now recognized as indispensable. The committee which is proposed
in Senator Croll's resolution should lay down
the guidelines for working towards that objective-and in attempting such a study I amn
confident that we have the whole-hearted
approval of Canadian public opinion. I can
speak only of conditions as I knýow them in
the rural areas.
While poverty is poverty wherever one
meets it, in the large urban centres it presents
different aspects, such as crowded slums
which we are not faced with to such an extent
in rural communities. Senator Edgar Fournier
in his excellent
(Madawaska-Restigouche),
speech, made a good presentation of the case
as we know it in New Brunswick. In that
connection, I would like to congratulate hlm
on the admirable way he expresses himself in
his second language.
Senator Fergusson has described the method of maintaining the poor in days now happily gone by, when the lowest bîd was
accepted by the commissioner of the poor for
the shelter and board of poor people, those
bids being based on the amount of work they
could get out of the pauper. I recaîl my
grandfather's distress over the saine practice
which took place in his day in our community. With the assistance of others, he started a
campaign for the erection by the municipality
of a Poorhouse to shelter and keep these
needy people. The Poorhouse, as it was
known, later was destroyed by fire and was
replaced by a quite pretentious building. This
was called an A]mshouse, but it neyer recovered from. the stigma and disgrace of the
namne Poorhouse and was always regarded as
a place of last resort.
When the municipal councils of New Brunswick were abolished in 1966, the Northumberland County Council, as its last act,
resolved to use its remaining funds for the
worthy purpose of providing a home for our
senior citizens. So, wîth financial assistance
from the provincial and federal Governments,
the almshouse was demolished and a very
attractive and comfortable senior citizens'
29234--364

home, with every modern convenience and
equipment, was erected, on the samne site
overlooking the Miramichi River. Nursing
services are available, and in fact the whole
project is one of which. ail classes in the coinmunity are proud. That new building is
already full to capacity.
What has happened in my community of
Northumberland-Miramichi has happened in
many other localities in New Brunswick, and
is striking evidence of the progress and
advance made in public thinking on the
municipal and community level, in the towns
as well as the rural areas of New Brunswick,
for the care of our less fortunate citizens. In
addition, in towns and cities all over Canada
there are a great many service clubs and
other groups who are devoting a lot of time,
money and voluntary effort towards helping
people who need help. Moreover, large sums
of money are dispensed each year in our cities through the United Appeal Fund and
numerous other charities. All these are indications of the feeling of the people and their
desire to help the less fortunate. So, 1 can
hardly agree with Senator Carter when he
speaks of the "apathy of the well-off
majority."
When we corne to the federal level, what
do we find? Senator Carter has submitted
figures showing that Canada is spending
annually about $3 billion on welfare. I have
put together some figures showing the breakdown of that total which was distributed in
the Province of New Brunswick for the last
fiscal year. I find that there was distributed
for family allowances, family assistance,
youth allowances, and Old Age Security a
total of $26 million; and for Old Age Assistance, Blind Persons' Allowances, and Unempioyment Insurance a further $5 million,
which is increased to $10 million by the share
paid by the provincial government. In addition to that, for three months of the fiscal
year, under Canada Assistance, there is a further amount whîch, with the provincial government's share, amounts to $3 million, making a total of approximately $40 million. This
is apart fromn the Veterans' Allowances.
When you project these figures across
Canada you arrive at Senator Carter's total of
$3 billion which, with the voluntary efforts of
our citizens to which. 1 have alluded, I think
speaks very well for the desire, if not the
efforts, on the part of Canadians to help their
fellowmen.
It is a happy coincidence that Senator Crol
should have introduced the resolution which

SENATE DEBATES

has precipitated this interesting debate, as
one of the first items of business in this first
session of the Senate under the leadership of
a Canadian statesman who, while Minister of
Health and Welfare, played a very important
part in establishing and administering the
Canadian social security policies. At the same
time I cannot resist the opportunity of
reminding the house that New Brunswick had
the distinction of appointing the first Minister
of Public Health in the British Empire, in the
person of the late Dr. W. F. Roberts who was
appointed in 1917.
Senator O'Leary (Carleton), in his usual
eloquent style made a good speech in which
he expressed this view:
that the committee should take a meaningful look at our social security system
and see what is good in it-see that we
are not encouraging indolence and making sure that we are not subsidizing and
perpetuating poverty, making dependence
on the state a way of life and thereby
undermining the worth and the dignity of
the individual.

November 19, 1968

Honourable senators, I think this is a scandalous situation. I feel very strongly that
blind persons should be considered in a category by themselves, and that pensions under
the Blind Persons Act should be adjusted
so as to be adequate for the respective needs
of the blind person. They should not have to
battle financial worries along with the nervous
tension caused by the loss of their sight.
Coming back to Senator O'Leary's comments,
I think the committee's objective in examining social welfare policies should be to find
ways to help people help themselves. There
are other kinds of poverty-poverty of imagination, poverty of opportunities, and poverty
of education, as well as poverty of wealth.
Senator MacKenzie's story of the young
man from his community who became general
manager of one of our banking institutions
can be repeated in many other communities
in the Atlantic provinces where young men
have gone out from humble homes and
achieved positions of great distinction and
responsibility in the professional, educational,
religious and commercial life of Canada. They
helped themselves. One of my happiest recollections is that of recommending a boy from
our community, who came from very humble
circumstances, to enter a bank in which he
rose to become general manager.
I agree with what Senator McDonald said
about the danger of establishing industries
through government bonus or financial assistance for the production of goods in which at
present the supply is greater than the
demand. Provincial governments, in their
urgency to create more jobs, have done a
great disservice to the economy by encouraging and, in many cases, assisting in the establishing of industries where a deferment
would have been much wiser.
However, we must never let up using our
ingenuity and imagination, our energy, our
venture capital and our competence in seeking outlets for new products which will create
jobs for the jobless. To me, there is nothing as
tragic as a man who wants to work and cannot find a job.
The subject of poverty is a very complex
one and will require a lot of study, but I
think it is well worth the effort and that
Senator Croll is to be commended for introducing the resolution.

Those are very wise words and I endorse
them.
But in that "meaningful look" I hope the
Canadian National Institute for the Blind,
which is doing such wonderful work, will
present its brief-which I understand is to be
presented to the Government-asking for
more realistic pensions for blind persons.
Blind persons' pensions are paid under the
Blind Persons Act, and to show you how
inadequate this act is I want to tell you of a
totally blind widow in my community, whose
pension, after deducting $75 per month which
comes from her husband's estate and a further amount for shelter, amounted to $44 per
month. In October, 1967 this widow received
notice from the Department of Health and
Welfare of the Province of New Brunswick to
the effect that as her son had reached the age
of sixteen years he could no longer be considered a dependent under the Blind Persons
Act and, consequently, her pension would be
reduced to $3.85 per month, which is the
amount she still gets under that act. This lady
is under a physician's care but on account of
her circumstances is obliged to do her own
cooking and care for her household. Happily,
the local government officials who administer
social welfare are humane gentlemen, and
they came to the rescue and found a way to

The Chairmnan: Then we corne to paragraph

Hon. Harfland De M. Maison: Mr. Chairman, in rising to participate in the debate on
paragraph 4 of the interim report of the Special Committee on the Rules of the Senate,
allow me to assure you I have no desire to
prolong unnecessarlly oui- discussion. However, it appears that we have reached a point in
our deliberations where a certain amount of
recapitulation might be helpful.
The interim report before us contains
recommendations on two subjects: one, the
structure of the committee system, and, two,
the Rules of the Senate pertaining to Divorce.
1 note with pleasure that the first subject area
reported on has been adopted by the Senate
with certain beneficial modifications. The
second subject, however, has received a
mixedreception, anida numiber of statemfents

have been made in the debate which I feel
require comment by me both in my individuai capacity and as chairman of the Committee
on the Rules.
I propose to leave aside for the moment the
substantive issues raised by Senator Roebucç,
and refer first to the criticisms made of the
manner in which the special committee has
proceeded on this subject.
This was first expressed by Senator
Roebuck on November 6, at the very outset of
our consideration of the report of the special
committee, and repeated by him on several
occasions. On November 6 Senator Roebucc
said:
I have seen this document for not more
than five minutes.
Then on November 14 he said:
Now it does seemn to me unreasonable
that I was not consulted about this report
and these proposed changes in the
rules. ..
And on the same day hie used these words:
..s you see, this report was not very
a
carefully considered.
As a resuit of this a few other members,
notabiy Senator Croll, Senator Fergusson and
Senator Thorvaldson, also expressed in the
debate certain reservations about your committee's course of action. We even received
what appeared to be an expression of nonconfidence from our leader when he stated
that:
... if anyone is at fault in the matter of
his (Senator Roebuck) not having been
more fully consulted, I must take that
responsibllity and I do. I do so because,
as Leader of the Government in the
Senate I had a great deal ta do with the
selection of the personnel of that
committee.
Honourable senators, this is quite a litany.
In the face of it, may I siinply say that your
committee is just that-your comimittee-and
is the willing servant of the wirfhes of this
chamber. In its defence and in my defencefor even though the report before you carnies
the unanimous judgment of the members of
the committee, I as chairman feel these criticisms more directly-I wish to remind you of
the sequence of events leading up to the
interim, report.
Honourable senators will recail that thç
special committee was established on Thursday, September '19, and its membership

SENATE DEBATES

appointed on Thursday, October 3. The terms
of reference of the committee clearly identified it as one which would be of interest and
relevance for all senators. In presenting the
first report of the committee on October 9, I
reaffirmed the significance of this committee
for all senators and indicated that a heavy
schedule of hearings had been agreed upon in
order to arrive at a final report by Christmas.
I then went on to say:
... every senator is most welcome to
attend the meetings of the committee,
and... we will expect their attendance in
considerable numbers. Furthermore... if

they have any points of view or ideas in
connection with the practice and Rules of
the Senate, we would welcome their submissions either in writing or by their
presence at committee meetings.
The response to this invitation has been
heartening, but scarcely overwhelming. Senators have attended sittings of the committee
and written submissions have also been
received. However, Senator Roebuck, because
of his other numerous and heavy duties and
commitments, did not attend any of the meetings of the special committee. In these circumstances, and at the time that the committee was dealing with the rules governing
divorce, I called on Senator Roebuck to
apprise him of your committee's activities
and to advise him of the consensus reached.
It is a source of regret to me that a degree
of misunderstanding exists about our meeting.
It is my recollection that I advised him of the
committee's views not only in respect of the
committee structure of the Senate, but also in
respect of the Rules of the Senate governing
divorce petitions. In any event, I can assure
all honourable senators that my purpose in
calling on Senator Roebuck was certainly not
to inform him of one development and not
the other.
While it is true that I did not leave a copy
of the report with Senator Roebuck, it was
for the very good reason that the report itself
was not finalized until Thursday, October 31,
the day it was presented to the chamber and
printed as an appendix to the Debates of the
Senate. The report was then available to all
senators for nearly one week prior to its first
consideration in this chamber and it seems to
me unjust to imply, as was done, that the
matter was being proceeded with without
proper notice.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

November 19, 1968

Hon. Mr. Molson: Your committee may be
guilty of errors of commission and omission,
but I doubt if the failure to refer to Hansard
is one of them.
Moreover, honourable senators, all the
elements of a tempest in a teapot appear to
be present on this question of consultation by
your committee, for the hard facts are that
the Senate has now had the very welcome
benefit of Senator Roebuck's views on the
substance of the interim report prior to a
final decision being made on the merits.
Further, as a result of the debate last Thursday, the special committee has met and
specifically considered the observations of
Senator Roebuck.
In putting forward the recommendations it
did on October 31, your committee was
unanimously of the opinion that its position
was consistent with the new status quo in
Canada in respect of divorce, given that
paragraphs 2 and 7 of the interim report continue intact and unaltered in respect of the
Senate Standing Committee on Divorce and its
procedures for as long as there are divorce
petitions not yet disposed of.
Your committee has two observations to
make. First, there have been no petitions
received since the coming into force of the
Divorce Act on July 2 last. More significantly,
no one can recall Parliament's acting on a
petition for divorce from an applicant who
was entitled to seek relief through the courts.
Therefore, the circumstances under which
Parliament would consider a new petition for
divorce appear very remote. Secondly, the
circumstances would be so exceptional-perhaps we have to imagine a Canadian Henry
the VIII-that the value of a set of rules,
originally designed to fill in provincial gaps
by a federal judicial system, is questionable.
On the other hand, if we retain these rules
your committee is of the opinion we would be
creating a myopic situation of divorce, for the
existence of these rules would suggest a continuing active role for Parliament in divorce,
whereas this responsibility is now ceded to
the judiciary without denying any inherent
right.
Senator Roebuck also suggested in his address last Thursday that change in these rules
was "a task for our experienced counsel and
some small select committee or subcommittee."
I should simply like to record that it is indeed
a task for "our experienced counsel," and we
have had the benefit of his very able assistance and advice on this complex subject, as

November 19. 1968

well as that of Senator Thorvaldson and
Senator Haig, a former and a present member of the Divorce Committee. Your committee also sought the advice of the law officers
of the Crown at the time it was seized of this
matter, and is grateful to Mr. D. S. Maxwell,
Deputy Minister of Justice, and Miss MacDonald, Advisory Counsel, Department of
Justice, for their co-operation in testifying on
the very matter under discussion.
I believe it would be of assistance to
honourable senators if I referred directly to
the Minutes of Proceedings of the Special
Committee on the Rules of the Senate. Referring to Meeting Number 9, October 29, 1968,
there is the foilowing:
Present: Honourable Senators
Macdonald (Cape
Molson
Breton)
Choquette
Martin
Desruisseaux
McDonald
Everett
Phillips
Lang
(Rigaud)
Leonard
Thorvaldson
White
In attendance:
E. Russell Hopkins, Law Clerk and Parliamentary Counsel
R. J. Batt, Assistant Law Clerk and Chief
Clerk of Committees
David R. Dehier, Special Counsel
Witnesses
Department of Justice:
D. S. Maxwell, Deputy Minister
Miss E. I. MacDonald, Advisory Counsel,
Legisiation Section.
Referring now to the business transcript of
that meeting, I read as follows:
It was moved anid unanimously
resolved that Rules 133-152, both inclusive (part of Part III), Rules 153-195,
both inclusive, (ail of Part IV) and the
forms of each part sub-joined, be
repealed. ."' et cetera.
I think you have there an indication that in
considering the divorce rules the matter was
flot deait with in haste. It was not deait with
by any rump session. It was not deait with
without the best parliamentary legal advice
the committee could get, and that after a
funi study of the matter the comrnittee
reached a unanimous decision.
In summary, honourable senators, your
commîttee has foilowed with interest the
course of debate on its interimn report, has
further considered its conclusions in the light

of Senator Roebuck's address, but for the
reasons I have expressed does not feel a substantive amendmnent to this part of its report
is warranted. I arn instructed to recommend
the adoption of paragraphs 4 to 10 now before
the Committee of the Whole on behaîf of the
Special Committee on the Rules of the Senate.
Hon. L. P. Beaubien: Honourable senators,
I wish to say one word on the old rules of
divorce. First, however, I should like to say a
word to Senator Roebuck. Over the course of
the last several years I have sought his help,
having been asked to do so by parents of
people who were seeking divorce, and I cannot tell you how kindly, how willing and how
helpful he was, even at a tirne when I think
he had more work than he could handie. I
therefore say to him now how very grateful I
arn for his help.
Honourable senators, I consulted the Chief
Clerk of Committees and, as Senator Molson
pointed out, according to the Chief Clerk no
petition has ever been received from a province that had its own divorce courts. Ten
provinces have their own divorce courts. It
therefore does not seem. to make much sense
to me to put a lot of rules on the book if we
are not going to use them.
In Hansard of last Thursday, November 14,
at page 544, the honourable Leader of the
Government is reported as saying something
to which Senator Molson referred but which I
should also like to read. He said in part:
... it has been recognized that the Senator Roebuck has had a long connection
with these matters and, if anyone is at
fault in the matter of hîs not having been
more fully consulted, I must take that
responsibility and I do. 1 do so because,
as Leader of the Government in the
Senate, I had a great deal to do with the
selection of the personnel of that
committee.
I was not in the chamber when the honourable leader made that statement and it is
quite possible that he conveyed a totally different impression when he said it than I got in
reading his words. But to me, he is beating
his breast and saying, "I sinned also; I
appointed the wrong people to the committee." Now, honourable senators, if that was
not the Government leader's intention, it
seems to be only fair to our very distinguished comnnittee that he should set the
record right. I do not think this remark in
Hansard conveys-at least, certainly not in
my opinion-thue proper evaluation of the
work of our comniittee.

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. Paul Martin: I am very grateful to
Senator Beaubien (Bedford) for the remarks
he has made. This is a pretty good example
of what Mr. Gladstone said, when referring to
a tribute he paid to one of his fellow members, "Unless you are very careful at all times
with every word, what may be designed as a
tribute may be construed as a criticism."
I think anyone who was in the chamber
Thursday last will recall the circumstances.
We had listened to an able argument by
Senator Roebuck. On November 14 last at
page 544 of Hansard, I said that Senator
Roebuck has had a long connection with these
matters. What I was endeavouring to do was
to indicate as politely and as forcefully as I
could to Senator Roebuck that I fully
appreciated his sensitivity in the matter, and
It was for that reason that I referred, as
indeed the honourable senator himself has,
to his long connection with divorce matters in
the Senate. But before I said that-after
Senator Roebuck had spoken and had made
his argument-I went on to say:
Clearly, there has developed a consensus
in the Senate on this matter.
I was saying, I think, very clearly, that in so
far as I could judge from the reaction of
honourable senators, while we appreciated
the remarks that Senator Roebuck had made,
there was not wide agreement with what he
had said. That is what I said-that there had
developed a consensus not in support of this
general thesis. Then I went on to say that I,
as Leader of the Government, had the responsibility of selecting members of this committee. What I was trying to do when I said
that was to relieve Senator Molson of the
criticism which was implied in what Senator
Roebuck had said. If there was any criticism
to be levelled, it should not have been directed at Senator Molson but at me. So having
done my best to deal with Senator Roebuck,
and my very best to deal with Senator Molson, I find that I have incurred the wrath,
certainly of Senator Molson, and I suspect
also now of Senator Roebuck. I am sure it is
very clear from the context that both Senator
Choquette and I-

November 19, 1968

Roebuck but suggestions which incorporated
his ideas, and I seized upon his reference to
these suggestions as being a presentation that
did not amount to an amendment, and I
thought that the most satisfactory way of concluding the proceedings on Thursday was to
suggest that Senator Roebuck's observations,
which had been placed before us in written
form, might be referred to the committee.
They were not in the form of an amendment,
and they were not intended by him or taken
by me as amendments. I was grateful to
Senator Choquette for accepting my suggestion and I think that, without having conferred with one another, we both agreed that
this was the happiest way of dealing with the
situation. I hasten to add at once to Senator
Molson that there could really be no construction placed on my words that would warrant
the mild rebuke which he so ably gave me a
few moments ago.
I am on record as having said that this
committee has been doing a very useful job. I
am on record as having said that the committee received from Senator Molson very good
leadership in this matter. I told him so privately, and I repeat it now. I am only sorry
that my good intentions were misconstrued. I
hope that this will put the matter in proper
focus.
In doing so, and giving a flavour to what I
say now, may I say how happy I am to see
the Leader of the Opposition (Honourable Mr.
Flynn) back in his seat. I am sure that if he
had been here he would have taken the same
position as Senator Choquette, who performed his duties admirably and helped us
out that day.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. David Walker: Honourable senators, it
is a wonderful thing to see that there is neither Liberal nor Conservative here tonighteverybody is being perfectly independent.

his words, but as Acting Leader of the Oppo- the bill under which the Rules Committee
sition, he was trying to be helpful. We had have seen fit now to abolish the old rules
before us, not an amendment by Senator in connection with divorce.

November 19, 1968

Noveber19. 998SENATE
DEBATES

Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Waiker: We have to give Senator
Roebuck credit for that, because had he flot
done this it wouid have been impossible to do
what is proposed at this tirne.
The Rules Cornrittee is a magnificent comrnittee, and 1 arn proud to pay rny tribute to
Senator Molson, its chairman and an
independent member. He is always independent of this charnber, and he has been chairing
this cornmittee and giving us leadership
under these circumstances.
Honourabie senators, to clear up any
rnisunderstanding between Senator Moison
and Senator Roebuck, rnay I say it is true
that Senator Moison did consuit Senator
Roebuck. He remirided hlm of that on
November 14 last, as reported at page 532 of
the Debates of the Senate:
I had the courtesy to call on you two
days before the report and say what the
committee had done.
And Senator Roebuck replied:
My friend is perfectiy correct in that. He
did corne to rny office, I appreciated the
courtesy, and stated so on a previous
occasion.
Now there can be no feelings which are outraged. We are talking now about the real
issue here. Feelings are gone. Senator
Roebuck has put through the divorce bill
which makes it possible for us to clear up the
rules of the house. Thank God we are getting
rid of divorce rules; we have always wanted
to do that. This has been a chain around our
necks for years, and Senator Roebuck and rny
good friend and former leader, Senator Aseltine, have laboured hard in the vineyard in
attempting to discharge this very onerous
duty.
We have for the first time an opportunity
now to get rid of these rules, mnade possible
through Senator Roebuck. Some of the provinces rnight have held out on this, but they
did not. Ail 10 provinces have accepted the
divorce bill and have promulgated their own
rules, so that at the present time in ail 10
provinces divorces are being tried. Those of
you who are at the Bar know what a wonderfui thing it is to be able to go into a court of
law to get a divorce and have the rules of
evidence appiy and the matter discharged li
a proper way without ail the extra expense
invoived in corning to the Senate.

Now, if these 10 courts in our 10 provinces
cannot discharge their duties in the trial
courts, people have a right to go to the courts
of appeal. Surely that is enough opportunity
for any person who wants to get a divorce. On
the other hand, if there shouid be-and I can
only think of this as a hypotheticai casesorneone who does not get justice, who then
wants to corne to the foot of the Throne,
corne to Parliament, he can do so either by a
petition to the House of Cornrons or by a
petition to the Senate. I wouid suggest that he
wouid get a rnuch better reception at the
Senate. But why, oh, why, and under what
circumstances, would any petitioner want to
do so? He bas the right, of course, but, after
going through the courts, why wouid he feel
that he had been wrongly done by, judged as
he is by judges trained in the law, and aided
by iawyers trained in the iaw? Why wouid he
want to corne here? But if he did corne here,
he could do so by petition which would eventually have to go through both bouses.
This has not; happened. No one has brought
or even suggested bringing a petition to
either one of the houses, nor is it conternplated that anybody would. But, if a petition is
brought, it can be brought before the Legal
Cornrittee and, if there are any ruies that
need to be invoked, that can be done overnight or, at the iongest, within 48 hours. Al
the ruies can be brought back again to deal
with that lone petition. But until that time
cornes, why should we, who are trying to
divorce ourseives o! divorce, encourage peopie to corne here when they have ample
opportunity li the trial division and in the
court of appeal in whatever province they are
dorniciled? Wihy do we keep the rules here in
the hope that perhaps sornbeody wiil corne
back to us?
This thing is out. Let us abolish the rules.
Let us abolish themn forever. Let us ciean
house thoroughly. lI this I think Senator
Roebuck should forget about his "lbaby"l and
be giad to be rid o! this thing forever. This la
rny suggestion to him.
These new rules caliing for the aboition o!
the rules lin divorce have been approved not
oniy by the very learned rnernbers of this
non-political cornrittee, but, in addition, by
very distinguished counsei-both those who
have been ernpioyed by the Ruies Cornmittee
and our own esteerned Senate counsei. These
are important considerations that we shouid
have li mind. Let us dlean out the stable. Let
us get rid o! titis thing forever. If perchance

SENATE DEBATES
there should in the future happen to be
something which, after going through the
courts of the provinces, appears to be an injustice, the matter can be brought before the
Legal Committee and can be dealt with
promptly and efficiently.
But let us not retain something that is
passé, which we have been trying for all
these years to get rid of; let us not keep it
among our rules and thereby invite further
submissions to the Senate on this vexed
question of divorce.
It is a wonderful thing for me to be here
tonight and to see the change in the debate
between senators on the Liberal side and
senators on the Conservative side, and to find
that in this debate above all else we are trying to give our honest views to solve this
vexed problem. Everybody, including Senator
Roebuck, yes, and Senator Croll, have shown
themselves to be as anxious to be rid of these
rules as we are. It is unusual to have Senator
Croll agreeing that perhaps Senator Roebuck
might be a little bit wrong. The Gold Dust
twins have broken up for a moment. This
Committee of the Whole has an able chairman, so let us get on with the business of
these rules and above all else get rid of the
rules on divorce.

[English]
The purpose of this bill is to incorporate a
new Canadian life assurance company ta
carry on the business of insurance, including
life, personal accident and sickness, throughout Canada. This would enable Union Mutual
Life Insurance Company of Portland, Maine,
an existing company domiciled in the United
States but doing business in Canada, to cease
doing business in our country. Thus, Union
Mutual would move to Canada the servicing
of its prescrit Canadian business so that it
could be done by Canadians and, to a large
extent, be controlled by Canadians.
The new company will have a capital of $1
million and a surplus of $500,000 paid in before it starts business. It will specialize in
low-cost, non-cash value group insurance. Its
head office will be in Westmount, Quebec. At
the beginning of its operations, the stock of
the company will be wholly owned by Union
Mutual Life Insurance Company of Portland,
Maine, in the United States. Within five years
of commencement of operations Union Mutual
will offer 25 per cent of its interest to Canadian shareholders, and within a period of 10
years it will offer another 24 per cent on the
Canadian market. Thus, it is expected that
within 10 years, 49 per cent of the company's
stock will be owned by Canadians. The bill
further provides that if those targets are not
attained, the proceedings at a general meeting of the company, at which the voting
rights held by non-residents have been exercised, could be declared void by a resolution
passed at a special general meeting.
The provision that the divestiture be cut
off at 49 per cent deserves further explana-

November 19, 1968

tion. The amendments made to the federal
insurance act in 1964 provide in particularand I refer to section 16D of the act-that
when the total number of shares held by a
non-resident exceeds 10 per cent, such nonresident, either by proxy or in person, cannot
exercise the voting rights pertaining to such
shares.
However, section 16 F(2) exempts any company from the operation of section 16D, as
long as more than 50 per cent of the shares of
the capital stock are held by a non-resident.
In other words, if Union Mutual were to
divest itself of 51 per cent of the stock of the
new company, and keep only 49 per cent or
less, it would then be unable to exercise its
voting rights. This obviously would be unacceptable to Union Mutual and unreasonable to
expect.
Union Mutual was organized in 1848, and
has since become a large and very sound
enterprise. At the end of 1967, its total life
insurance in force had risen to $2.6 billions,
its total premium income ta $87 millions, and
its assets to more than $210 millions. Dividends to its policyowners have been paid
every year since 1850.
Union Mutual commenced business in
Canada exactly one hundred years ago, and
in the first year of its Canadian operations it
issued policies in French for the benefit of its
Quebec market. It is licensed as a dominion
insurer and also by all the provinces. During
its 100 years of operation in Canada it has
earned a good reputation for its integrity.
Until recently the amount of business done
in Canada by Union Mutual was relatively
small and could easily be serviced from the
United States. In the last few years, however,
this situation has changed considerably. The
Canadian business done by Union Mutual,
especially
group
life
insurance,
has
experienced a sharp increase. It had risen to
almost $74 millions in 1965, and it reached
more than $100 millions in 1967. This substantial amount of business, and more particularly its recent rapid increase, has led Union
Mutual to the conclusion that the interest of
Canadian policy owners would be better
served by a company domiciled in Canada
and under the direction of a board of directors, the majority of which will be Canadian
citizens.
I have been assured by the management of
Union Mutual that the existing insurance business of that company will be serviced by the
new company, and that at the end of the year

vation that our amplification system is not
working. I heard the honourable sponsor of
this bill because he sits close to me.

It is often asserted that there is already too
much competition in the life insurance business in Canada. While this bill will create a
new life insurance company it will not
necessarily increase competition in this field,
although it is hoped that eventually the new
company will do more business in Canada
than Union Mutual has been doing up to now.
Its main effect, at least for some time, will be
to transfer to a Canadian company which will
have, within a period of ten years, a substantial Canadian financial participation, the
existing business being done by an American
company in Canada. This transfer will mean
an improvement in our balance of payments,
a greater Canadian participation in the life
Insurance business, greater availability of
capital in Canada, and more jobs for
Canadians.

Hon. Mr. Everett: Is it not a fact that the
business which Union Mutual, as a mutual
company, is now transacting in Canada will
be transferred to a shareholding in a private
company which is not a mutual company?

gap here in the recognition of the essential
rights of people who enter into a contract
with one company not to have that relationship arbitrarily changed to a relationship
with another company.
Hon. J. Harper Prowse: Honourable senators, there are two or three things that concern
me on this bill at the moment. Probably we
will not get the answers until we get into the
committee, but I raise the questions now so
that people will be warned and be prepared
when they come to the committee.
My first question is this. There is nothing
whatever in this bill to indicate that this company is being formed with the intention
of taking over the assets of any going concern.
In the bill the whole suggestion is that the
new company is to be formed, but section 5
says:
The Company shall not commence business until one million dollars of the capital stock have been subscribed and at
least that amount paid thereon together
with a contribution to surplus of five
hundred thousand dollars.

at that meeting is void by reason only of
such contravention, but any such proceeding, matter or thing is, at any time
within one year from the date of commencement of the general meeting at
which the contravention occurred, voidable at the option of the Company by a
resolution passed at a special general
meeting of the Company.

In other words, that gives them the right to
go ahead, and they just do not act, so nothing
happens. In other words, there is no guarantee in this provision at ail.
If we are to be told that there are guarantees by legislation, then the guarantees should
be there. If there is to be a merger by legislation and we are giving approval to it, we
should be advised of it and it should be clearly in the bill. If we had not been warned by
the sponsor of the bill that there were other
viable companies involved we would have
had no way of knowing. Those are my
questions.
The more companies we have doing business the better, the more competition the
better it is for everybody, and I am prepared

BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

Hon. Eric Cook moved the second reading
of Bill S-3, to amend the Canada Evidence
Act.
He said: Honourable senators, when the
Government Leader suggested that I undertake the task of explaining this bill, I was
greatly flattered, but I was also nervous
because I arn aware that there are many
senators who are distinguished members of
the legal profession and are much better able
to deal with the bill. As a consequence, I feel
somewhat like Daniel in the lions' den.
As I pondered the matter, I recalled during
the very interesting debates on the Supreme
Court Act some of the foremost of the legal
lions in the chamber made reference to the
Book of Proverbs. I thought, therefore, perhaps I too should take my Bible in hand and
see if I could find something to help me.
Honourable senators, I read the Book of
Daniel, and was greatly encouraged by Verse
21 and the first portion of Verse 22 of the 7th
Chapter. After he emerged from the lions'
den, Daniel is telling his adventures to King
Darius. Daniel was obviously a good
diplomat, for we find that he begins his
report in a manner calculated to please the
King. We read as follows:
Verse 21Then said Daniel unto the King, 'O King,
live forever.'

SENATE DEBATES
Then, in Verse 22-and this is the part which
encouraged me-Daniel continues:
My God hath sent his angel, and has shut
the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt
me.

meat, and I should not cail it drink; yes,
you may."
However, these colourful old days are gone
forever, and therefore the amendments
proposed ini the bill before the Senate are not
of a dramatic nature designed to correct
grave injustices. They are nevertheless of
very great importance for thc present day
administration of justice.
At this Urne it is not my intention to
attempt to provide a detailed explanation of
each o! the provisions of titis bill. I do,
however, wish to, draw the attention of
honourable senators to the specific areas of
the law of evidence in which amendments are
being proposed. The provisions of this bill
provide:
(1) A more liberal procedure in applying
for leave to cail more than. five expert
witnesses;
(2) Cross-examination of a party's own
witness on a previous inconsistent written
statement without prior proof that the
witness is adverse;
(3) An extension of section 29 of the Canada Evidence Act, which now relates only to
banks, to include other deposit-taking fInancial institutions;
(4) Clarifications of section 29 of the Canada Evidence Act, so that it is not interpreted
in such a manner as to prevent searches of
the premises o! financial institutions under

the authority of search warrants issued under
any other act of Parliament;
(5) A procedure designed to facilitate the
proof of matters contained ini records made ini
the usual and ordinary course of business,
includmng computerized records and other
business records kept on magnetie tape or
otherwise recorded, stored or reproduced
electronlcally;
(6) A change ini the formn of making a
solemn declaration.
Fmnally, Mr. Speaker, I should like to
reaffirm that the Government will welcome
any comments from interested members of
the public, particularly on the provisions of
the bill relating to the proof of business
records, wh.ich are perhaps the most important feature of the bill, so that we can be
satisfied that the bill wlll in fact effect the
improvements in the law that it is designed to
achieve.
If the bill should receive second reading I
intend to move that it be referred to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce where I am sure it will receive the
exhaustive and detailed study which it naturally requires, and the committee will also
hear from those who may wish to comment.
On motion of Honourable Mr. Walker,
debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at

German strongpoint that the Newfoundlanders had captured, to which had been
brought as a base for the statue the native
stone of Newfoundland. One could not look at
this defiant caribou without being deeply conscIous of the courage and bravery of the men

of Newfoundland that it symbolized. When I
tell you that out of 6,000 Newfoundlanders
who enlisted in the First World War, over 60
per cent-more than 3,700-were killed,
wounded or captured, you will have some
idea of their bravery.
I must mention too that one of the Newfoundlanders, Ken Goodyear, of Grand Falls,
spoke to me of Senator Malcolm Hollett, who
also went overseas, and gf the other senators
from Newfoundland whom he knew-Senators Cook, Petten and Carter.
We visited all the Canadian memorials: St.
Julien, where the Canadians in April, 1915,
faced the first gas attack launched by the
Germans and stood up against this new and
deadly weapon; and the Menin Gate in Ypres,
on which are inscribed the names of those
who have no known grave to mark their last
resting place. We visited Sanctuary Wood,
Passchendaele, Dury, where Senator White
was wounded, Bourlon Wood, Courcelette,
Amiens, Cambrai, Vimy-all hallowed names
for the Canadians who fought in that First
World War. Places once so familiar to us are
now changed. Where once were trenches and
seas of mud, now there are fertile farms and
quiet peaceful landscapes. Places which were
once ruins and rubble are now busy,
bustling towns and villages, and the old
familiar places are now almost unrecognizable.
The cemeteries and memorials are all
beautifully maintained and to each one we
went to pay our tribute of remembrance. The
ceremonies were impressive. They folowed
much the same form each time. Two sentries
guarded the memorial, arms reversed and
heads bowed. Our two padres said the opening prayers, and then came the invocation
in words familiar to us all:
They shall grow not old, as we that are
left grow old,
Age shall not weary them, nor the years
condemn
At the going down of the sun, and in the
morning, we will remember them.
And all the veterans intoned the response:
We will remember them.
There followed after the invocation, the
laying of the wreaths. Every veteran in the

November 20, 1968

group took part at least once in the laying of a
wreath. Then came the clear melancholy call
of the bugle sounding the Last Post as all
stood at attention. The troops in their berets,
wearing their medais, stood in silent remembrance until there came the awakening sound
of Reveille with its symbol of the hope of
resurrection. The haunting sound of the bagpipes followed as the piper slow-marched
around the memorial playing the Lament, and
again the padres closed the ceremony with a
blessing. It was al very reverent, very
touching, very impressive and very sacred.
In the second week, we split into two
groups-one to go to Mons, which the
Canadians captured on Armistice Day in
1918-the scene of the first British battle in
1914 and of our last one in 1918-and there
we took part in the Belgian memorial services. The other group went to Paris to join
in the French ceremonies. I did not go to
Mons but I can say that those who did
go were enthusiastic about the warmth of
welcome from the Belgians and the conduct
of the ceremonies.
As for the French events, the first one was
at Compiegne, about 70 miles from Paris,
where the Armistice was signed on November 11, 1918, in the railway car that
was Maréchal Foch's headquarters deep in
the woods of Compiegne. The ceremony was
at night and flaming torches provided the
light for the ceremony against the background of the dark forest. A brooding statue
of Foch dominated the clearing and the music
of a band of trumpeters heightened the dramatic effect of the setting.
On Armistice Day there were a number of
events, but I shall mention only two. The first
was the Te Deum Mass at Notre Dame Cathedral. This historic cathedral where kings and
emperors of France, including Napoleon,
were crowned, was ablaze with lights, decorated with flags including our standard
among the French, and a magnificent choir
and the great pealing organ supplied the music. The Garde Republican, the crack French
regiment, with silver cuirasses, red plumes
and red tunics, with white breeches,
black riding boots and flashing swords, lined
the centre aisle of the church, down which
the President of France, General de Gaulle,
came to sit on a raised dais in front of the
altar. I was interested in watching him, and I
noticed how his head moved from time to
time, now up, now down, now to one side,
and then to the other, but always en grande
manière.

November 20. 1968

Noveber20. 968SENATE
DEBATES

Madame de Gaulle was there, too, and the
widows of some of the maréchals of France.
0f course, the cathedral was crowded. There
were scores of diplomats and heads of governments. Arab sheiks ini flowing white robes,
Africans in coloured turbans and togas. The
homily was given by the Cardinal Archbishop
of Paris, a very old man, crippled by age, but
his voice was strong and eloquent, except
when it broke with emotion as he spoke of
the loss suffered by the widows and children
of the hundreds of thousands of French who
had been killed.
After the Te Deum at the end of the Mass,
the organ and the choir broke into the stirring music of the Marseillaise. It was something neyer to be forgotten.
In the afternoon General de Gaulle took
the salute at a parade in the broad Cours de
Vincennes. He was escorted to the reviewing
stand by the Garde Republican on horseback
at full trot.
The parade was led by a company of "Pantalons", the French soldiers of 1914 who
stopped the German advance at the Marne, ini
the red pantalon uni! orm, with the old
French rifles and long flxed bayonets. Then
camne the Poilus of Verdun, in slate blue battie dress and steel helmets, followed by companies from ahl those countries which fought
in the First World War, the Belgians, the
Guards Regiments from Britain with the busbied band of the Grenadiers, and the pipes of
the Scots Guards, the Australians with their
broad-brimmed hats, the New Zealanders-ail
Maoris, the natives of New Zealand-the
Yugoslavs with a pounding high-knee action
step taught them by the Russians-one wondered how they could go on mile after mile in
this pounding step-and others, mncluding the
Americans and our own Royal Canadian
Regiment.
Then came units representing the might o!
present day French forces-infantry, artillery, tanks, mobile units, while super-f ast
Mystère jets dived from the heavens and helicopters ini precision formation flew overhead.
It was the kind of parade which could take
place nowhere else ini the world but ini Paris,
and at no other time--a once-in-a-lifetime
experience.
In closing, I must pay my tribute to our
Honorary Commandant Milton Gregg, V.C.
As those who know hlm best will testify, he
is the personification of kindness and
gentlemanlhness.
Hon. Senalors: Hlear, hear.
29234-37

Han. Mr. Leonard: He commanded the respect and affection of the whole contingent.
Brigadier Jimmy Melville was Commandant,
a wonder!ul. man, smart on parade, able and
efficient when necessary, but always lovable
and full of life and f un when the occasion
called for it. Those who know him can
conflr
that, too.
We had four members o! the Royal Canadian Mounted Police wîth us, and wherever we
went they stole the show. There can be no
better advertisement for Canada than these
colourful men ini scarlet, yet they were
always modest, courteous, kind, smiling, on
the job, and perfectly bilungual. The Mounties
are truly ambassadors o! goodwill for Canada.
Perhaps I might single out one of our veterans for special mention. Mr. T. Dinesen was
a Dane; you may recail that Denmark was
neutral in 1914-1918, but Mr. flinesen, like
other flanes, felt that he must flght against
German aggression. He crossed the Atlantic
to try to enlist with the United States forces.
They would not take him, I presume because
he was a Dane, but he happened to see a
Canadian recruiting office ini New York and
he applied, was accepted, and went over with
the Canadian forces in a Montreal regiment,
Serving with us he won the Victoria Cross,
the most distinguishing decoration a soldier
can win. He returned to his native Denark
a!ter the war, but when he heard about this
pilgrimage of ours, he came down to join us
and once agaun marched with us to the old
battleflelds, and no one could want a better
compaion.
The senior Governinent official was the
Deputy Minister of Veterans Aif airs, Ernest
Côté, blimseif a veteran o! the Second World
War. He worked tirelessly, and his fiuency ini
French and English enabled hlm to cope with
ail occasions. To hlm I think is due the greatest share of credit for the planning, organization and carryung out of this great
enterprise.
I could go on and mention others, but I
tink it sufficient to say that ail played their
part. Privates and generals, N.C.O.s and commissioned officers-ail were equals as pilgrims. There were no casualties.
One place to which some of our group went
was Wimereux, ta the grave of LieutenantColonel John McCrae who wrote the beautiful
poem lui Flanders Fields. I could nat; help but
feel that the Canadian contingent lived up to

SENATE DEBATES
the trust he gave them in his immortal
words:
To you from failing hands we throw
The torch; be yours to hold it high.
If ye break faith with us who die
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
In Flanders fields.
I think we have kept faith.
Hon. Malcolm Holleit: Honourable senators,
if I am allowed, I would like to say just a
word of thanks to the honourable Senator
Leonard for the tribute which he has paid to
all those boys of the First World War, and, in
particular, to our lads in Newfoundland,
though they were not Canadians. They never
were Canadians-and I should add "unfortunately"-but I want to assure all senators
here that just as all Newfoundlanders were
then loyal to the mother country, Great Britain, so from 1949 onwards we have been and
always shall be loyal to this Canada of ours.
The tribute which has been paid is an
excellent one, and I thank the honourable
Senator Leonard for his remarks. I am unable
to say more at the moment.
On motion of Hon. Mr. White, debate
adjourned.
EDUCATION
EMPLOYMENT OF "DRAFT DODGERS" AS
TEACHERS IN CANADA

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Chesley W. Carter: Honourable senators, before the Orders of the Day are called
I should like to direct a question to the Government Leader. My question arises from the
knowledge that a considerable number of
"draft dodgers" are coming to Canada from
the United States and are being employed as
teachers in our schools. I realize that education is a provincial matter, but internal as
well as external security is a federal responsibility. Bearing in mind that these "draft
dodgers" have deliberately defied and broken
the laws of their own country, it seems to me
that there is grave danger that these persons
as teachers will develop wrong attitudes in
our children.
Therefore, I would ask the Government
Leader if he would be good enough to state
the Government policy with respect to "draft
dodgers" and say whether it is possible to
initiate action at the federal level to alert the
provincial and municipal authorities to the
dangers of employing these people as teachers
in our schools.

November 20, 1968

Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators,
Senator Carter gave me notice of his intention to ask this question just before our proceedings began.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Is this going to be a
daily affair between you two?
Hon. Mr. Croll: You are catching on.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I think he has himself
provided the answer when he said that education is a provincial matter. The fact is that
under international law no country imposes
the military service obligations of another
country and, consequently, Canada in this
particular case is not required under international law to enforce the military service laws
of the United States any more than in the
First World War between 1914 and 1917 or
the Second World War between 1939 and 1941
the United States was obliged to enforce the
laws of Canada in their military terms. It
follows that this matter is one that does not
come within the authority of the federal
Government in any particular.
Under our immigration laws a "draft dodger"-if he may be so called-enters Canada,
and the landing permit given to him does not
in any way cover circumstances attending his
military services, whether it be in compliance
or non-compliance with military service. It is
not prohibited under our immigration laws to
enter Canada because one has not fulfilled
military service obligations in another country. That is international practice. Therefore,
I do not think it would be possible for the
federal Government to interfere in the matter
of education, which is something specifically
reserved under section 92 of the British North
America Act to the provinces.
It may be that my honourable friend had a
certain purpose in mind in asking this question, and perhaps the very asking of it may
serve that purpose.
NATIONAL DEFENCE
REPORT RE DEATH OF PARACHUTISTS
AT PETAWAWA

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, in
the absence of Senator White I had earlier
indicated I was prepared to deal with his
inquiry for the tabling of the report of the
Board of Inquiry into the incident involving
the death of some armed services personnel
at Petawawa.
To be specific, on October 10 Senator White
asked me to obtain and table a copy of the

November 20, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

report of the Board of Inquiry into the death
of seven army parachutists on May 8 last at
Petawawa. Senator White stated that according to the press the report had been released
the previous day. I obtained and tabled on
October 15 a copy of a statement on the
report of the Board of Inquiry which had
been issued by the Department of National
Defence. At the time of tabling, I referred to
this statement as the report of the Board of
Inquiry. This was a mistake on my part.
There was, in fact, no report of the Board of
Inquiry made public, but only a copy of a
statement on the report of the board. However, I understand it is all that has been
released with regard to the inquiry.
My colleague the Minister of National
Defence has informed me that the report of
the Board of Inquiry in this matter is privileged material and is not for tabling. It has
always been maintained that the reports of
boards of inquiry are privileged documents.
Boards of inquiry in the armed forces are
designed to enable senior authorities to obtain
information on matters within internal service
administration. These inquiries are not public, and officers serving on boards and officers
and men appearing before them to give testimony are aware that the proceedings are for
internal use and that their evidence will not
be made public. It is argued that it would
clearly hamper the administration of the services if those called upon to serve on or to
give evidence before boards of inquiry were
to feel that their actions or their statements
might become subject to public debate. It is
essential that these men speak freely, and this
is possible only if they are aware that the
testimony and findings will not be used
beyond the confines of the services.
In a case such as the one at Petawawa,
where there were seven deaths, testimony
given at the Board of Inquiry is made available on a confidential basis to the coroner for
his examination and information. The coroner
is free to decide whether or not he will hold a
coroner's inquest. In this particular case, my
information is that the question of the exercise of the coroner's discretion is still under
consideration by the coroner in Pembroke.
The fact that an inquest would be held if the
coroner, with the advice of the Attorney General's Department, felt that this was desirable
satisfies the concern which I have about there
being no public inquiry into an incident
involving such a heavy loss of life. The presumption is that this inquiry would take place
in the normal course of events if the coroner
29234-37J

were not satisfied with respect to the evidence that is now available to him concerning
the accident.
Hon. George S. White: I thank the honourable leader for his statement and with leave of
the Senate I would like to comment on it
very briefly.
First, I disagree entirely with the statement
that a report of a Board of Inquiry is confidential and cannot be made public. After all,
this is the Parliament of Canada and who are
these mandarins and high brass hats who are
telling Parliament that we are not entitled to
have a report which dealt with the tragic
death of seven young Canadian soldiers?'
These soldiers made a parachute jump that
landed in the Ottawa River and they were
drowned. These soldiers were only carrying
out orders. They had no control over what
they were instructed to do; they had no control over how they were to do it; they had no
control over when or where they were to
jump.
I understand that a board of inquiry is set
up in the services where there has been damage to or loss of government property, where
there has been injury to or death of personnel. The board hears evidence and makes a
report on it. What possible reason can there
be for secrecy in keeping this report from the
public?
In the Province of Ontario, and I presume
this applies in all other provinces, where
there is a death on the highway or in industry there is an inquest which is open to the
public and the press. A full report is given to
the press of the findings of the jury, and
anyone who follows the proceedings in the
Ontario Legislature can readily recall many
comments and caustic remarks made in that
legislature as a result of the report of a jury
at an inquest. I recall two such cases in this
city, the collapse of the Heron Road Bridge
and the collapse of the building on Elgin
Street. In each case an inquest was held and,
I believe as a result, certain action was taken
through the office of the Crown Attorney.
The release put out by the Information Services of the Department of National Defence
contains this important clause:
The inquiry found that the primary
cause of the accident was the existence of
winds in the drop zone layer of a
strength and direction not suspected.
These winds were such that the parachutists were carried out over the
Ottawa River.

SENATE DEBATES
I can easily understand the factor of wind
change, and certainly any old soldier from
the First War who had any experience of any
kind in connection with gas can well recall
and tragically remember how wind can
change at the critical moment.
In this case the fact remains that a strong
wind did arise and it suddenly changed direction. We know that the jump took place in
the vicinity of water and that the parachutists
did not wear life preservers. We also know
that there were no safety boats or rescue
equipment provided in the event parachutists
did land in the water.
I do not want to go into any further detail
on this tragic matter, but I simply suggest to
the honourable leader that he should again
consult with these higher authorities who
have decided that Parliament is not entitled
to this report. I would ask him to see these
officials, and I hope that he will be able to
convince them that Parliament is at least
entitled to read this report.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I well understand the
honourable senator's concern in this matter. I
can assure him that I have examined this
very carefully, and I will see that his
remarks are taken into consideration once
again.
Hon. Mr. White: Thank you.
POVERTY
MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL
COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of the honourable Senator Croll that a special committee
of the Senate be appointed to investigate and
report upon all aspects of poverty in Canada.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
is it agreed that the honourable Senator
Inman proceed in the place of Senator
Martin?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. F. Elsie Inman: Honourable senators,
I have listened with great interest to the
many excellent speeches on the subject of
poverty. I wish to congratulate Senator Croll
for bringing this matter to the attention of
honourable senators. His resolution for a committee to consider this very important subject, which is a canker in our fair and beautiful country, is welcomed by all of us in this
chamber.

November 20, 1968

Poverty is ugly. The word is ugly. The
thought is ugly. It seems to be something that
we have in the past backed away from; but,
like many facts of life, it has to be faced
some time, and now seems to be the time.
No longer can we ignore the knowledge that
we have within Canada many areas of real
poverty, and we must try to do something to
cure this disease, for it is a disease eating at
the very vitals of our country.
Those of us who have lived in small towns
and rural areas perhaps come closer to the
actual site and realization of real poverty
than those who live in larger centres. Before
the era of social benefits in the 1940's I had
seen many cases of poverty that could leave
one deeply depressed; and we still have many
such cases.
I would like to cite several cases as examples of poverty that I have personally encountered. I remember on one occasion I went
with a public health nurse to take an eightyear-old child back to its home in a little
fishing village in my province. That child had
been in hospital for six months with a tubercular ankle and she had a cast with a window
in it, but we thought perhaps it could be
looked after at home. We drove 40 miles to
the child's home. She was anxious to be
home; she was welcomed with love and affection by her father and the other children in
the family, but we did not see the mother. In
a few minutes' time we were taken into a
windowless room. The mother was lying in
bed with a three-day-old baby. Everything
was in a very poor condition. The nurse
looked after the mother as best she could. I
took this baby, who had not been washed
since it was born, and washed it and did the
best I could for it. There were three rooms in
that house. The kitchen had a bit of a floor.
The room where the mother was had a bed
on some sort of rocks and the floor was just
sand, the house being built on sand hills.
There was a third room, with a very small
window, where the children apparently slept
on pallets on the floor. There was nothing to
eat in the house; the mother was going to
nurse the baby on water.
The nurse and I went back to the town
where we lived and from our own means we
took food that we thought would do for a
week or so. We went back to the house, taking with us canned milk and other canned
goods with which the children could be fed,
and then we solicited from merchants and
others food enough for about a month. That is
one case I saw that involved real poverty.

November 20, 1968

Noveber20, 968SENATE
DEBATES

I remember another case in which we saw
the police around a house and so we stopped
and asked what was the matter. The police
were arresting a widowed mother who had
four young children. She had been making
moonshine whisky or beer and selling it to
feed her family. Anyway, after we were
through with the police, they backed away
and did not arrest her. We told them that
many people were making money out of this
affair and it would be better if they were left
to continue their work. We got away with it.
On another occasion I was collecting for the
Red Cross, and I rernember going into a
home. I was always interested in going to
places where I thought the Red Cross would
be appreciated for what it did. I went into
this particular home about noontime, and
there I found a widowed mother with three
or four children. On the table was just a pot
of potatoes-no butter, nothing else. She
insisted on giving me two cents because she
said that if it had flot been for the Red Cross
one littie chap would flot be where he was
then. However, we looked after them, and she
did have a proper meal that day.
I arn just citing these cases to show what
poverty can mean in this country. It is a
shocking fact that in Canada today, one of the
most prosperous nations in the world, a large
number of Canadians are poor and some are
truly destitute; and for various reasons,
because of their poverty they are deprived of
sharing in our abundance and the better life.
Poor people live everywhere-in the cities,
towns and villages, as well as in the rural
areas. Rural 10w-income areas have lost
numbers o! their populations over the past
years on account o! many of the young people-and especially the young people-going:
to the cities.
I arn speaking now o! my own Province o!
Prince Edward Island-I amn sure all honourable senators know the province from which I
come-where the average family incomes are
low in the poverty areas, and where there are
many symptoms of poverty, such as a low
level of formal schooling, dilapidated housing
in need o! repair and replacement, a high
proportion of children, and the elderly who
depend on the working-age population with
low incomes.
These are some of the actual reasons for
poverty. Schooling in low-income areas is
usually inadequate. Rural people generally
have poorer schooling than city people, and
so are handicapped by lack of education. It
follows that they have difflculty ini finding

new jobs, acquiring new skills, or adjusting to
new environments. The size o! many lowincome families makes escape from. poverty
extremely difficult. The resuit, of course, is
that meagre resources have to be stretched
beyond the breaking point in order to feed,
house, clothe and educate children.
It is unfortunate that in our modem society
it is still not the custom for two, or even
three, generations to live together in the same
household, and thus have to keep up one
domicile instead of two, or, in other words,
live under one roof instead of two.
I can well remember as a child that I rarely saw in Prince Edward Island a home, be it
in the city-and we have only one city-in
the towns, or in the country, in which there
was not also living a grandparent, or an old
aunt or uncle, or somebody else. Two homes
were not required to look after the family.
The mass emigration of young people !rom
low-income rural areas in recent years has
meant that those le!t behind are o!ten worse
off than they were before. Their chances of
escape from poverty, or o! avoiding deeper
poverty, or even of easing their burden, have
been reduced. This is partly because the areas
have too many old people and young children
for the working-age population.
During my years as a member and chairman of the Mothers' Allowance Commission
for Prince Edward Island, I and other members o! the Commission had to deal with many
cases o! sordid poverty. Those were the days
before many of the present social benefits
came into existence. From my experience as a
member of this commission I came to realize
that poverty is really relevant. For instance, a
family with a free !arm-and by that I mean
a !arm that is free o! mortgage-o! 100 or 150
acres, and with two or three children, and a
cash income of $3,000 per annum, can live
quite comfortably because much of the food is
produced on the !arm, while the city or town
worker with the same income and the same
family, and having to pay for rent, fuel, food
and clothing, et cetera, is actually at the
poverty level. So, what amounts to poverty
for one family can be comfortable living for
another.
I would li.ke to say that in Prince Edward
Island this is quite true. In the years when the
flshing is good the people in the fishing areas
have good incomes. They can make as
much as $6,000 or $7,000 in two months. If the
fishing is poor, or the price for flsh i5 10w,
their incomes decrease to almost the poverty
level. Many of these people do not look ahead
and save for rainy days.

SENATE DEBATES

a mistake to underestimate the various programs that governments of all political persuasions in Canada have brought forward,
either on federal or on provincial account. I
could not agree for one moment that the
social welfare programs, for instance, that we
have on federal account, have served their
day, that they are no longer of any value.
That view could not under any circumstances
be accepted.
In the first place there are the manpower
programs that were initiated in this country
two or three years ago following the establishment of the Department of Manpower
and Immigration, to insure that those unemployed and those likely to be soon unemployed receive the necessary training and
counselling to permit them to obtain employment if it is available.
The second major set of measures are those
commonly grouped together under the general heading of regional development. Traditionally, the approach to solving the problem
of regional economic disparities-now very
much in the mind of the Government-has
been to deal with it through a series of measures implemented by different departments
and agencies. The Economic Council in its
Fifth Report has severely criticized this
approach which, because of the multiplicity
of government agencies involved, has almost
inevitably led to duplication, sometimes
inconsistencies, in programs and policies. The
new department responsible for regional
development under my colleague Mr. Marchand has been given the task of putting these
various programs on a more rational and
well-integrated basis in order that larger and
more effective measures to improve employment can be taken.
The major area where the proposed special
committee suggested by Senator Croll could
make a most useful contribution, as I see it,
and as the Government sees it, is in examining what special measures need to be taken in
the fields of both assistance and employment
so that people who have no prospect of entering the mainstream of economie activity can
be saved from the destructive effects of acute
poverty, and so that the new employment
opportunities can be taken by those who have
the capability and yet are in the greatest
need.
It is widely recognized today, honourable
senators, that poverty is not only economic
but also social and political. For example, it
has been found that the poor in cities have an
extremely limited knowledge of the urban
environment in which they live. Ways must

be found to assist these people to break away
from their psychological and other inhibitions, if they are to become useful members
of society. It is by concentrating on issues
such as these that the committee could best
achieve its objectives of helping in a concrete
and realistic way to eliminate the burden of
poverty.
While this is a matter for which we must
find a solution, it will not be solved unless we
recognize the limitations attached to effort. It
seems to me that the problem Senator Croll
has projected is one that has an immediacy
about it, an urgency. Though study is desirable, we are anxious to see what projects we
can suggest to remedy the situation as it confronts us. A study that would take years is
not one that will help us meet the problem. It
would be a mistake to conclude that existing
programs are of little value in trying to meet
this problem. They certainly do not touch certain areas of poverty, but we should not fail
to recognize that the various social measures
do effectively eliminate many levels of poverty which would otherwise persist. I do not
believe that a study or a discussion of this
sort should overlook the work that has been
done and the measures that have been
provided.
One of the achievements, for instance, on
behalf of the aged in Canada was the introduction of the Old Age Security pensions in
1952. Senator Croll was on the committee that
had so much to do with this program when
the universal scheme of old age pensions was
established and the means test was eliminated. This heralded the end of the means test
for those of 70 years and over. Senator Argue
will remember the discussions in the other
place on this point and the relevance of the
argument of that day to the question of poverty as it existed in Canada. In the last few
years, provision has been made to lower the
age of eligibility gradually to age 65. On
January next all those 66 years of age and
over will be receiving the benefit in Canada.
Over the years the benefit has been increased
substantially, and the rate is being adjusted
upward in response to increases in living costs.
With the next adjustment in January, the
rate will be $78 a month.
Over one and a half million people will
receive the pension this year. The federal
expenditure will be about $1.3 billion. For
those who require a greater income than the
flat-rate pension, a guaranteed income supplement is now available. The maximum combined benefit will reach $109.20 next January.
At the end of the last fiscal year, slightly

SENATE DEBATES
more than 700,000 persons were in receipt of
the supplement. In the current fiscal year the
estimated expenditure on the supplement will
amount to $240 million.
These old age security programs have made
a significant contribution, and they continue
to make a significant contribution to the
reduction of poverty among older people in
Canada. It must be kept in mind that in those
individual cases where these benefits prove
insufficient, because those involved live in
areas where living costs are higher or where
health and welfare services are needed, the
federal Government is prepared to share the
costs for further provision of this type under
the Canada Assistance Plan.
Quite apart from these three types of
benefit, the Canada Pension Plan and its
counterpart in Quebec have started an orderly build-up of pension protection for contributors under this nation-wide pension system. In addition to requirement benefits,
survivors' pensions are now being paid for the
first time this year.
In recent years, as we all know, family
allowances have been extended to a higher
age group in the form of youth allowances.
These two programs have been helpful to
low-income and large families. Estimates of
the income redistribution effects of these programs show clearly that the low-income provinces have been the most important
beneficiaries.
The impact of Canada's social welfare legislation on the prevention of poverty and the
aid provided to those in the lower income
groups has been considerable. Indeed, much
of the current discussion on poverty ignores
far-reaching achievements which have been
made in Canada, and our record compares, I
think, favourably with that of almost any
other country.
I am not arguing that we should be complacent. The Fifth Annual Review of the Economic Council on "The Challenge of Growth
and Change", as Senator Croll has reminded
us, has served to underline that much more
needs to be done to cope with poverty in
Canada. Fortunately, a wide variety of initiatives have been undertaken by the federal
Government which will greatly extend government efforts to reduce poverty. They
include, for example, ARDA, FRED, the
Atlantic Development Board, the manpower
mobility program, the adult occupational
training program and the greatly improved
counselling and placement activities under
manpower services and work activity projects

November 20, 1968

under the Canada Assistance Plan. The establishment of a new Department of Regional
Development will do much to co-ordinate
regional programs and to focus government
aid in areas requiring special attention.
Matters such as programs for Indians and
federal provision in the field of housing are
under active review at the present time, to
determine what new approaches need to be
developed. These are all programs which are
designed to meet in some way the question of
poverty to which the Economic Council has
directed our attention.
The guaranteed income supplement is providing experience in the application of the
guaranteed annual income concept. The
income test is related to the income tax in
much the same way as is proposed under
some proposals for a guaranteed annual
income. Canada is one of the few countries
that is testing this approach. And I am conscious of the fact that Senator Croll played a
part in bringing this about. A great deal is
being written in the United States, the United
Kingdom and other countries on this subject.
It is a topic which will certainly receive close
scrutiny in Canada in the years immediately
ahead. It is apparent frorn the outset that the
concept which is disarmingly attractive on
the surface, unfortunately raises some very
difficult and contentious problems, such as
how to integrate with existing social security
programs, how to finance an annual income
that is adequate, how to get agreement on
what is a level of adequacy in a country such
as Canada with widely varying costs and
standards of living, and how to work out
jurisdictional problems in a federal state.
It is apparent that many stubborn problems
face us when we look for solutions to poverty
in Canada. But that should not prevent us
from moving along. With study and research,
with discussion and dialogue, it will be possible more clearly to identify the nature of
problems and alternative solutions. Out of
this process may come some new approaches
and some realignment of existing approaches.
If the proposed Senate committee can achieve
such results, it will make a lasting contribution to the efforts of Canadians to reduce and
eventually to eliminate such poverty as we
can in our country.
The major area touching upon hard-core
poverty which is still largely unattended is
that which is at the juncture of two worlds:
the world of the user of selective social security programs, and the world of the administrator of such programs. We have not yet

November 20, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

found a way of guaranteeing that Government programs reach those for whom they
are intended. While this is true of most government programs, it applies especially well
to programs designed for the underprivileged.
Hard-core poverty breeds a sub-culture of its
own, the main characteristic of which, especially in urban ghettos, is a communications
system which has very little in common with
the system which affluent society uses. I think
it would be useful for the Senate committee
to examine whether the information which
the different levels of Government put out on
their social security programs reaches out to
the hard-core poverty. What does written
information convey-be it in attractive threecolour folders-when one cannot read? How
does one feed information back to distant,
complex, impersonal government bureaucracies when one cannot write?
There is another area of social programming, quite apart from information, which is
of direct relevance to those in hard-core
poverty: that of delivery of services. It is true
that most social security programs are
administered by the provinces and that this
question is primarily a provincial one. It is
also true that under present cost-sharing
arrangements, the Government of Canada
provides at least half of the cost of these
services. It is at this level of counsellingwhere the user and the dispenser of government programs come together-that breaches
to individual rights and dignity occur and
that "parity of Canadianism" suffers. I therefore would suggest that the committee design
pilot projects to examine the methods
through which services are presently made
available to users of the main social welfare
and social assistance schemes-and I think
that part of this was touched on by Senator
Croll in his opening statement.
Do the people employed by governments
across this country to administer income
maintenance programs and social assistance
measures generally consider that users have a
right to benefits? Or do they operate the programs on the premise that social benefits are
a privilege? Do counsellors in social welfare
inadvertently create dependency in their
"clients" because their own careers benefit
from the size of the caseload assigned to them
or the number of "permanent" cases which
become their responsibility? I am not suggesting that they do, but this question is asked. I
agree that these are highly complex questions
to which it is not easy to find clean and clear
administrative answers. Yet, it seems to me
that until we can find ways to make available
29234-38

to those in need the help they require without
killing their motivation to work or destroying
their dignity as human beings, we will not
have begun to solve the problem of hard-core
poverty.
The day may be soon upon us when "client
power" is as current an expression as those
presently making headlines almost every day:
"student power", "Black power", "Red power". Participation by individuals in decisions
affecting their way of life in a very immediate and intimate fashion is a matter which
concerns all of us. It is known to be part of
the basic philosophy of the present Prime
Minister of Canada. It appears to me also to
be an important dimension of the very texture of democratic societies. This too, is an
area in which the Senate committee could
usefully take a searching look, devising better
methods of participation by users of government services. There are projects afoot in
many provinces of this country in which different ways of involving people more closely
in programs affecting them are being tried
out. Assessing these different methods and
comparing results would undoubtedly throw
light upon a difficult subject which, by universal consent, is now in need of examination.
If the Senate were to mandate its committee to study the techniques used to, (1) inform
people of the programs available to them, (2)
counsel them on the use they can make of
such programs, and (3) involve them in deciding for themselves how best they can break
out of the cycle of poverty, it would be performing a very useful task which few other
institutions in this country could tackle. It is
a matter of common knowledge that thorough
self-assessment is beyond the capability of
most human beings and that evaluation of
program efficiency, likewise, cannot exclusively be left to agencies and departments
responsible for their implementation.
Honourable senators, I have risen to support the proposal put before us by Senator
Croll. I have sought to indicate what I believe
might be useful parameters for action. I have
done so fully conscious of the fact, however,
that while we have a problem of poverty to
meet in this country-I think the figure given
was 4 million out of a population of 21 million-it should be remembered that we have
not refrained from taking action over the
years to provide instruments which will give
additional security in a social way to thousands of Canadians. In that process Senator
Croil has been a leader. I am pleased as a
fellow senator and as a fellow townsman to
pay him this deserving tribute.

the things we have to do, that we sit around
and pass our time sending cheques to people

It is the most unbelievable exercise in futility
to be sending out $1 billion worth of cheques

Cook for the second reading of Bill S-3, to
amend the Canada Evidence Act.
Hon. David Walker: Honourable senators,
may I first offer my congratulations to my
kinsman from Newfoundland. Senator Cook,
who in a succinct, brief and precise way
introduced this bill. It was good to hear that
there are to be amendments to the Canada
Evidence Act which has not been revised in
75 years. It was introduced first in 1893 and
has been only amended since then. There
were also some other matters that he might
have mentioned, but I do not expect my
honourable friend to be an authority on
everything.
The Hon. the Speaker: Order, order.
Hon. Mr. Walker: Let Senator Martin keep
on talking. After all, he is the leader of the
Senate!
Hon. Mr. Martin: I am sorry if I interrupted the honourable senator.

Hon. Mr. Walker: I do not mind that at all.
Things like that are not very important.
There are some very important amendments to this bill. First of all we find that
subsection 2 of section 7 of the act is to be
repealed. This will be a good thing. Many of

We come next to clause 2 which amends
section 9 of the act. This is very important.
Hitherto, you could be at trial and you could
call your first witness thinking that he was
your best witness because you have a signed
statement from him. But, lo and behold, you
find that somebody has got to him in the
meantime. Senator Croll will understand
about that. And when you call him, he gives
an entirely different story from the one he
has given in the signed statement. As the law
now stands, nothing can be done about it.
You are taken by surprise; you can appeal to
the judge, but nothing can be done. The
witness appears to be very pleasant, and is
not in any way nasty, and cannot be described as hostile, but he gives a story which
is the direct antithesis to that contained in his
signed statement. Under this amendment it
will be possible for counsel to cross-examine
his own witness on a statement which he has
previously made and signed. Section 9 of the
old act which is referred to in clause 2 of this
bill is to be found in the explanatory notes on
the opposite page.
Then we come to clause 3 which is another
very important clause because it amends section 29 of the act by inserting "financial institution" instead of "bank". The rules as to
bringing in of documents from banks were set
out rather fully, but now because of the
growth of financial institutions it will be possible to extend the same rules of evidence to
financial institutions. I would have thought
that "financial institutions" would have been
defined here but instead we find it at the
bottom of page 3. Perhaps in finally reframing this act, "financial institutions" might be
defined at an earlier stage. The definition at
the bottom of page 3 is as follows:
"financial institution" means the Bank
of Canada, the Industrial Development
Bank and any institution incorporated in
Canada that accepts deposits of money
from its members or the public, and
includes a branch, agency or office of any
such Bank or institution;

November 20, 1968

to the reception of evidence such as the proof
of cheques and the proof of signatures, and
also applies to questions where special orders
are necessary. It is not necessary for me to go
into this in detail at this time because I
assume that it will be considered thoroughly
when the bill is before the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce under Senator
Hayden.
Then, honourable senators, coming to page
3Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Before you come to
that, may I ask a question?
Hon. Mr. Walker: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Senator Choquette said
the other day that you never ask a question
until you know the answer. However, I ask
this now because I want to know something
that I do not know.
Hon. Mr. Walker: He meant just at the
trial, not here.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: This clause says "...institution incorporated in Canada that accepts
deposits of money from its members or the
public,..." Are there any institutions in
Canada accepting deposits that are not incorporated in Canada?
Hon. Mr. Walker: I would not know that,
but I would think not. I would think that at
least there would be a Canadian branch, but I
have not any knowledge of that. I am sure
the matter will be dealt with in the Banking
and Commerce Committee.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Co-operatives, perhaps.

Hon. Mr. Walker: But they have a Canadian branch. Otherwise there is no way of controlling them. I would certainly think with
financial institutions it may be an unnecessary precaution to say "who are incorporated
in Canada", because I think most of them, if
they are going to operate here, must form a
subsidiary Canadian company.
Then on page 3, subsection 6a is being

SENATE DEBATES

I should add that loans and guarantees of
the government, mentioned in this act,
represent a maximum which the Canadian
National and Air Canada can use, totally or
partly, according to their needs.
The bill provides for the upholding, in 1969,
of the authority granted the government to
purchase preferred shares of the Canadian
National Railways of Canada and, as agreed
to in last year's act, the renunciation to payment of interest on $100 million; these are
clauses 13 and 14.
Finally, this legislation authorizes the
Minister of Finance to sign, on behalf of Her
Majesty, any guarantee provided therein
(clause 8) and also provides the appointment
of independent auditors (clause 15), in accordance with the Canadian National Railways.
Honourable senators, I intend to propose
that the bill be referred to the committee on
transport and communications; I have the
honour to ask you to pass it on second
reading.
Hon. Edgar E. Fournier: I wish to thank
Senator Denis for his explanations on Bill No.
C-124 which should give satisfactory results.
I must say that I entirely agree with him.
[English]
However, I believe we are receiving this
bill, as we have in the past, at a late date
because al of this money has already been
spent without any authority. I am not critical
of this, however, because this is the kind of
routine matter that has been taking place
year after year. To me financing the Canadian
National Railways is not an easy function.
Because of the old lines and the old deficits
which were accumulated during construction,
the amalgamation of many lines, many of
which were useless in the state in which they
were taken over, not being serviceable, an
extensive construction program had to be
undertaken, necessitating spending a lot of
money.
I find the report interesting, and I should
like to quote some figures. Again I am not
critical of the figures. These are taken from
page 31. The total railway operating revenue
for 1967 was $945,212,669, against total railway operating expenses of $942,443,611, leaving a net railway operating income of $2,769,058. This is not bad because it shows revenue,
but we are not taking account of the debt yet.
This is the crucial part of the report. Going
on to income, we find for the telecommunications department, hotels, trucking operations
and other sources, revenue of $26,413,913,
which gives a total interest on the debt of

$78,909,630, less interest received on loans
from Air Canada of $13,857,462. The net
interest on the debt is $65,052,168, leaving a
deficit, as mentioned by my honourable friend,
of $35,869,197. One can see that the interest
itself is almost double the deficit.
If we turn to the following pages we come
to an alarming figure. The total long-term
debt of the Canadian National was $1,772,840,026. I do not believe this long-term debt will
ever be repaid. It has been carried on year
after year. The Canadian National is owned
by the Canadian people and there should be
some way of absorbing some of these debts,
trying to reduce them, in order to reduce the
interest which cripples the financial operations of the C.N.R. every year.
The Canadian National is Canada's largest
business. It has over 90,000 employees and
covers 34,964 miles of railway track; it has
2,165 locomotives and other motive power
equipment, 106,745 freight cars-box cars,
refrigerator cars, gondola cars, and so on;
2,491 passenger cars; and it operates 13 ferries, barges and tugs. Last year this equipment covered 2,397,831,299 miles. This is quite
a distance.
The freight revenue is also very interesting.
The revenue was $678,099,947, an increase last
year of 1.5 per cent over 1966, because this is
the 1967 report. The passenger revenue was
$83,885,978, an increase of 24.3 per cent. This
is an amazing figure, and a very pleasant one.
We must, however, take into consideration
that this is the report for Centennial Year.
Unquestionably in the minds of many senators there was a big increase in the passenger
service last year. I am told-although this is
something I have not verified-that the passenger service so far indicates an increase of
8 per cent over last year. This shows that
people are going back to the railway, for
many reasons. Our highways have become
crowded with cars; there are too many accidents. On the railways the service is better,
the trains are better, meals are better, and
everything is better.
This summer I had the pleasure of making
a trip from Montreal to Vancouver by railway, and it was really a treat. The service
was very good, the meals were excellent, the
atrnosphere of friendship among the passengers was of the best, and the courtesy of the
staff was without reproach. This again
indicates why people are returning to the
trains, and I hope they will continue to do so.
Yet, honourable senators, the train service
is used by only a small minority of people,

SENATE DEBATES
because of the comparative slowness. People
like to travel fast nowadays and many are
using air services. We are spending billions of
dollars to provide facilities for air services,
and I believe that in time it will be necessary
to help the passenger services on some lines
which do not pay very well. I know that a
community without a passenger service and
no other travelling facility becomes a desolate
area.
In my own little community riding some 15
years ago we had four different passenger
service trains-Canadian Pacific, Canadian
National, Temiscouata, and Bangor and
Maine. For the last four years we have been
without a passenger service, and you have no
idea the effect that has had. We have no air
travel facilities, because the nearest airport
to my riding is 175 miles away. However,
last year, Centennial Year, Senator Burchill
was kind enough to let us have one of his
trains, because C.N.R. had four trains going
up that way-the Cabot, the Ocean Limited,
the Scotian and what we call the local, which
used to be the old Maritime Express. This
has made quite a change in the community.
We applied for a train for several years but
were not successful. Last year, Centennial
Year, the C.N.R. saw fit to give us a train.
It is running to full capacity all the time
and reservations have to be made ahead of
departure. The service maintains a good
schedule and it is a satisfactory arrangement.
I am very grateful to Canadian National
for this, and to Senator Burchill for giving
us one of his trains.
I was talking about the passenger service.
Perhaps in the few minutes I have left, without boring honourable senators with a lot of
figures on the financing of the Canadian
National, which is quite complicated, and
which you all have, I should like to say that I
think the Canadian National is at this
moment doing a very good job. There have
been many improvements for employees,
public relations are much better and there is
an entirely new atmosphere.
Much is now said about the new turbo train.
As an amateur railroader I have taken a
great interest in this turbo train. Naturally it
will revolutionize train service, and it is an
evolution in train design. Two weeks ago I
had the pleasure of visiting one of these
trains, and I should like to express my thanks
to Mr. Feller, Assistant Secretary to the VicePresident of Canadian National in Montreal,
and Mr. Cann, Technical Director in charge
of construction of the turbo trains. After
annoying Mr. Feller for two hours one morning, in his office, asking questions of all kinds,

November 20, 1968

he finally arranged a tour to one of his trains.
I was accompanied by Mr. Cann, and my tour
lasted about three hours. I had the privilege
of viewing one of the trains from the inside,
the outside, underneath and from the topbelieve me, it was a revelation!
This train has many technical aspects. Perhaps I may give a few details. The train is
aerodynamic in design, which enables it to
travel without too much air resistance. It will
have seven cars including the turbo-power
locomotive. It has a modern design and when
you sit in it you think you are in a jet. It does
not look like a train at all, and it does not
ride like a train. The seats are designed like
those in airplanes. Meals will be served by
stewardesses at the passengers' seats, and
there will be attendants in the club cars.
The train, which will carry 340 passengers,
will have two classes, a first class and second
class. The train is all aluminum which, of
course, makes it lighter in weight. It has
made a few trial runs between Montreal and
Toronto, and it has also made some in the
United States. During trial runs it travelled as
fast as 160 miles per hour. The train will be
able to accelerate up to 120 miles per hour
within five minutes. The proposed overall
speed is 90 miles per hour. This will shorten
the travelling time on the Toronto-Montreal
run by one hour. The Rapido, which is one of
the fastest trains today, travels at 90 miles
per hour 67 per cent of the time, whereas the
turbo will travel at 95 miles per hour 88 per
cent of the time. This is due to many factors,
such as a single set of wheels. It has one axle
with one wheel on each side. The axle is set
between the two wheels and supports the
front end of one car and the rear end of the
other. This reduces the number of wheels.
Another feature is that the wheels on the
power cars are all made of steel. There are
two power turbos, one at each end. One is a
tractor type and the other a pusher, although
they operate in an identical manner, depending on the way in which the train is travelling.
One pulls and the other pushes.
There are three turbos or motors in each
locomotive. Two are for the traction power
and one for the servicing of the cars, which
includes all utilities such as heating, ventilation, lights and operation of doors and steps.
The turbos are not very big; they are what
we call the ST6, a modification of the PT6
turbo aircraft engine. They weigh less than
400 pounds and can produce 400 horsepower,
approximately a pound per horsepower,
which is amazing. The turbos are connected
together end to end. A compressor is operated

Novemnber 20, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

which in turn feeds an extra supply of air to
operate the turbos. The power, supplied
through drive shafts, will go first by these
interim connections to a gear or reduction box
and from there to a transfer case, and then to
two drive shafts connected to the driving
wheels of the locomotive.
There are two axles and two wheels under
the locomotive unit. It is one of the features
of the train which has amazed many people.
What really impressed me was the new type
of brakes. There is only one brake shoe per
wheel, and instead of braking on the sides of
the wheel it brakes over the top. This brake
is very effective, although it is the old conventional air brake system. By pressing over
the top of the wheel it eliminates vibration
and it keeps the wheels on the rails when the
train makes a sudden stop. Another feature of
this system is that all brakes operate at the
same time, uniformly, by electric relays. This
is contrary to the old conventional train
where the brake application takes effect on
the first car, then on the second car, and so
on until it reaches the last car. This new
method apparently has been very effective,
and the braking action is smooth. There is no
noise and the train can be stopped in a much
shorter distance than is the case with conventional brakes.
The cars are tight together, and there is no
backlash. The old locking-pin device is back
in service. Everything is tight. When the
engine moves half an inch, the rear car
moves half an inch. Everything is rigid. This
makes it much more effective, and gives a
smoother ride.
As to the cars themselves, the conventional
train car is 13 feet 6 inches high and 9 feet 6
inches wide, whereas the turbo car is 11 feet
high and 10 feet wide.
Another feature which helps to increase the
speed of the turbo train is that the distance
from the floor to the rail is 42 inches in the
case of the conventional train compared to 32
inches in the turbo train, about a foot lower.
The train does not actually rest on the axle
but floats on air chambers, and when it is idle
it stands lower than when it is running. Once
the turbo is started, air is sent through the
system and the train rises about 3 inches and
floats on a cushion of air, something like the
tire of a car.
The suspension, which is new, is a torsilastic suspension. It has been tested and has
proved to be very successful. It is not like the
conventional train, resting on the axle. It is
suspended from the top, like the pendulum of
a clock. Perhaps the best way to illustrate its

action is to assume that while I am standing
on my two legs the floor should lean to one
side. Naturally I would keep my body
straight by bending one knee. The torsilastic
suspension system acts in exactly the same
way. The two puspension rods have knees to
bend, and one will bend on a curve while the
other will remain straight. If this floor were
to rise on one side I would remain level by
bending, say, my left knee and by forcing my
right knee straight I would lean against the
curve.
The curve of the track, at the highest curve
elevation, is approximately 3 inches. This is
the highest permissible elevation. This will
have the same effect on the train as if the
elevation were 15 inches, which would be
impractical, because the train would upset at
that elevation. The effect of this torsilastic
suspension is that, although the grade is 3
inches or less, it will allow the train to take
curves at very high speeds, with the car leaning towards the inside of the curves, against
the centrifugal force which otherwise would
force it toward the outside. It is just the
opposite of what takes place on the conventional train.
Al doors are sliding doors and can be operated by the conductor from one control.
There are three steps after the doors are
opened. The doors are in the centre. For
instance, the train will sit in the station at
Montreal and if one wants to get out of the
car, one has to climb three steps to get out.
The train rides naturally much more closely to the track than in the case of the conventional train.
Honourable senators, as I said a while ago,
it is an aerodynamic design, to reduce friction. The train is all aluminum. It is much
lighter. Perhaps these figures will be of
interest. The weight of one of these turbo
trains is 600,000 pounds, compared to the conventional train which we have today, weighing about 2,300,000 pounds. It is much lighter
in weight, and there are many other features.
One of the things which amazed me was
concerning what we al knew on the old
locomotives as cow-catchers, the steel guard,
and so on. The red nose which you see on the
train is plastic; its purpose is that of a spinner on a propeller, to reduce air resistance,
but I can assure you that behind it all there
is the protection required.
As regards the operation of the locomotive
itself, it is very simple. There is one leverlike that of the electric cars of the old days,
where a lever was swung-and this lever controls everything. There are a number of green

SENATE DEBATES
and red lights, telling the engineer what is
taking place. He controls everything by
means of these light indicators.
When he applies the brake, the power is
automatically eut from the turbos. When he
applies the power, the brake releases itself.
Honourable senators, these are only some
of the features. I hope the day is not very far
off when we can all have a trial run on this
train, as I think all senators would enjoy
it. It is something new, and it is something
that people expect. I am sure this will revolutionize the railway service and I hope very
much that the Canadian National Railways
will find this train successful, and I wish
them all success.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. G. Percival Burchill: Honourable
senators, we listened with very much pleasure to Senator Edgar Fournier's most informative address. I was deeply interested in
his description of the achievements of the
Canadian National Railways. I hope that its
new activities and operations will not be
confined to the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, but that the C.N.R. will find a way of
using this new train in the provinces of Nova
Scotia and New Brunswick and also in the
other Atlantic provinces.
Honourable senators, I endorse what Senator Fournier has said about the service and
the courtesy of the officials of the Canadian
National Railways. I travel extensively by
rail, because my home, like that of Senator
Fournier, is not near an airport. I must give
the railway employees full marks for their
courtesy to me and to all the other passengers. We have a very high opinion of them
down in our section of the Province of New
Brunswick. We are proud of the officials of
the C.N.R.
Honourable senators, I am not entirely
happy about Senator Fournier's remarks
regarding robbing us in our section of the
province of a superior train, the great Ocean
Limited, which began long ago. We always
considered it as one of Canada's crack trains.
We were robbed of that and it incurred the
indignation, let me say, of the mayors and

November 20, 1968

citizens of many towns on the north shore of
New Brunswick.
However, they have substituted for the
Ocean Limited a train called the Chaleur,
which originates in Moncton and runs to
Montreal. I complained last year or the year
before about the timetable of the Ocean
Limited, under which it arrived at Montreal
about 15 minutes after the departure of the
train for Ottawa, so that passengers on the
Ocean Limited had to wait in Montreal about
two hours for the next train. This means that
we did not reach Ottawa until the afternoon.
That matter was aired at a meeting of the
committee here, when the officials of the
C.N.R. were present. I am happy to give the
President, Mr. MacMillan, full credit because
we had some correspondence and when the
schedules were drawn up that difficulty was
wiped out. In fact, the Chaleur arrived on a
schedule that gave us about 15 or 20 minutes
to make the connection for Ottawa.
Now, however, with the new winter
schedule we find that it is the old story again.
We arrive in Montreal half an hour after the
train for Ottawa has left. At that hour of the
day, when you cannot do much business in
Montreal, you just have to sit there in the
Central Station for two hours.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: May I ask the honourable senator a question? Is it not a fact
that the Ocean Limited now arrives one half
hour before the train departs for Ottawa?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: It may, but that train
does not serve our section of the province. It
serves Senator Fournier's section but it does
not do us any good.
I intend to register another protest. I hope
the officials of the Canadian National Railway
will appear again before the committee on
this bill. If they do, they will hear from me.

SENATE DEBATES

able Senator Croll that a special committee
of the Senate be appointed to investigate and
report upon all aspects of poverty in Canada.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators,
the fight against poverty is practically the
history of man. It has been more or less the
main responsibility and preoccupation of governments of all types over the centuries. This
fight in fact covers the whole of the social,
economic, financial and monetary fields.
Consequently, it is not surprising that the
debate on the motion by Senator Croll to
appoint a special committee to investigate and
report upon all aspects of poverty in Canada
bas covered practically as much ground as
did the debate on the Address in Reply to the
Speech from the Throne.
Very little can be irrelevant. For this reason I express some concern as to the generalities of the terms of reference of the committee suggested by Senator Croll. He himself in
his speech has narrowed to some extent the
task which he had in mind for the committee.
The Leader of the Government in his speech
yesterday also suggested very specific questions upon which the committee should
concentrate its attention. However, those
speeches, if they provide some guidelines,
have only a moral authority over the committee, and if it should decide to be guided
only by the terms of reference, as defined in
the motion, its activities could cover such a
wide area that it would not be able to report
for several years.
In his speech of yesterday, the Leader of
the Government expressed practically the
same fear. He went even so far as to suggest
that the committee might be to a large extent
trying to accomplish a useless job. In this, of
course, he would be right, if we were to
believe the Prime Minister when he speaks of
his "just society". A just society is certainly
one in which one would not be able to find
any poverty and, therefore, if the present
Government knows how to achieve this just
society, of what use can this committee be?
Furthermore, the Leader of the Government yesterday indicated very clearly that
the committee should not start from the premise that our present system of social security and assistance is inadequate. He took the
care to put on record facts and figures to
indicate that our present legislation is still
very sound and need not seriously be questioned. He even added-and this is another
indication that he does not believe in the
usefulness of the committee-that al this

November 21, 1968

legislation is constantly under review. I agree
with him that it would be foolish to ignore
what has been achieved by this legislation,
and I also concur in his views that our record
in Canada compares favourably with that of
almost any other country.
On the other hand, I suggest that the committee's main preoccupation, if not the only
one, should be to consider the efficacy or
inefficacy of our social and welfare legislation.
Is it not superfluous or redundant in many
instances and, if so, could we not, by trimming and saving in many areas, fill some of
the gaps which certainly exist? I say "some of
the gaps," because I do not think we can ever
hope to fill all the gaps. In other words,
should not the committee restrict itself to a
comprehensive review of the social and welfare legislation? Again I suggest that to try to
deal with the problem of poverty generally
would be an impossible objective for the
committee because this is the general objective of all our social, economic, financial and
monetary policies.
Let me remind you of what the Speech
from the Throne said in connection with this
problem. I read from page 35 of Hansard:
A great deal has been accomplished in
recent years to make the Canadian society more just in terms of income distribution and security against the vicissitudes
of life. Pensions for the aged, provision
for the sick and for the needy have been
made more effective by legislation passed
in recent Parliaments and by action of
the provinces. Notwithstanding such measures, poverty continues to exist in Canada. My Government recognizes that, but
it also believes that it would be deluding
and cruel to pretend that there is a simple, all-encompassing or instantaneously
effective remedy. Poverty can be dealt
with successfully and permanently only
by continued and determined action in a
variety of ways by all governments.
I am convinced that the Senate does not
wish this committee to cover the whole front
of an effective fight against poverty, which
includes the examination of all means to
attain a prosperous economy as well as a fair
distribution of its proceeds. We certainly do
not want this committee to tell us, for
instance, if we should move towards more
state control or less in the exploitation of our
resources, the supply of services and the production and distribution of goods.

November 21, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Therefore, while I praise Senator Crol for
bringing in this motion, I would like to ask
him if he would not agree to amend it so that
the first paragraph would read as follows:
That a special committee of the Senate
be appointed to investigate and report on
the efficacy or inefficacy of our system of
social and welfare legislation in dealing
with all aspects of poverty in Canada,
whether urban, rural, regional or otherwise, and to recommend appropriate
action to insure the establishment of a
more effective structure of remedial
measures.

called them. These were in four main colours:
red, blue, grey and green-then there were
some tartans. Medals were worn, and many
of the soldiers had blazers on which they had
their regimental crests done in gold. These
soldiers came from every unit that served in
the First War; they were of every rank and
every occupation; and while this trip to
Europe has cost the taxpayers of Canada a
certain amount of money, I do not think that
Canada has ever sent finer ambassadors to
Belgium and France than this group of old
veterans.

I do not propose this as an amendment, but
merely as a suggestion. I would feel more
secure if this suggestion were accepted. If it
is not, I would hope that it would at least
serve as a guideline to the committee or as a
warning that if it tries to do too much, it will
accomplish very little.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Croll, debate
adjourned.

Hon. Mr. White: Senator Leonard told you
something yesterday of the great affection
shown by the Belgians towards the Canadians. This same welcome was extended to
Canadians everywhere we went in France. At
Vimy Ridge-and, unfortunately, the day we
visited it turned out to be very foggy-there
was a very large number of French civilians
and children. After the ceremonies everyone
went to visit the trenches, and there is a
large crater separating the German and Allied
trenches. Coming back from this inspection,
the children were all lined up, marching with
their teachers, and somehow or other our old
friend Brigadier Jimmy Melville became the
leader of the children. He led them back to the
monument, and they all sang that good old
French song Alouette.
On Armistice night the mayor of Paris gave
a reception, to which all the Canadians were
invited, and there were many French veterans from the First War in attendance too.
While, to some degree, there was difficulty
with the language, there was no difficulty in
communicating. We soon realized and felt
that we all belonged to this fraternity of old
soldiers, and there was more than the greatest goodwill on both sides. In honour of the
Canadians, the French veterans sang Tipperary in English; and, in response, we sang
Alouette in French.
A very interesting incident occurred at the
memorial at Bourlon Wood. The battle of
Bourlon Wood took place towards the closing
months of the war. This monument stands on
ground that was owned by the Count de
Frangueville. The Canadians captured the
farm, and after the war the Count gave this
hill and the large wood to the Canadian Government, on which it erected a fine monument. It is most impressive. One ascends the
monument by stone steps which are lined on
either side by large lime trees which, as was

WORLD WAR I
COMMEMORATION CEREMONIES IN FRANCE
AND BELGIUM OF FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY
OF ARMISTICE

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
debate on the inquiry of the honourable Senator Leonard, calling the attention of the
Senate to the Commemoration in France and
Belgium of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the
World War I Armistice and of the participation therein of Canadian veterans of the said
War.
Hon. George S. White: Honourable senators,
I would like to thank my colleague, Senator Leonard, for the very generous reference
he made to me yesterday. In return, I
cannot think of any finer and more genial
person with whom to travel than Senator
Leonard. In addition, he is still a real old
soldier and has not forgotten the soldier's
vocabulary.
Yesterday the senator gave this chamber a
detailed and very colourful description of this
pilgrimage to France and Belgium by the veterans of World War I. In my very brief
remarks I will attempt to fill in here and
there, and to give some of my impressions of
a return visit to the battlefields, some of the
old memories and some of the things that the
old soldiers on the trip talked about.
It was a very colourful group. Everyone
wore their berets, or "berries", as the soldiers

SENATE DEBATES
specially pointed out to us, were almost destroyed by gun fire but, after being given very
fine care, were revived and now enhance the
approach to this memorial.
In the Second World War the Count was in
the underground. He was captured, and sent
to a German concentration camp where he
died. On the day of the ceremony, the
Countess, her son and his wife and the two
children, were present, and the Deputy
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Mr. Côté, spoke
in French to a large gathering, explaining the
history of Bourlon Wood and the gift of the
Hill to the Canadian Government. The
Countess replied, and asked all the veterans
to call on her at the chateau just down the
road where she wanted to give to every one a
glass of champagne. All of the veterans went
down, and once again were met by large
numbers of the French population. There may
have been some language difficulties encountered, but no one had any difficulty in communicating or of feeling the warmth of heart
that these French citizens had for the
Canadians.
As we left it was very touching to see tears
running down this most gracious lady's face
as she attempted to say goodbye and thank
the Canadians for what they had done for her
country 50 years ago.
When we arrived at the monument at Courcelette, which is on the Somme where the
Canadians had a tough time, we found waiting for us-and this was quite unexpectedthe Mayor of Courcelette and other officials, a
large number of children and French citizens
from the community. The mayor made a
speech explaining what had happened 50
years ago in the Battle of the Somme, and
laid a wreath on behalf of the citizens of
Courcelette. After our own ceremony was
over the school children lined up, and each
laid a bouquet of chrysanthemums of various
colours at the foot of the monument.
When the ceremonies were over we always
mingled with the French citizens, shaking
hands and saying whatever few words we
could to them. Here again we were all
impressed by the warmth of feeling and
appreciation of these citizens.
At Quesnel, which is on the Amiens front
where the battle of August 8, 1918 took place,
there were a large number of French veterans of the First War who had their regimental colours with them. The mayor was present, as were other officials and many children.

November 21, 1968

There was also a French bugler who, when it
came time, blew the Last Post with our own
bugler. After Reveille a French soldier played
O Canada on a cornet. It was an extremely
moving ceremony at Quesnel.
On Armistice afternoon, as Senator Leonard told us yesterday in some detail, the
army paraded before General de Gaulle.
Along both sides of this long avenue there
were French troops, each one holding a regimental banner of some kind, bearing their
colours and their crests. There were also soldiers from the allied countries with their own
colours. You will be interested to know that
directly in front of the stand where General
de Gaulle took the salute was the flag of
Canada.
After this ceremony was over there was
some delay in getting away in the bus and for
some time we mingled with and talked to the
French people. When we got into the bus it
was like an old homecoming, we were waving
to them, and all was smiles and friendly
handshakes.
Senator Leonard referred to the evening
ceremony at Compiegne Wood, where the
Armistice was signed. Leading up to this
place there was a long avenue lined with
French soldiers, each one holding a torch.
When the ceremony was over the Canadians
marched back between these two rows of torches and as soon as the civilians discovered
we were Canadians they all wanted to shake
hands, and the applause all along that avenue
was most heartrending and very touching.
Senator Leonard also made reference yesterday to the memorials erected by Newfoundland, and paid a well-deserved tribute to the
bravery and record of the soldiers from that
province. On looking over the ground and
reading something of the battles in which
they were engaged one learns that the troops
from Newfoundland, like those from the rest
of Canada, were always given the toughest
assignments.
I want to refer briefly to the Newfoundland
monument at Beaumont Hamel, which was on
the Somme front. Old soldiers will remember
the Battle of the Somme started on July 1,
1916. On the first day of the battle there were
over 60,000 casualties and we gained merely a
few yards of trenches. This monument is most
impressive. It has a large bronze caribou with
its head held high in a most defiant manner,
standing on a flower-covered base of rock
from Newfoundland, rising to a height of
some 50 feet. The approach to this monument

November 21, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

is most effective. The landscaping is very
effective and sets off the monument in a fine
manner.
Around Beaumont Hamel the trenches and
shell holes have been left exactly as they
were in 1916. The only difference is that they
are now covered with grass. The same ugly
barbed wire is still in place, and on looking
at those trenches one could not help but wonder how we ever lived and survived in them
for months and months.
My colleague described to you in detail
yesterday the ceremony held at each memorial. It certainly was most impressive. No matter
how many times you attend a ceremony of
this nature, when you hear the Last Post and
Reveille and the piper playing Flowers of the
Forest, as you stand there in silence, it is
amazing how the memories flash through
your mind. You remember the faces of old
friends and comrades, old associations, you
think of the good times and the bad times. It
was amazing what memories came back in
those few brief moments of silence.
I want to join with Senator Leonard in the
well-deserved tribute he paid to Colonel Milton Gregg, V.C., Brigadier Jimmie Melville,
the officers of the R.C.M.P., Mr. Côté from
D.V.A. and all the other officials from D.V.A.
who did such a marvellous job in arranging
and planning this pilgrimage. The manner in
which it was carried out indicates the most
careful planning of every detail.
Naturally every one of us had some special
spot that he wanted to revisit or something
he wanted to see. At Vimy we were all disappointed because of the fog. In this chamber,
immediately above my head, there is a wonderful picture showing the return of civilians
to a small village called Albion St. Nazaire.
On looking closely at the picture you can see
a sign which says that this is Albion St.
Nazaire, which may strike you as strange.
However, that was quite common because all
that was left of the village was rubble and
there is the sign there to tell you what it is.
This little village is behind Vimy and is very
close to the Village of Souchez. Anyone who
was on the Somme would want to go to the
Village of Albert, because at the village
church there was a very large statue of the
Virgin Mary which hung for many months at
right angles over the street. On our visit we
were there for lunch, after which we went to
the church, which has been completely
restored, and there is now a new statue in
gold on top of the church.

When I was on the Somme I was most
anxious to find some landmarks. There used
to be an old sugar factory there. Everything
seemed to stem from that sugar factory
because we all knew it and used to get our
directions from it. However, it was impossible
to find.
The greatest recollection of ail the veterans
I know who were on the Somme is the terrible mud. Those who are old enough will
remember that after the First World War
there was a great deal of criticism of certain
service clubs operating during the war, especially the Y.M.C.A. Anyone who was on the
Somme will still remember the road leading
from Albert to Bapaume. After a spell in the
trenches soldiers came down that road in
groups of four because it was under heavy
shellfire. On coming out of the line one's
ambition was to reach a certain shellhole,
because there under continuous shellfire the
Y.M.C.A. had a hut in which they served hot
coffee. I never tasted such good coffee in my
life. It was made out of water from the shellhole; it had neither cream nor sugar and was
served in a baking powder tin. Soldiers coming from the battle on the Somme never tasted a finer drink!
I would like to say a word and pay a tribute to the officers and the men who make up
and carry out the duties of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. It is a great
credit to these men for the very, very fine
way in which all these cemeteries are kept.
Each grave has a shrub or a flower of some
kind, usually a rose bush. I am sure it must
be a great source of satisfaction to parents
from Canada going to visit the grave of a son
to find that he is buried in a cemetery which
is so beautifully kept.

As we travelled through Belgium and
northern France one was impressed with the
very, very large number of Canadian cemeteries. These cemeteries from World War I
indicate the price that Canada paid in a tragedy that defies the imagination of today. It
was the price Canada paid in a war to end
wars; it was the price Canada paid in a war
to make the world safe for democracy, and
yet the war proved or gained nothing. The
peace treaty only laid a powder trail to World
War II. How true were the words of Marshal
Foch who, after the peace treaty was signed,
said, "This is not peace; it is an armistice for
20 years."
As you wander through these Canadian
cemeteries you fully appreciate the folly and

SENATE DEBATES
the tragedy of war when you realize that over
60,000 young Canadians did not return. I
thought in looking at these hundreds and
hundreds of graves that in each one was
buried the hopes, dreams and the ambitions
of a young Canadian. What a waste of brains,
ability and talent. Who among us can tell or
say that perhaps one of those 60,000 young
Canadians who did not come home might
have turned out to be the famous research
scientist whose brain discovered the golden
key to unlock the secret cure for cancer.
This Canadian group, like all the units in
the First World War, came from every part
of this great nation, from every class, creed,
colour and ethnie group, but in this pilgrimage, as in the war, we were all just Canadians. We represented Canada, not as a Dutch
Canadian, an Irish Canadian or any other
kind of Canadian, for such distinctions did
not exist in the First War. In that war we
Canadians were united in a comradeship
which cannot be described in words. We were
held together by some invisible bond that is
stronger than steel. We all belonged to a fraternity that will last for each individual's lifetime. Today, as you look over the Canadian
scene with all our so-called petty divisions,
we old soldiers wonder why we do not have
in Canada now just a little of that invisible
bond of steel, that fraternal feeling that held
both young and old soldiers together. If we
could only have a bit of that in Canada we
could all be just plain Canadians and determined to make our Canada united, the best
and the finest country in the world.

standing interest the words of Senator Leonard
and of Senator White.
For the rest of us, whether it be those who
participated in the Second World War, or
those who participated in no war, there can
be no doubt how we all have been moved by
the portrayal of the pilgrimage in which two
of our colleagues participated.
We are reminded every day in this chamber of the First World War by the eight
paintings which hang on our walls. Fifty
years is a long time in the lives of human
beings and in the life of a nation. There are
so many millions of our fellow citizens of
whom World War I is but an incident of
history. It is an incident of the greatest
importance; and it is well for us to remind
ourselves of our debt, as Senator White has
just recalled, to those 60,000 brave Canadian
lads who joined in defending what they
believed to be a war which might end in a
permanent peace, which might end in a preservation of the democratie way of life.
I could not but note that Senator White
himself, a gallant participant in that war,
spoke somewhat bitterly about the failure of
its consequences. It has not brought permanent peace. It has not guaranteed the democratie way of life but, as he himself observed
today and as did Senator Leonard yesterday,
it has brought home to us how important is
the effort to eliminate war as an instrument
of national policy, how important it is, in face
of the sacrifice of those men, for the rest of

SENATE DEBATES

INVESTMENT COMPANIES BILL
SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED
Hon. Paul Desruisseaux moved the second
reading of Bill S-17, respecting Investment
Companies.
He said: Honourable senators, Bill S-17,
intituled "An Act respecting Investment Companies" is a major and most important bill of
this Parliament. A large number of federally
incorporated companies act in the capacity of
financial intermediaries. Many of these, such
as banks, insurance, trust and mortgage loan
companies, are presently supervised and
regulated in the interests of their creditors
under existing legislation. However, there are
many of diversified types, but including
primarily finance and acceptance-type companies, for which there is no comparable supervision or regulation. Recent collapses of
several of this type, although essentially involving companies under provincial jurisdiction, have pointed out the danger of such a
vacuum. Many investors have suffered losses
and, on occasion, confidence in the stability of
our financial institutions has been shaken.
This bill is intended to establish a system
of supervision, registration and regulation for
most such companies incorporated under federal law, in an effort to protect their creditors
from similar catastrophes. The act will be
administered by the Department of Insurance
and will thus come under the direction of the
Minister of Finance.
The bill applies to "investment companies"
as defined in section 2. Investment company
means, in effect, a company that raises money
by issuance of debt instruments and uses a
significant proportion of its funds for loans or
investment in bonds, other evidences of
indebtedness, instalment sales contracts,
stocks or real estate.
Mutual funds are not included within this
definition, since they do not raise money by
borrowing, and various other types of financial institutions, adequately supervised under
other legislation, are specifically excluded.
The act is divided into three parts.
Considering Part I first, section 3 provides
that the minister may exempt any investment
company from the application of the act if he
is satisfied of certain conditions. Exemptions
may be granted where a company is only
incidentally engaged in borrowing and investing, where it borrows only from major shareholders or banks or where it is a non-profit
company without share capital, incorporated

under Part II of the Canada Corporations
Act.
Section 5 provides that every investment
company is required to file annually a statement of its condition and aff airs at the end of
its fiscal year, in such form and containing
such information as is prescribed by the
Superintendent of Insurance. A system of inspection of the books, records and documents
of investment companies by inspectors
appointed by the superintendent is provided
for under section 6.
Investment companies are prohibited under
section 8 from making certain types of investments where there may be a conflict of interests. This is an important provision since
experience has shown that financial troubles
are very frequently the result of investments
and loans made where there is less than an
arm's length relationship.
The prohibition is based on the principles
of defining certain persons who are likely to
have a significant influence on the company
and its investment policy. Loans to or investments in the securities of such persons are
prohibited. Also, where any such persons
have a significant interest, more than 10 per
cent of the equity shares, in another corporation, loans to or investments in the securities
of that corporation are prohibited.
Persons in the class just described are
specified in the bill as the following: (1), a
director or an officer of the company, or a
spouse or child of such a director or officer;
(2), an individual, his spouse or any of his
children under the age of 21 years if either
the individual or a group consisting of the
individual, his spouse and such children is a
substantial shareholder of the company; (3) a
corporation that is a substantial shareholder
of the company. A "substantial shareholder"
is a shareholder that holds more than 10 per
cent of the voting shares.
In addition, loans to or investment in the
securities of another corporation would be
barred if the directors, officers, their spouses
and children as a group owned more than 50
per cent of the stock of such corporation,
even though no one such person owns more
than 10 per cent.
The prohibition would apply only against
any such loan or investment being made
"knowingly", but, if made in ignorance of the
facts bringing it within the prohibition, the
company would be required to dispose of the
investment on learning of those facts.

SENATE DEBATES
Provision is made for exemption of specific
investments on application where the investment was made while the company was not
subject to the act or where it is shown that
the investment is in a corporation in which a
major shareholder, not a director or officer,
has an important interest but the shareholder
does not take any part in or exercises any
influence on the company.
Honourable senators, it would be intended
to proclaim Part I, "Supervision of Investment Companies", in force as soon as the
department has organized the necessary staff
to administer it. Part II, which is concerned
primarily with the setting up of a system of
registration, and with the granting to the
minister of the power to impose limitations
on the operations of investment companies
and the power to wind up those in unsatisfactory financial condition, will not come into
force for at least two years after Part I comes
into force. Part I deals with the supervision
of investment companies. The reason for the
delay is that it is unlikely that the minister
could effectively use his powers to regulate a
company's operations until the supervisory
authorities have gained considerable experience with the type of company concerned
through their inspection and examination of
their financial statements. Until this situation
is reached, it would not be wise to assume
the responsibility of issuing, refusing or withdrawing certificates of registry with all that
such actions imply.
Examining Part II in greater detail, section
10 permits the minister to issue a certificate
of registry to an investment company upon
application, and to renew such a certificate.
He may also impose and vary conditions and
limitations relating to the carrying on of the
business of investment in a certificate of
registry, and may in effect terminate the certificate of registry at any time, subject to the
right of the investment company to make
representations before any such decision is
taken. He is also authorized to issue a certificate of registry to a company that does not
technically qualify as an investment company
if the company carries on the business of
investment and applies for such a certificate.
It is further provided that any registered
company shall be deemed to be an investment company as long as it continues to be
registered.

November 21, 1968

borrowing of money in certain instances, provide for especially close supervision of investment companies in financial difficulties, and
permit the minister as a last resort to dissolve
an investment company or to apply for a
winding-up order if it is felt that such action
is necessary to protect the investing public.
The sections also provide for a resolution of
any conflict that may arise between terms of
the Winding-up Act and the Bankruptcy Act.
Specifically, section 11 (1) and (2) requires
companies subject to the act to apply for certificates of registry within the time periods
stated. A distinction, important for the succeeding sections, is drawn between two types
of investment companies which may be
referred to as Type A and Type B. Type A
companies are those to which section 11 (1)
applies, mainly companies incorporated after
the coming into force of Part II (certificates
of registry), and primarily for the purpose of
carrying on the business of investment. Other
investment companies, which will include
mainly all existing investment companies as
well as all those which become investment
companies in the future by reason of the
nature of their business and not by reason of
their incorporation, are referred to as Type B
companies.
Section 11 provides that a Type A company
must apply for a certificate of registry within
two years of its incorporation. Section 13 prohibits it from borrowing until it has been
issued a certificate of registry. A Type A
company which fails to apply for a certificate
within two years of its incorporation, or
which borrows money before it has been
issued a certificate of registry, may be dissolved by ministerial order under section 12.
Type B companies are required by section
11 to apply for a certificate of registry within
two months of the coming into force of Part
II or within three months of the close of their
fiscal years during which they became investment companies. If they fail to do so, they
are prohibited by section 13 from increasing
their outstanding indebtedness, and they are
subject to being wound up under section 17
(1) (a).
When an investment company applies for
registration, section 14 requires that the superintendent make a special report to the
minister recommending against the issuing of

report and an opportunity to be heard by the
minister in connection therewith, but if the
minister nevertheless agrees with the opinion
of the superintendent he shall refuse to issue
a certificate of registry. He may or may not
allow the company a period of time within
which to improve its financial condition and
affairs, but until he issues a certificate of
registry he has the power to apply to a court
of competent jurisdiction for a winding-up
order under section 17 (1) (b) or (c). Meanwhile, from the time it has received notice of
a special report under section 14 until it has
been issued a certificate of registry, an
investment company is forbidden by section
13 to increase its indebtedness.
When the superintendent believes that the
ability of a registered company to meet its
inadequately
obligations
is
outstanding
secured, he is required by section 15 to make
a special report to the minister with regard to
its financial condition and affairs. The company must be given a copy of the special report
and an opportunity to be heard in connection
therewith by the minister. If the minister
nevertheless agrees with the superintendent,
he has three courses of action open:
(a) to allow the company a period of time,
during which the certificate of registry
remains in force, to improve its financial condition and aff airs;
(b) to withdraw the certificate of registry
and replace it by a conditional certificate; or
(c) to withdraw the certificate of registry
without replacing it by a conditional certificate.
Until he is satisfied that the financial condition of a company has been fully rehabilitated, the minister may change from (a) to (b) or
(c), or from (b) to (c), but, while either (b) or
(c) is in force, the company is prohibited by
section 13 from increasing its indebtedness. If
a certificate of registry has been withdrawn
without being replaced by a conditional certificate, the minister may apply for an order
to wind up the company under section 17 (1)
(d) or (e).
After a special report has been made under
section 14 or 15, a company will be supervised particularly closely until it has significantly improved its financial condition and
affairs. If it seems advisable, the minister
may apply under section 16 to a superior
court for the appointment of an interim
receiver to conserve the assets of the company after the making of such a report.

A number of instances have just been
specified where a company is prohibited from
borrowing by section 13. In all such instances,
the directors are made individually liable as
guarantors of the amounts borrowed in violation of the section.
Section 18 provides that when proceedings
are taken under the Bankruptcy Act they
shall have precedence over proceedings under
the Winding-up Act. Section 17(2) authorizes
the minister to become a party to any such
proceedings.
Section 19 provides for the annual publication in the Canada Gazette of a list of registered companies.
The superintendent is required by section
20 to submit annually to the minister a report
setting out particulars of the financial condition and aff airs of each registered company at
the end of its fiscal year ending in the last
completed calendar year.
Part III of the act, which will come into
force at the same time as Part I, sets forth
various administrative provisions. The most
important sections are: section 21, which provides that expenses incurred in the administration of the act will be assessed against
investment companies in proportion of their
incomes; section 22, which authorizes the
Governor in Council to make regulations to
secure the establishment and maintenance of
a sound financial structure for investment
companies; section 23, which authorizes the
superintendent to prescribe necessary forms
and the information to be contained in the
annual statement, and to appoint inspectors;
and sections 27 to 29, which are concerned
with offences and penalties.
Honourable senators, it is not known at this
time how many companies would be subject
to the act. Some companies have been positively identified and a preliminary list has
been drawn. However, there are a large number of companies incorporated federally,
apparently for investment purposes, and a
considerable amount of work will be involved
before they are al identified and it is determined whether they would be subject to the
act or not. If they do not borrow, they will
not be subject to the act, even though they
are primarily incorporated as investment
intermediaries. Companies that raise their
money only through the issuance of capital
stock will not be subject to the act. A distinction is drawn between that type of company
and a company that borrows money, in that
the former has no fixed dollar obligations to

SENATE DEBATES
the public; the shareholders become participants in the enterprise and must expect to
share its fortunes, good or bad.
Mutual funds will not be covered by the
act, since they raise their money by the issuance of equity instruments and do not incur
fixed dollar liabilities to the public. The superintendent states that it is also important in
this connection to note that there is a committee studying mutual funds and investment
contract companies under joint federal and
provincial auspices. This committee is expected to report early in the next few months.
Legislation relating to mutual funds would no
doubt be based upon its recommendations.
Investment contract companies are companies that sell contracts to the public requiring
the payment to the company of annual or
periodic payments and providing for the payment by the company of a fixed sum at
maturity of the contract. There are no federally incorporated companies active in this
type of business. Most of the provinces have
special legislation governing such companies.
The superintendent expects, honourable
senators, that there will be great variety and
complexity encountered among the companies subject to the proposed act. It will,
therefore, take some time for the department
to become thoroughly acquainted with all the
various types of companies concerned and
their financial condition and affairs. For this
reason it is proposed to delay the coming into
force of the registration procedure. It may
well be that some of the companies subject to
the act are not in a financial condition that
would justify the issuance of a certificate of
registry. Thus, some time may be needed in
order to enable such companies to be placed
in a satisfactory financial condition. The issuance of a certificate of registry under the
legislation implies that the company is in
satisfactory condition, and before this procedure is started it is desired to have a thorough knowledge of the companies concerned
and an opportunity of discussing any of the
financial implications with the companies
affected.
The system of supervision contemplated in
the act, namely, the filing of financial statements, inspection by the staff of the department, and control through the issuance of
certificates of registry, is essentially the same
system that is now used for insurance, trust,
and loan companies.
Except for clause 8 of the bill prohibiting
investments and loans that are not at arm's

November 21, 1968

length, there are no provisions establishing
financial standards or restricting investments.
It is thought that, initially at least, time
should be available to identify the companies
concerned and to learn the details of their
activities. Only after a thorough knowledge is
gained of the variety of companies that will
be subject to the act, can proposals be made
as respects the establishment of financial
standards. For this reason, the bill seeks
power to adopt the necessary regulations. It is
not expected that regulations can be proposed
for some time.
Honourable senators, Ontario has recently
passed special regulations under the Securities Act, effective July 1, 1968, requiring special reporting by finance companies. This
procedure will be used to regulate companies
that seek to borrow money by the issuance of
securities in Ontario. For the most part, the
regulations under the Securities Act require
the disclosure of full financial information,
but no system of licensing or regulation is
contemplated. Even though the Ontario regulations might represent a satisfactory move, it
is to be noted t hat federally incorporated
companies are subject to the Ontario regulations only if they attempt to issue securities
in Ontario or if residents of Ontario hold any
securities issued by them. Such supervision
does not cover all that is required with respect to federally incorporated companies
since some may be active in other provinces
and, further, the Ontario regulations would
only work to prohibit borrowing operations in
Ontario or the issuance of other types of
securities.
The prohibition against investments and
loans that are not at arm's length does not
apply to prevent a company making loans to,
or investments in, a subsidiary. It is thought
that this type of transaction does not involve
a conflict of interests since the parent company has a direct interest in the success of the
subsidiary. Thus, the prohibition would not
bar the use of holding companies for raising
money and providing funds to subsidiaries.
The prohibition would, however, prevent a
company from investing in the securities of,
or lending to, a sister company, that is, one
under common ownership or control.
Companies of the type contemplated as
being subject to this legislation are now
incorporated by letters patent under the Corporations Act. It is not proposed to change
this procedure, but the concurrence of the
minister responsible for this act would be
required before letters patent are granted to

SENATE DEBATES
confined to debate on the principle of a bill.
The difficulties which have developed in the
Commons and which have overwhelmed and
slowed down their work, have been the multiplicity of stages and the repetitious nature
of the debate. On all measures introduced by
resolution, for instance, when that resolution
is passed a bill is introduced and is discussed
on second reading. The bill may then be
referred to a committee, and when it comes
back from the committee it is examined section by section. These are lengthy procedures.
I do not say that I possess a crystal ball,
but I would venture a guess that part of the
procedural reform in the Commons will
involve doing away with the resolution
process in the Commons as the preface to
certain bills. After all, there is no constitutional basis for it: the resolution procedure is
simply the product of a house rule, as I will
develop later.
We have this situation, therefore, that we
are concerned with the procedures which are
followed in the Commons because, if they
slow down the Commons in dealing with
legislation, they provide us with less work or,
it may be, work in bunches at a time when
the opportunity to examine it may not be less
than if it were sent to us at an earlier period.
Honourable senators, I have heard people
talk about reform--reforn of the Senate,
reform of Parliament. Many words have come
and gone which have acquired a peculiar connotation for a time. For a long time, nobody
said "definite"; everyone said "definitive".
For a long time, everyone used the word "escalation"; now the political emphasis seems to
be on "reform". When they talk about reform
of the Senate and reform of Parliament, in
my view they are not talking about reform of
the institutions of Parliament; they are talking mainly about reform in the procedures so
that members can deal expeditiously with the
business of Parliament.
It is open to the public to see that in every
science, in every business, in industry, we
have the latest ideas to expedite the process
of manufacture; for the process of calculation,
we have computers; for mass production,
automation. I think it would be fair to suggest that we get a little bit of that into the
procedures of Parliament and, particularly at
the moment, into the procedures of the
Commons.
That is why, on a previous occasion when I
spoke in connection with the rules which
were being considered, I approved of what
was being done. However, I did say at that

November 26, 1968

time, and I firmly hold this view, that the
updating of our rules will not add to the
debate in this house. Whether we need more
in the way of debate in this house than we
now have is, in my view, open to grave
doubt.
Any member who wishes to speak to a bill
may speak; but since our practice has been to
confine ourselves to the principle of the bill,
and to some public issues which may arise in
connection with it, we seem ta feel that
debate for the sake of debate is not a good
motto. Therefore, when we have exhausted
the stage of intelligent debate, it is time to sit
down and avoid the repetition which seems to
go on in so many places in connection with
discussions, as though by endless repetition
one were making the subject clearer.
Having said that, I conclude that it would
be a very anomalous situation if, in the New
Year, the Commons were to reform their
procedures and practices to the extent that
they will have moved out estimates and
major bills for consideration in committees,
so that they will have left the principles of
the bills for discussions-as it should be in
the Conmons-and if at the same time we
adopt the lengthy debate procedures or other
procedures abandoned by the Commons, and
thereby extend the debates in this place. That
would be an anomalous situation. But, if we
emphasize and overemphasize the business of
debate and more debate, then it is inevitable
that this is exactly the situation that is going
to occur. What will have happened then, really, is that we will have exchanged our procedures, which in my view have worked very
well here, for the Commons procedures which
they have abandoned on the basis that they
are archaic and anachronistic. I would hate to
see that situation develop here with us.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: For some years, certainly until 1949, at various times the thinking in
the Government and on the Commons side
has been that certain bills might be initiated
in the Senate, In fact, some of them have
been very large and important measures. For
instance, I think of the National Defence Act
which we considered in 1949. I happened to
be the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Commerce at that time. In order that
you may not think that I was the perpetual
chairman of the Banking and Commerce
Committee, I may say that I was only the
chairman pro tem for the consideration of
that bill. One of the major helpers in dealing

November 26, 1968

Noveber26, 968SENATE
DEBATES

with the provisions of that bill at that time,
and one who made a tremendous contribution was our Senator Arthur Roebuck.
I have gone back and read those proceedings. I may say that it was a bil having sorne
elements in it that really arnounted to the
levying of taxation or the appropriation of
moneys. Nevertheless, the bill was presented
to us notwithstanding the prohibition in section 53 of the British North America Act.
We considered the bill and made about 73
amendments to it. In order to preserve the
recognition of section 53 of the British North
America Act, what we did in committee was
to strike out the sections that deait with any
ievying of taxes or any appropriation of funds.
Then we added a ciosing paragraph to our
report, when the bill was reported out of
Committee to the Senate, saying that there
were a number of sections in the bull dealing
with the expenditure of money, which we
ordinarily call money clauses and, as the
Senate could flot initiate bills dealing with
money matters but since this bull originated
in the Senate, the clauses set out in the iast
paragraph of the report were deleted from
the bull. We said that these clauses would, of
course, be restored when the bull was considered in the other place.
This practice was followed prior to 1949 on
a number of occasions. Bills that obviousiy
flew in the face of section 53 of the British
North America Act nevertheless were introduced in the Senate, and, in committee, the
Senate adopted the expedient of striking out
such sections. Then the bill otherwise would
be reported and sent to the Commons. The
Commons would, as part of its consideration,
restore these sections, whereupon the bill
wouid corne back to the Senate as amended
and we would approve of those amendments
made by the House of Commons.
It was a course of action invented to meet
the demands and to satisfy the prohibition in
section 53 of the British North Arnerica Act.
But it was somewhat like the route little
Benny takes to go to the corner grocery store.
We really wandered around the territory
before accomplishing what we wanted. As I
say, that was done on a number of occasions.
Then there was another type of expedient
that we followed. For example, it was decided
that the bill was not; a money bill. There were
various reasons. One was that the money was
only incidentai to the main purpose of the
bill. In another case, while the bull provided
for the spending of money, it was to be out of
rnoneys to be appropriated by Parliament. In
29234--39

stiil another case, while it was to pay for
services rendered, there was a statutory
provision in the Financial Administration Act
which permitted the payment of these services, and they were not thereby classified as
money buis. There were numbers of those
situations. In fact, for those senators interested in turning it up, I believe we had such a
situation in the hast couple of years, dealing
with the Canada Lands Surveys Act.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): That was
last year.
Han. Mr. Hayden: It was during the hast
session. At that time Senator Connolly (Ottawa West) gave quite a dissertation on ail
the phases of this question, and then we had
quite a full discussion in committee. We finaliy resolved that we couhd distinguish between
a money bill and a payment for service, and
we were perfectly free to deal with it in the
ordinary
way
without adopting
these
expedients.
Now I corne to what I regard as the kernel
of this thing. I would first read to you section
53 of the British North America Act, which
says:
53. Bills for appropriating any Part of
the Public Revenue, or for imposing any
Tax or Irnpost, shail originate in the
House of Commons.
There you have a prohibition against the
introduction of bills of the character described in section 53. But that section is not al
embracing in so far as to cover everything
that rnay be described or may have been described as a rnoney bill, but only bills as cal
for "aids and supplies" to Her Majesty and
bills irnposing taxes to provide revenues for
the operation and functioning of Governrnent.
This provision was absolute, certainly up
until the No. 2 arnendment to the British
North America Act ini 1949. It was absolute in
its terms, and the only way we avoided
impact on occasions was by making use of the
expedients that I have described to you
today, where we said it was not reaiiy a
rnoney bill within section 53 or, if it was -a
rnoney blill, we did not deai with that phase
of it. But in 1949, by a resolution of the
Senate and the House of Commons, and by an
act of the Imperiai Parliarnent, the following
arnendrnent was made to section 91 of the
British North Arnerica Act. Honourable senators will recali that section 91 enurnerates the
specific powers which the federai authority

has exclusively and also the residual general
authority. The amendment in 1949 reads:

you get down to the legal basis, and the legal
basis thereafter in my submission is briefly
that the Senate or the House of Commons
may introduce legislation under this new
amending item 1 dealing with the items in
section 53 of the British North America Act,
notwithstanding the provisions of that section
and the requirement in that section that such
bills must originate in the Commons.
Now the question is, how may Parliament
proceed to do that? This question was discussed at certain federal-provincial conferences, and at one of these, when the discussion went along the lines that at least if you
were introducing a piece of legislation in the
Senate that was a money bill that might fly in
the face of section 53, the then Prime Minister of Canada, the Right Honourable Louis St.
Laurent, suggested that at least you should
say, "notwithstanding section 53." Mr. St.
Laurent's viewpoint was that you are only

SENATE DEBATES
large and increasing volume of so-called Government business which can just as readily be
introduced in the Senate as in the Commons.
The moment you remove the effect of the
prohibition that exists in section 53-and
now, as a matter of law, it is no longer an
absolute prohibition, in my submission-and
either by the introduction of a bill which flies
in the face of section 53 or by using the
words, "notwithstanding section 53", authority would then exist in the Senate, in conformity with its rules, to deal with whatever
the measure may be, and the day for the
expedients and for the attempt to distinguish
between what is incidental to the main
purpose and what is not has gone.
I can give you an illustration. You had an
explanation last Thursday of the Investment
Companies bill. In that there is provision for
the making of assessments by regulation by
the Governor in Council in amounts that are
related to the overall income and expenditures of investment companies that are
required to make returns with such percentages applied, such overall percentage, to the
particular company. That is the amount that
becomes the amount of the assessment which
the investment company must pay, and that
money is applied to take care of expenditures
of the Government in the administration of
that department.
At one stage there may have been considerable discussion, but there is no discussion
now about our right to deal with such a bill.
Even without the amendment in 1949, we
could deal with it because we were not dealing with public money or revenues. We were
taking the money from these companies to
pay for a service we were giving them and,
therefore, it would be outside the realm of
any prohibition by section 53.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Let us say there is a miscalculation and the anticipated revenue will
not be sufficient to pay for the services.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: If there is, it is just too
bad. The Government would have to make up
the difference because they make the expenditure in the first instance and reimburse themselves.

November 26, 1968

Hon. Mr. Hayden: If you are asking me
whether I agree that that is the state of the
law now, I reply, no, I do not. I say that the
state of the law now is that any bill, even a
bill that flies in the face of section 53, may be
introduced in the Senate, following the procedure of our Rule 70 in the Senate. But I then
come along and say that as a matter of practical politics, and with the great respect I pay
to the statement "no taxation without
representation," I would expect, and I would
be very disappointed if this were not the
case, that the minister and the elected members insist upon their prerogative. As a senator I would want them to take their responsibility, because of the other principle I have
asserted here from time to time, that the people who spend the money should impose the
taxes necessary to raise it.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): That is
the question I asked. Given that reservation
with respect to the democratic process, any
bill, other than an appropriation bill, can be
properly introduced here.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes, that is my view. I
have given my reasons, and my view is not
worth any more than the reasons I have
given in support of it, but there it is to be
considered.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask a question?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes, certainly.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: At the present time
money bills must be introduced in the House
of Commons. When they come to us, after
being passed by that house, there is the parliamentary rule-I think it is more than that;
it is a constitutional rule-that we cannot
increase the amount, although we hold the
opinion here that we have the right to
decrease the amount. If a money bill were
introduced here and we passed it, and sent it
to the House of Commons, would that house
be restricted in any way in respect to changing the bill?

Hon. Mr. Hayden: In my view, no. I would
think that they have full freedom in dealing,
with it. If such a bill is introduced here and
we pass it, then I think the House of Commons is free to consider changing or amendHon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): May I ing it.

ed, which would have the effect of making, in
my submission, the procedures in the House
of Commons more in line with the procedures
in this house, would work to the advantage of
both houses. One very noticeable advantage
would be in the fact that there could be
some study made of the time required in connection with the various bits of legislation
that are going to be presented, and the time
of both houses in that fashion could be utilized to broader advantage than having one
house giving its consideration to all the bills,
or, at least, to the major portion of them,
while we are sitting by with some of the
smaller bills and with our own work waiting
for those to come from the House of Commons. Perhaps some kind of division can be
worked out. Surely by now, even on a trialand-error basis, we in the Senate have
demonstrated that we can do the best work in
connection with the consideration of legislation-and here I think of the National
Defence Act, to whirh I referred earlier, and
the Criminal Code, in respect of which the
minister came over here to initiate the bill.
We put a provision in our rules years ago to
enable a minister to come over here and
introduce his bill. We have not had more bills
introduced in that manner, and it is quite
natural, I think, that ministers should want to
stay close te their legislation, particularly if
they feel it is breaking new ground. They are
loathe to leave it in the hands of another
body to present. Having pride of authorship,
in all I suppose they felt they could do a
better job in their own house. When we introduced the rule saying, "You can come over
here and say everything you could say in the
Commons", a number of them took advantage
of that. We had the Criminal Code, the
National Defence Act, and the Bankruptcy
Act on several occasions. I am just recalling
those that occurred within my tenure of office
here.
By each house complementing the work of
the other, working with some considerable
measure of co-operation, instead of having
some of the exhibitions we hear of from time
to time, and instead of the ready condemnation of the Senate as an institution-which I
think is sometimes more in an effort to draw
criticism away from their own yard-with
that spirit of co-operation we would get more
expeditious and better work, and less time
would be consumed in the doing of it, all of
which would be for the greater benefit of
Canada and of the institutions of Parliament.

November 26, 1968

Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators,
it may be risky on my part to follow Senator
Hayden after having given this matter only a
few moments reflection, but as he bas provided us with a lot of food for thought and
discussion I will take that risk.
First I wish to compliment him on calling
the attention of the Senate to this important
subject at this time, when we are reviewing
our rules and considering the so-called reform
of the Senate. I say "we," but the subject of
Senate reform is a very popular topir at government levels and generally among the publir. I would say that the objective indicated
by Senator Hayden is one which I entirely
share. To prove that, I should like to quote
from what I said on September 17 of this
year when speaking in the debate on the
Speech from the Throne, which appears at
page 37 of Hansard:
The principal solution, however, for
increasing the role of our chamber in the
legislative process is to have more legislation initiated here. This may be difficult, unless an amendment is made to the
B.N.A. Act which would authorize certain
so-called money bills-and I am thinking
of practically all bills except taxation and
appropriation bills-introduced in this
chamber, especially when the legislation
bas not too much political or, if you prefer it, electoral impact. We are better
equipped to deal with technically difficult
legislation than is the other place.
Therefore, whether or not I am prepared to
agree with Senator Hayden's thesis, I think
we are entirely in agreement on the objective
we should seek.
At the beginning of his remarks Senator
Hayden said that under the B.N.A. Act both
houses have equal authority. Constitutionally,
I agree with that, but there are differences
under section 53. However, I am not so much
interested in seeking for the Senate equal
authority with the other place. I think our
objective should be an ability to assist the
other place more than we do, to play a
greater role in the legislative process, and
otherwise. I think the other place will always
be very jealous of the privilege of keeping
complete control over exclusive appropriation
bills, or taxation bills. To be more explicit,
when I speak of an appropriation bill I am
not speaking of one which would indirectly
appropriate some money, but of a bill to deal
with budget expenditures and to impose

SENATE DEBATES

November 26, 1968

taxation. I think those bills should always be
initiated in the other place.
Under the present system I do not think
anybody should want the Senate to be another House of Commons. -If you want the Senate
to be another House of Commons you might
as well abolish the Senate outright, because I
do not think there is any merit in having two
competing elected bodies. I believe there is a
distinct advantage in our system of having an
appointed body which is less preoccupied
with electoral or political problems and, as
such, assist the other place. You may disagree
with this; you may wish the Senate to disappear because you do not accept the principle
of an appointed body, but as long as you
accept the proposition that an appointed body
can play the role I have just described, then I
think we should very well continue to look
forward to changes which would be beneficial
to the Canadian Parliament.
Senator Hayden has presented an interesting thesis on the effect of the 1949 amendment to section 91 of the B.N.A. Act. I must
say that I am a little surprised at this; I had
not heard this proposal before and I am not
sure that I have had sufficient time to digest
it sufficiently to pass judgment on it. I would
only say that I am a bit worried at the idea
that every time a money bill is initiated here
we are, in effect, amending the Constitution
without any warning to Parliament that we
were doing so. This is implicitly what is suggested by the honourable Senator Hayden.
Hon. Mr.
alternative.

Hayden:

I

presented

the

Hon. Mr. Flynn: But you say that every
time we initiate a money bill here it is constitutional for us to pass it, and if it is passed
by the other place then it is legal, because
Parliament would thereby have amended the
Constitution, as it is empowered to do under
Section 91. This was my understanding of the
whole of his thesis.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The other part of the
thesis was that if doing it by short division in
that fashion bothered you, you could do it by
long division, by saying, "Notwithstanding
the provisions of Section 53."
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Yes, of course, you could
say it, but I do not think this has ever been
used. Even if we were to use this phrase, I
am not prepared, at this time, to agree that
this is a good solution. I do not favour dealing with the Constitution as if it were any

other bill. I know that the B.N.A. Act is a
mere act of the Imperial Parliament, which,
to the extent of the 1949 amendment, has
been given to the jurisdiction of our Parliament, but I do not like to deal with our
Constitution, as suggested by the honourable
senator, as easily as dealing with any other of
our statutes.
In any event, there were other ways to deal
with money bills here than by invoking the
effect the 1949 amendment had to section 91.
This has been used in the House of Lords,
where on third reading of a bill they would
simply delete or put in brackets all the provisions having money implications, and forward
the bill, with the sections in brackets, to the
House of Commons where they would be
adopted, complementing the bill. The sections, after having been added in the other
place, would merely be returned here for
concurrence as amendments. Such concurrence
by the Senate would be a mere formality,
because the Senate would have taken cognizance of these sections before.
That is the device which has been used in
the House of Lords and accepted by the
House of Commons at Westminster, which is
acceptable. Whether we use that device or
whether we accept the thesis of Senator
Hayden, the situation is not entirely satisfactory and I do not see why we should not ask,
and repeatedly ask, for an amendment to section 53 in order to define as money bills only
those bills that I have mentioned before,
namely, bills imposing a tax, or actual appropriation bills, where the appropriation is not
merely incidental to the purposes of the bill,
so that we would be in a position to do what
we want to do, which is to share more in the
legislative process and be of greater help to
the other place. I suggest that, since the 1949
amendment this one would be very easy. This
would be an amendment to the Constitution
which Parliament would pass, knowing what
it is doing, rather than amending the Constitution every time it deems wise for reasons
only of, let us say, efficiency.
Again I am hesitant to accept the thesis of
Senator Hayden. We should not touch the
Constitution for reasons of efficiency only: we
should know exactly what we are doing. If
we really want the Senate to do more than at
present, I do not see why the other place
should not agree to a specific amendment to
article 53. We are not trying to take privileges away from the other place; we are really telling the other place we want to help
more, which is the role of the Senate. We do

SENATE DEBATES
not claim more authority than the other
place; we do not seek even equal authority,
but rather a different authority, a very specific role.
Therefore, I would not hide the purpose we
are trying to achieve. I would want the other
place to agree to an amendment to section 53
so that we could initiate bills here which may
have money provisions incidental to them. We
are better qualified to deal with certain bills
because they are technical and complex and
because they are less electoral or less political. We could consider them in the more calm
climate which prevails here.
In conclusion, I thank Senator Hayden for
having raised this question and, even if I am
not able at this time to share entirely his
conclusions, they are thought-provoking and
they are a very useful contribution in the
circumstances.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Sarto Fournier (De Lanaudière):
Honourable senators, a moment ago I rose to
make a remark and I was asked in a most
gentlemanly way if it were my intention to
make a speech. It was not my intention to
make a speech. We were discussing money
bills and I was listening to the very learned
remarks by the honourable Senator Hayden.
Having heard the remarks of the honourable
Leader of the Opposition, I finally found the
quotation in Bourinot which helps me to say
exactly what I wished to say a moment ago. I
was speaking then from memory, from what I
learned at university many years ago. I have
found the paragraph now, confirming what I
was sure of in my mind.
I should like to quote from Bourinot's Parliamentary Procedure and Practice, fourth
edition, edited by Thomas Barnard Flint,
page 493. Before I read it, I wish to say that
the Senate can initiate a money bill under
certain conditions. Now, in order to corroborate my opinion, I would like to read this
paragraph in Bourinot:
It is frequently found convenient to
introduce bills involving public expenditure in the Senate, and in such a case,
the money clauses are embodied in the
bill as presented, in order to make it
more intelligible. When the Senate goes
into Committee on the bill, these clauses
are ordered to be left out. They are
printed in red ink or italics in the engrossed bill sent up to the Commons, and
are technically supposed to be blanks.

November 26, 1968

These clauses are always considered in a
previous committee by the Commons, and
then regularly referred to the committee
of the whole on the bill. In the same way,
resolutions imposing a tax or duty must
be alone considered by the Commons, and
referred to the committee on a Senate
bill.
My only intention is to indicate to you that
here in the Senate we have the capacity, we
have the power and we are entitled to introduce a money bill, provided that the other
place agrees with us and that the bill has been
drafted first here in the Senate.
It was not my intention to make a speech
but merely to corroborate my most learned
colleague, the honourable Senator Hayden.
Hon. L. M. Gouin: Honourable senators, I
should like to congratulate honourable Senator Hayden and the honourable Leader of the
Opposition on their interesting contributions.
A few years ago we had a bill before us
which had, between brackets, as suggested
now by the honourable Leader of the Opposition in the case of the House of Lords, certain
money clauses. We did not pass them, of
course, but these clauses were necessary, as I
recall, for the understanding of the bill. After
the bill had been passed here, and then by
the House of Commons, it had to come back
again to us so that we could give our consent
to the measure as finally amended.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson, debate
adjourned.
POVERTY
APPOINTMENT

OF SPECIAL

COMMITTEE

The Senate resumed from Thursday,
November 21, the adjourned debate on the
motion of honourable Senator Croll that a
special committee of the Senate be appointed
to investigate and report upon all aspects of
poverty in Canada.
Hon. David A. Croll: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, may I remind the Senate that if the
honourable senator speaks now it will have
the effect of closing the debate.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Honourable senators, I was
very much intrigued by and interested in the
preceding debate. Since plans were being
made to initiate programs for spending
money, I already had ideas as to how that

November 26, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

money should be spent. I will try to tell you
about that this afternoon.
First, I want to thank all those who participated in the debate. They made very valuable contributions because they spoke from
their hearts. The debate indicated their concern just as their contributions came from
their depth or knowledge and experience,
based on their many points of view. As a
result, I think this country has become more
aware of what the Senate has been undertaking. In this instance the technique of repetition has worked out very well for this particular problem.
Indeed, there is evidence that there is some
feedback. Some of you may have noticed that
on November 5 there appeared on the Order
Paper of the other place a motion by Mr.
Leblanc of Laurier, reading:
That, in the opinion of this House, the
government should set up immediately,
jointly with the Senate, a special committee whose main terms of reference would
be to study, examine closely and analyse
the 6th chapter of the Fifth Annual
Report of the Economic Council of Canada dealing with the problem of poverty
in order to find adequate solutions to
remedy an urgent and deplorable situation.
That indicates to me that mail has been coming in to the members in the other place.
Inquiries are taking place and there is some
interest.
Generally, the speeches have been of high
calibre, blending humanitarian overtones
with a real desire to be helpful; to a large
extent they have indicated the various backgrounds of the speakers.
After the resolution went on the Order
Paper I had a discussion with the Leader of
the Senate in the same tones that the Leader
of the Opposition discussed the matter the
last time he spoke in the house. At this time
it is not clear just where we are going, so we
have to keep all avenues open. But one can
take guidelines from the discussion that has
taken place, and I have attempted to restrict
it within reason. On the other hand, there
will be 17 members on the committee; they
will all have views and we must let them
have some flexibility and some movement.
The speech made by the Leader of the Opposition refiects to a great extent my thinking,
and I am sure it will reflect the committee's
thinking.
29234-40

I used in this case the exact words that
came from the Fifth Annual Review in order
to indicate that we were not trying to take a
shortcut. We were not trying to enlarge. We
were concerned with the chapter dealing with
poverty in the report, and in taking a good
look at it. If there is anybody in this house
who thinks that the committee wil go out
and look for poverty customers, banish that
idea from your minds. We have them identified already. We know who they are. We do
not know who they are by name, but we
know whom to look for and what their problems are. I do not think we will have to go
much beyond the Economic Review.
We did have a very lengthy and useful
debate, and it was necessary. It was necessary because Canadians have a habit of closing their eyes and sometimes their minds to
that which they do not like. Very often
Canadians try to avoid facing the truth. I
sometimes think that Canadians are born
with self-serving blinkers. What they do not
want to see, they do not see. I will call your
attention to some things they should have
seen a long time ago. For that reason, the
truth had to be stated and had to be repeated
over and over again.
We have had no serious depression in
Canada for 20 years. It has been the longest
continuous upsurge in Canadian history. And
yet something is the matter in this country.
The Economic Council finally diagnosed it as
a "cancer" and called our attention to it.
Honourable senators, we must do more
effectively that which we originally commenced to do through our social measures.
We have to examine our social measures
in action. But this cannot be a long-term job.
We have to do it as quickly as we can. And
there is no hesitancy on my part to say that
our concept of social welfare needs revision.
It needs some rethinking. It was good in its
day. I am the last one in this house to have
anything but words of high praise for the
social measures that are on the books in this
country, but we have here a bewildering
array of agencies, programs and services, and
by the time the benefits trickle down, there
just does not seem to be enough and they are
almost totally inadequate.
The Economic Council spelled out the problem in its Fifth Annual Review. We need not
discuss poverty in a vacuum, therefore. There
is full confirmation in the report, and in addition there is the Report of the Canadian Welfare Council in October of this year. Those of
you who have been following the press know

SENATE DEBATES

that there is evidence of poverty before the
Royal Commission on the Status of Women. It
makes evident what poverty does to females,
who, as a group, are poorer than Canadian
men.
Su, it behooves us to make a meaningful
attack on poverty, and it is going to cost
money-a great deal of money. We should
look around at the same time to find avenues
where money can be saved. On another occasion I think I will be able to make a
contribution.
Many of us came of age during the depression, and many of us knew poverty first-hand.
Yet, now that we are in authority and have
responsibilities we find that solutions come
few and hard. Why can we not be rid of
poverty? Well, there are many reasons. One is
that we adopt sudden, make-do methods and
fail to exercise foresight, planning and determination to stay with it until such time as the
job is done. The affluent society does reduce
the problem, at least for those of us who are
able-bodied and have skills. But the aged, the
unskilled, the uneducated, the under-educated
and the handicapped are excluded even in an
affluent society. It is indeed a very real and
baffling problem.
The Economic Council report has been a
painful reminder to the people of Canada that
poverty has become a challenge to the established order. Moreover, we have in this
country problems of Indians, Eskimos and
Metis which should never have been a special
problem. If our national goal is a just society,
and it is, then serious poverty must be eradicated, for it is far too costly in every respect.
We will never make real progress until our
best minds set their sights on a solution. We
have now
precisely
and meaningfully
acknowledged the existence of the evils of
poverty.
There are in this country two societies. We
have the great majority of 16 million, who
are the beneficiaries of the economics of affluence. It is true we always claim we are
broke, but some of us are broke in a most
comfortable sort of way. These 16 million that
I speak of are trained, educated and hold
steady jobs. They have good health, they are
living in comfortable homes and are benefiting from every increase in the gross national
product. However, the five million minority
who are trapped in the economics of realistic
poverty, and the culture of poverty, are poorly trained, uneducated, under-educated, unable to find or hold a job, have low incomes

November 26, 1968

and frightfully bad housing. To those particularly, we who have had a rough time in our
youth have a special responsibility. We are
the generation that climbed the economic ladder and even the poor helped us in our
ascent. But they seem to be trapped in perpetual poverty, and it is our responsibility to
show them a way out of the trap. We have to
help them to bridge the gap.
When I began in politics, and that was
many years ago, I believed that if you had
economic growth and full employment in the
country, you had the game beat; you had it
made. Well, that is no longer true. We have
got to re-adjust our thinking on these economic formulae, because we have uneven distribution, substandard wages, urbanization
and other matters that perhaps we did not
know about.
I also believed at one time that if you had
enough public housing you had it made. That
is not true.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It is not what you have; it
is what you want.

Hon. Mr. Croll: The neighbours do not like
public housing; people who live in them do
not like the idea of council houses. It is
accepted in other parts of the world, but not
in our country. The people want to have an
interest in the bouse. They want to have a
piece in the play and they want to own part
of it. It is about time the Government came
to the conclusion that no matter what the
down-payment is, or if there is no down-payment, if you get people into the house who
will maintain it, look after it and pay the
rent, you are far ahead of the game.
One thing we will certainly have to consider is the establishment of a department of
housing with a full-time minister, and he will
have a full-time job to provide housing for
this country in the measure that we deserve.
I once thought that if you had a massive
social security program, you had the game
beat and you were on the right track. We
have such programs now but we find that
they are departmentalized, they are scattered
and overlapping. We know that they are not
bringing us the results that we thought we
would attain, despite the fact we are spending money. We are not cheap. I will give you
the figures on that in a little while.
You ask, "What is poverty?" There is little
use in my telling most of the members of this
house what is poverty. Poverty is a widow
with young children living on welfare; it is a
deserted wife with young children living on

November 26, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

welfare; it is the head of a household with a
young family who is crippled by accident,
automobile or otherwise. Poverty is a single
woman who stayed home with her parents
and is now alone and without skills; it is the
head of a household plagued with sickness,
prolonged ill health, physical and mental,
who cannot work full-time and does not get
much wages when he works part-time. Poverty is a man who is receiving substandard
wages, has a large family and is trapped in
his environment and location. Poverty is a
man who cannot hold a job because he is
uneducated or under-educated, works for four
months and is off for eight months. Poverty is
a state of mind to all of us who allow these
conditions to prevail. We are clearly a young
nation, one half under 25 years of age and
one third under 15.
Honourable senators, I have defined poverty, but the definition is not complete. It is a
relative term, and it varies from area to area
and from generation to generation. The
amount of income is not necessarily an accurate and adequate measure of poverty. Environment and the character of the individual
are some of the determining factors. The
solution is in the hands of Government, all
levels of Government; private enterprise has
a stake, but the main responsibility is that of
the federal Government with regard to leadership and funds, for this is a national problem. Moreover, these are man-made conditions to be put right by man.
In approaching our study I think we will
have to move into some specific areas. They
will be those of income, slums, Indians and
other disadvantaged groups, and welfare
measures.
Let me deal for a moment with some welfare measures. I said before that we have
welfare measures that compare favourably to
any in the western world, and I think they
are better than most. We have given leadership in many instances, but the measures
have been built up ad hoc, in bits and pieces;
no one has made an overall plan. We have to
examine these, not to do any witch hunting,
but to have a thorough investigation as to
their practicability in the light of present
experience. I think it will be good that we
should look at them, for in order to make any
progress at all we in this committee must
stand in the shoes of the poor. We cannot be
a party to turning the clock back.
We speak of some very important social
measures in Canada, such as the Canada
Assistance Act, which changed our whole
29234-401

concept of social approach, for we had been
burdened with a means test in this country
for generations, and we changed it to that of
a needs test, which is an entirely different
thing. On this basis of need, are we meeting
it? Some of the provinces are using the act
and some are not. We ought to know why
they are not. I do not think we will continue
to meet the needs of the people of this country if the federal Government contributes
only money. When we examine the matter of
hospitalization, will the standards be maintained if we withdraw and only contribute? I
doubt that very much.
Educational costs have been very heavy, but
can the ultimate benefits be measured in
present expenditures? When you think of the
sacrifices that families made in order to give
a child an education, what difference did it
make what it cost in the end? It was a delight
and pleasure to know that they had started
someone off in a way of life that was much
better than their own.
Speaking of "need," the act has now been
passed some time. Last week the United
States government decreed that need will
now be the basis upon which they will provide assistance. Applicants in their country
are made eligible on the basis of their own
statements, a provision we have with respect
to Old Age Security. This has been in effect
in the State of New York on a test basis for a
period of time and now applies to the whole
of the United States. The statistics indicate
that there was very little abuse in the State
of New York. The number of infractions was
about the same on the basis of need as it was
when they investigated everything they were
told by applicants before giving them assistance. They made the very vital point that
the new system we have introduced here, and
that they have now introduced, would free
social workers to provide effective social services. They estimated that the average welfare worker was spending 70 per cent of his
time investigating the eligibility of relief recipients. They felt that was a waste of time,
and that to take a statement of need, as we
do now under the Canada Assistance Act, was
by far the better thing to do.
I said a few moments ago that we were not
pinching pennies on social measures in this
country. I must thank Senator Carter for
bringing these very interesting figures to my
attention. The social welfare expenditures for
1967 at all three levels of government in
Canada totalled $5,956 million-about $6 billion. That is an increase over the year before.

SENATE DEBATES
The federal Government has a budget of
$10 billion-odd-the provinces have a budget
of $8 billion-odd; and the municipalities about
$4 billion-for a total of $22 billion. Of this
amount, $6 billion was spent on social welfare-10 per cent of the Gross National Product, 22 per cent of the tax dollar. I am not
suggesting for a moment that is a penny too
much or that it is even enough. That is my
attitude. What I am saying to this country
and to this house is: Are we receiving value
for our money? That is all. Is it doing what
we think it ought to or can do? Should we not
take another look at it and see if we cannot
make it work so that we are not faced with a
minority of five million people living in a
state of poverty?
One of the most helpful approaches to the
problem of poverty, of course, is education. I
think we owe it to ourselves to have a generalized review of the interaction of poverty
and educational levels in Canada, an examination of the educational level in different
regions, an analysis of the effects of the educational system on the economic well-being of
the community. Naturally the study would
involve a special study of minority groups,
such as Indians and Eskimos. It will attempt
to describe the mechanics whereby low educational levels and poverty are self-reinforcing. We are committed to massive education
in this country. It is in the hands of the
provinces, and the results are not yet fully
foreseeable. We must wait for some time
before we can see the full effect, but I think
it is well to know that the placing and training of applicants who need assistance seems
to be working pretty well. There are some
imaginative programs.
One of the very important things we have
to consider in this committee is the guaranteed income, or what is sometimes called a
negative income tax. I remind the Senate that
this is no novel idea that originates here. The
Economic Council discussed this and said.
"Take a good look at it", and added:
An official minimum income level would
be established for family heads and nonfamily individuals.
All would be required to complete an income
tax return. When income fell below the
official level, a negative tax payment by the
Government would make up the difference.
This is exactly the system that has met
with so much acceptance by the recipients of
Old Age Security, which has been in effect
for a few years.

November 26, 1968

Those of us who have been in politics for
some years-and most of us have-remember
that there was a constant appeal to us from
the recipients of Old Age Security. They were
everlastingly complaining. I am not suggesting that they are all now completely satisfied,
but this has proven to be the most satisfactory approach ever taken to the problem. Let
me give you some statistics. On September 25
of this year a question was asked in the other
place, as reported at page 453 of House of
Commons Debates:
How many persons in Canada, by
provinces, are in receipt of the Old Age
Security pension?
The answer gives the total as 1,376,600. I will
not give the number in each province because
I do not think that is important. The next
question was:
Of the recipients of the Old Age Security pension, how many persons in Canada, by provinces, are in receipt of the
Guaranteed Income Supplement?
The answer given is 735,965. Honourable
senators will recall the first figure I gave.
A third question was asked:
Of those receiving the Guaranteed
Income Supplement, how many persons
in Canada, by provinces, are receiving
the full amount?
The answer given is 455,617, leaving 280,000
receiving a partial amount.
The fourth question was:
What is the average amount, in Canada
and by provinces, being received as a
Guaranteed Income Supplement by recipients of the Old Age Security pension?
The average given is $26.77. Of course, it is
more in some provinces than it is in others.
Well, it has done a remarkably good job,
and it seems to me that there is a door of opportunity before this committee to act rather
quickly on some things.
I would like to hear an argument from
anyone who has an argument as to why a
blind person, or a disabled person, or a widow, or an unemployable person should be
subjected to two governments, federal and
provincial, before he or she draws his pension
or whatever he or she is entitled to, rather
than from one government in the same way
as people who are receiving Old Age Security. There will be savings. These people are in
the mainstream of life, but they are not in
the mainstream of the economic life of this

November 26. 1968

SNT DEBATES
SENATE EAE

country, and they have got to be provided
for. There is no purpose in dealing with thema
in the way we have been dealing with them.
In any event, what we have done sa far for
Old Age Security recipients has worked remarkably well.
Some people may think this is a view that
is flot commonly shared. I should like to
read from an editorial headed "A Little Outdated," which appeared i the Globe and
Mail of November 12.
Almost certainly Ottawa will eventually
decide that some kind of negative income
tax is necessary, to put an income floor
under ail Canadians. This would not only
alter the income tax structure, but put
into a single bag a multitude of welfare
programs which Ottawa now shares
with the provinces and even, in some
cases, which the provinces share with the
municipalities.
This is not a socialist paper, as I recall from
having read it for ever so long.
Welfare groups, church groups, government
administrators, and businessmen have not
only been studylng the problem, but have
given it limited approval. It is not pie in the
sky with ice cream.
Is it a solution? I do not know. If the
guaranteed income resuits in a vast population of permanently subsidized unemployed,
then who wants it? The paramount need is
for increased job opportunities at fair living
wages, and a maintenance of the family
structure. It is not coddiing that we are looking for, but many taking their place in a
productive commuunity. What we want ta
know is whether the Guaranteed Incarne will
be a crutch on which people will lean, or
whether it wiil be an incentîve ta go out and
eamn more on their own, if more of their
earnmngs are exempted so that they may
benefit from, whatever earnings were brought
into the household.
I know that we wiil again hear the cry:
"You are going to, have bums and loafers
receiving help, and now you are talking about
creating superbums." Weil, it is just not so.
1 have told you something of what the
recent statistîcs in the United States indicate.
The statistics I have been able ta obtain with
respect ta this country are almost identical
with those of the United States. About one
per cent of the people who are receiving
assistance beat the game, but that is below
par for the course ini respect of other elements ini the community.

The philosophy of aur social measures is to
meet the need, and it is best expressed i the
Canada Assistance Act, where need is the
test. Although it is adrninistered inadequately
in many parts of the country, it is the law of
the land. The aid Elizabethan philosophy of
"those who don't work, don't eat" went out
the window a long time ago. It came out of a
poor society, and is no longer tolerable.
Today we meet the need through many agencies, and endiess ordeals. Yet, the cycle of
dependency is perpetuated by outworn social
programs. I think that a guaranteed annual
income would avoid the scattering of welfare
services and could be far less costly.
We can provide a decent system of living
for ail Canadian citizens in a physical and
materiai sense. I hope that the committee wiil
examine, research, and establish a pilot project for a few thousand persans across the
country, after consulting with welfare agencies, universities, and government departments, and establish different combinationsperhaps as many as a haif dozen-for the
purpose of studying thern over a period of
time. The Americans have undertaken such a
project. We can examine it and benefit from
it.
There came ta my desk this morning-and
very tiniely it was-a document entitled "Social Security. Prospect for Reform." It cornes
from the Bookings Institute, which ail of us
are knowiedgeable about. It is an independent
organization devoted ta non-partisan research, education, publication, economnics,
government foreign policy and social sciences
generally. Its principal purposes are ta aid in
the development of sound public policies and
ta provake public undertakings and issues of
national importance. The Chairman is Douglas Dillon, who you wiil remember was connected with the Eisenhawer administration.
Mr. McNamara is also a member. This book
was published in September of this year. In
dealmng with social security they recommend
the guaranteed incarne. These are people in
high positions wha have an understanding of
what is going on i the country.
I point out ta honourable senators that
there is no timne ta lose. A great struggle is
beginning between those who have been
accustomed ta contralling the structures of
power and reaping ecanomic benefits from, A
and the younger elements in aur saciety who
have decided not; ta link themselves with the
so-called Establishmient.

SENATE DEBATES
say about the students that they do not know
what they are talking about or what they
want. They are talking about building a new
world tomorrow, and if they join forces with
the disadvantaged, the poor, the Indians, they
will really have a cause. We, who can have a
second sober thought and time to reflect, can
do something about it before it gets out of
hand by responding to the unending pressure
for change, making a meaningful beginning
for the disadvantaged, and that will be neither easy nor cheap. The time has come in
our country to decide on priorities. We have
faith in our system, so the Government must
make it work in order to make it truly a just
society.
The slums in this country are all about us.
You do not have to go to the poorer parts of
Canada to see them. Take a subway ride in
Toronto or Montreal and you can see them at
first hand. We must study the possibility of
pilot slum projects. That we are plagued with
slums can no longer be denied. The poor cannot pay to destroy them or eradicate them,
yet we all agree it must be done. Who else
but us? We ought to be able to recommend to
the Government the undertaking of a few
pilot slum projects of manageable proportions, to demolish them and build new housing, to make sure that they do not again
become slums-this which will take a little
doing-and in the course of the pilot project
to repair, rebuild and renovate housing units.
Every time we spend a dollar to eradicate a
slum we grow richer, and we must approach
this with a realistic sense of vision and be
prepared to spend a considerable sum of
money as an investment. In the end, the
money we spend on slum dwellers and what
it is costing us in money and many other
ways would far more than compensate for the
capital expenditure.
If we are wise we will look at the violent
society of the United States and profit accordingly. Canada is not immune from the forces
of hate, disunity and despair that prevail
across much of our neighbour's land. We have
to face up to the grim and hideous fact that one
out of every five Canadians lives in poverty.
We have to awaken to the realization that
injustice breeds disease and eats away at the
national fabric. We do not have a large negro
population in Canada, but we have Indians
who feel that they are the "negroes" of this
country. We have slums hidden away in our
pockets of poverty. Unless we are able to
create a climate of economic justice in Canada we are heading for trouble.

November 26, 1968

Who would have thought only a few years
ago that the United States could be torn by
what amounts to civil strife? If our giant
neighbour is gripped by an internal crisis of
great magnitude, have we any reason to
believe that we are immune from the contagion? Have we ever been immune from what
has been happening in the United States?
This is an age in which yesterday's impossibility becomes today's probability, an age in
which technological genius points the way to
a dazzling future. To say that there is no cure
for slums, no solution to the plight of Canadians subsisting on the crumbs they are able to
get, is a denial of our own humanity. Governments, social scientists and business leaders
must pool their resources in an all out frontal
attack on these cancers.
No matter what we do, we are not going to
achieve Utopia, but it is possible for us to
better the lot of the unfortunates in our
society, to tear down rat-infested slums and
replace them with decent housing, to effect
a break-through that allows men, women and
children to snap the chains that bind them.
The policy in this country is not entirely
set by the minister when he says that we
must build 200,000 new houses each year. Of
course we must have new housing units, but
it must also be our objective to demolish each
year 1,000 slum dwellings and rebuild new
housing, to renovate and rebuild at least 500
old dwellings that are capable of being used.
As I said, we need a Department of Housing
in this country very badly, and I hope the
committee will see it that way.
Here is another problem. We have not paid
too much attention to it, and I am as much
responsible as others for that. It is the problem of the Indians, the Eskimos and the
Metis. This relates particularly to the Indians,
220,000 of them.
We have to make a new approach. Nothing
that we have done in the past seems to have
met with the approval of the Indians. They
continue to inhabit a separate solitude. I
think the time has come for us to consider the
creation of municipalities out of some Indian
reserves, for Indians and by Indians, to create municipalities on a pilot basis, with all
the powers of municipalities under the law, to
be a municipality like any other municipality.
We should consider the need to create a
Crown corporation to pay the cost-and it
would still be cheaper than keeping them all
on relief; it would leave room for private
enterprise and welcome red capital if it is
available.

November 26, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

The various government agencies could do
their best to bring industry to the municipalities and create a viable municipality. This
should give the Indians an opportunity at
self-government, self-assessment, and more
knowledge of the way of the urbanized world.
A pilot municipal project will cost some
money, but nothing is to be gained by continuing our misunderstanding with the Indians and other people. None of us should be
asked to make a choice as to whether we are
for the Indians or against them. We have
been against them long enough: this time it
would be better not to put us in that position
where we have to make a choice. This time
we would choose the Indians.
For far too long we have given lip service
to the problems besetting our Indian population. It has been always a few kind words for
the Indians and a few more million dollars
for defence. We had better look on some of
these matters more realistically. We talk and
talk endlessly, but words alone do not wipe
out the shame of what we have done since
first this land was colonized. The intelligence,
energy and dedication that we are able to
bring to bear in solving a multitude of problems are qualities which are strangely lacking in our approach to the plight of the
Indians.
There has to be a new approach and new
thinking. We have got nowhere with a policy
which tells the Indian what we think is best
for him. Instead, we must invite the Indian to
ask for the kind of assistance which he wants
in order that he may help himself towards a
better life. Of course, this will need money
and a genuine desire to make a breakthrough.
If we fail to come to grips once and for all
with this national disgrace, then the words
"just society" become a mockery and a sham.
If we are to achieve a "just society" it must
be a just society for all-white, black, brown
or red.
Honourable senators, I do not know how
you felt, but I remember when Governor
George Wallace-who was a candidate for the
presidency of the United States-came to
speak at ''ronto Maple Leaf Gardens under
the auspices of one of the service clubs. The
hall was full and the hecklers were giving
him a rough time. I was not there, but I read
of this in the press. They were heckling him
on his stand on segregation, when he turned
on them and told them a few things about
Indians in Canada, and that was the end of
the heckling.

Honourable senators will remember that
recently we sent some people over to Nigeria,
who complained about what the Nigerians
were doing to the Biafrans. The head of the
Nigerian forces said "What about your Indians? Would you like me to tell you something
about them?"
Honourable senators, have you ever met
some of the Members of Parliament who
come from Caribbean countries? If you sit
around and talk to them, you find they are
nice, pleasant people. Finally it comes from
them: "You do have an Indian problem in
your country, do you not?" They bring it up
and start to talk about it, and you realize that
there is something in what they have been
hearing.
Honourable senators, I think I have said
about all that should be said at the moment
in order to ask you to support this motion.
This would be a strong, representative committee, whose members will be easily available and will have an especial interest in the
problem of poverty. It will not be easy to get
staff. The kind of people we want are in great
demand and are not easily available. We have
bespoken some facilities which are available
in quarters now filled by the Divorce Committee, which they would give us at the end
of the year.
In closing, I say to this house that the
responsibility will be a heavy one. We have
never undertaken a study in this house which
has not been constructive. We have always
come up with something of use and value for
the Canadian people. The public will expect
us to produce some tangible results and we
must satisfy them, as well as ourselves. I
hope all honourable senators will support the
motion.
Motion agreed to.

INVESTMENT COMPANIES BILL
SECOND READING-DEBATE

CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday,
November 21, the adjourned debate on the
motion of honourable Senator Desruisseaux
for the second reading of Bill S-17, respecting
Investment Companies.

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. Lazarus Phillips: Honourable senators,
may I first congratulate Senator Desruisseaux for the able manner in which he has
presented for our consideration Bill S-17, an
act respecting Investment Companies. Knowing him as we do, his presentation and his
clarity of expression was expected from him.
The analysis of the basic principles of this
bill has led me to the conclusion that some of
its provisions are highly commendable, but
that others certainly will require very careful
and detailed study.
I hope, honourable senators, that those who
take part in this debate will support me in
expressing the view that when this bill is
referred to the appropriate standing committee, the varlous clauses of the bill will receive
even more than the usual detailed analysis,
and that the honourable senators and the
committee at large will have the advantage of
obtaining both the views of those in authority
who are sponsoring this bill and those of all
interested parties and institutions who will be
concerned with the administration of the bill
when it becomes an act of Parliament.
At the very outset it is clear that those
responsible for the drafting of the bill have
been motivated by a high sense of public
duty and by a desire to protect investors,
whether lenders or equity holders in the
stock, or evidences of indebtedness of companies that are engaged or that will be engaged
in the business of investment. To the extent
that this bill proposes to protect such investors, those in authority are entitled to congratulation and support.
It is further to be noted that the administration of the proposed act will come effectively under the direction of the Superintendent of Insurance. The incumbent of this
important office is a man of superlative
competence and one who enjoys the confidence of the public. A distinction, honourable
senators, must be drawn between the quality
of the person and the broad authority that
will be vested in him, because this authority
in turn will with the passage of time pass to
others.
In making in due course some criticisms of
certain aspects of this bill, I shall necessarily
be exposed to the criticism that I am in
favour of sin and against virtue. Obviously,
legislation is necessary on the federal level in
an effort to avoid the repetition of dishonest
practices and offences by certain people who
have been operating companies engaged in
the business of investment and who have
been responsible for causing serious loss to

November 26, 1968

innocent lenders and investors. It must,
however, be kept in mind that the overwhelming majority of Canadians actively
engaged in this type of business are honest
and law-abiding citizens. In the effort to
supervise and to reach and to punish a recalcitrant and troublesome minority, we must
not, in my opinion, vest broad powers in any
agency of Government which might tend to
interfere with the normal day to day business
activities of companies engaged in the business of investment.
The essence, honourable senators, of a
healthy economic climate requires a necessary
suppleness, flexibility and sensitivity to changing financial commercial situations which will
enable those engaged in these pursuits to
adjust themselves to the requirements of the
day. It therefore becomes a problem of no
small importance to balance out a philosophy
of approach which will punish offenders
while at the same time not interfere unduly
with the normal activities of the market
place.
It should be pointed out at the outset that
in section 2 of the act it is provided that the:
"business of investment" with respect
to a company means the borrowing of
money by the company on the security of
its bonds, debentures, notes or other evidence of indebtedness, and the use of
some or all of the assets of the company
for .. .

the purposes indicated in this section.
In practice, any significant borrowing of
this nature, as defined by section 2, at least
where the public at large is concerned, is
evidenced by a trust deed which provides,
among other matters, for the determination of
the circumstances under which a borrowing
company is in default, and for the protection
of lenders. It also deals with the subject matter of the nature of the assets and liabilities
of the company and the relationship of the
one to the other. Honourable senators, you
will see in a few moments why at this time I
specifically make this observation.
I might also add parenthetically that the
definitions of section 2, and particularly subsection 1, paragraph (b) thereof, in my opinion, lack the clarity required for an act of
this nature, and will require considerable
amendment in order to precise exactly what
businesses and endeavours are to be covered.
If the phrase in section 2(l)(b) "on the
security of" is equivalent to "by the issue of",
then subsection (1) (b) and (f) would include

flot only finance and acceptance cornpanies, in
the usual sense, but also ail holding companies such as private, personal or family cernpanies, and any industrial or commercial
company which has ever borrowed funds and
which has invested 25 per cent cf its assets in
other corporations, even if such corporations
are wholly-owned subsidiaries.
I also think that a precise distinction rnust
be made between those investrnent companies
that deal with the public at large and those
that are privately owned and deal only with
banks and other financial institutions.
As was pointed out by my good frîend
Senator Desruisseaux, the sponsor of the bll,
the act is divided under three headings, as
follows: Part I, Supervision of Investment
Companies; Part II, Certificates of Registry;
Part III, General-and cover, in the main, the
subject matter of assessrnents and regulations
and notices to be given pursuant te the statute by the Governor in Council.
For the convenience of honourable senators
I have decided te express at the outset rny
tentative conclusions with respect te this bill,
and 1 shail then atternpt te give reasons in
support of such conclusions.
I arn wholly in f avour of Part I of this bill,
at least te the extent that it provides for the
supervision of investment companies. I cernrnend those in authority for the draftsrnanship of this part, which refiects careful
thinking.
For the present, and subi ect te being convinced in committee, I amn against the
philisophy refiected in Part II of this bull,
dealing with certificates of registry, but there
are certain sections thereof which I believe te
be of value, and which, after appropriate
amendments, should be retained.
I entertain serious and grave doubts as te
the desirabîlity and efficacy of certain of the
sections in Part III marked "General".
Honourable senators, I shaîl now deal seriatim. with the varieus headings.
Part I of this bil as introduced, in rny
humble opinion, proposes effective procedures
for the supervision and inspection of companies engaged in the business cf investment.
Such supervisory authority te inspeet the
activities of such cempanies, te send officers
ini to examine the books, and te keep, presumably, in close contact with such companies se as te see that they are in a general way
properly run, is te be cernmended, provided
this part is limited te companies which in one

way or another deal with elernents of the
public which need protection.
I particularly congratulate those in authority on section 8 in Part 1, which deals with the
subject matter of prohibited loans and investments. I have not been able to deteet any
situation in which a dishonest person will not
be reached by the terrns of this section. The
necessity of filing annual statements with the
Superintendent of Insurance two months after
the close of each fiscal year, such statements
being verified by oath of two persons being,
respectively, a director and officer ef the
company, is bound to produce salutory resuits.
The power of inspection and the penalties
provided for obstruction of such inspection is,
te my mmnd, extremely desirable. I have
already covered the subject mater of prohibited loans and investrnents.
Honourable senators, it is when I corne to
Part II of the bil, deaing with certificates of
registry, that I arn somewhat disturbed.
Broadly speaking, Part II provides for the
issuance of certificates of registry to those
companies which are engaged in the business
of investmnent and which fail withmn the category of companies covered by this legisiation.
The idea behind the issuance of certificates of
registry by the Superintendent of Insurance,
as I read it, is to pin, as it were, upon a
cornpany the badge of respectability, but in
order to protect the superintendent; he is
given the authority to revoke such certificate
for a period of trne, to re-grant it with or
without conditions, and generaily speaking,
because he is responsîble for the badge of
respectability se bestowed, he is in corisequence given the authority to interfere seriously and effectively in the admninistration of
the affairs of such companies that corne under
his jurisdiction.
A careful reading of the powers se given
wiII indicate that the authority of the board
of directors, of the officers and of the shareholders of a company, if they corne within the
category, are subordinated in some instances
to that of the superintendent. I very much
doubt whether Bull S-17, if passed in its pres..
ent form., could have the legal and consequential resuit of superseding the corporate activities of cornpanies as provided for by the
Canada Corporations Act.
May I, honourable senators, give you two
examples of the proposed powers to be conferred on the rninister in charge, and through
him of course on the Superintendent of Insurance. I quote section 10, subsection 2 of Part
II ef the act, which reads in part as fellows:

of the Act, should proceed to exercise the
powers that are granted to him under Section
17 of Part II of the act dealing with the
winding up of investment companies, whether
under the Bankruptcy Act or under the
Winding-Up Act, as the case may be. I well
realize that the purpose of the present legislation is to provide for fiexibility to give companies engaged in the investment business the
opportunity to improve their position if they
strike a difficult period. I should think that in
this case the matter should be left in the
hands of companies themselves and the creditors and shareholders whose interests are at
stake. The right of the minister and the superintendent should be invoked only in cases
where, because of special knowledge resulting
from the right of inspection, the minister and
the superintendent are of the view that there
is dishonesty and fraudulent administration.
In such event, the company should either be
required to correct its administration or be
wound up.

The issuance of Certificates of Registry
will, moreover, put Government, the minister
and the Superintendent of Insurance from
time to time in the position where a company
is enveloped in a cloak of respectability
which, on occasion, it may not be entitled to
have. Put differently, in the effort to reach
the dishonest malefactor we may be unduly
interfering with the normal and legal activity
of those companies engaged in the investment
business.
In any event, honourable senators, if my
reactions on this review are not justified, I do
not think I have done any harm in drawing
attention to this section of the bill, and I
again ask that the matter be carefully considered in committee. It is my view that, generally speaking, Part II should not be included
in the bill, but that there should be retained
only the pertinent sections which deal with
the granting of the original certificates of
registry in the first place and the right of the
minister to cause the winding up of companies under circumstances provided for in the
section to which I have already referred.
I now corne to Part III of the bill, which is
headed "General".
Under section 21, subsection 1, the superintendent is given the power to ascertain and
certify the total amount of the expenditures
for or in connection with the administration
of this Act during the immediately preceding
fiscal year, and the amount of the expenditures so ascertained and certified is final and
conclusive for al purposes of this section.

The superintendent is further given the authority to determine the income of investment
companies. Such income is not necessarily
that reflected in the returns of the company
under the proposed Act, or under any other
act, but may be determined by the superintendent from annual statements and any
other information available to him. The superintendent is then to prepare an assessment
against such investment company, the income
of which was so certified in the amount that
bears the same ratio to its income as so certified, as the amount of the expenditures
incurred and so certified bears to the aggregate of the incomes of all investment companies, the incomes of which were so certified,
and such assessment, when certified by the
superintendent, is binding on the company
against which it is made and is final and
conclusive for all purposes of this section.
Subsection 4 of section 21 provides that an
amount assessed against an investment company, pursuant to subsections 3 and 5 of section 21, constitutes a debt due to Her Majesty
payable upon the demand of the superintendent and recoverable, as such, in the Exchequer Court or in any other court of competent
jurisdiction.
I must confess, honourable senators, that
this section 21 somewhat unnerved me. Here
is an authority given providing for finality as
to an amount owing by a company without
right of appeal. It is utterly impossible for
any company coming under this section to
anticipate the nature of its liability. It is not
clear whether the assessment proposed is an
expense against operations and deductible
from its taxable income or whether it is a
capital sum payable and appropriated out of
surplus, if the company has any. I entertain,
moreover, considerable doubt as to the
desirability of taxing a particular group of
companies for the administration of any particular act, even though that act applies only
to that particular segment of the economy. On
the assumption that this questionable principle might be accepted by honourable senators, surely some provision should be made for
the right of a taxpayer to state his case in a
court of law if this right should refer to the
computation of the expenditures incurred in
the administration of the act, to the determination of profits of the company assessed and,
in any event, there should be clarification as
already stated, as to whether the assessment
is to be in the nature of a tax or an expense.
I now corne to section 22 of the Act, Part
III, which reads as follows:

November 26, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

It will be noted that Part II is to come into
force on a day not sooner than two years
after the coming into force of Parts I and III,
to be fixed by proclamation. There is here, I
think, a manifestation of instinctive caution
on the part of the sponsors of this bill, realizing, as they no doubt do, that Part II may be
covering too much ground. It is for this reason I suggest that we pass a compact bill
which will reach the immediate objective of
suppressing or attempting to suppress the dishonest and fraudulent activities that have
come to light. This can be done by the
retention of Part I of the bill, some sections
of Part II and some sections of Part III, all,
however, to be accompanied by appropriate
amendments. After such compact bill is
passed supplementary legislation could, if
necessary, be introduced in due course, but
such supplementary legislation will then be
based upon the benefit of experience.
I am reminded of a story about Talleyrand,
the famous French statesman. When acting as
foreign minister he would give instructions to
those whom he had designated as ambassadors to represent France in other countries.
After listing their duties, he would end by
saying-"Monsieurs, pour protéger nos intérêts-Jamais trop de zèle!"-"Gentlemen, in
order to protect our interests, please not too
much zeal!"
I close by again stating that I make these
observations, and some criticisms, with diffidence, because I appreciate that this bill has
been presented to this chamber in the hope
that dishonest and fraudulent people may be
caught in the net of public authority. I am al
in favour of this attitude and of this desire. I
should like to retain all these factors involving inspection and control and necessary
sanctions reaching the offender, but I should
like to eliminate all those sections which may
create confusion and which may interfere
with the normal business processes of the
market place.
I assume, honourable senators, that when
this bill reaches the committee, consideration
will be given to existing provincial legislation
where applicable, in order to see whether
such legislation runs parallel to the provisions
of this bill.
In conclusion, I assume that in committee
stage, due consideration will be given to the
requirements of the exchanges in respect of
listed securities and to the regulations of prowherever
commissions

applicable.

Hon. Mr. Molson: Would my honourable
friend permit a question?
I would like to ask Senator Phillips if he is
happy with the definition of "investment company" as contained in the bill, which refers
back to "the business of investment." It
would seem to me there is possibly some confilct between what is generally known as a
finance company and an investment company.
Would he care to express any opinion on
that?
Hon. Mr. Phillips (Rigaud): Well, I have
already covered the point that I regarded section 2 as too broad in its terminology. I do
not think you were here, Senator Molson,
when I referred to it and suggested that the
investment companies to be covered by this
bill should be only those that come to the
public for funds and who have borrowed
money on the security of their assets and
have used more than 25 per cent of such
assets for the purpose of buying equity
stocks, or evidence of indebtedness in other
companies. And I have indicated that the section, as presently drafted, could apply to
industrial and commercial corporations who
may find themselves now in the position that
25 per cent of their assets are set aside for
investment purposes. These industrial and
commercial companies should not come under
this bill. If the definition were modified in the
manner I have indicated, then I think we
would be dealing with investment companies
that are using funds for investment in other
companies, and these might then popularly be
categorized as finance companies properly
coming under this act.
Hon. Mr. Molson: Thank you.
Hon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson: Honourable
senators, I propose to move the adjournment
of this debate, but before doing so I would
like to make one or two brief remarks.
My attitude to this bill is very similar to
that of Senator Phillips. On the other hand, I
am quite certain that we in the Senate, and in
committee, can do a splendid job on this bill
because basically it is necessary legislation.
However, I was a bit disturbed by some of
the final words of the sponsor of the bill the
other day, when he said:
This bill, honourable senators, is of
some urgency. It had been intended to
present it at the last session.
Honourable senators, to my mind this bill
is of enormous importance, and I think it is
of greater importance than many of us re-

SENATE DEBATES
alized. For instance, the bill has to be adjusted to all the securities acts of the provinces and, unless a very fine adjustment is
made, in many ways there will be no end of
difficulty and trouble in the investment field
in Canada.
I heartily agree with practically every criticism that bas been made by Senator Phillips,
but I do say that this bill must be seriously
considered not only in Committee but it
should also be debated at length, if necessary,
in this chamber.
Senator Phillips made the remark a
moment ago that he did not think this matter
should be approached with too much zeal. I
make this remark, that while cooking a dinner, let us not burn down the house.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson, debate
adjourned.
PRIVATE BILL
CANADIAN

ORDER OF FORESTERS-SECOND
READING

Hon. T. D'Arcy Leonard moved the second
reading of Bill S-18, respecting Canadian
Order of Foresters.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill follows a precedent which has been set by the
Senate in dealing with two bills affecting provincially incorporated life insurance companies. One was The Excelsior Life Insurance
Company and the other was The Empire Life
Insurance Company. Both of those companies
were incorporated originally under the laws
of the Province of Ontario. They desired to
give up their provincial status and acquire
federal status, and to do this it was necessary
to obtain legislation both in the Province of
Ontario and the Parliament of Canada. The
Senate dealt with those two companies and
has passed bills continuing them as federal
companies, and the Province of Ontario has
passed the enabling legislation respecting
these two companies.
The only difference which I think I should
call to your attention is that those two companies were share capital companies. In this
case we are dealing with a fraternal benefit
society. That makes no difference in law or
in principle and, if anything, probably makes
it a little easier from a practical standpoint
to have the legislation passed through the
Parliament of Canada.
The Canadian Order of Foresters, incorporated under the laws of the Province of
Ontario in 1879, is almost 90 years old. It is a

November 26, 1968

non-profit Canadian society, as I have mentioned, of the fraternal benefit type. It is a
purely Canadian society. It has its head office
in Brantford, Ontario, and it has subordinate
courts in every province of Canada. At the
present time there are more than 300 subordinate courts of this society, and its total membership is about 40,000.
As its membership and operations are
Canada-wide, the society wishes to come
under the jurisdiction of the Parliament of
Canada. This can be done by incorporating a
new society and selling the assets of the
existing provincial society to the new federal
society, but this would involve a great deal of
administrative work and expense in transferring thousands of mortgages and policies
from one society to the other, and in dealing
with the investments of the society. Accordingly, the society decided to follow the precedent I have mentioned set by the Empire Life
Insurance Company and the Excelsior Life
Insurance Company, and apply for enabling
legislation which, in effect, continues the provincially-incorporated society as a federallyincorporated society.
The wording of clause 1 of the bill is:
The Society is hereby continued as a
body corporate, under the name of
Canadian Foresters Life Insurance Society, and, in French, Forestiers Canadiens,
Société d'Assurance-Vie, and shall be
deemed to be a society incorporated by
Special Act of the Parliament of Canada.
Clause 2 invests the society with all the
powers, privileges, and immunities, and
makes it subject to all the liabilities and
provisions set forth in the Canadian and British Insurance Companies Act respecting fraternal benefit societies.
Clause 3 continues the directors in office
until the next ensuing election.
Clause 4 continues the head office in Brantford, Ontario.
Clause 5 prescribes the kinds of insurance
the company may deal in. They are life insurance, personal accident insurance, and sickness insurance. These are the usual classes
of insurance for fraternal benefit societies.
Clause 6 continues the regulation of the
company under the provisions of the constitution of the society.
Clause 7 is a clause that we are always
quick to make sure is present. It reads:
All rights and interests of the members, policy-holders and creditors of the

November 26, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Society in, to or against the property,
rights and assets of the Society and all
liens upon the property, rights and assets
of the Society are unimpaired by this
Act.
Clause 8 makes the Canadian and British
Insurance Companies Act applicable to the
society as if the society had been incorporated
by special act of the Parliament of Canada.
This society has been registered under the
federal act, as well as carrying on business as
a provincial corporation. The provincial
Legislature has passed an act authorizing it to
apply to the Parliament of Canada for legislation to enable it to continue as a federally
incorporated company, and that act provides
that the provincial status will cease as and
when this bill is passed and a certificate to
that effect is sent to the Provincial Secretary.
That provincial act was passed on April 11,
1968.
The Superintendent of Insurance, who is
aware of this application, has expressed to
me that it is in order. Of course, I intend to
move that the bill be referred to the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce if it
receives approval in principle on second reading, and the Superintendent of Insurance and
the officers of this society will be present in
order to answer any questions with respect to
its operations.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Honourable senators,
may I ask the honourable Senator Leonard a
question? Have the members and policyholders of the society, as it now exists, been
consulted about the intention to change the
name and status of the society?
Hon. Mr. Leonard: I think in the case of a
society such as this there is an identity of
interest between the members and the policyholders, so the question really relates, I take
it, to the members of the society.

Hon. Mr. Grosart: I wonder if the honourable sponsor of the bill would advise the
officers of the corporation that that question
might be asked. I have no objection to this,
but it is quite possible that somebody might
object when he understands that the traditions of the society are being changed.
I have spoken to this broad principle before
when bills of this sort have been presented to
us. The Senate should be informed as to the
steps that have been taken in order to ascertain the attitude and, if necessary, the sanction of, in this case, the members and policyholders, and the shareholders and others who
may have an interest.
Hon. Mr. Leonard: I think Senator Grosart's
point is well made. I can only repeat what I
said before, that the Ontario Legislature has
passed an act with respect to the change of
name, but that question can be very definitely
answered by the officers of the society in the
committee.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

RULES OF THE SENATE
FOURTH REPORT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE
PRESENTED

Hon. Hariland de M. Molson: Honourable
senators, I have the honour to present the
fourth report of the Special Committee on the
Rules of the Senate.
The Clerk Assistani: The Special Committee on the Rules of the Senate makes its
fourth report as followsHon. Senators: Dispense.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this report be taken into
consideration?
Hon. Mr. Molson moved that the report be
taken into consideration on Tuesday, December 10.
He said: Honourable senators, in submitting this fourth and I hope final report, it is
felt that some explanation as to its form and
contents may be desired. I would therefore
ask leave of the Senate to make a few
remarks in this connection.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Molson: As I stated a short time
ago in this chamber, your committee was
aware that the task allotted to it was to
recommend changes which would streamline
the performance of the Senate so as to give it
a modern approach in keeping with the times
in which we live. For this purpose it was
instructed to examine the rules and to recommend any changes considered either necessary or desirable.

November 28, 1968

In its study, the committee sought out the
background or basis for its rules, which, of
course, is to be found in the British North
America Act 1867, and many other statutes
which are listed as an appendix to the report.
Many rules were obsolete and required considerable revision. I would propose at a later
time, with your permission, to deal with the
matter of our recommendations to repeal
some rules, amend many others and add a
small number of new ones. At the moment I
would like to call your attention to the conclusion of the committee, that in modernizing
the rules it is impossible to so change the role
of the Senate as to help it assume its full
share of the legislative load and the tasks for
which it is best suited, because of the limitations imposed on the Senate by the Constitution or by statute.
In considering its report, therefore, your
committee felt that its responsibility should
include both the task of recommending modernized rules and its observations of other
factors which prevent the Senate from accomplishing the purpose which we believe the
Leader of the Government, and the Leader of
the Opposition, and the majority of senators
contemplate as the proper contribution of this
chamber to the country.
This procedure is consistent with parliamentary practice and is given authority by
the following quotation from May's Parliamentary Practice, Seventeenth Edition, which
reads as follows:
Special reports.-Besides the report properly so called relating to the subject-matter referred to the committee, it is frequently necessary for a committee to
make what is termed a special report in
reference to some matter incidentally
arising relating to the powers, functions
or proceedings of the committee. Such
reports are similar in point of form to,
and are proceeded upon in the same
manner as, the principal report of the
committee.
In consequence, the rules now recommended to the Senate are set forth in a schedule to
the report showing clearly which should be
repealed, the amendments proposed for others, and the new rules considered to be
desirable.
I would propose, given the approval of
honourable senators, that when the report
comes up for consideration I would make a
motion recommending the adoption of the
rules as set forth in the schedule, so that the

Wovemnber 28, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

rules as amended or adopted by the chamber
could become effective with little or no
unnecessary delay. Only following this stage
would I move the adoption of the remainder
of the report, because I believe there may be
considerable discussion on the other matters
referred to, and your committee realizes that
there may be many different points of view
on some of the observations or suggestions
that are made. It will then be for the Senate
to decide which, if any, parts of the report it
wishes to adopt.
In this context it should be said that considerable stress has been laid on the importance of the impartiality and independence of
the Senate. It is not suggested by your committee that the Senate should be displaced
from the political stream. It is fully aware of
the absolute necessity of the party system for
our form of democratic government in Canada. However, it is also conscious that the
Upper Chamber is thought to be obsolete by
some, redundant by others, and sometimes
spoken of as a "rubber stamp", or "a cosy
refuge for party favourites" or in other terms
of a disparaging nature. No matter how inaccurate or undeserved such reprobation may
be, the underlying thought is that a reputation for impartiality and independence would
go some distance towards convincing the
nation that the Senate acted only with no
consideration other than the common good.
The report contains a table showing the
percentage of government bills initiated in
the Senate, and points out from the figures
that the Senate can carry a substantial
measure of govermnent legislation, but only
when the government of the day so decides. I
might emphasize that were it not for the
practice of initiating all so-called money bills
in the Commons, it would have been clear
that the Senate had recently assumed a very
substantial part of the remaining legislative
load.
Attention is drawn to the fact that all private bills should be introduced in the Senate,
which is the logical house for this purpose, as
well as making a further contribution to sharing the ever-growing pressure on Parliament.
The question of "money bills", a subject of
discussion over centuries of parliamentary
practice, is raised because it may be time to
differentiate between a bill appropriating
public funds or a bill imposing taxation, from
one with a completely different purpose
which may have as a consequence the provision of a salary or some expense only incidental to its main purpose.

The desirability of obtaining only the highest qualities of statesmanship, wisdom and
experience from all walks of life for the
Senate, as wel as the often expressed concern
that parties may become too unbalanced in
the chamber, has caused comment on the
method of appointment.
Recommendations are made that the Committee of the Whole be used more frequently
by the Senate, and that select committees
considering some important legislation make
use of the Senate chamber for their sittings,
in order that the public may be more easily
aware of the progress of legislation. As you
will remember from the third report, rules
have been revised to encourage both the public and non-member senators to attend committee meetings.
These are some of the highlights of the
report which points out that after 100 years
of experience there is now not only some
reason but there is an absolute necessity for
change in the Senate, with a recommendation
which, if thought well of, would enable the
Senate to go into a study in depth of the
constitutional or statutory changes which
would be required to enable the Senate to
fulfil its responsibilities in the latter part of
the twentieth century.
Honourable senators, in the report I
expressed my personal debt to the members
of the committee and to our staff. However, I
believe that the committee would not feel
that I had fulfilled my responsibility if I did
not now say a few words on this subject.
On behalf of the committee, I wish to
express our appreciation for the co-operation
of the Clerk of the Senate and the Assistant
Clerk; to our legal counsel, Mr. Dehler, for
his competence and assistance; to the staff of
Hansard and the Queen's Printer; and to the
members of the staff of the Senate: the Law
Clerk, Mr. Hopkins; the Chief Clerk of Committees, Mr. Batt; and the Clerk of our committee, Mr. Jackson, for their constant
attendance and untiring zeal in their work,
sometimes day and night, on our behalf, and
this should include their office staffs for the
cheerful assumption of their heavy workload.
May I say that the Senate is fortunate indeed
to be so well served by this small body of
dedicated people.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

November 28, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

If we are to make a reassessment of the
Commonwealth and to know just what we
should do in respect of it, we should know
the facts. What are they? Well, first, demographically, the Commonwealth consists of
some 780 million people. That is about 25 per
cent of the people who live on the face of the
earth. They live on every continent and in
every climate. They represent almost every
religion, every culture and every language.
There are some 27 countries. Some of them
are old; some of them are new. Some of them
are
developed;
some
of
them
are
undeveloped. Some of them are poor; some of
them are rich. Some of them are overcrowded; some of them are underpopulated. They
are diversified almost beyond description and
yet they are a unit. Whence, then, is the
source of this unity? To this queston there
are a number of answers.
The first, I think, is the existence of the
monarchy. The Queen is the head of the
Commonwealth, not as the Queen of England but as the head of the Commonwealth,
and is so consecrated and so crowned. She is
not an absolute ruler but a constitutional
monarch in some states. She is a reigning, not
a ruling monarch. In other states of the Commonwealth she is not even a monarch at all.
Appropriately enough, the monarchy is a
family symbol at the head of a family of
nations. As such it is a salutary symbol. The
monarch is subject to the advice of her governments, but she is neither tarnished by
their deficiencies nor credited with their
accomplishments. The Monarchy, a continuing
symbol of authority in the Commonwealth, is
supported only by popular sanction.
The second bond of unity is that comprised
in the common parliamentary institutions to
which we subscribe. None of these institutions
is a slavish imitation either of Westminster or
of other institutions in the Commonwealth
parliaments. Westminster itself and its like
institutions are evolving. There is a wide diversity of establishment in the various countries. Some countries, such as New Zealand,
have a unicameral system of government, but
most have a bicameral system of government
like all of the great democracies of the West.
But there are some commonwealth countries
in which some of the features of a congressional system exist. This is particularly true
in Pakistan. Politically, there is no uniformity. In some countries there is a single party;
in other countries there are two parties. In
some countries, as in our own, there are
many parties, while in other countries there
are no parties-there are military regimes,

which we hope are temporary. Within all 27
countries of the commonwealth the parliamentary institutions are changing, developing
and adjusting, and I think it is fair to say
that they are ever seeking better democratic
methods for the governance of their peoples.
They suspend them at times, and they restore
the democratic methods at other times.
Certainly some of these countries are more
ready for democratic procedures than are others. Some are going through agonizing adjustments and readjustments, because in fact
they are so new.
The third feature of the commonwealth
that I think is of essential importance is the
concept of the independence of the judiciary.
This concept is basic to the prevalence of
justice, both for the protection of human
rights and to settle property disputes. The
concept is as ancient as history itself, as
ancient as human society. Without it there is
disorder and distrust. Law and order were
talked about a great deal in the national election in the United States just a few weeks
ago. Law and order is important in a country,
but the concept of justice must be coupled
with it. That is the concept which is involved
in the commonwealth people's understanding
of the independence of the judiciary. The
concept of the institution must be fortified
and must be dignified.
Another bond within the commonwealth is
the understanding of a common language, the
language of Chaucer, and Bacon, of Milton, of
Shakespeare, of Dickens, Shelley, Dryden,
Scott and Burns. But it is not only English
that is spoken in the Commonwealth. In many
parts other tongues are officially recognized
and in some cases not officially recognized.
We have, for example, in some of the countries the languages of the ancient and inscrutable East. In others of the western parts of
the commonwealth we have the languages
with the polished phrases and the deep thought
of the Gaul, the Gael and the Greek. Here
indeed is a richness in diversity, in diversity
of expression, in diversity of philosophy of
life, a diversity of belief. All this is a commonwealth asset which carf be used to promote the comity of nations. It has links and
ties and contacts in every part of the world,
and who indeed knows when the commonwealth, as a unit, may feel called upon by
one of its members to intervene in a crisis, a
world crisis, perhaps, if not a commonwealth
crisis, when the intervention by another commonwealth country might indeed be disastrous. Finally, there is the anomaly of anomalies, it is de facto equality of status of

SENATE DEBATES
almost every unit, whether rich or poor, big
or small. The evolution of this status of
independence was not uniform. Honourable
senators will remember the situation with
respect to the older dominions. The watershed
was the Imperial Conference of 1926 and the
Statute of Westminster in 1931 in which it
was declared that members of the Commonwealth were "autonomous communities within
the British Empire, equal in status, in no way
subordinate one to another in any aspect of
their domestic or external affairs, though
united by a common allegiance to the Crown
and freely associated as members of the
British Commonwealth of Nations."
That declaration and that statute both constituted a huge step forward. They were born
of the diversity of the members of the Commonwealth. They were nurtured by a sense of
self-sufficiency in the various countries. They
were inspired by the workings of the democratic process, and the result constituted a
new form of community in the international
scene. The value of that step to Canada as
Canada approached World War II was incalculable. The effort which emerged from this
country in that war, primarily because of that
step, perhaps, was an effort that was truly
Canadian and of which Canadians were deeply and justifiably proud.
Since the war a whole new multitude of
sovereign states has come into being in the
Commonwealth. Most of them in fact are
more autonomous than we are ourselves,
because most of them do not have to go to
Britain for amendments to their Constitution.
I quickly add that of course that is not the
fault of the British. It is the fault of ourselves
because we cannot agree on a formula. In due
time that will be rectified.
Most of these new nations are in the tropics. Most of these people are the basic peoples
of human history, and indeed of pre-history.
Many of them have cultures and social structures thousands of years older than our own
in the west. Most of them are shut off from
the ways and the wealth and, indeed, the
weariness of the west. Their peoples live out
their lives in the fateful serenity of their
fathers before them for generations. Many of
them question the value of change. But
change has come to them. Awareness of the
better things was thrust upon them by events,
by communications and by a contracting
world. To cope with these changes within the
new Commonwealth is certainly now a Commonwealth challenge. Perhaps it would not be
inappropriate to say that this great challenge

November 28, 1968

is one of the foundations for the existing and
continuing unity of the Commonwealth. To
assist many of these nations to cope is the
challenge of the developed parts of the Commonwealth. But it is also a challenge that
faces developing parts of the Commonwealth
to assist each other. Nigeria, for example, is a
case in point. Everybody wants to help Nigeria. But what country in the Commonwealth
could be most effective? And Nigeria may not
be the last instance in which we will be faced
with trouble. I personally was deeply disappointed a few years ago when it was necessary for two Commonwealth countries, India
and Pakistan, to go to Tashkent-to the Russians-as an intermediary for the solution of
a problem between them. As I say, these
were two Commonwealth countries. But one
does console oneself with the fact that these
are eastern peoples and perhaps they did feel
that an eastern mind could understand their
problem better than a western mind.
We should remind ourselves also that in the
Commonwealth there is no central legislative
or administrative authority. There is no
supergovernment. There is no set foreign
policy. There is no unified defence establishment. There are periodic meetings of prime
ministers to review common problems. There
are periodic meetings of special ministers for
the review of special areas of concern. We
have the Commonwealth Secretariat to carry
out the programs and policies assigned to it
by the prime ministers. And we have the
Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, a
forum which enables Commonwealth legislators to consult, to debate and to inform themselves and their legislatures on matters of
interest to the Commonwealth.
The Commonwealth today is not run from
Il Downing Street. We should remember also
that once complete independence is granted,
even to a small country, the United Kingdom's juridical, legal and constitutional responsibilities have virtually ended. Perhaps
there are moral factors; perhaps there are
historic practices which temper this. But
when there is equality of status between
Commonwealth countries, concern for the
welfare of any one of these countries becomes
diffused among all of them. And if the more
powerful of the Commonwealth countries
have this duty, so have the smaller units,
even if their help cannot be as great as the
help given by the more powerful elements in
the community.
I think we might with value contrast the
position which exists within the Commonwealth now, with that which existed in the

November 28, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

thirties. At that time the association was
known as the empire. But we did not get rid
of the concépt of empire and accept the idea
of equality of status very quickly despite the
1926 meeting and the 1931 statute. The old
association looked to the development of each
other through trade and a system of preferences. Some of these preferences still survive,
and, indeed, some are essential. I think particularly of the importance of these preferences for the economy, for example, of New
Zealand. But today the whole trade atmosphere is changed, and who would say today
that the road to trade, better trade, greater
trade, and to greater prosperity lies within
the ambit of trade preferences and trading
within the Commonwealth.
Throughout the world the talk is of wider
markets, the widest possible markets. We
have regional trading agreements. Some, like
the European Economic Community, cut
across commonwealth boundaries.
It is unrealistic to attempt to restore the
old approaches. The prime fact of the matter
is that although independence has been in
existence for many of those countries now for
two decades, the commonwealth, as newly
conceived, is in a period of transition. To give
some examples-the United Kingdom is
reducing its defence commitments, either
immediately or in the foreseeable future, in
certain parts. It is leaving Singapore. I have
visited Singapore and the base there. Its leaving there ultimately is creating a strategic
problem in the far east. I know it will create
an employment problem in Singapore. I, too,
have seen the great harbour at Valetta, on the
Island of Malta. Britain is withdrawing largely from the refurbishing of ships there,
although there has been some accommodation.
But what accommodation is to be made in
these cases as a result of the independence
that these states acquire.
The days of empire are gone and with them
the responsibility and the demands upon a
former mother country. But the dependence
of people in some of these new countries on
the old establishment cannot but create hardships for them and I am sure heartache for
those who manage the affairs of Britain.
The new countries are not all self-sufficient.
Few, if any, could defend their own borders.
Some lack resources, some lack skills and
know-how, some lack facilities for training.
All of them need capital, all need infrastructure to begin modernization. Most of them are
overpopulated. Many of their peoples are
underfed. Yet though they can grow almost
anything, in many areas their agriculture is
29234-41

in decline. "Encourage agriculture," you say.
"Make it an industry like we have made
western agriculture an industry in this country." Suppose you do that with some of those
countries, what about the commodity prices
that these products will command on the
world market? Some developed countries,
with agricultural problems of their own, like
this one, will not or cannot expose their
markets to the products of some of these
developing countries. What I say of agricultural products applies equally to their early
manufactures.
It may be a little beyond the context of the
Commonwealth to say this, but the solution of
these tremendous problems, these overwhelming problems, may have to come from
three countries, mainly. They are the United
States, the United Kingdom and Canada.
Honourable senators, the picture is not
pleasant and the gap between the developed
and the developing countries is widening
every day. By the year 2000 the prospect of a
drastic food shortage in the world is more
than a vague conjecture.
What is to be done, for example, in the
area of commonwealth defence? We may not
be naked to our enemies, but certainly they
do not stand in awe of our armed might. We
contemplate a power play which can threaten
many parts of the Commonwealth. That power
play results from the jockeying of big powers
for position in the far east, in the middle
east, in the Mediterranean, in northwest
Europe. Some of the Commonwealth countries
are cajoled, some of them are threatened, by
ideologies foreign to Commonwealth ideals.
At this point, I would like to quote briefly
what U Thant had to say in a recent
statement:
There has been a serious decline in the
standards of international ethics and
morality. If this trend is not reversed,
and if the principle of non-intervention in
the free destiny of nations is not re-established, the future of international peace
and security itself is indeed a very dark
one.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Where is that quotation
from?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): That is a
quotation from a recent statement of U
Thant, Secretary General of the United
Nations.
Both within and without the commonwealth
there is another problem which raises its ugly

SENATE DEBATES

head. That problem is racism. Mr. Pindling,
at the opening meeting in Nassau, said that it
perhaps was the most frightening of all the
problems which exist in the world today.
There exists a suspicion of white men's
motives among the coloured men. Some of
this is based on history. Some of it, indeed, is
based on existing policies in many parts of
the world.
The intrinsie dignity and the importance of
the individual has not been the basic premise
for the governments of people in many parts
of the so-called enlightened commonwealth.
The coloured man has suffered and he continues to suffer. Change must come. Change will
come. Perhaps it will come by black power or
yellow power or red power. For my part, I
hope it wili come by persuasion from the
convinced. Justice must not only be done but
must be seen to be donc, and justice will not
be donc overnight.
There will be and there is a need for restraint, for patience, for prudence, and these
virtues must prevail over excessive and inflamatory demands. These demands do not
all come from the underdeveloped parts of
the world. Some come from developed countries. The so-called enlightened countries
should practice those virtues.
Honourable senators, I am confident that
the commonwealth can show the way, if these
common ideals and these approaches of the
commonwealth are adopted even within the
commonwealth itself. If we do that, in the
words of the hymn which was popularized by
the late Martin Luther King, "We shall
overcome."
Peace and social justice are basic to development. Revolution will only spread the
chaos so ardently desired by Communism.
The developed countries of the world must
provide massive help, must provide, indeed,
heroic help to the underdeveloped countries.
And, indirectly, defence is one forn of help,
although we do not count it when we assess
the value of our foreign aid budgets. But
when we contribute to defence, to security, to
peace, we are not only helping ourselves but
we are also helping to try to establish conditions under which development can occur not
only in the third world but in the developed
world.
In the past 10 years some $40 million has
been poured out in public funds for aid to the
third world, and some $20 million from private sources. Yet the gap grows daily.
The Marshall Plan taught the world what
investment in development abroad can do.

Povember 28, 1968

But the Marshall Plan had a basis to work on
in northern Europe devastated by a war,
because there were in those countries skills
and know-how and education-trained people.
But in the third world the base must be built
and we are only starting.
Sometimes the economic, social, the political and military difficulties of the domestie
scene, like those in Canada, are obstacles to
more help for underdeveloped peoples. These
obstacles we must overcome. The mote in
our own eye we must cast out. For this we
will need will-strong will and goodwill.
Within the Commonwealth, if we show the
way, the world as well as the Commonwealth
will benefit both materially and spiritually,
and "We shall overcome."
On motion of Hon. Mr. Haig, for Hon. Mr.
Blois, debate adjourned.
NAVIGABLE WATERS PROTECTION
ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READINGDEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Charles McElman moved the second
reading of Bill S-19, to amend the Navigable
Waters Protection Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the amendments proposed to this bill are for the most
part a tidying up of the existing legislation
and do not include any major proposals for
change of either policy or principle.
The Navigable Waters Protection Act, as its
title implies, provides authority for protection
of the navigable waters for navigation and
shipping. The existing legislation is divided
into three parts. Part I, encompassing sections
2 to 11 inclusive, seeks to control the construction, repair or alteration of any work.
"Work" includes any bridge, boom, dam,
aboiteau, wharf, dock, pier or other structure, tunnel or pipe, and so on, to be found
in, upon, over, under, through or across any
navigable water.
Until October 1, 1966, Part I of this act was
administered by the Minister of Public

Works, the authority under which many of
the works-wharves, tunnels, and so on-that
are subject to this act were constructed. Yet,
the Department of Transport through its
Marine Services Division had responsibility

for navigation and shipping. It became the
consensus of opinion that the Department of
Transport was the more logical body to
approve or disapprove such works in relation
to protection of navigable waters for naviga-

tion and shipping. Consequently, on October

November 28, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

1, 1966, by an order of the Governor in Council, responsibility for the administration of
Part I of the act was conveyed fron the
Minister of Public Works to the Minister of
Transport.
The amendments being proposed in this bill
to Part I of the act provide for conveyance of
this administrative responsibility.
Other amendments to Part I include the
insertion of a new definition of the words
"navigable water" to cover canals and other
bodies of water such as those artificially
created through the construction of water
storage facilities and hydro electric generating facilities.
Also, there is an inclusion of the dumping
of fill or the excavation of materials from the
bed of a navigable water within the definition
of the word "work" in this act. This latter
inclusion is designed to overcome existing
nroblems such as those experienced through
the dumping of fill in Lake Ontario near Port
Credit, which presently cannot be controlled
by the existing provisions.
Provisions will also be made for a time
limit, following ministerial approval, for construction of any work, and this will prevent
what has sometimes happened in the past,
namely, long time-lags in approved construction of works which, if unduly delayed, could
become no longer desirable owing to changing
circumstances.
Clauses 4, 5 and 7 of the bill, if approved,
will strengthen the hand of the minister in
ordering and enforcing the removal or alteration of a work. They will provide penalties
for non-compliance with such an order, and
will provide for introduction of a scale of fees
in applications for approval of works related
to navigable waters. But these fees will apply
only where exceptional supervision or inspection may be required in connection with any
such work.
Part II of the existing legislation, sections
12 to 29 inclusive, deals with protection
against obstructions to navigation created by
moored, wrecked, derelict or abandoned
vessels, and against obstructions created by
unlawful dumping of material in navigable
waters of minimum depths. There is currently
no effective provision for removal of floating
vessels which are permanently moored in
such a manner as to create a hazard to navigation or shipping. A case in point is the
vessel Inch Arran presently moored, afloat, at
Kingston, Ontario.
The proposed amendments would enable
the minister to more effectively overcome
29234-41J

such problems, as they may arise, and would
provide more realistic and, hopefully, effective penalties in case of breach of the provisions of Part II of the act.
It is also proposed that the minimum depth
of navigable water in which material may be
dumped should be increased from 12 fathoms
to 20 fathoms to allow adequate clearance for
the larger bulk carriers now in use.
It is further proposed to remove the current distinction between tidal and non-tidal
waters in section 19. Current provisions of
this section guard only against the dumping
of material in navigable tidal waters.
Section 23 of the act should be repealed.
The harbours at Quebec City and Montreal
are now under the jurisdiction of the National
Harbours Board, and the Department of
Transport recognizes that in these harbours it
has an obligation to remove wrecked vessels.
Section 24 and 25 of the act are proposed
for amendment in order that the National
Harbours Board and the St. Lawrence Seaway Authority may not be affected by the
prohibitions against dumping materials in
navigable waters under their jurisdiction.
Part III, sections 30 to 32 inclusive, of the
existing legislation, deals with protections
against ferry cables and swing or draw
bridges.
The only amendment proposed in part III
is to provide for more realistic penalties for
violation of these sections of the act.
Honourable senators, I am sure that questions of detail will arise concerning certain of
the proposed amendments contained in this
bill. I will therefore propose that prior to
third reading the bill be referred to the
Standing Committee on Transport and
Communications.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Macdonald, debate
adjourned.

BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACT
INITIATION OF LEGISLATION IN THE SENATEDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Tuesday, November 26, the adjourned debate on the inquiry
of the honourable Senator Hayden, calling the
attention of the Senate to section 53 and section 91 (as amended in 1949) of the British
North America Act, 1867, and the effect of
such sections on the initiation of legislation in
the Senate.
Hon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson: Honourable
senators, Senator Hayden has introduced a
very interesting thesis relating to the effect of
the 1949 constitutional amendment, namely
section 91(1) of the B.N.A. Act. Senator Hayden has done this in his usual lucid style and
manner and I compliment him most highly on
his presentation of a very intricate and difficult problem. I might say that when Senator
Hayden speaks in this house, particularly on
matters of law or on the Constitution, he is a
person who should be listened to with great
respect. But may I say this, that I think he
also may have opened up a can of worms,
especially if he should be wholly correct in
his thesis. I will explain this point further at
a later stage, but I may say now that if section
91(1) is interpreted in the way Senator Hayden suggests, we may find that our Constitution is so fluid that all the constitutional
guidelines of the past may not be guidelines
any more. I think that is partly the view
taken by Senator Flynn in his impromptu
remarks yesterday following Senator Hayden.
However, for the purposes of my subsequent
remarks, let me put on the record the sections of the British North America Act that
are involved in this discussion.
The first of these is section 91(1), and I
would like to cite the whole section because it
is basic to the entire problem we are discussing in this resolution:

November 28, 1968

91. It shall be lawful for the Queen, by
and with the Advice and Consent of the
Senate and House of Commons, to make
Laws for the Peace, Order, and good
Government of Canada, in relation to all
Matters not coming within the Classes of
Subjects by this Act assigned exclusively
to the Legislatures of the Provinces; and
for greater Certainty, but not so as to
restrict the Generality of the foregoing
Terms of this Section, it is hereby
declared that (notwithstanding anything
in this Act) the exclusive Legislative Authority of the Parliament of Canada
extends to all Matters coming within the
Classes of Subjects next hereinafter
enumerated; that is to say,And now I come to subsection (1) which contains the power of the Parliament of Canada
alone to amend from time to time the Constitution of Canada1. The amendment from time to time of
the Constitution of Canada, except as
regards matters coming within the classes
of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the
provinces, or as regards rights or
privileges by this or any other Constitutional Act granted or secured to the Legislature or the Government of a province,
or to any class of persons with respect to
schools or as regards the use of the
English or the French language or as
regards the requirements that there shall
be a session of the Parliament of Canada
at least once each year, and that no
House of Commons shall continue for
more than five years from the day of the
return of the Writs for choosing the
House: provided, however, that a House
of Commons may in time of real or
apprehended war, invasion or insurrection be continued by the Parliament of
Canada if such continuation is not
opposed by the votes of more than onethird of the members of such House.
Now, as all honourable senators are aware,
the passage of this amendment to our Constitution in 1949 was a matter of great importance and added tremendously to the powers
and, indeed, gave certain very considerable
powers to the federal Parliament to amend
the Constitution in all respects where the sections come within the federal sphere or scope
of operations. However, I must refer to the
exclusions and exceptions that you have
heard me read in subsection (1), al] of which

November 28, 1868

SENATE DEBATES

are of great importance. Nevertheless the fact
is that since the passing of this amendment
the Parliament of Canada, acting alone, has
very extensive powers of amendment of our
Constitution.
At this stage I would also like to put on the
record section 53 of the British North America Act, with which Senator Hayden was very
much concerned in his speech. I quote:
53. Bills for appropriating any Part of
the Public Revenue, or for imposing any
Tax or Impost, shall originate in the
House of Commons.

it is constitutional for us to pass it, and if
it is passed by the other place then it is
legal, because Parliament would thereby
have amended the Constitution, as it is
empowered to do under section 91. This
was my understanding of the whole of his
thesis.
HON. MR. HAYDEN: The other part of
the thesis was that if doing it by short
division in that fashion bothered you, you
could do it by long division, by saying
"Notwithstanding the provisions of section 53."

Now, if I may briefly define Senator Hayden's position, as I see it, it is this: that by
virtue of section 91(1), various methods are
open to Parliament, namely to the Senate and
the other place working together and in unison, to thwart and make of no effect sections
53 and 54, by way of introducing money bills
in this chamber without the prior necessity of
repealing those sections. In practical terms, as
I understand his position, a so-called money
bill could be introduced in the Senate, and if
concurred in by the other place such action
would in effect amount to the repeal of section 53 for the purpose of such bill. However,
he also suggests that if this was too much of a
shortcut, the same effect could be obtained by
prefacing such bills with the words "notwithstanding the provisions of section 53".
That this is his view is, I believe, confirmed
by the brief exchange between Senator Hayden and Senator Flynn contained on page 615
of Hansard of Tuesday last. This exchange
reflects to a certain extent Senator Flynn's
position on this matter as well as Senator
Hayden's. Senator Flynn had this to say:
Senator Hayden has presented an
interesting thesis on the effect of the 1949
amendment to section 91 of the B.N.A.
Act. I must say that I am a little surprised at this; I had not heard this
proposal before and I am not sure that I
have had sufficient time to digest it sufficiently to pass judgment on it. I would
only say that I am a bit worried at the
idea that every time a money bill is initiated here we are, in effect, amending
the Constitution without any warning to
Parliament that we were doing so. This is
implicitly what is suggested by the
honourable Senator Hayden.
HON. MR. HAYDEN: I presented the
alternative.
HON. MR. FLYNN: But you say that
every time we initiate a money bill here

In regard to the context of the remarks I
will be making later, let me add also this
short paragraph which was uttered by Senator Flynn and is contained at the bottom of
page 615:
...

I do not favour dealing with the Con-

stitution as if it were any other bill. I
know that the B.N.A. Act is a mere act of
the Imperial Parliament, which, to the
extent of the 1949 amendment, has been
given to the jurisdiction of our Parliament, but I do not like to deal with our
Constitution, as suggested by the honourable senator, as easily as dealing with
any other of our statutes.
Honourable senators, I have recited this
exchange between Senator Hayden and Senator Flynn because I think it fairly represents
again Senator Hayden's position in this matter.
Is not this exactly what the 1949 amendment
to section 91 has done to the Canadian Constitution as applied to purely federal affairs,
namely, to make it amendable by Parliament
acting alone in the same way as it is empowered to amend any other statute? That
is the problem which has been raised by
Senator Hayden and I think it is one of
utmost importance.
Referring again to Senator Hayden's position, I go along with it nearly all the waybut not quite all the way. In other words, in
order to achieve the ends which Senator Hayden says are possible, namely, to extend the
powers of the Senate over money bills, I
believe it would be necessary to repeal
expressly at least section 53. I say "at least"
because I do not think that section 54 would
require repeal for the purpose intended.
It is a well-known canon of construction
that all provisions in a statute, even in an
organic constitutional document such as the
B.N.A. Act, must be construed in relation to
each other. It is equally clear that a specific
section will prevail over a general one. To

SENATE DEBATES
give full effect both to section 53 and section
91(1) it must be concluded that amendments
to the B.N.A. should not be sought by means
of money bills introduced in contravention of
section 53. Nor can this defect be remedied by
adding at the beginning of a money bill:
"Notwithstanding the provisions of section 53
of the B.N.A. Act."
Honourable senators, in further reference
to section 91(1) and the question whether in
fact it goes further than was intended, I
would like to refer to a quotation which
suggests that the Right Honourable Louis St.
Laurent deemed that section 91(1) had gone
too far. This is a very interesting quotation,
which I am about to read from the book by
Mr. Russell Hopkins, Confederation at the
Crossroads. At page 265 he refers to the
amendment made in 1949 and says:
The second important amendment to the
Canadian Constitution in 1949 was
embodied in the B.N.A. Act, 1949 (No. 2).
This amendment, which empowered the
Parliament of Canada to amend the purely federal aspects of the Constitution, was
obtained without either consultation with
or approval by the provincial governments. The federal government maintained the position it had assumed in respect of the 1943 and 1946 amendments.
NeverthelessAnd these are the words to which I would
like to draw your attention-at a federal-provincial conference held
in 1950, Prime Minister St. Laurent
indicated that, if an agreement were
reached on an overall procedure for
amending the Constitution in Canada, he
would be prepared to reconsider the
broad effect of the amendment of 1949.

November 28, 1968

whole subject matter has brought up
another problem which I have loosely
referred to as a "can of worms". I think
this is the reason why Mr. St. Laurent
seems to entertain some doubts as to whether
or not section 91(1) did not go too far in this
respect, namely, that it gave the Parliament
of Canada too much power to alter the Constitution in the designated fields of authority.
Again I would refer to the fears that Senator Flynn voiced in his remarks yesterday. I
have not discussed this with him, but I am
presuming that this is what he had in mind.
Senator Flynn suggested that surely the
B.N.A. Act is not merely another statute
which can be amended in certain particulars
at will. Indeed, is it not quite possible that if
a very irresponsible Parliament existed in
this country, it could reduce the number of
members from 264 to one? Also, there are
various sections of the B.N.A. Act relating
exclusively to the federal arena which could
be either repealed, amended, or so mutilated
as to cause grave damage to our country as we
have it today. There are some examples in
history of this happening. Is not that exactly
what happened in Germany in 1936? We all
know that Hitler acted quite within the law
in everything he did.
Hon. Mr. Walker: Would Senator Martin do
that?

Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: The fact is that
when Hitler came to power in 1936, with his
tremendous majority of "brown shirts," he
obtained much too easily the amendment of
the Constitution of Germany, namely, of the
Weimar Republic of that day. The result, of
course, is obvious to all of us. We know what
happened, but that is how it was done. Consequently, I refer to this matter simply to sugNevertheless, it is my conviction that sec- gest to this honourable body that it may not

country could not be altered without very
effective safeguards being applied.
We know what these safeguards are. They
are very strict ones. It is true that they have
had many amendments to that Constitution,
but they have been within the guidelines laid
down by the founding fathers nearly 200
years ago.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: They were always consented to by the entire population, by the
states as representatives.

Honourable senators, this is really a digression in this part of my remarks. Ail I want to
say is that in my view Senator Hayden is
very nearly correct in what he says. The only
difference in view that I have with him is
that I believe that section 53 cannot be
amended, impliedly, as it were, merely by
passing an act which flies in its face. It can
be repealed by this Parliament, however, in
which event we could make such definitions
in regard to section 53, and in regard to what
is meant by a money bill and so on, that
there would be no need for further debate on
what a money bill is. Parliament could
decide, if we wanted to change that section,
just what bills could come in here and whether or not the Senate should be allowed to
originate money bills. We could deal similarly
with section 54, which relates to the question
of money bills being introduced in the other
place. Parliament could, in respect of that
section, make any arrangements that might
be desirable.
Honourable senators, thank you for listening to me on these points. But let me add that
the Senate is now, as it has always been, a
bulwork of the Constitution of this country.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Prowse, debate
adjourned.

Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson: Yes. You know the
procedure: by a three-quarter majority of the
states and a two-thirds majority in Congress.
I come now to the last question which I
would like to touch on just briefly, namely,
that the Constitution of Canada is so easily
amendable by a mere majority of the members of our both houses, and what might
conceivably be the result of that. So let us
ask, what about people who suggest that the
Senate should be abolished? What about these
people who suggest that you should do that
under circumstances which I have related?
And so, suppose there were no Senate in
Canada. If, for instance, there was such turmoil in this country that a majority were
elected to the House of Commons representing the far left or the far right, as was the
case in Germany, what would happen to this

facts or events which have necessitated the
petition requiring the presentation of this
bill?
The Atlantic Peat Moss Company Limited
was incorporated by Letters Patent dated
May 22, 1945, and Supplementary Letters
Patent were obtained in 1963 in order to
change the stock and refinance the company.
This company carries on the operation of
extracting, manufacturing, packaging, and of
the expedition and sale of peat moss. This
product, as honourable senators know, is used
to modify soil properties, particularly the
moisture retention ratio, and it is often used
with other fertilizers.
The centre of operations of Atlantic is in
Shippegan and Lamèque, both in Gloucester
County, New Brunswick. In the last four
years the average sales of this company have
been in the vicinity of three quarters of a
million dollars. In addition, it has paid for
freight charges an average of $260,000 a year,
and has paid in salaries for the plant operation approximately $200,000 a year. I might
mention, in passing, that 90 per cent of its
production is exported to the United States
market.
This company has had to face in recent
years, particularly in the last three years,
serious union problems. Furthermore, certain
American syndicates have taken over a number of Canadian companies producing peat
moss. There was a tendency to lower the
market price and this caused serious financial
difficulties to Atlantic Peat Moss. However,
these problems were met following the refinancing of the company in 1963. For certain
reasons this company failed to complete and
file its annual report to the department as
required under the Canada Corporations Act.
It is for this reason that the company is
requesting now that the orders in council
which were published in the Canada Gazette
on June 17, 1968, and on June 2, 1967, be
deemed to never have had effect, as this company now is not legally incorporated under
the Canada Corporations Act.
The company admits that this omission
occurred as a result of some negligence or
lack of supervision on its part. The fact
remains that it is operating in a designated
area. It gives employment to approximately
100 persons, and even up to 300 during the
peak production period.
Two solutions are offered the company to
correct the existing situation. The first one
would be to obtain new Letters Patent, but
because of all the financial implications, this

November 28, 1968

first action seems impossible to adopt. The
transfer of assets, plus the depletion already
used, would automatically set the company to
a point where it probably would have to
cease all operations.
The other solution is the one which is to be
found in the present private bill. The
petition requests a cancellation of the notice
of dissolution pertaining to the company
concerned.
Honourable senators, again I want to mention that the company admits that there has
been serious neglect on its part, or on the
part of its administrators and officers, but the
seriousness of the consequences of its dissolution must be considered. The operation of the
company, as I have stated, is important and
vital to the region concerned. This company
is completely Canadian-owned and, as I have
indicated, 90 per cent of its sales are to the
United States.
Section 1 of the bill simply states:
The notices given on June 2nd, 1967
and June 17th, 1968, and published on
June 17th, 1967 and June 22nd, 1968, in
the Canada Gazette, by virtue of section
125 (12) of the Canada Corporations Act,
R.S.C. (1952) chapter 53 and amendments,
shall be deemed to never have had effect
as for Atlantic Peat Moss Co. Ltd.Mousse de Tourbe Atlantic Cie Ltée, subject to the following sections.
Section 2, subsection (1) states:
Within the two months following the
adoption of the present Act, all returns
prescribed by the said Canada Corporations Act, shall have to be filed and
received for and in the name of the said
Company, notwithstanding any stipulation of the said Act, or notice to the
contrary.
When the bill was presented for third reading in the other place, subsection (2) of section 2 was amended to read as follows:
Failure to comply with the requirements
of subsection (1) of this section, will
make all sections of this Act null and
void.
It was felt that this amendment further
strengthened the bill.
Honourable senators, I commend for your
approval the second reading of this bill, and I
am prepared to move that it be referred to a
standing Committee.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: I am sure that it is not
necessary.

RULES OF THE SENATE
FOURTH REPORT OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE OF THE SENATE
ON THE RULES OF THE SENATE

Thursday, November 28, 1968.
The Special Committee of the Senate on
the Rules of the Senate makes its Fourth
Report as follows:
1. Under authority of the Resolution passed
by the Senate at its sitting Thursday, September 19th, 1968, reading as follows:
"The Honourable Senator Martin, P.C.,
moved, seconded by the Honourable
Senator McDonald:
That a Special Committee of the Senate
be appointed to examine the Rules of the
Senate, and to recommend to the Senate
any changes therein considered by the
Committee to be either necessary or desirable; and
That the Committee have power to call
for persons, papers and records, to examine witnesses, to report from time to
time, to print such papers and evidence
from day to day as may be ordered by
the Committee and to sit during sittings
and adjournments of the Senate."
a Special Committee composed of the
following:
The Honourable Senators

has met and now submits its Report.

United States of America, and previous
debates of the Senate of Canada on this subject, were considered.
3. Throughout its study, your Committee
was aware of the need to accelerate the legislative process, and the widespread public
criticism of the whole parliamentary process
as it exists in Canada today. Your Committee
has therefore satisfied itself that the Rules
recommended to the Senate will permit the
Senate to assume greater legislative responsibility without sacrificing its customary scrutiny of the legislation itself. In addition, in
recommending the amendments set forth as a
Schedule to this report, your Committee also
recommends that the Committee on Standing
Rules and Orders be instructed to keep under
constant study the Rules and to recommend
periodic revisions thereto. Your Committee
further recommends that the proposed Rules,
as adopted by the Senate, be printed in the
English and French languages in conformity
with the arrangement, style, numbering, and
lettering used in the Statutes of Canada, with
a detailed index, an appendix showing a bibliography of related statutes, and an appendix
of relevant forms of proceedings, the responsibility therefor to be entrusted to the Clerk
of the Senate, the Law Clerk, and Legal
Counsel of your Committee.
4. In the course of study, however, it
became apparent that amendments to the
Rules would not be sufficient to enable the
Senate to carry out effectively its role as one
of the three vital parts of the Parliament of
Canada in accordance with the terms of Section 17 of the B.N.A. Act:
"There shall be one Parliament for Canada, consisting of the Queen, an Upper
House styled the Senate, and the House
of Commons."

November 28, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

only could not accomplish this purpose. There
emerged the clear necessity for constitutional
and statutory changes beyond the terms of
reference of the Committee in order to reach
the objective of a modern and streamlined
Parliament.
5. Such basic reform is not a new idea.
Over the years, the Senate itself has struggled with this problem. One can recall the
motion placed before this Chamber in 1951 by
the Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson, then
Government Leader in the Senate,
"that a Special Committee of the Senate
be appointed to inquire into, and report
upon, whatever action in its opinion may
be necessary or expedient to enable the
Senate to make its maximum contribution
to the welfare of the Canadian people."
But today the problem is more urgent
because of the rapid social change during the
last two decades. Parliamentary reform is
now a public issue which must be resolved
with dispatch in accordance with the requirements of modern society.
6. The British North America Act, 1867,
contemplated a primary role for the Senate
which has changed substantially over the
years. Originally it was envisaged that all
legislation would originate in the House of
Commons and that the function of the Senate
would be to re-examine the Bills passed by
the House and referred to the Senate. It was
to be a Chamber for review and "sober
second thought".
7. With the passage of time this function
has changed. In the first place many private
bills have been introduced in the Senate, particularly of course divorce bills. It appears
generally agreed that all private bills ought to
be introduced in the Senate, whereas for special reasons a few private bills are still being
introduçed in the House of Commons. That
conclusion was implicit in the decision taken
in 1932 to increase the parliamentary fee to
$500 if a private bill were introduced in the
Commons while it was left at the less realistic
figure of $200 if introduced in the Senate. A
provision to the effect that all private bills
shall originate in the Senate would be beyond
the competence of the Senate acting unilaterally. It is recommended therefore that discussions be initiated with the House of Commons
to the end that such a provision be made
either by a change in the rules of the House
of Commons or by statute. If that change is
made, presumably the parliamentary fee in
the Senate should be raised too. In addition,

it bas become the practice to introduce a
limited number of government bills-those
with no money context-in the Senate. This
practice, which is a very welcome one, has
enabled the Senate to carry part of the legislative load in recent years, as the following
data reveals:

8. When it is borne in mind that all money
bills are included in the figures of Bills initiated in the Commons, it becomes apparent
that the Senate can carry a not inconsequential share of the legislation when the Government of the day directs Bills to it for introduction. It might be added that during the
last ten years 233 Private Bills, other than
Divorce Bills, have been initiated in the
Senate, while only 4, initiated in the House of
Commons, have been received by the Senate.
9. Another innovation, the function of
investigation, has been most effectively carried out by special committees of the Senate,
and often at a fraction of the cost that would
have been incurred by a Royal Commission.
More and more the work of Parliament has to
be done in Committees. This is true also in
other countries with democratic forms of government, including the United Kingdom and
the United States. Over and above its deliberative functions the Senate, in carrying out its
primary responsibility as a legislative body,
must do an increasing amount of investigatory and research work. Examples of this are to
be found in recent years in the work of the
Special Committees such as those on (1) Inflation, (2) Manpower and Employment, (3)
Land Use in Canada, (4) Aging, (5) The Joint
Committee on Consumer Credit and (6) The
Joint Committee on Divorce, and the current
intensive study being made by the Special
Committee on Science Policy. Such studies

SENATE DEBATES
and investigations in depth have been and
will continue to be the bases for sound constructive legislation. The Economic Council of
Canada recognized this in its Fifth Annual
Review which says at page 136:
"The Senate of Canada might consider
the advisability of creating a committee
to enquire into the problem of poverty in
Canada. An earlier Senate inquiry into
the problems of land use in Canada
helped to bring about the Agricultural
Rehabilitation and Development Act (ARDA) in 1961. The enquiry we propose
would deal with all aspects of poverty,
urban and rural. Many excellent witnesses, both Canadian and foreign, would
be available to appear before the committee, whose work could also be aided by a
small but competent research staff. The
work of such a committee could do much
to define and elucidate the problem of
poverty in Canada, and to build public
support for a more effective structure of
remedial measures."

triumphs of science and technology. It is an
experience of individuals and nations alike.
Our age, like all times of transition, is one of
unrest. The era we now live in reveals a
great deal of public discussion and considerable evidence of the danger of parliamentary
democracy deteriorating into an authoritarian
executive supported by a strong and
experienced bureaucracy, with Parliament
itself relegated to the role of a debating society. When the growing demands, increasing
complexity and almost instantaneous communication of problems presented to Governments are considered, these fears appear to
be not unreasonable.
12. To preserve the vital democratic responsibility of examination and thorough
study in depth of legislation presented to Parliament, an impartial and independent
Senate, comprising the ablest talent which
can be attracted to it, is of paramount importance to our system and, consequently, to the
Canadian public. This emphasizes not only
the continuing and perhaps increasing need

Noveber28, 969SENATE

Such a chamber would be fitted for
much more than to be a merely moderating body. It would flot be exclusively a
check, but also an impelling force. In its
hands the power of holding the people
back would be vested i those most
competent, and who would generally be
most inclined, to lead them forward in
any right course. The coundil to whom
the task would be entrusted of rectifying
the people's mistakes would not represent
a class believed to be opposed to their
interest, but would consist of their own
natural leaders in the path of progress.
The best constitution of a Second Chamber is that which embodies the greatest
number of elements exempt from the
class interests and prejudices of the
mai ority, but having in themselves nothing offensive to democratic feeling."
14. In similar context it has frequently been
suggested that general participation by Senators in House of Commons caucuses, has not
proven helpful to Senators in the impartial
consideration of legislation in the Chamber. It
might be suggested that if the practice were
adopted of the Leader, JJeputy Leader, and
the WVhip, only, of each party, attending
caucus and then accepting the responsibility
of passing on to, their Members the informnation on policy and other matters, as necessary, it might preserve the political connection without affecting the impartiality of the
Senate. In order to weigh legislation i the
light of only what is best for the country, it
is obviously difficuit for members of the
Senate to be subject to the direction of the
saine person who leads their party in the
House of Commons.
15. A reform. that is within the competence
of the Goverrment of the day, and badly
needed to enable the Senate to serve a more
valuable and, it is submitted, its proper purpose i Parliament, is a change in the concept
of a "money bill". Debates and opinions on
this matter go back for some three hundred
years or more i parliamentary history, but
your Conimittee is convinced that a different
application of the definition is now needed,
and they believe that there are good grounds,
based on historical opinions, to exclude from
the definition of "money bil" a Bill introduced, not for the purpose of imposing taxation or for the purpose of spending public
funds, but for another purpose which has
only some consequential cost of administration or other very secondary financial aspect.

16. There are also conditions or requirements imposed in the past by statute which, ini
the modern world, may be anachronisms.
Among these worthy of re-examination are
the property requirements for appointment to
the Senate dating from an age of class distinctions and coloured by the character of
landowner of Members of the House of Lords
and, in particular, those applying to Senators
from Quebec; the time consun3ing and sometimes disruptive procedure for Royal Assent
in the Senate Chamber; the fact that deductions are made from the Sessional Allowance
for absences from the Chamber while no
credit is given for committee attendance even
during adjournments showing the lack of
recognition of the importance of Senators'
attendance at Committees both during the
session and adjourniments relative to sittings
in the Chaxnber.
17. In matters of procedure there is also
room for improvement in the performance of
the Senate. This has been suggested i part
by the proposed amendment in the number,
composition and functions of standing committees contained in the Third Report of your
Committee adopted by the Senate on November l9th. This basic restructuring of the
Standing Committees has reduced the number
of committees from 19 to 11, now strengthened and empowered to cali for persons,
papers, and records, whenever required, with
areas of direct concern such as foreign aif airs,
national finance, legal and constitutional
affairs, banking, trade and commerce, health,
welfare, science and transport and communications. In addition, bis of major public
interest should be considered in the Chamber
in the Committee of the Whole. Further, fromn
time to time, select committees of the Senate
should hold committee meetings in the Senate
Chamber itself. In this way the public would
have an opportunity to see the Senate performing what is undoubtedly one of its most
useful roles-the examination in depth of the
legislation submitted to it. This is suggested
with the thought of enabling more people to
appreciate where and how the Senate makes
its vital contribution in Parliament. Public
opinion properly informed would soon realize
that the debates which. are listened to, from
the Gallery ini the normal course of our sittings are those dealing with matters of principle only, and in no way encompass the ful
consideration and careful treatment given to
bills that come before our Chamber.
18. Your Committee also gave some consideration to the present status and functioning
of the Standing Joint Committees of the

SENATE DEBATES

Senate and House of Commons. The former
rules concerning such Committees were left
unchanged in the proposed new rules, since
neither the Committee nor the Senate, acting
unilaterally, could properly change them. It is
nevertheless considered that the status and
functioning of such Joint Committees should
be studied jointly by the two Houses with a
view to ensuring that any necessary changes
are made. In addition, your Committee considers that there is much doubt existing as to
the proper functioning of Special Joint Committees: there is no clear guide for example,
as to the procedure to be followed by such
Joint Committees, as to which House should
bear the expenses incurred, or as to whether
such expenses should be apportioned. A study
of these matters could be undertaken as part
of the joint study, recommended above, of the
Standing Joint Committees.
19. Experience dictates that parliamentary
reform should be undertaken only if wide
public demand for it is in evidence. There is
considerable evidence that there would be
public support for Senate reform. Your committee recognizes that this situation is partly
the result of lack of public knowledge and
understanding of the responsibilities and performance of the Senate, but acknowledges
that there is a substantial feeling among
Senators themselves that change is as essential here as it is in life itself.
20. Having examined and discussed at
length the root causes of its inability to render Senate procedures completely modern by
changes to the rules; being fully convinced of
the supreme importance of the parliamentary
process in the conduct of national affairs in
our democracy; being persuaded that a system devised 100 years ago and scarcely
modified since is no longer adequate to cope
with conditions of this age; and being of the
opinion that the Senate can and should participate to a greater degree in the ever
increasing load placed on Parliament, your
Committee in making its report therefore
recommends that the Senate instigate an
examination of the constitution of the Senate
with a view to recommending changes which
would enable it to carry out more fully the
purpose which was intended in making it one
of the three essential parts of Parliament.
21. This could be accomplished by introducing for debate in the Senate a motion setting
out the terms of reference of such a study,
which if adopted could be carried out by the
recently established Standing Committee on
Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Such a
debate, ranging over all aspects of the Consti-

November 28, 1968

tution with regard to the Senate, would be
useful in developing recommendations which
would meet with public approval and set the
course for the Senate's second century.
22. In closing, the Chairman would like to
record the interest, co-operation and diligence
of the Law Clerk, the Chief Clerk of Committees, the Clerk of the Committee, the members
of the Committee and its Legal Counsel,
Mr. David Dehler. That it was able to complete its task in a reasonable time is due only
to those qualities so cheerfully apparent during its intense activity over these last weeks.
All which is respectfully submitted.
H. de M. Molson,
Chairman.

Explanatory Note:
This Rule is intended to eliminate all doubts concerning the printing of documents as
appendices to our Debates and Journals. This Rule would equally apply to documents that
may concern both Houses of Parliament.

101. No change.

101. Accounts and papers may be ordered
to be laid on the Table, and the Clerk
shall communicate to the senator having
the conduct of government business all
orders for papers made by the Senate;
and such papers when returned shall be

on or before the thirty-first day of May,
or if the Senate is not sitting within
fifteen days after the recommencement

disbursements, since the last audit, with
vouchers in support thereof.

Explanatory Note:
Redrafted to accord with modem practice since the Treasury Office and the Auditor General
both perform an audit on Senate accounts. It seems unnecessary to have this function
repeated by the Senate.

104. No change.

104. If for two consecutive Sessions of
Parliament, any senator has failed to
give his attendance in the Senate, it
shall be the duty of the Clerk to report

determined by the Senate. B. 109, 111.

have the following information that I should
like to give.

last.
Senator Davey has given notice that he will
move the appointment of a special committee
of the Senate to consider and report upon the
ownership and control of the major means of
mass public communication in Canada, and it
is hoped to proceed with this motion at that
time.
The Special Committee on Science Policy
will be holding meetings. I expect that the

selected and that perhaps an organization
meeting will be held during that week. It is
hoped that the Finance Committee will continue to examine the Estimates, and that
other standing committees will meet to deal
with whatever legislation is referred to them.
Some honourable senators may wonder why
we should meet on Monday evening rather
than on Tuesday evening. This is only to
accommodate a number of honourable senators who may wish to attend a function to be
held on the Tuesday evening. Our sitting on
Monday evening would mean that we would
not have to sit on Tuesday evening. In the
event that we are able to complete our work
before the end of the week, appropriate
action will be taken.

CUSTOMS TARIFF
BILL TO AMEND-FIRST READING

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill C-131, to amend
the Customs Tariff.
Bill read first time.
SECOND

READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. Saller A. Hayden, with leave of the
Senate, moved the second reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, Bill C-131
looks like an extremely formidable document.
In the form in which it comes before us, it
consists of 127 pages. So that you will not be
unduly disturbed, I hasten to add that I do
not intend discussing all the various items
and tariff changes contained in the bill and its
schedules. I will point out the main features
and the principles involved, and the effect of
all these changes.
I should tell you that the main purpose of
the bill is to implement and to give statutory
sanction to the tariff reductions that were
agreed to in the Kennedy Round of negotiations, to which Canada was a party, and to the
trade agreements resulting from those
negotiations. All the leading industrial and
trading nations and many of the smaller
developing nations were at Geneva during the
course of these negotiations, and the agreements were signed at Ottawa on June 30,
1967. In ardition to the agreements to which

December 9, 1968

I have referred, there are some consequential
or housekeeping changes to which I will
casually refer towards the end of my remarks.
Bill C-131 contains three sets of budget
resolutions. These were tabled by the Minister of Finance in the last session of Parliament, so they have been around for a period
of time. The first set was part of the budget
speech presented to the other place on June 1,
1967, and involved for the most part housekeeping tariff amendments, appearing in
Resolutions 1, 2 and 3 on page 4 ta 8 of the
resolutions appended to the budget debate
contained in Hansard of October 22, 1968. The
second set was tabled on November 6, 1967
and largely implemented the commitment
that Canada made, other than those relating
to chemicals and plastics. The rates therein
came into effect on a provisional basis on
January 1, 1968. These resolutions arising
under the Kennedy Round agreements were
subsequently submitted ta a Commons committee. After consideration of these resolutions, the committee reported to the Commons that favourable action should be considered in relation to the resolutions. In addition, these resolutions were printed in a
White Paper entitled "Canadian
Tariff
Concessions agreed to in the Kennedy Round
Negotiations under the General Agreement of
Tariffs and Trade", dated June 7, 1967.
The third set of resolutions incorporated in
this bill were contained in a budget speech
delivered on November 30, 1967 and dealt
mainly with rates of duty and excise on
spirits, beer and ale. The White Paper was
tabled in the Senate, and it contained all of
these resolutions implementing the agreement
arrived at in Geneva on October 31, 1967. By
a resolution of the Senate on December 6,
1967, the Standing Committee on Finance was
authorized to examine and report on the
Canadian tariff concessions contained in that
White Paper. The committee heard witnesses
on December 14, 1967 and February 15, 1968.
As I stated earlier, the rates of duty set out
in these resolutions came into force on a
provisional basis on January 1, 1968. However, Parliament was dissolved before these
changes could be enacted into law. Accordingly, an order in council was passed on
April 25, 1968, under the authority of section
22 of the Financial Administration Act, continuing in effect the proposed reductions in
duty. It was announced also at that time, by
the then minister, that collections of the
increase in duties proposed on some imported
products were being suspended; but when

Decemnber 9, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

these provisions were passed, he warned, the
legislation would make the reductions and
increases effective from the dates originally
proposed.
Honourable senators, as the next step, the
only new matter contained in Bill C-131 is the
set of resolutions which you find in the Budget Speech of October 22, 1968, contained in
Schedule D to this bill, and which is entitled
"Chemicals and Plastics". This is to be found
in Group XII, starting at page 103. If you are
in a reading mood, you can continue to read
about chemicals and plastics, and the rates of
duty in connection therewith and the exceptions thereto, from pages 103 to 125 of the
bill. I do not even wish you to assume that I
have read each and every one of those, but I
have read some of the important exceptions.
These rates of duty on chemicals and plastics
arose by reason of recommendations made by
the Tariff Board in their Reference 120,
which was tabled in the House of Commons
in June 1966. Canada undertook, in the Kennedy Round negotiations, to introduce the
concessions not later than July 1, 1968.
However, as I explained before, it was not
possible to implement this undertaking by
that date. Our trading partners, mainly the
United States, entered into an agreement in
relation to these chemicals and plastics as to
reductions in duty on a number of the items
in the then tariff-and labelled under their
description as they appeared in the existing
tariffs of that time-for a period from July 1
to December 31, 1968. Therefore, the critical
date-if we are to keep the undertaking
which we made at Geneva-for enacting
these provisions and passing them into law,
would be December 31, 1968, so as to make
them effective on January 1, 1969.
Now, there are not many changes. There is
a change in approach as between what the
Tariff Board recommended and what is incorporated in these resolutions and in the items
in Schedule D dealing with these different
goods, but the purpose of the change was
really to permit more flexibility. May I point
out what it is? The Tariff Board had, in relation to the chemicals and plastics tariff,
recommended the adoption of the so-called
"Brussels Nomenclature" used by all the
major trading nations, other than the United
States, in relation to these two products.
I was not aware what the Brussels Nomenclature was until I read and became informed
that it is a system which is recognized
administratively and followed uniformly for
classifying goods in headings which are

grouped into chapters and sections. That
grouping also has the rules and notes defining
the scope and priority of the various headings. If you wish to see what I mean by that,
you can, for example, look at page 103 of
Schedule D in this bill. You will see there
Group XII and Chapter 915. Then, as is generally the case, there is a heading giving the
products to be dealt with as to rates under
that heading.
Secondly, the Tariff Board recommended a
long list of chemicals, produced in Canada
and identified by names, with the rates of
duties of 10 per cent under the British Preferential Tariff and 15 per cent under the
Most-Favoured-Nation Tariff. On residual
tariff items, that is, items not produced in
Canada, the board's recommendation was
"free" under the British Preferential Tariff
and 15 per cent under the Most-FavouredNation Tariffs.
After representations had been made by
the industry and a full study had been made
of the Tariff Board recommendations, the
Government, as you will see in the material
which we have before us in Schedule D,
varied the board's recommendations as to
rates. It has incorporated a more flexible
basis of rates in line with the present tariff
flexibility. As I have indicated, this part of
the rate structure dealing with chemicals and
plastics is in Schedule D.
This proposes a 10 per cent rate under the
British Preferential Tariff on certain items in
the chemical section. This is the change, with
authority to the Governor in Council under
section 2 of this bill, which adds a new section 1OA to the Customs Tariff, to lower or
remove this duty from time to time. This
method considerably shortens the items to be
set out in the schedule.
If you look at section 10A as enacted by
section 2 of the bill, you will see that
Group XII refers to chapters 915, 928, and
929, which deal with chemicals, and chapter
939 which deals with plastics. Perhaps I
should explain the manner in which the
Brussels Nomenclature is used with the rules
and explanatory notes and all these things
incorporated in the actual structure of the
tariff rates. Clause 4 of Bill C-131 provides a
new clause 15A. We have provided for the
Governor in Council by regulation to give the
direction and guidance on the matter of rules,
etc. The new clause 15A provides as follows:
The Governor in Council, on the
recommendation of the Minister, may
from time to time by regulation prescribe

SENATE DEBATES
rules for, and explanatory notes to assist
in resolving conflicts or doubts respecting, the interpretation of the several descriptions of goods in Group XII of
Schedule A, set forth under the group
designation "Products of the Chemical,
Plastics and Allied Industries".
Subsection 2 of the new section 15A reads:
In the formulation of the rules and
explanatory notes to be prescribed by the
Governor in Council pursuant to subsection (1), the Governor in Council shall be
guided, as nearly as may be, by the
Nomenclature for the Classification of
Goods in Customs Tariffs published by
the Customs Co-operation Council in
Brussels (commonly known as the
"Brussels Nomenclature"), including the
rules for the interpretation of the said
Nomenclature, the section and chapter
notes and the headings, and the Explanatory Notes to the Brussels Nomenclature published by the said Council, as
amended from time to time.
So the method has been adopted-and
it is certainly very flexible-that the regulations by the Governor in Council on the
recommendation of the minister will provide
these rules and explanatory notes for the
interpreting of the sections and resolving any
conflict that might develop. This is a more
flexible way than having these items written
into the Customs Tariff so that we would
require further legislation in order to vary
them.
Now, as to plastics, the same board recommended a progressive rate from resins to the
more fabricated forms, and the rates
proposed for goods that should be dutiable
because they were competitive with Canadian-made plastics, and residual items to be
generally free of duty. It was important to be
in a position so far as the Canadian authorities were concerned, and this was their thinking, to provide free entry where circumstances warranted it, and higher rates on
residual items other than those which the
board recommended as being free of duty.
Authority is given to the Governor in Council
to waive, reduce or restore the duties, and
also providing the conditions and the
period, et cetera.
There were some other changes, as against
the board
recommendation,
that were
proposed to meet changing conditions not
foreseen by the board at the time it conduct-

December 9, 1968

ed its hearings and wrote its report. These
you will find in section 2 of the bill, in new
paragraph 10A of the Customs Tariff Act.
As to one item, polyethylene, one of the
resins, the board recommended certain rates
of duty on imports. Strong representations
were made to the minister that the rates
recommended were not sufficiently high, but
the minister did not feel that he could accept
the representations of the industry, in the
face of the recommendation of the board,
without further examination. Accordingly, he
referred back to the Tariff Board, with a
fixed date for the hearing early in 1969, this
question: What changes, if any, have
occurred in the position of the Canadian
industry using polyethylene as against the
conditions that existed at the time the Board
conducted its hearing and made its report;
and are those changes of a nature which
would warrant the change and support the
position of the industry which has claimed
that it is entitled to some higher measure of
protection?
Having said that, may I move ahead into
the next aspect, namely, the coming into
force of the various portions of these rates of
duty as agreed to in the Kennedy Round
negotiations.

Hon. Mr. Lang: May I ask for some
clarification? I take it, from my honourable
colleague's remarks, that the chemicals and
plastics items in the tariff schedule are being
treated differently from the other items in
that schedule, and differently from those
agreed upon in the Kennedy Round. Could
the honourable senator explain why the plastics and chemicals items are being picked out
for different treatment?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I would expect it is the
state of the industry in Canada as compared
to the position of the industry in the United
States, which is the major exporter of these
products to Canada.
When my friend suggests there has been a
change in the rates from those agreed upon in
the Kennedy Round, as far as my knowledge
takes me, having read all this material, I
cannot accept that there has been a change as
between what is reflected in Schedule D and
what was agreed to at Geneva. There may be
some changes as between what the Tariff
Board recommended and what is contained in
this Schedule D.
I was about to speak about the staging. By
"staging" I mean the timing, as to when these

December 9, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

various groupings would come into force; that
is, Canada had to take its position and make
the reductions in duty it had agreed to.
As to some of them, the first stage where
there was a full reduction of the amount of
duty that had been agreed to by Canada as a
concession in its agreement with the other
trading countries, full reduction was granted
at once-that is, on January 1, 1968-in relation to tropical products, because this was
recognized as being of considerable benefit to
developing countries and, secondly, there was
little in the way of competition in Canada to
be harmed by this. I shall have something to
say about the "machinery" part of this later.
In the second group you have chemicals
and plastics which have a starting date now
of January 1, 1969. The reductions on all the
other items that were agreed to are stated to
reach a maximum reduction over a period of
four years, which makes five stages starting
on January 1, 1968 and going through until
January 1, 1972.
I point out that I say they will come into
effect in approximately equal steps each year.
Yau may find a few variations, so do not
check me for having made such a general
statement. Where fluctuations result it will be
noted that the figures have been rounded out,
and there are a few places in which this
general rule has not been followed. For
instance, there are 15 items relating to machinery, in a basket item, where there was an
accelerated rate of reduction. In other words,
where the existing duty was higher than 20
per cent the acceleration was in relation to
the first reduction, which was down to 20 per
cent, and then you have your step by step
reduction of a half point per year until you
reach the effective and final maximum rate
agreed on, which will be 171 per cent. In
some cases if the rate were higher, there
were then corresponding reductions, but
always aiming ultimately at the end of the
staging to getting down to 17j per cent. I do
not think it is necessary for me to say anything more on that point.
I should point out that the conference
between the industrial trading nations at
Geneva was made possible by the action of
the then President of the United States, and
from whom the proceedings took their
name-the Kennedy Round of negotiations. It
started out originally by seeking a multilateral agreement that would proceed as far as
possible on the basis that all tariffs, and in
particular tariffs on manufactured goods

imported into the main trading nations,
would be cut by 50 per cent. The main trading nations are those included in the group
consisting of the United States, Britain, the
European Common Market, Japan, and the
EFTA countries of Western Europe. It was
recognized that it would not be appropriate
for Canada and some other countries to proceed on the basis of a general 50 per cent cut,
having regard to the structure of our trade. It
was agreed that we should offer selective
concessions equivalent in terms of their
impact on trade to those offered us by other
participants.
Canada adopted this selective item-by-item
approach rather than a 50 per cent linear
approach, for two reasons. The first is that a
large proportion of our export trade consists
of foodstuffs and raw materials on which
tariffs are generally low, but on which nontariff barriers may be important, whereas our
imports are largely semi-processed or fully
manufactured goods which are generally subject to higher rates of duty. For this reason a
linear 50 per cent eut in our tariff would have
resulted in a sharp increase in our imports
without any assurance of a comparable
increase in our exports. The second reason is
that we were able to make use of this selective approach to help the rationalizing of our
tariff structure.
May I be permitted an illustration at this
time. You will find in section 1 of this bill a
definition of "wire", and later in the bill
provisions in relation to wire. These provisions are the result of a Tariff Board study
and recommendation in which the board rewrote these items, and many reductions were
involved. Of course, our people, as you may
be sure, are good traders. Even though the
Tariff Board had recommended these reductions, when our people went to Geneva they
used these reductions, which they were
already thinking of in terms of the Tariff
Board's recommendation, as a quid pro quo
for something they were asking of the other
people. This is good business and good
trading.
I can cite another example of this, but with
a different connotation. For instance, there is
an item in the Customs Tariff concerning aircraft of a class or kind not made in Canada,
and there is a most-favoured-nation rate of
duty of 15 per cent. As honourable senators
will recall, consistently every two years we
have had a bill before us, and which has been
passed, under which those duties were sus-

SENATE DEBATES
pended for two years. In our negotiations, as
can be seen from the schedules here, we have
agreed-and we have received some consideration for so agreeing-to reduce that rate of
15 per cent to 7½ per cent. I think the present
legislation runs out at the end of 1969, but at
whatever time it runs out I am sure Parliament will be in the mood, having regard to
the fact that the aircraft they are thinking of
are of a class or kind not made in Canada,
and which may never in the foreseeable
future be made in Canada, to pass legislation
suspending the application of this item for
another two years. However, in the meantime
it was available as a concession with which
we could trade. But, on the other hand, I
would expect the people on the other side
were smart, and they had their own methods
for gaining some point that they wanted to
gain, and one may have balanced out the
other. At least, it served our purposes and
provided material by which we could do some
trading that was beneficial to Canada.
Hon. Mr. Walker: Were those recommendations available to the other side or were they
kept secret?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: May I check that? I
think the recommendations had been made
previously, but I am not sure. I do have that
information somewhere.
I should point out that when you are a
distance from avenues of information in
Ottawa, or Washington, or London you are
not as familiar in your understanding of what
these things mean. Although the Tariff Board
had recommended changes in the rates of
duty, it did not necessarily follow that it was
Government policy to implement those
changes. It was stil a matter of trading.
I should tell you too that the agreement
which emerged has been correctly described
as the most far-reaching pact ever negotiated
to reduce barriers to international trade.
Some 50 countries, accounting for over 75 per
cent of total world trade, participated, and
about $40 billion of trade annually will be
favourably affected by the results. The tariff
reductions made by Canada cover about $2.5
billion worth of 1966 imports, and on these
imports the average incidence of tariff is
being cut by about 25 per cent. Reductions
will be found in virtually every sector of the
Canadian tariff. However, in certain difficult
areas-for example, textiles and footwearthe reductions are not very great. The situation at present in respect of footwear is diffi-

December 9. 1968

cult in Canada, and the eut is from 27à per
cent to 25 per cent.
The Kennedy Round also provided us, as I
indicated earlier, with the opportunity of
rationalizing the structure of our Customs
Tariff. Excessively high rates are being scaled
down so that by 1972 rates of duty higher
than 20 per cent ad valorem will be exceptional, apart from those on a few items such
as textiles and footwear. When the Kennedy
Round results are fully implemented, as
proposed in Bill C-131, Canada's rates of duty
on final manufacturers will generally be in
the range of 17 per cent to 20 per cent,
compared with the pre-Kennedy rates of 221
per cent to 25 per cent. The rates on most
intermediate products-that is products in
various stages of manufacture-will range
downward from 15 per cent, compared with
the present rates of up to 221 per cent, and
most of the basic materials will be free, or
close to free.
I now come to the machinery item, which
received special consideration. This was an
item under which there was a full implementation of the agreement at one time. A broad
new tariff item was negotiated providing for
rates of 2j per cent British preferential and
15 per cent most-favoured-nation on most
machinery and related equipment. This item
replaces 18 tariff items which had rates ranging up to 22m per cent on machinery held to
be a "class or kind" made in Canada. The
new machinery item includes a provision for
the complete remission of the duty when the
machinery imported is determined to be not
available from production in Canada. The essence of the machinery tariff program is
expected
to contribute substantially to
improving the competitiveness of Canadian
secondary manufacturing.
In that connection I should tell you,
although perhaps I do not need to labour it,
that the volume of business generated in
imports under this item of machinery would
be of the order of $700 million a year. This
range of machinery does not cover such
things as mining machinery, agricultural
machinery and electrical equipment. However, there is language written in the bill at
page 55, so that even where there is a duty
provided in item 42700-1, while you have
machines, n.o.p and accessories with a rate of
British preferential of 21 per cent and the
most-favoured-nation tariff of 15 per cent,
you will find written into the tariff a provision
under which in certain circumstances there is
a remission program. It says:

December 9, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Except that in the case of the importation into Canada of any goods enumerated in this item, the Governor in Council
on the recommendation of the Minister of
Industry may, whenever he considers that
it is in the public interest and that the
goods are not available from production
in Canada, remit the duty specified in
this item applicable to the goods, and
subsections (2), (3), (4), (5) and (8) of section 22 of the Financial Administration
Act apply in the case of a remission
granted under this provision.
They have therefore provided for a very flexible administration of this item in the interests of Canadian manufacturers, who will be
able to get their machinery, particularly of
a "class or kind" not made in Canada, more
cheaply than under the existing situation.
Moving on, there are one or two items I
should tell you about. There is one to which
by now I suppose you have become so accustomed that you will not bemoan the situation
any longer. It has to do with the subject-matter contained under section 5 of the bill. This
deals with special duty on spirits, ale and
beer. While these were included in the budget
resolutions effective December 1, 1967 and
January 1, 1968, this gives statutory effect to
the provision. You will notice that in section 5
they create a new section 18, which is headed
"Special Duty". This deals with a special duty
of $1.25 per gallon on the strength of proof of
spirits, and four cents a gallon in the case of
beer, ale, porter and stout.
The explanation is a simple one. If you
read sections 18 and 19, which are created by
section 5 of the bill, you will see that it has
effect for one month, because for the month
of December the excise tax on domestic spirits,
beer and so on had been increased, and
that therefore increased the cost and the
excise tax did not apply to imported spirits
and beer. The concept was that they would
have a special duty of customs for that period of one month until they reached the common line of January 1, 1968. This item is
really to provide statutory authority so that
imported spirits, beer and ale will overall in
dollars bear the same levy as domestic spirits
and beer in that period. On January 1, 1968,
the situation corrects itself. If you look at the
appropriate provisions in the tariff you will
see that the customs duty on spirits has been
reduced from $1 to 50 cents, but you may not
have felt there was any difference in the ultimate purchase price you paid because the
29234-45

excise tax went up and the net result overall
was that you were paying as much in the way
of cost, even though the customs duty is separated to indicate that customs is a duty levied
on stuff coming in and the excise tax is something in the domestie field dealing with all
products, the imported as well as the
domestic.
There is an item on drawbacks, which you
will find in Schedules E, F and G. These
provide amendments to Schedule B of the act.
They are really consequential amendments.
They broaden the impact of the amount of
drawback to which you might be entitled in
relation to mining machinery, chemicals and
machinery used in the automotive industry.
The effect is beneficial; it simply broadens
the coverage of your entitlement to drawback.
I think maybe I have said as much as I
should without running the risk of wearying
you. I have not, as I undertook at the beginning of my remarks, gone into these three
volumes that contain all the information
about what every item does in every part of
every schedule attached to Bill C-131. I did
not tell you at the beginning, because you
might then have thought my statement that I
would not weary you with it was a sort of
threat, and if you did not pay strict attention
I would start reading them all. I had no such
intention.
In conclusion, I should like to say that the
financial press, the newspapers, the economic
consultants and advisors all seem to share a
common view at this time, that while there
may still be some uncertainties, we have got
through about a year of the operations of
these reductions under the Kennedy Round of
negotiations.
Despite some of the uncertainties which
you may not yet be able to fully calculate,
their consensus seems to be that there are
distinct benefits and opportunities already
apparent, and they say they are not only reflected in statistics showing that Canadian
exports have increased sharply in 1968, but in
the confidence and high expectations which
become apparent at this time of the year, and
which the Canadian business community generally is looking forward to in 1969.
Honourable senators, this is all I have to
say. In my view, unless the Senate wishes
otherwise, since this bill has new provisions
in relation to chemicals and plastics, it should
be reviewed in committee. True, all the other
provisions were studied in committee some
time ago, but I think it should go for this

you are dealing in the future, it seems a reasonable provision to protect all cases.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators,
may I make a comment leading to a question
to the sponsor of the bill, seeking clarification
of the effect of clause 4, the clause to which
Senator Leonard referred a moment ago.
In explaining the very broad provisions of
the bill, the honourable senator pointed out
that it gave great flexibility, using the term
"fiexibility of administration." We can all
understand the need for some flexibility in
this kind of bill.
I know that the sponsor has always shown
great concern for any undue extension of the
power of ministerial discretion. I note that, in
clause 4, by the addition of section 15A subsection 1 to the act as it stands, the minister
will now have power to "prescribe rules for,
and explanatory notes to assist in resolving
conflicts or doubts respecting, the interpretation of the several descriptions of goods . . ".
This is not in the usual form of granting
power to make regulations under an act. In
that form there is at least a suggestion of the
limitation, that it will be limited to the making of regulations intended only to give effect
to the act.
My question to the honourable senator is
this. Let me first say that I know that it is not
proper to ask him to interpret a statute, but I
think it is quite proper to ask him to indicate
the intended effect, the legal effect, of the
"explanatory notes" a minister may prescribe.
In particular I would ask, whom are they to
assist? Are they intended to assist the department, or the Tariff Board or the courts; and,
if so, what will be their binding legal effect?
To some extent this may be regarded as a
hypothetical question, but I am sure the
honourable senator has the answer.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I thank my honourable
friend for his high degree of confidence in my
judgment on this matter. However, I would
point out that there are certain guidelines
provided in subsection 2 within which the
Governor in Council must operate in determining from time to time by regulation what
the rules and explanatory notes should be "to
assist in resolving conflicts or doubts respecting interpretation".
We have that method all the time, I would
say, in connection with the ordinary adminis29234-451

tration of customs. The rules and bulletins
they issue are for the guidance of their own
inspectors and others who are administering
the customs, but it is al for the information
of the public who have to deal with this. It all
centers on the question of classification. You
are dealing with an import, something which
is coming into the country, and the question
is, how shall it be classified under the various
items in the tariff, under these headings of
chemicals and plastics? These are guidelines
by way of regulation and they must tie
in to the Brussels Nomenclature and into
the Explanatory Notes of the Brussels
Nomenclature.
I would conclude that if an importer were
concerned about the propriety of the regulation, as to whether it was not a proper regulation in the circumstances, le would have
his remedies which are provided under the
Customs Act by way of appeal.
We are not taking away any rights. We are
trying to assist in some orderly and expeditious treatment of these matters and telling
those concerned what dictionary they should
go to. If they do not read the dictionary
aright, the person who is hurt by it still has
his remedy.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: What would be the effect
if the rules or the explanatory notes were not
found to be within the guidelines of the
Brussels Nomenclature?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That depends on the
person who is affected. Some people accept
the situation rather than fight; others negotiate and bargain-and you would be surprised
what bargaining does. There is an old saying
that you get nothing unless you ask for it.
The ultimate, the end of the road, would be
litigation.
Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable
senators, I am sure we have al listened with
interest to the very informative explanation
of this bill given by Senator Hayden. And his
was not an easy task, for the bill deals with a
great many items. Indeed, I read somewhere
that Canada has reduced her tariff on over
1,500 items, and, while I have not counted
them, I can well believe this is so just judging from the size of the bill.
In these days when tariffs are reduced only
by negotiations, we no longer hear of the
great debates that took place in former days
as to whether or not any tariffs were justified.
We no longer hear of tariffs to provide protection for infant industries, of tariffs for revenue only, of tariffs to build up defence industries or to provide regional employment.

SENATE DEBATES
In the Kennedy Round of tariff negotiations
our tariff was reduced in order to have other
countries reduce their tariff on our goods.
There was hard bargaining, the negotiations
took a long time as they were conducted on a
commodity-by-commodity basis and not on
the basis of an across-the-board percentage
reduction. The deductions arrived at were for
the mutual benefit of the parties so that no
one country felt it had obtained an advantage
over another or had bested another country
in the results obtained. And as these reductions were made for the mutual advantage of
the countries concerned, each had to assess
the advantages against the disadvantages of
the action taken on the industries concerned
and those employed in such industries.
Generally speaking, the first reaction in
Canada to the agreements reducing the tariff
was favourable. They were announced in
June 1967, and I noticed one headline said,
"Round of Tariff Agreements seen as a great
opportunity for Canada." Another said,
"Canadian Consumers to gain but Ottawa
can't estimate how much"; yet another read,
"Changes give Canadian exporters a big
change to expand sales in U.S. Market".
I do not know if these results or any
of them have as yet been realized, because
newspapers are apt to exaggerate. So, I prefer the forecast or estimate given by the
Honourable Robert Winters, then Minister of
Trade and Commerce, before the Senate
Committee on Finance on February 15, 1968.
While he spoke at some length on the agreements, I would like to quote him in part. He
said this:
But, we were in a unique position, and
a position in which we may or may not
be able to find ourselves in another round
of negotiations. We shall not face this
again for a number of years, because
nobody is going into another round of
negotiations in a hurry. But, the fact of
the matter is that at this stage of our
development we got an exemption from
the linear approach to tariff cuts, and we
were able to negotiate on a more selective commodity by commodity basis, and
we made the biggest cuts in those areas
in which we can sustain them, namely, in
the field of primary products and, of
course, agricultural products, which we
produce best, and we were able to minimize our concessions in the field of
jnanufactured goods which is the area
where we must seek further development
in this country if we are to be a devel-

December 9, 1968

oped country in the true sense of the
word.
And further on he said:
So, what we have succeeded in doing as a
result of hard negotiation is to gain
access to the industrialized countries of
the world for a broad range of manufactured products, while keeping our concessions in these fields to a minimum. We
made our greatest concessions in the field
of primary products-those elements that
contribute to the cost of production-and
in certain areas where we knew the
imports would help our productive effort
and at the same time minimize the costs.
I have in mind particularly the field of
machine tools and machinery, where we
gave away a considerable package of
reductions.
He also spoke at some length on the efforts
made to obtain agreements for the sale of
wheat and about trade with the so-called
underdeveloped countries. I apologize for
quoting him at such length, honourable senators, but I have done so because I think he
placed the whole matter in a proper perspective and did not attempt to exaggerate the
benefits anticipated or the disadvantages
which could follow. Moreover, I think his
views are worth quoting, as he was generally
recognized as being very expert in this field.
Now, these tariff changes are to come into
effect over the next few years. However,
because many of them have been in effect
since January 1 last, it will be interesting to
know what has been the effect so far as one
would expect some effect would by now have
become apparent.
Of course, while we feel that tariff reductions among the great trading nations should
have a beneficial effect, I think we should
also remember there are other non-tariff hindrances to trade and these appear to be coming more frequently. A country may wish to
decrease its imports and increase its exports
to help cure a balance of payment problem,
and may use various methods to do so while
at the same time not making any tariff
changes or violating any tariff agreement.
Import quotas may be imposed, and some
indirect incentives given to exports. It may
make it difficult to obtain foreign exchange or
to send money out of the country. And we
know how one country may ask another to
impose limitations on its exports of certain
commodities for the sake of good trading
relations. Also, devaluation of a currency will

My last observation, and I thank you for
your kind attention, is to express my satisfaction at the manner in which this transaction
is being handled. For 20 years or thereabouts
I have protested when various departments of
government have brought us agreements,
dumped them on our table and asked us to
make them the law of the land, and left it to
the ordinary citizen to find out, if he could,
what part it played in the law of the land. I
have stated over and over again that the
proper way to deal with an international
treaty, which requires the consent of Parliament and requires being reduced into law, is
either to amend the acts already in force or to
pass a new act and thereby give parliamentary sanction to it. In this instance, honourable senators will realize that a number of
agreements have been made which in turn
have given rise to the necessity for certain
legislation. These requirements have been
extracted from the agreements, drawn up as
understandable law and brought before us for
enactment. That, honourable senators, is the
proper way to handle an agreement. If anybody is interested, financially or otherwise, in
this transaction he can now look through
these schedules and find out in the most concise language just how it will affect him and
his trade. That is the proper way.
In closing, I might say that I hope the
Income Tax Department will take notice, and
in future follow the system set out in the act
that is now before us.

NAVIGABLE WATERS PROTECTION ACT
BILL

TO AMEND-SECOND

READING

The Senate resumed from Thursday,
November 28, the adjourned debate on the
motion of the honourable Senator McElman
for the second reading of Bill S-19, to amend
the Navigable Waters Protection Act.
, Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable
senators, I do not propose to speak at any
length on this bill. Its provisions are familiar
to all of you, and the sponsor gave us a lucid
and detailed explanation of them. It is to
amend an act which has had very few amendments in recent times; indeed, the last
amendment was in 1956. So the amendments
proposed by this bill are designed to make a
few improvements in the act and to bring
some of its provisions up to date.
The general principle of the Navigable
Waters Protection Act is, of course, to prevent interference with navigation. You will
have noticed that under section 9 of the bill
the minister is given wide powers in order to
prevent or, if not to prevent, to remove
obstructions to navigation.

Just what constitutes an obstruction to
navigation is, I suppose, a matter of fact.
Some examples are set out in the bill and,
generally speaking, it would not be difficult to
determined and decide what is and what is
not obstructing navigation. I was wondering
if a ship or a barge which had been allowed
to sink at a wharf, or at or near the shore of
a harbour, would or could be called an
obstruction to navigation which should be
removed to protect navigeable waters.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: What about the Suez
Canal?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is a good example, but it does not come under our
jurisdiction.
Such old wrecks are unsightly in any event,
but I could not find anything in this bill by
means of which they might be classified as a
danger to navigation, as they are usually seen
sunk at private wharves or on private water
lots where other ships would not have the
right to go.
However, in order to satisfy myself on this
point and to see if by any chance they would
be considered to be in navigable waters, I
looked at the definition of "navigable water"
given in the proposed section 1A. There it
states that:
"navigable water" includes a canal and
any other body of water created or
altered as a result of the construction of
any work.
I would have expected that a canal would
have been recognized as navigable water, but
since it has been included in the definition in
this bill, there must have been some doubt
about it.
I then looked at the original act to see the
definition given there and, to my surprise, I
found it was not so defined. So, in order to
look a little further, I took advantage of the
excellent research facilities of our Parliamentary Library and asked them to obtain for me
a legal definition of "navigable water". They
did so promptly. However, that research
showed there does not appear to be a well
recognized, concise definition. Apparently, at
one time only waters where the tide ebbed
and flowed were recognized as navigable.
Another criterion was the capability of use by
the public for purposes of transportation and
commerce. If the body of water was capable,

712

SENATE DEBATES

in its natural state, of being used for purposes
of commerce, then it was navigable in fact.
Another opinion stated:
The question whether a river is navigable
or not seems to depend partly on its size
and the formation of its bed and partly
on the use to which it bas been put; if a
river will admit ships and has been used
for shipping purposes by the public, it is
a navigable river whether it is tidal or
non-tidal and whether it flows through or
over private land or land belonging to
the Crown. As a rule however an arm of
the sea or a tidal river with a broad and
deep channel is deemed navigable.
So, honourable senators, while all this
research was most interesting, it did not
resolve my problem which was to determine
whether anything could be done under the
act, or this amendment, about removing
unsightly wrecks sunk at private wharves or
in private water lots. So I have come to the
conclusion this cannot be done under this
legislation, though perhaps it could be under
some other act. I am strengthened in this
view by a definition given in a 1921 decision
in Alberta which stated that "navigable"
means navigable for boats of any character,
even for rafts of logs. The question whether a
river is navigable or not is one of fact. I
expect those who drafted the original act also
felt it was a question of fact, and did not
attempt to make a definition of the term.
Honourable senators, I do not see any
objection to this bill and, indeed, I do not see
any need for sending it to a committee, unless
the sponsor or some other honourable senator
would like it referred to a committee in order
that they may there examine some of the
details of it.
I thank you for your kind attention.
Motion agreed to, and bill read second
time.

COPYRIGHT ACT

BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

Hon. Earl W. Urquhari moved the second
reading of Bill S-20, to amend the Copyright
Act.
He said: Mr. Speaker, before proceeding
with my explanation of this bill I should like
to congratulate you upon your assuming the
position of Speaker of this chamber. Our
association goes back to the days when we
occupied positions other than those of today,
when you were the Minister of Public Works
for Canada, and I was the leader of my party
in Nova Scotia.
You are held in high esteem by all members of this house, and your appointment was
well received everywhere. We have confidence
in your ability, character, and leadership, and
we know that your term of office will be
filled with distinction and success.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Urquhart: Honourable senators, it
is my privilege to move second reading of
Bill S-20, to amend the Copyright Act.
Although the amendment appears small in
substance it is a matter of considerable
import, and its passing is of some urgency.
The bill is designed to remove fron the
Copyright Act the performing right that
record manufacturers now have in records or
any other devices by means of which sounds
are mechanically reproduced. The bill does
not interfere with the normal right which
record manufacturers now have of preventing
their records being copied by others.
Honourable senators are aware, of course,
of the important right that composers, authors and publishers have with respect to the
performing of their works in public. These
rights subsequently result in substantial
payments being made annually to these persons. In Canada to date two associations,
namely, the Composers, Authors and PublishREFERRED TO COMMITTEE

December 9, 1968

SENATE DEBATEE

tariffs on an annual basis, and different tariffs
are provided to allow users of the two repertoires of works held by CAPAC and BMI to
use such musical, dramatic or literary material depending upon the particular use.
Following the collection of the royalties, the
funds received are distributed to the various
composers, authors and publishers by means
of a complicated rating system devised to
reward the recipients for their creativity
depending upon how frequently works are
played on the air, or in public places to
which an entrance fee is charged.
As I have said, this has been the situation
in Canada up to the present time, and I think
I can truthfully say that it has operated satisfactorily from the point of view of both the
suppliers of the music and those who bring
about its performance.
There has, however, now been added to the
existing two performing rights societies a
third society set up by the Canadian record
manufacturers who claim copyright fees for
the right of public performance of their
records. This is a new performing right, additional to the right already legally recognized
authors and
in favour of composers,
publishers.
The Canadian record manufacturers have
now joined together to introduce a new performing rights society known as Sound
Recording Licences (SRL) Ltd., which is a
Canadian company incorporated on September 27, 1967. I call to the attention of honourable senators the fact that the object of this
company is:
to acquire, hold, exercise, supervise,
enforce, license, lease and generally deal
and grant or issue rights in or in respect
of copyrights, performing and similar
rights of every kind and nature, and to
collect, receive, recover and disburse and
otherwise acquire and dispose of royalties, fees, penalties and other payments
in connection therewith.
Honourable senators will wish to know how
such rights could in fact be acquired by the
record manufacturers who now in concert act
through Sound Recording Licences (SRL) Ltd.
The present meaning of "copyright" in all its
forms is contained in section 3 (1) of the
Copyright Act, Revised Statutes 1952, Chapter
55. To be brief, copyright in musical, literary
or dramatic works includes the right to publicly perform such works, and specifically the
right to communicate such musical, literary
or dramatic works by radio communication.
29234-46

You may well ask how a performance right in
records, tapes and similar contrivances exists
in addition to the performing rights of authors and composers, but this right definitely
comes about as a result of the wording of
section 4 (3) of the Copyright Act, which
reads as follows:
Copyright shall subsist for the term
hereinafter mentioned in records, perforated rolls, and other contrivances by
means of which sounds may be mechanically reproduced, in like manner as if
such contrivances were musical, literary
or dramatic works.
I wish to emphasize that the copyright subsisting in records and the like is
in
... like manner as if such contrivances
were musical, literary or dramatic works.
The result is that copyright in records is
brought back to fall within the definition of
section 3 (1) of the act, to which I have
already referred, and it is this section which
then grants the performing right in records
and similar contrivances.
I come now to the urgency that is attached
to this bill. On October 28, 1968, there was
filed with the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs, under whose jurisdiction the
Copyright Act is administrered, and strictly
in accordance with the procedure established
by the act, a statement of fees that Sound
Recording Licences (SRL) Ltd. proposed to
collect for the calender year 1969 in compensation for the issue or grant of licences for or
in respect of the public performance of its
records et cetera in Canada. In accordance
with the act the statement of fees or royalties
has been published in the Canada Gazette,
together with the other statements of fees
proposed to be charged in 1969 by the two
other performing rights societies, namely,
CAPAC and BMI. The act provides that, following publication of the statement of fees,
objections to the proposed fees may be filed,
following which hearings are held before the
Copyright Appeal Board, which board then
determines the appropriate fees to be charged
for the calendar year. Thus a situation has
been created where, if no legislation is enacted to deny a performing right in records and
similar devices, the Copyright Appeal Board
will be obliged to set and fix its tariffs for
Sound Recording Licences (SRL) Ltd. for
1969.
We have no way of knowing, of course,
what fees the Copywright Appeal Board will

SENATE DEBATES

fix should Sound Recording Licences (SRL)
Ltd. in fact appear before the board, but
undoubtedly a substantial amount of money
will be required to be paid out by broadcasting and radio stations throughout Canada to
meet these fees. The Canadian Broadcasting
Company, which derives its revenue solely
from the taxpayers, will, it is estimated, be
required to pay a levy of some $840,000 for
the 1969 year. It is tentatively estimated that
the total fees proposed to be collected from
private broadcasters and theatres etc., may
run as high as $3 milliion to $5 million each
year. Honourable senators, I wish emphatically to point out that these are new fees that
have never been levied before.
As honourable senators are aware, a study
of the Copyright Act in all its implications is
now being undertaken by the Economic
Council of Canada, and the Government is
strongly of the view that while this study is
being made, present rights now being exercised should not be taken away and new
rights should not be created or rights permitted to be exercised, especially when such
rights have never been used or taken advantage of in Canada before.
Perhaps I should mention at this point that
this particular right of performance in
records, which bas never been exercised
heretofore in Canada, bas been in our Copyright Act since 1921, having been copied from
a similar provision in the Imperial Copyright
Act of 1911. As I mentioned, just at the time
when the Economic Council of Canada is
reviewing the Copyright Act, the record
manufacturers seek to exert a right for the
first time in 47 years.
There is another cogent reason why the
Government feels obligated to deny a performing right in records, and that bas to do
with one of the recommendations of the Ilsley
Commission's Report on Copyright made in
1957. I would like to quote from page 77 of
that report:
The act restricted by the copyright in a
sound recording should be the making of
a record embodying the recording. At the
present time it would appear that an
unauthorized public performance of a
recording embodied in a record is an
infringement of the copyright in the
record. Probably the broadcasting of a
recording embodied in the record is also
an infringement. We recommend the abolition of a record manufacturer's performing right and broadcasting right in

December 9, 1968

records or in the recording embodied in
the record.
It is my understanding that the record
manufacturers now argue that since the Ilsley
Commission Report was written, substantial
changes within the record industry itself have
taken place which would now make the Ilsley
recommendation no longer valid. But I would
point out to honourable senators that,
although Sound Recording Licences (SRL)
Ltd. was incorporated almost 14 months ago,
it was not until three days prior to the deadline for the filing of tariffs for the 1969 calendar year under the provisions of the copyright Act that this came to the official attention of the Government. The Government
cannot treat lightly the serious recommendation on this matter made by the Ilsley Commission, namely, the abolition of the record
manufacturers' performing right. If the
record manufacturers seriously consider that
the recording industry bas changed to such a
substantial extent since the date of the Ilsley
Commission Report so as to make this particular recommendation no longer justified,
then surely Sound Recording Licences (SRL)
Ltd. should have presented this case to the
Government over the past year and not merely argued this at such a late date that no
attention could properly be directed to this
point.
It is only fair to say that Sound Recording
Licences (SRL) Ltd. has inferred that part of
the fees collected would be expended on
Canadian artists and performers in an
attempt to develop Canadian talent and truly
Canadian recordings. This, of course, could
only come about as the result of private
agreement, as the Copyright Appeal Board
bas no jurisdiction to set terms and
conditions.
Honourable senators should also be reminded that if this legislation is not enacted and
the copyright Appeal Board sets a tariff for
Sound Recording Licenses (SRL) Ltd. for the
year 1969, much of the fees collected would
eventually go abroad as the major record
manufacturers in Canada are subsidiaries of
foreign corporations. Indeed these moneys
would flow into the hands of manufacturers
who, in some instances, do not have a similar
right or claim in their own country against
their own broadcasters. For example, the protection given in the United States to phonograph records or tapes is limited to the right
to reproduce and distribute copies only; the
right of performance in phonograph records
or tapes is specifically denied to record manu-

December 9, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

facturers. Neither United States record manufacturers nor Canadian record manufacturers
have the right to claim for the performance
of a record in the United States by United
States broadcasters. On the other hand,
record manufacturers
in Canada under
Canadian law as it is at present, which fact
this bill will rectify, are entitled to claim for
the performance of their records in Canada.
The Government has strongly urged the
record manufacturers to withdraw their
application presently filed with the Copyright
Appeal Board, and it is understood that if
this is done the Government will not persist
in the passage of this amendment to the

29234-461

Copyright Act. The Government feels strongly, as I suggested earlier, that the Copyright
Act should in fact be left alone in its entirety
until a report from the Economic Council of
Canada is received for study. However, as
long as Sound Recording Licences (SRL) Ltd.
persists with its application to the Copyright
Appeal Board the Government is left with no
recourse but to urge the passage of this
amendment.

DEBATES

[Translation]
Honourable senators, as this is the first
opportunity I have to take the floor since the
beginning of the current session, I wish to
greet His Honour aur new Speaker. To him
wvho presides so well over our debates, I
wvish a complete success in his new duties.
I should also like to congratulate sincerely
our new Leader of the Government in the
Senate who brings to us extensive and priceless experience.
To both of them, my congratulations and
best wishes.
[En glish]
It is a pleasure for me to report to you
on the 56th Annual Meeting of the InterParliamentary Union held in Lima, Peru,
September 5 ta 13 of this year.
There were fourteen in aur delegation
which was ably and brilliantly headed by Mr.
Grant Deachman, M.P., Senators Thorvaldson, A. H. McDonald and myseif represented
this chamber. Messrs. Gordon Aiken, Gustave
Blouin, Yves Forest, Leonard Hopkins,
Gerard Laprise, Carl Legault, Barry Mather,
Georges Valde, Eugene Whelan, and Eldan
Woolliams represented the Hause of Commons. Mr. Gordon Dubray, Assistant Clerk of
the House of Commons, accompanied us as a
member of the Association of Secretaries
General of Parliaments, and Miss Jean
Macpherson acted as aur mast invaluable
secretary. Senator Thorvaldson, Mr. Deachman, Mr. Blouin, Mr. Woolliams and myself
were accompanied by aur wives.
Since Canada was host to the Interparliamentary Union in 1965, here in Ottawa, I
have had the honour and privilege of representing Canada on the Executive Committee of
the Union. This is the first time our country
has been so represented. The resuits of the
1965 conference were far-reaching, and contributed ta making the attending 60 member
nations fully aware of our large country, its
history, resources and oppartunities. It has
been for me a most rewarding experience.
Since its inceptian in 1889 in Europe, the
Inter-Parliamentary Union has grown ta
include 76 cauntries. Canada joined in 1900,
but permitted its membership ta lapse in
1927, and it was nat until 1960 at the Tokyo
meeting that aur affiliation was renewed. The
headquarters, secretariat and permanent staff
are situated in Geneva.
The Unian eleets a president for a terni of
three years, and an executive committee of
ten members for a terni of faur years. The

council cansists af two members from each
national group. The Union plays a mast significant role in warld politics, and contributes
ta unity of opinion among the divergent
nations of the world. Contacts between
members af different parliaments enhance the
prestige of democratic institutions. The Union
has made, and will continue ta make, important contributians ta world peace.
These details, hanourable senatars, might
seem superfiuaus ta you who have first-hand
knawledge of the Inter-Parliamentary Union,
but the more recently appointed senators
might be interested in the workings of this
international bady.
Accompanied by Mr. and Mrs. Deachman,
my wife and I left Montreal a few days ahead
of the rest of the delegation, as the Executive
Cammittee was to sit for twa days priar to
the general meetings. We also met for twa
days following adjournment of the conference. Althaugh we arrived in Lima at 2.30 in
the morning, aur Canadian ambassador ta
Peru, His Excellency Mr. Français Haude,
and his charming wife were at the airport ta
greet us personally and to assist us thraugh
immigration and custams. This great kindness
set the tone af aur visit to Lima and made us
feel at home immediately.
Some 63 countries attended the Lima conference, which was held in the Parliament
Building. Senatar Luis Alberto Sanchez,
chairman of the Peruvian group, was elected
President af the conference and greeted the
members. The President of the Congress, Mr.
Manuel Cox, and the President of Peru, Mr.,
Belaunde Terry, also welcomed the delegates.
The 1967 conference was scheduled to be
held in Moscow, following an official invitation accepted the previaus year. The Russians
had agreed, accarding ta custom, to invite
each and every member country of the Union,
but at the îast objected to inviting South
Korea. After a special meeting of the Executive Committee in Geneva, called for discussion of this matter, it was decided ta cancel
the 1967 conference.
The meetings this year were most significant in view of the world situation, and mare
especially because of the invasion of a member country, Czechoslavakîa, by other member countries. This created same sharp

and

economic and social problems before our
nation. It is also an obligation to work out,
with the representatives of other countries
which make up this shrinking world, equitable ways of reinforcing and protecting peace,
eliminating misery and antagonisms which
separate peoples. These goals are being
sought after with sincere purpose by most of
the members.
The debates of the meetings were held in
accordance with parliamentary procedure. It
was impossible to cover completely all of the
items on the agenda in view of the eagerness
of most of the members to convey their disapprobation of the Soviet and allied invasion
of Czechoslovakia. This slowed down proceedings considerably.
Al of the western delegations declared
themselves appalled at the anti-democratic
flouting of the right to auto-determination of
a neighbour and ally. Several members of our
delegation made most eloquent appeals to the
Eastern bloc, asking them as members of a
union of parliaments to voice, through their
own parliaments, their independent opinions
and ideas. This struck the assembly quite forcibly, and brought attention to the Canadian
delegation.
The two official languages of the Union are
French and English, although any other country which so desires may set up a system of
simultaneous translation, and all facilities are
provided. The Japanese, Spanish and Russian
groups are but a few of those who take
advantage of this privilege.
On the agenda of the conference there was
first a general debate, and then four draft resolutions were debated in plenary session, where
amendments were proposed and then sent to
the appropriate committees for study and
preparation of a final report. They were then
put to a vote at the end of the plenary
session.
The draft resolutions were as follows:
1. Concrete measures for ensuring, in particular at the parliamentary level, the
implementation of the United Nations declaration on the inadmissibility of intervention
in the domestic affairs of states and the protection of their independence and sovereignty.
2. Parliament's role in the elaboration and
control of national science policy.
3. Colonialism, neo-colonialism and new
forms of racial, religious, political and economic discrimination.

December 10, 1968

4. Methods of providing aid to developing
countries through stable prices for exported
products, development of primary industries
and effective financial assistance.
Peru is a most interesting country with a
population of 12 million, and Lima, the capital, with two million. We had many official
receptions, among which was a reception by
the now deposed President Belaunde Terry at
his most luxurious palace in the city square.
The Minister of External Affairs, the Mayor
of Lima, and our ambassador, Mr. Houde,
also gave brilliant receptions. There was, as
usual, a varied program for the ladies who
accompanied the delegates. What struck us
most forcibly in Peru was the great riches
next to the extreme poverty, most of the latter in straw "barriadas" in a circle around
the capital city.
I have copies, in French and English, of the
report of the Canadian delegation which I
table and ask leave to be printed in today's
Hansard. It may interest some honourable
senators, and it certainly gives more detail.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable senators, that this report be printed

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Mr. Flynn: It would be of interest if
the Chairman of the Rules Committee would
indicate how the Chairman of the Committee
of the Whole will proceed, now that it is
indicated that he may leave the Chair. Will it
be again in the entire discretion of the Hon.
the Speaker or of the Chairman of the
Committee?
Hon. Mr. Molson: I am not sure whether
that is a fair question, Mr. Chairman. Everything which occurs in this chamber is done by
the will of the Senate, with which His
Honour the Speaker always seems to concur.
I would think the change here merely indicates that, instead of its being obligatory, it is
now discretionary for him to leave the Chair
at a time which suits him and the members of
the chamber. That is why the word "may" is
added. The only other change is from "halfpast seven" to "eight o'clock". As all honourable senators know, when we rise in the afternoon we resume at 8 o'clock. This merely
makes the rule conform to the practice.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Mr.
Chairman, it seems to me that it is the
members of the Rules Committee who are
asking the questions, rather than Senators
who were not on the committee. In this case
there is a discretion because of the use of the
word "may", and it seems to me that the
discretion actually is the discretion of the
Speaker.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I doubt it.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa Wesi): Would
the Chairman of the Rules Committee comment upon whether or not, in the event that
His Honour the Speaker should decide to
adjourn at 6 o'clock and the Senate raised
objection, a vote or at least a concensus of
the house should be taken before the discretion is exercised.
Hon. Mr. Molson: Mr. Chairman, I do not
know if my opinion on this is of much value,
but I would reiterate that the Senate itself is
always the ultimate authority. I do not visualize the situation of the Speaker trying to
leave the Chair and the Senate being reluctant that he should. In the unlikely event of
that occurring, I would assume that the
Senate then would have to move that he not
now leave the Chair. Certainly the authority
is vested in the chamber and, as I said
before, the Speaker has always shown great
respect for its wishes.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: This puts it in the reverse
order. You have just shifted the onus .

because of course he could adjourn. We could
adjourn, with the consent of the Senate; we
could adjourn now. I think that some time by
some means a motion has to be put. It may be
that the only significant change is that we
adjourn until 8 o'clock instead of 7.30.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): As to the
practical working of this rule, I would ask
the Chairman of the Rules Committee to comment on the statement I make now. When 6
o'clock comes the Speaker or the chairman
may leave the Chair. If it is desired that he
should not, then I think the motion referred
to by Senator Flynn would be put, that the
Speaker, or the chairman, do not now leave
the Chair.
Hon. Mr. Molson: It has happened in the
past that the Senate has sat beyond 6 o'clock,
and on those occasions no special motion has
been put. In fact, on such an occasion the
Senate was out of order and should not have
been sitting, according to its own rules. This
was pointed out in committee as the reason
the word "may" was inserted in place of the
definite words "leaves the Chair".
Hon. Mr. Prowse: Mr. Chairman, as it now
stands, the difficulty is that the word "may"
presumably affects only the rights of the
Speaker or the chairman. If we have "shall",
then we have a proviso, and we can determine that either the Speaker or the chairman
has the right to make the decision as to what
he should do, or the house has the right. At
present this situation is unclear.
Suppose that at 6 o'clock the chairman or
the Speaker decides to leave and does so, the
sitting is then ended, even though we might
want to complete the business which we have
before us. If we are amending our rules and
making new rules, and trying to take care of
that kind of situation, or a situation that we
might reasonably anticipate, it seems to me
that it should be provided for in the rules.
One of the procedures by which this is
accomplished is that at six o'clock the Speaker stands and says, "Is it your wish that the
clock should now be stopped?" I think this is
provided for in Beauchesne, May and Bourinot and the various other authorities. If we
want to bring our rules up to date, I think
that should be included. This could be timesaving, since we usually have something to do
here.
May I therefore move, and I hope I will get

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Mr.
Chairman, the only reservation that members
-of the committee had was, I think, that on
that particular night some of the members of
the Opposition were not present. It was
intended to draw their attention to this paragraph (2). The motion "Shall the bill pass?" is
a debatable motion. I draw to the attention of
the Senate, and particularly of the Leader of
the Opposition-I think the chairman of the
committee would agree that I should-that on
a bill which is very contentious the Opposition has the right to further debate on "the
motion to pass." This further opportunity is
now being eliminated. I think in modern parliamentary practice it is appropriate that it
should be. It does not apply in the other
place. I think it is only appropriate, Mr.
Chairman-and I am sure the chairman of
the committee would agree-that this should
be drawn to the attention of the Leader of the
Opposition.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It is in accordance with
the practice instituted in the other place, that
there is only one motion for third reading and
passing. I was wondering if the intention was
that the question should be put "that the bill
be now read a third time and passed"?
Hon. Mr. Croll: No.

when the question is put as to whether the
bill shall pass.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I understand we are
retaining the question, that the bill shall pass.
Hon. Mr. Prowse: I understand, Mr. Chairman, that the situation now will be that when
a bill is read a third time, that is the end of
it, that third reading automatically completes
the process, and it is passed without further
question or comment.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No. You can still debate it
on third reading.
Hon. Mr. Prowse: I am speaking of when it
has passed third reading.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Then it is all right.
Hon. Mr. Prowse: What we have done in
the past is to take four kicks at the cat instead of three. Now we are simply saying that
when a bill comes up for third reading there
may be further debate depending upon how
senators feel about it, but once it has received
third reading, then without further comment
the bill automatically passes. Am I correct in
that?
Some Hon. Sena±ors: Yes.

Hon. Senators: Carried.
The Chairman: Shall rule 71-no changecarry?
Hon. Senators: Carried.
The Chairman: Shall rule 72-no changecarry?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: With regard to rule 72, the
chairman of the committee just asked leave to
sit in a seat other than his normal place. In
the other place it is only when the house is
sitting as such that a member is obliged to
sit at his own seat. In Committee of the
Whole this rule does not apply. I am wondering why we should maintain this rule for the
Committee of the Whole. Why should not any
other arrangement be permitted? As has been
indicated today, it is very convenient for the
chairman of the committee to be sitting in the
first row, while his usual seat may be in the
second or third row. I do not see why we
should keep this rule. It should be repealed.
Hon. Mr. Molson: Mr. Chairman, I do not
think Senator Flynn could have been present
at the particular sitting of the committee
when this rule was discussed. I do not think
there was keen feeling about it, but one of
the reasons given for retaining this rule was
that it is a great deal easier for the reporters,
for example, to follow senators when they are
not moving around and changing seats. It
makes matters much simpler if senators
remain in their own seats. They can always
ask for permission to move, as I did. I do not
think there was any keen feeling about this
rule, as I say, but if in Committee of the
Whole we stay in our places it would make
everything that much simpler.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I agree with the argument
that it may be helpful for the reporters, but if
those who are sitting at the ends of the chamber could come to the middle it would make
debate easier to carry on, particularly in
Committee of the Whole. I do not see why we
should retain this rule. Generally speaking, if
all senators were present they would stay in
their own seats, but if a certain number were
away then we might wish to organize ourselves differently. If I have a seconder, I will
move that this rule be repealed.
Hon. Mr. Bourget: I will second that
motion, and put forward another reason for
repealing this rule. Two senators who have a
special interest in a bill may wish to sit
together, and ask questions together. I agree

December 10, 1968:

with the honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Flynn). I would like to see this rule
repealed.
The Chairman: Is has been moved by Senator Flynn, seconded by Senator Bourget, that
rule 72 be repealed. Is the committee ready
for the question? Those content will say
''content".
Some Hon. Senators: Content.
The Chairman: Those non-content will say
"non-content".
Some Hon. Senators: Non content.
The Chairman: The motion is carried.
Shall rule 73 carry?
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Mr. Chairman, I wonder,
in view of the repeal of rule 72, whether it
will now be necessary to make another exception in rule 73. Perhaps I should address this
question to the chairman of the committee. In
other words, having repealed rule 72, are we
now bound by the other rule requiring senators to speak from their places. I do not know
the number of the rule, but it is my recollection that we have a rule to the effect that a
senator must speak from his place.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Yes, that is right.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: If rule 72 is repealed,
and rule 73 is left as it stands, then the general rule applying to the Senate will still
apply to Committee of the Whole.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: We shall just have to say
that rule 32 does not apply.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: What about a senator's
voting from his place? Yes, it is rule 32.
Hon. Mr. Molson: Rule 32 reads:
A senator desiring to speak in the
Senate shall rise in his place and
address himself to the rest of the
senators.
The same is true of calling the roll, and when
there is a standing vote. In committee of the
whole, if there is an attendance of 60 or more
and everybody moved around, that may not
make things easy either.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: My understanding of the
sense of the chamber in repealing rule 72 is
that a senator should be allowed to speak
from other than his usual place.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: In that case persons in
the gallery would not know who was speak-

SENATE DEBATES

I am raising this to point out that the
definition of "any pecuniary interest whatsoever" is not a black and white one. It seems
to be generally accepted that if, for example,
a senator were a shareholder in a large corporation with thousands of shareholders, this
would not be a pecuniary interest to him that
should disqualify him. On the other hand, if
he were a partner or a shareholder in a small
closely held company or a director in a company which had a bill before a committee, he
would be considered to have that interest.
I think the point that the committee was
making here, dealing with this rule, was that
if this pecuniary interest not held in common
with others did exist, that the senator should
withdraw from the sittings of that committee.
He should not sit on the matter referred to
the committee. I think this is the point. The
actual changes from what existed in the rule
book historically up to now is very slight. It
is only that it changes the words "in the
inquiry" to "in the matter referred". That
may not be a very good explanation, but I
think it is as good as my legal training will
permit.

this might be a most useful vehicle to these

rule 86B is one of the new rules which has
been added. Now these may be rules which
are somebody's interpretation of Bourinot or
Beauchesne or whatever rules they looked at,
and I know it has been the practice in some
areas to say that the report shall reflect merely the view of the majority of the members of
the committee. I submit that when we are
handing down a report and the report that is
published at public expense, and we say
"This is the report of the committee", and the
names of the people on the committee are
listed, the presumption in the mind of the
ordinary person is that it is a report which
has been concurred in by each and every
one of the persons whose names appear as
members of the committee.

are dealing here with what is to be done by

in the future, I suggest, with broadened responsibilities for those committees. Therefore,
I think that under rule 86B we will be serving the people of Canada, whom it is our
reponsibility to serve, much more usefully,
much more honestly and effectively by providing for the addition of minority opinions or
reservations to a report than by insisting that
the majority opinion only should be put in

and governmental structures of the host
country.
5. Participation by the Canadian Delegation
Not more than two representatives from a
delegation were permitted to speak to each
draft resolution put before the plenary sessions with a combined time ailotmnent of 15
minutes. Since only four draft resolutions
were on the agenda, not ail members of the

SENATE DEBATES
delegation were able to speak during the plenary sessions. At its first caucus the delegation selected eight representatives to speak on
behalf of Canada during the plenary sessions.
The roster of speakers on the agenda items
permitted the maximum participation of eight
speakers from the Canadian delegation. (Only
one other delegation achieved optimum
participation).
(a) General Debate and draft resolution
"Concrete Measures for ensuring, in particular at the Parliamentary level, the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on
the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the
Domestic Affairs of States and the Protection
of their Independence and Sovereignty."
Senator J.-M. Dessureault, a Member of the
Executive Committee of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, spoke on the opening day of the
Conference and Senator Dessureault noted
Canada's particular interest in Latin America
as evidenced by a contribution of forty million dollars to the Inter-American Development Bank for development programs in
Latin America. He also pointed out that the
special Canadian Ministerial Mission would
begin its visits to Latin American countries in
October, indicating Canada's desire to participate actvely in the progressive development
of the Southern Hemisphere.
The first draft Resolution placed before the
Conference was one related to "Concrete
measures for ensuring, in particular at the
parliamentary level, the implementation of
the United Nations declaration on the inadmissibility of intervention in the domestic
affairs of States and the protection of their
independence and sovereignty." Although a
delegation from Czechoslovakia was not present at the Conference, the debate focused on
the situation in that country. Grant Deachman, M.P., who spoke for the Canadian delegation, reminded participants of the strong
stand the Canadian Government had taken
against the intervention in Czechoslovakia's
domestic affairs by the invading foreign
forces and he asked the U.S.S.R. delegates to
take the example of parliamentarians in other
countries who had waged bitter and successful battles for parliamentary supremacy. Mr.
Deachman stated that "acts such as that committed against Czechoslovakia were not made
by nations in which parliaments and people
were supreme".
After a debate lasting for two days, the
draft, along with five proposed amendments,

December 10, 1968

was referred to the Committee on Political
Questions, International Security and Disarmarnent for detailed study and the drafting of
an amended resolution for submission to the
plenary body. Senator Dessureault, Messrs.
Deachman, Valade and Whelan, actively participated in the work of this Committee. In
addition to the above subject, the committee
considered a draft resolution on "The Rebirth
of Nazism and Racial Intolerance" submitted
by the Polish Group. Four amendments were
proposed, including one by Mr. Valade which
was adopted. Mr. Valade successfully convinced the committee that the resolution
should not be confined to racial intolerance
but should also incorporate religious intolerance as an equally virulent threat to human
rights and dignity. The committee also discussed and brought forward a resolution on
"The Events of Nigeria" which was adopted
by the Conference in plenary session. The
Committee voted in favour of the reaffiliation
of the National Group of the Republic of
Vietnam. Following this vote, the National
Groups from the Warsaw Pact countries and
from Mongolia walked out of the Conference.
The committee completed its functions by
recommending proposals for the 1969 work
program of the committee on Political Questions, International Security and Disarmament.
(b) Draft Resolution on "Parliament's Role in
the Elaboration and Control of National
Science Policy"
On behalf of the Canadian delegation, Mr.
Gordon Aiken, M.P., presented an amendment to the draft resolution to point out that
"Canada believed that parliaments had a responsibility to their people to ensure that
science policy did not become a tool for
political or military objectives at the expense
of human betterment". In support of Mr. Aiken's amendment, Mr. Leonard Hopkins, M.P.,
enlarged upon Canada's many achievements
in scientific research and concluded by saying
"if nations of the world today fail to develop
national science policies that emphasize the
dignity and worth of mankind, instead of
military might, then surviving peoples of the
world may very well be justified in condemning our age".
Following a morning's debate, the Canadian
amendment, along with two others, was then
sent to the Educational, Scientific and Cultural Committee for detailed study. The Canadian amendment was accepted unanimously and

December 10, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

was incorporated into the resolution adopted
by the Conference.
The Committee also agreed upon recommendations for its Work Program in 1969.
(c) Draft Resolution on "Colonialism, NeoColonialism and New Forms of Racial,
Economic
and
Political
Religious,
Discrimination"
While this draft was generally acceptable to
the delegation, it was felt that Canada's voice
should be heard during the plenary debate.
As first speaker, Mr. Eldon Woolliams, M.P.,
recommended "that to assure freedom to people within the boundaries of countries under
the domination of others a free vote be given
to them supervised by an International Commission". He went on to say that "because of
the recent aggression against Czechoslovakia
and other countries the veto power in the
U.N. Security Council should be reviewed."
Mr. Eugene Whelan, M.P., in his speech
emphasized that "Canada rejects the policy of
intervention by any country in the domestic
affairs of other sovereign states either by
force or other means."
Because four amendments were submitted
to the original draft resolution, all were sent
to the Committee on Non-Self-Governing Territories and Ethnic Questions. In addition to
Messrs. Woolliams and Whelan, the other
Canadian delegates to participate in the Committee's proceedings were Mr. Carl Legault,
M.P., and Mr. Gérard Laprise, M.P. The work
of the Committee resulted in the forging of a
resolution which was later adopted by the
Conference.

Senator G. S. Thorvaldson also spoke during this debate and stated "that, despite
been
about what had
disappointment
achieved at the recent UNCTAD meetings,
Canada was determined to continue her cooperation with others to solve the pressing
problem of inequality of economic standards".
The draft resolution and one proposed
amendment were referred to the Economic
and Social Committee. Mr. Legault worked
with Senator Thorvaldson and Mr. Forest
during the Committee stage where agreement
was reached on a resolution subsequently
adopted by the Conference.
The Committee also proposed a Work Program for 1969.
(e) The agenda for plenary debate did not
include an item falling within the direct purview of the Parliament and Juridical Committee but a spirited debate on a resolution
"Violation by the Greek Authorities of the
Citizens' Fundamental Rights and Liberties"
took place in the Committee. Canadian
delates who actively participated in these discussions were Senator A. H. McDonald and
Messrs. Blouin, Forest and Laprise.
The Committee also established its Work
Program for 1969.

Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the Domestic Affairs of
States and the Protection of their
Independence and Sovereignty

The Canadian delegation to the 1968 Spring
Meetings in Dakar took the initiative in having this subject put on the Conference agenda. Mr. Yves Forest, M.P., in his speech, suggested the solution to the problem would
require a profound change in the approach to
helping developing countries. He pointed out
that the population of the world could double
between now and the end of the century and
that an enormous increase in agricultural production would have to be attained in order to
provide an adequate level of consumption
throughout the world.

Control of National Science Policy
The 56th Inter-Parliamentary Conference,
coNSIDERING science to include not only
the basic study of natural laws but also the
application of this knowledge for mankind's
needs through development, technique and
technology,
NOTING the continually increasing importance of science in the life of all peoples and
its essential role in economic development,
Recognizing the necessity for every State to
set its own goals, to formulate and implement
a science policy in harmony with its own
national development and to help itself
towards the achievement of its goals.
Recognizing also the universal nature of
science, the imperative necessity for international co-operation in the different branches
of science and the mutual benefits to be
drived from world-wide co-operation in all
scientific fields,
Considering that the agreements reached in
the spheres of disarmament and restrictions
on nuclear weapons create favourable conditions for the future development of peaceful
forms of scientific and technical research,
Aware of efforts to promote national
science policy planning by Unesco, the Advisory Committee of the Economic and Social
Council of the United Nations on the Application of Science and Technology to Development, and other international organizations,
and of the advantages of strengthening the
relationship between the Inter-Parliamentary
Union and Unesco in this area as well as in
other fields of common interest,
Believing that it is the responsibility of
Parliaments to help formulate and control
national science policies and to ensure that
scientific advances are applied for the peaceful development of the national economy and
for social progress,

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. T. D'Arcy Leonard, Acting Chairman
of the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce, presented the following report:
The Standing Committee on Banking
and Commerce, having been authorized
on the 10th October, 1968, ta inquire into
and report upon existing legislation
regarding the census and statistics and
upon the administration of such legislation and recommend any changes in such
legislation and admnistration required ta
establish and develop the census and statistics as a vital and efficient aid ta the
good government of Canada and the
advancement of private business in the
public interest, and having considered
the terms of the inquiry so authorized, is
agreed that such inquiry should be
undertaken by a special committee of the
Senate ta be constituted for that purpose,
and sa recommends.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this report be taken into consideration.
Hon. Mr. Leonard moved that the report be
placed on the Orders of the Day for consideration on Tuesday next.

Hon. T. D'Arcy Leonard moved the third

Motion agreed ta and bill read third time

Hon. J. Harper Prowse: Honourable senators, I find myself in a position similar ta that
of Jacob, who wanted ta marry a young lady
but could not do so until her older sister had
been married off. I have been ready ta proceed on this matter for some time, and it is
better for all honourable senators that I am
able ta go on today because the longer I wait
the more arguments I think of. But let me
assure you, as I thought of new arguments I
abandoned some of the old. It is my hope that
I can deal with this subject perhaps more
effectively in a shorter period of time than
would have been possible had I been able ta
go on earlier.
The inquiry puts the emphasis on the position of the Senate with reference ta the British North America Act and the effect of the
amendment of section 91, amended in 1949,
and of section 53, which provides that money
bills must originate in the Commons.
Without implying any criticism of anyone
or, in particular, of Senator Hayden for the
way in which he presented his own case, I do
feel it is unfortunate that we got so involved
and intrigued with the very brilliantly
proposed legal arguments he presented ta us,
that we tended ta lose sight of the real purpose of this inquiry.
It seems ta me that the discussion falls into
two parts. One is the legal argument which
formed the basis for the conclusions Senator
Hayden outlined later. I assume from having
listened ta the debate that took place following that, and from my own reaction ta it, that
the real purpose was missed, because by the
time we got ta that we were so busy turning
over in our minds the rationale and the
implications of bis legal arguments that we
missed the purpose of the base that he was
laying.
In that regard, I hope that with the advantage that cames ta anyone with hindsightwhich is a surer and cheaper guide than,
though perhaps not as admirable as,
foresight-I can avoid the mistakes that may

752

SENATE DEBATES

appear to have been made. Let me then deal,
not with the legal arguments, although I will
come back to them in time, but specifically
with what is the basis of the proposal implied
in this inquiry, actually spelled out in the
later parts of the first speech by Senator Hayden, made very clear by Senator Flynn and
also referred to by Senators Fournier (De
Lanaudière) and Thorvaldson. First we must
realize that Senator Hayden was suggesting to
all parts of the Parliament of Canada and, in
particular, to the Government which has responsibility for legislation, a procedure or
device which he then set out to prove was
legally quite proper. Originally he asked
another question, but he said that this was
the basis upon which the speeding up of the
work of Parliament could be established.
I do not think anyone in this place, or in
the other place, or through any newspaper
column in the country, is going to quarrel
with the suggestion that in recent times Parliament has come in for much serious criticism. Whether that criticism was deserved is
not the point. The point is that criticisms
have been made and widely accepted, and
they are, generally, that the procedures in
Parliament are too cumbersome and slow to
enable this institution, upon which we depend
for the functioning of the democratic process,
to deal with the many complex problems with
which society is faced as speedily and effectively as is required in modern times. I do
not think there is any argument with that
statement. It is a statement that is accepted
as a matter of fact in most quarters. Parliament finds it increasingly difficult-not
because of any fundamental weakness in the
institution, but because of the increasing
complexity and number of things that it is
asked to deal with-to meet and deal with the
problems of the day in the time available to
it.
While the traditional procedures permit the
fullest possible expression of all points of
view, and the use of every device by the
Government to examine its position before it
proceeds, and that Parliament should look
twice at every action before it takes a step,
-this is all valuable and I do not think anybody suggests it should be abolished-in
view of the increasing workload, it results
in Parliament being subject to increasing and
sometimes irresponsible criticism which hurts
not just a party, or a government, or the
present members of Parliament, but the
whole institution. While we may have a certain interest in protecting ourselves from
criticism, I am sure all honourable senators

December 11, 1968

would rush more quickly to the defence of
the institution than they would to their own
defence. Criticism of ourselves does not matter. It is the criticism of the institution that is
important.
The fact of these increased demands on the
time of Parliament and its members is particularly important when we consider the
other place. Members of the other place are
being deprived of the opportunity of returning to and spending time with their constituents, and of maintaining the type of contact
that is desirable if they are to reflect in Parliament the wishes, desires, and thinking of
the people they have been elected to represent. This has resulted, not only in increased
criticism, but in a deep feeling of frustration
on the part of the elected representative. It is
difficult for him to get down to dealing
with things, because of the necessity of
being in his place to meet the challenges
to the Government, to listen to the debate, to
have time to read Hansard so as to examine
those parts of the debate which it was not
possible for him to hear in person, and to
deal with the demands from his constituency.
I say that it becomes not only increasingly
difficult, but impossible for him to keep
informed about what may be proper solutions
to the problems that are most pressing so that
he may be sure in his own mind that the
decisions he makes are sound, proper and in
the best interests of the country he hopes to
serve.
We in the Senate know something about
this frustration, because delays in the procedures have resulted not only in Parliament
suddenly getting a big backlog which they
have to rush through, but in it then tumbling
through to us important legislation, and we
are expected, in a scandalously short period
of time on occasions, to concur in matters
which might deserve long and serious consideration. Often the only reason we have agreed
to give that consent bas been because, with a
proper respect for the people of the country
whom it is our desire to serve, we did not
feel we were justified in withholding from
them the advantages expected to flow from
the legislation while we crossed the t's and
dotted the 's. At the same time, it has left us
with a deep feeling of frustration, and at
times a wondering whether we are in fact
discharging as we should in this chamber
the responsibilities we have sworn to
discharge.
The proposal Senator Hayden's inquiry has
implied, as expressly laid out in the later
part of his speech, is simply that we say to

may be that really what Senator Hayden had
in mmd was the principle in dealing with
legislation which acknowledges the supremacy of Parliament. That merely means that if
legislation is passed by both Houses of Parliament and is assented to by the Queen, and
someone then challenges it in the courts, they
can look only at the area of jurisdiction covered by the legislation. They cannot look at
the way in which we have exercised our responsibilities. The courts will not do that.
If anyone wishes to have the legal authority, I would cite the case of Edinburgh and
Dalkeith Ry. Co. v. Wauchope House of Lords
(1842) 8C1. & F., 710, a decision by Lord
Campbell of the House of Lords. In this case
the railway had been given certain rights by
a private act of Parliament in Great Britain,
and at a later date Parliament changed the
act. In changing the act they substantially
changed the position of Wauchope. Under the
new act he did not have nearly as large a
claim against the railway company as he had
before. He objected that the act was illegal
because he had not been given any notice of
the intention of the government to enact a
new act which would restrict his rights. The
Scottish court upheld him, and the case finally came to the House of Lords. I read their
judgment:
I cannot but express my surprise that
such a notion should ever have prevailed.
There is no foundation whatever for it.
All that a Court of Justice can do is to
look to the Parliament roll: if from that it
should appear that a bill has passed both
Houses and received the Royal Assent no
Court of Justice can enquire into the
mode in which it was introduced into
Parliament, nor into what was done
previous to its introduction, or what
passed in Parliament during its progress
in its various stages through both Houses.
I trust, therefore, that no such enquiry
will again be entered upon in any Court
in Scotland, but that due effect will be
given to every Act of Parliament...
Now, let us face the law. If you say you do
not care how you get to the results, if you say
you can hide behind the interpretation, if you
say you cannot look at it once it is done, if
you say that when Parliament accepted an
act from us they have waived their responsibility for dealing with it first, that when
the Queen assented to it she implicitly had
given us instructions to deal with it in the
first instance, or if you say you amended the

December 11, 1968

constitution-these are like asking how many
souls you can dance on the point of a needle.
One could keep lawyers busy forever on that,
and not settle a thing. This surely is what we
are interested in, in settling public business.
Honourable senators, there is one danger,
let me warn you. We come to the question of
whether when we exercise a delegated right,
that perhaps our principal has not delegated
but has abdicated his duty. This is implicit in
the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada
and, I think, of the Privy Council. The principle is good enough, anyway. In what is called
the Direct Legislation Act of the Province of
Alberta early in the 1920's the government
there then tried to import into the law of
Alberta a principle which had received some
public widespread support in the United
States, namely, the feeling that over and
above the legislature there should be a direct
appeal to the public. Then they enacted the
Direct Legislation Act. The title was somewhat more complicated, but that will do.
Under that act, if a specified number of
citizens in the province signed a petition asking that a certain measure be enacted, that
bill then had to be drawn up by the Government and presented to the public in the form
of a referendum, and if it passed it became
law without any interference by Parliament.
This was declared ultra vires of the province-although they were dealing with civil
rights and withîn the area of their jurisdiction-not on the grounds that they had
exceeded their jurisdiction, but that the Constitution imposed on the legislature of the
province the responsibility of dealing with
these things, and while they could delegate
their responsibility they could not ablicate
their responsibility.
There is a danger that we could run into a
situation where we are not dealing with a
delegation but where laws might be challenged on the ground that there was abdication. I say "might" because this is an area of
law in which there have been very few decisions. It arises very infrequently but it is
something for us to keep in mind, and the
last thing we want to do is to import uncertainty into the law.
Honourable senators, the conclusion I want
to make is this. First, let us make sure that
nobody misunderstands us. We are not suffering from an overblown sense of our own
importance, nor do we think that this house
could possibly have escaped an overflow from
the criticisms of parliamentary institutions

December 11, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

house, through che other place and in the
press, about speeding up the work of
Parliament.
Everybody now is for speed. There is a sort
of speed mania, and overnight on television
we hear those nylon-spun, so-called constitutional authorities mouthing and repeating
these crowd-begotten clichés about "bringing
Parliament into the twentieth century".
Honourable senators, you might as well say
that we should bring freedom into the twentieth century, because freedom is all that Parliament is about. Parliament is not a legislative mill: Parliament is not a production line
turning out statutes as General Motors turn
out motor cars. Parliament, basically, is a
place of accountability, a place to check the
Queen's estimates and to hold the executive
to account as to how it is carrying on the
business of the country.
I have met people in the last three or four
weeks who said, "Why doesn't Parliament get
on with the country's business?" And when
you ask them what business they are talking
about, they remind you that there are 20, 30,
40, or 50 bills awaiting introduction in the
other place. But, honourable senators, if you
look at those bills you will find that most of
them are of a minor character, and in the
case of 50 per cent of them it probably would
not matter a tinker's curse whether they were
ever introduced at all.
I repeat this: Speed, haste, seem to be the
governing motivation in the public mind
today. All speed and no control; all facts and
little knowledge; all information and no wisdom; all know-how and no know-why; all
signposts and no destination.
My honourable friend who has just taken
his seat spoke about getting on with the business of the nation by having government
bills introduced in this chamber. And Senator
Hayden the other day, with his considerable
mental muscle and his lucidity, argued the
same case. Honourable senators, if you are
going to have the Government introduce
legislation in this chamber, then this chamber
will lose entirely its historic character of

about this theme which runs through thi with Senator Flynn's saying the other day,

generally which have resulted from the failure, not only in Canada but in other countries
of the Western World, of democratically elected representatives to deal effectively and in
time with some of the important problems of
the day.
We do not wish to extend our powers,
because we know that one can only extend
powers by shortening or curtailing the powers
of somebody else. What we are doing is merely saying to the Government and to the House
of Commons: If you want to have the business of the country dispatched more effectively, we are sitting here cooling our heels
waiting for you to complete your process,
awaiting an opportunity to do something. We
suggest to you that you can make greater use
of the procedure which you have started to
use because we can introduce legislation
here, deal with complaints, receive proposals
and suggestions, examine witnesses, and
compile facts-all of which are necessary
to a sound decision. Let us do that, so that by
the time the Commons has to deal with legislation it will have available to it the information and the knowledge necessary to take a
sound decision. In addition, each house will
have the opportunity of reading the other
house's Hansard. I am sure this will enable
Parliament to discharge the workload in a
portion of the time that is presently required,
and thus to reach sounder judgments in a
shorter period of time.
The cabinet always retains its control over
what legislation is to go through the final
procedure to become law, or to be initiated
anywhere, for that matter. The other place
will always retain its final control as to
whether it wants to make available the
money required for a certain bill.
All we are saying is that nobody could lose
but there could be one important winner,
namely, the people of Canada, who expect so
much of their Parliament, and all of us hope
to be able to serve them to the best of our
ability.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

SENATE DEBATES

that if you are going to make the Senate a
pale carbon copy of the House of Commons, if
you are going to put it into competition with
the Commons in the way of having legislation
introduced here, you will destroy the whole
character of this house.
I have often thought since coming here that
there has been something of a lack of integrity, something of hypocrisy in what we say
about the Senate being a chamber of second
thought. Honourable senators, how can the
Senate be a place for second thought, a place
for the review of government legislation,
when the Government Leader who sits in the
seat opposite me is a member of the cabinet?
How can he give second thought to legislation
to which he was a party in the cabinet? This
is the kind of nonsense we have to listen to.
We also hear about the public frustration; the
public, we are told, is critical of Parliament.
Of course it is-and it is a good thing that it
is critical of Parliament. But the public has
always been critical of Parliament. I think it
was Charles Dickens who once said that Parliament was the only insane asylum run by
the inmates themselves. This is the kind of
criticism that has been levelled in Britain
against the Mother of Parliaments itself for
centuries.
Honourable senators, we should not think
we are above criticism. We should not worry
about criticism of the slowness of Parliament. I am not afraid of the slowness of
Parliament. I am afraid that all we are getting is too many laws on our statute books.
The job of this house is not to compete with
the House of Commons in putting more laws
on our statute books; its job is to see that bad
laws do not get on the statute books.
When my honourable friend spoke a
moment ago and said that the Senate has
been sitting here over the years with nothing
to do, he confessed that he has not read the
history of the Senate. This Senate over a
period of years has saved this country millions and millions of dollars by applying common sense and experience to government
legislation.
Furthermore,
honourable
senators,
I
believe-and I intend to say this if I am here
when Senator Molson's proposals come before
the house-it is nonsense to say that a man or
a woman who previously took part in the
political life of the country cannot be appointed
to this Senate. Surely these are the people
who should be appointed to this chamber.
Have they always been partisan in this

December 11, 196e

house? If you are to argue that only nonpartisans should be appointed to this chamber,
then you also have to argue that only nonpartisans should be appointed to the Supreme
Court of Canada. I have had the great privilege of knowing most of the men who have
served on the Supreme Court of Canada in
the last 25 years. They were former partisans.
I remember Sir Lyman Duff telling me how
as a young man he had campaigned for
Edward Blake. He was a philosophie Liberal,
there was no doubt about that, but does anyone suppose that he allowed his Liberal
philosophy to influence his judgments in the
Supreme Court of Canada? So should it be
with this house.
I remember Arthur Meighen telling me that
when he was Conservative Leader in this.
house he met up one day with Senator Dandurand, the great and distinguished man whos
was Government Leader, and Meighen said to
Dandurand, "I hope I will be a foeman
worthy of your steel." Dandurand replied,
"You are wrong on two counts; you are not
my foeman, and I am not worthy of your
steel." This is what Dandurand believed and
this is what Meighen believed. And over the
years that Arthur Meighen was the leader off
his party in this house he never once attended a Conservative party caucus. Why? Because he said he believed he should get the
legislation cold when it came to him. And
never once in all the years he was leader of
the party in this house did R. B. Bennett,
Conservative Leader in the other place, ask
Meighen to consult with him about legislation
coming to this house, because he understood
and Arthur Meighen understood, as Raoul
Dandurand understood what the Senate really
is about.
I have heard honourable senators in this
house, and I have regretted hearing it, say
how grateful they were to the Prime Minister
who appointed them. Well, honourable senators, I have never felt any gratitude to the
Prime Minister who appointed me. I did not
say, "You can have my conscience if you will
send me to the Senate." I believe, and I have
acted accordingly, that my job here is to
apply my Conservative philosophy to the consideration of the legislation coming to us in
this house, but accepting the Conservative
philosophy is to me a very different thing
from accepting the Conservative party line.
We are not here to accept the party line. We
can have our political beliefs, our political
creeds, our political philosophies, but our sole
responsibility is not to any party that

December 11, 1968

appointed us, nor is it to any Prime Minister
who appointed us; our sole responsibility here
is to the people of Canada.
I arn against ail this ta]k o! speeding up the
work of Parliarnent. As I said before, Pariament is not a place to speed up or to turn out
legîsiation as if it were a legislative miii. In
this Senate our sole task is to take legislation as it cornes to us and to appiy the best
eonscience, the best brains that we have, in
deciding what we should do about it.
I was delighted at some of the things mentioned in the report of the Rules Committee
under Senator Molson. I arn not going to deal
-with that report now because it is not before
the house, but I feel there is something more
-we should do. If this Senate is to be what the
Fathers o! Confederation intended it to be,
then it should eiect its own leader. If it is the
chamber that the Constitution set up, this
Senate shouid eleet its own Speaker. When it
does not do that, when the Government of the
,day appoints the Leader o! this house and
appoints the Speaker of this bouse, it is denying, it is violating, the principles upon which
this house is supposed ta rest.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I would
suggest to the honourable senator that as far
as Mr. Speaker is concerned, this la required
by the British North Arnerica Act.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary (Carleton): Then why is
it not done? You know perfectly weil that the
Speaker is norninated by the Governrnent of
the day, and elected accordingly.
I know what the Constitution and what the
Fathers of Confederation said about this
bouse. It was to be an independent body to
protect minorities. I doubt if it has done that.
But what this Senate should do above al
-else-and I say this to Senator Prowse-is to
protect this nation from the growing power o!
the Prime Minister and o! the executive; and,
more than that, to protect this nation from,
the ever-growing and awesome power o!
bureaucracy. That is what we should be
attending to, the danger cf power passing
entirely fromn Parliament.
You now have the President-elect of the
'United States wire-sounding the nation for
advice, and that, as bad as it la, is not so bad
in a country where they have not a parliament. But where you have the Prime Minlater
o! Canada telling the House cf Commons and
this chamber that ini the future he is gomng to
seek his advice and knowledge of what public
opinion la across Canada by special people
whom he wiil select throughout the country,

this, I say, is again a denial of the rights of
Parliarnent and a denial of the rights of this
bouse.
There can be littie doubt about this. The
real, growing power of Government in this
country no longer reposes with Parliarnent,
either in the other place or here. That power
reposes in the office of the Prime Minister, in
the office of the Privy Council and with the

Minister.
Now, to cap it ah, they suggest we have to
have an ornbudsman to look after the complaints of the citizenry. Honourable senators,
that is the work of Members of Parliament;
that is their responsibility. If that too is to be
taken away from thern and given to an
officiai, an ombudsman, we cniy add to the
bureaucracy; we have another subtraction
frorn what la left of the powers of
Paliament.
We have a sprawling empire of Crown
companies running a great percentage of the
business of this nation, with their estimates
and their expenditures hardly being checked
in Parliament at ail, because Parliament actualiy has flot the information or the knowiedge
with which to check them. Crown companies,
ombudsmen, speciai advisors to the Prime
Minister, here, there, and everywhere, the
growing and awesome power of the Prime
Minister himself-this is something that has
chailenged the fears and misgivings of people
ahl over the parliamentary world. Ail cf these
things have taken place, and yet we are now
saying to ourselves that this Senate should be
made into a paie carbon copy o! the House of
Commons; that it too shouid be introducing
Government legisiation-not our legisiation,
but Government legisiation shouid be introduced in this Senate, where we are supposed
to take a second look at Governrnent bis.
This, honourable senators, is ail contrary to
and barks at the whole spirit of Parliament.
What this house should be concerned with is
protection o! the powers, the prestige, the
authority cf Parliament itself. If they cannot
do it any other place, then let us try to do it
here.
I would neyer consent to a member o! the
Cabinet coming into this chamber and introducing legislation. I would neyer let hlm go
beyond the committee room, where we could
cail hirn before us, as we caîl any other citizen, and ask the need for or the rneaning o!

contrary to the whole spirit o! this chamber.

SENATE DEBATES
Honourable senators, I could say more, but
I will not. However, I would have been sorry
to have said less. Thank you for your
indulgence.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Roebuck, debate
adjourned.
OMBUDSMAN COMMITTEE
MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COMMITTEEDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Tuesday, October 15, the adjourned debate on the motion of
the honourable Senator Croll that the Senate
considers it desirable to establish at an early
date a committee of the Senate to be known
as the Ombudsman Committee.
Hon. Chesley W. Carter: Honourable senators, at the outset I should like to declare my
support for Senator Croll's motion that the
Senate set up an Ombudsman Committee.
While the scope of this committee would be
limited to matters within federal jurisdiction,
my experiences as a former Member of Parliament have convinced me that such a committee is absolutely essential. Without it, or
something like it, there can be no Just
Society.
I base that statement on cases of which I
have personal knowledge and which I shall
describe later on, but first I should like to
quote an extract from the newsletter of the
Union of National Defence Employees. This
publication is called "Circlet", and the edition
I refer to is No. 57, dated June 10, 1968.
Paragraph 9 of this newsletter is headed "If
it's unsafe, don't do it", and the article continues as follows:
The Public Service Commission has
just dismissed an appeal from an employee in another department who had
been declared incapable of performing
the duties of his position. The evidence
showed that the discharged employee had
reported for duty in 1964 and had suffered an injury on the job. As a result of
this, he had been absent from duty for
various lengthy periods of time.
According to the evidence, even when
on duty, the employee was unable, due to
his injury, to perform the full duties of
his position and currently had not been
able to report for nearly eight months.
The Department was not able to prove
that he would be unable to perform his
duties when he returned. However, it

December 11, 19689

contended that his absenteeism to date
had shown conclusively that it had sufficient grounds for discharge action.
The Public Service Commission Appeals Board considered that there was
sufficient evidence to indicate that the
employee was incapable of performing
the duties of his position, and that since
there was no production of medical evidence to indicate that he could return to
duty within a reasonable period of time,
and would again be in a position to perform all his regular duties, the department was justified in seeking to have him
released for incapacity. The evidence also
showed that there were no positions of
even a lower grade in the department to
which this employee could be reassigned. (How about other Departments?)
The moral of the story is if it is unsafe,
don't do it because if you get hurt, your
benevolent employer will discharge you
unless you happen to be in one of those
fortunate places where they have some
extra light work.
This, I think, illustrates one kind of case that
a Senate Ombudsman Committee might well
inquire into.
This man was injured while employed by a
federal department. His injuries prevented
him from discharging all his former duties,
and he was fired on the grounds that this
particular department had no lighter job for
him. Apparently no effort was made to find
suitable work for him with some other
department and, worse still, no acknowledgment is made of any obligation on the part of
the federal Government to do anything for
this man. Though his injury was incurred in
the service of a Government department,
since his usefulness to that department was
reduced they fired him.
When private enterprise exhibits that kind
of "man's inhumanity to man," there is a
great outcry about it, and we are justly
incensed. Governments are inclined to point
the finger. Should we not be equally incensed
when Government itself is the perpetrator?
A committee such as that envisaged in
Senator Croll's motion would enable any such
victim of injustice to have his case investigated and, hopefully, remedied.
Honourable senators, not long ago in the
debate on the motion for an Address in reply
of the Speech from the Throne several members of this bouse, including myself, referred
to the importance and worth of the individual
person as a created being. Has not the federal

Government, or every government for that
matter, an obligation flot only ta set an exampie as a model employer, but alsa to demonstrate the practical application of the moral
and spiritual values on wbich aur society is
founded? I believe the kind of committee described in Senator Croll's motion can contribute ta this end.
Honourable senators will note also that this
man's case was dealt with by an appeal board
of the Civil Service Commission, and that the
appeal board upbeld tbe department's attitude towards this man. My faith in civil service appeal boards was shattered long ago,
shortly after I became a Member of
Parliament.
One of my constituents, wbo was already a
senior representative of his department in a
part of my riding, entered a promotional contest for a position that had become vacant in
bis own departmnent. He was eminently
qualified for tbe promotion. He had a university degree, a variety of experience, and a
fairly long period of satisfactory service with
the department with which he was employed.
He bad a very pleasing personality and,
moreover, bie was a war veteran witb four or
five years of overseas service and was entitled ta veteran's preference. Only one thing
was wrong. The head of the provincial office
did not like him-possibly because he realized that my constituent's academic qualifications, persanality, and ability ta get along
witb people were far superior ta bis own.
Eventually my constituent learned that the
position had been filled by someone whose
qualifications, experience, and service were
far less than bis own, and, in fact, less than
that advertised in the competition. He then
appealed the decision. The Civil Service
Appeal Board sided with the department, and
that is where I came into the picture.
My constituent pravided me with all pertinent information, and I took the matter up
with the appeal board in an endeavour ta
find out how tbey operated in cases like this,
and an what basis they bad rejected bis
appeal and, at the same time, canfirmed the
appointment of a less qualified persan. I
found that the appeal board had made no
attempt at ail ta get at the true facts. They
simply accepted as gospel, without any question wbatsoever, every undocumented and
unsubstantiated statement made by the head
of the provincial office, while any statements
the man made on bis own bebaîf by way of
rebuttal were treated as lies, and even bis
documentary evidence was ignored.

It was easy ta see that tbe appeal board
was nothing but a rubber stamp for tbe
department and, tberefore, a farce. Tbe
appeal board's decision cancerning tbe case
described in "Circlet" indicates tbat notbing
much bas cbanged in 17 years.
Another case I know af is that of a young
man wbo was employed as second engineer
on a small boat operated in my province by a
federal department. One day, wbile the sbip
was at St. Jobn's, one of the big shots from
tbe provincial office came an board and
ordered this engineer ta pack up immediately
and take anotber job temporarily on land in a
comimunity some 200 miles away.
The engineer dîd nat refuse ta go, but he
besitated samewbat because it was bis
understanding, and rightly sa, tbat he sbauld
take orders only fromn the captain of bis sbip.
He did not know quite wbat ta say, but
because be did not jump ta bis feet at once,
click bis beels, and say "Aye, Aye, Sir"', be
was fired an tbe spot.
Han. Mr. Choquette: May I ask my bonourable friend a question? He is multiplying
cases and giving us a one-sided version only,
wbich apparently be always believes and
wbicb the otber side does nat. Is the Ombudsman Committee going ta, act in tbe same manner as my bonourable friend, and side with
tbe poor persecuted man? Will that be the
purpose of the Ombudsman Committee?
Hon. Mr. Carter: I wauld tbink tbe purpase
of tbe Omnbudsman Committee would be to
investigate tbese cases and get at the truth.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: And is it going ta be
always right?
Han. Mr. Carter: I do not knaw. I am not
saying that. It is not for me ta propbesy as
ta the actions of tbe Ombudsman Committee,
but I am citing cases of absolute injustice of
wbich I bave persanal knowledge. Tbat is
why I arn citing them. If 1 did not have
personal knowledge of them 1 wauld nat refer
ta tbem.
In any event, this young man was fired and
given no appartunity ta discuss the matter. I
am sorry ta say tbat the captain of the sbip
did nat; have guts enaugb ta figbt for his man
because be did not; want ta get i bad with
the bureaucratic "powers that be."
I took up this engineer's case with the
mmnister, who ordered that be be reinstated.
This was done after be bad lost mare than

federal bureaucrats in the provincial office

SENATE DEBATES
saw to it that he was put on another ship
instead of being reinstated in his former job.
In spite of tremendous handicaps, that
same man worked and studied and secured a
first-class engineer's certificate for marine
diesel operation, and later he studied navigation and acquired a master's coastwise ticket.
That in itself shows the kind of man he is,
but the federal bureaucrats in the provincial
office never forgave him for fighting to get
back his job. They were determined to get
him sooner or later.
There came a time many years later when
the ship, of which he was master, suffered
$200 damage, and he was charged with negligence. He offered to pay the $200 out of his
own pocket, but he was not given the chance.
He was fired after 24 years of good and faithful service, which meant that he lost not only
his job but his pension as well.
One of the unbelievable aspects of this case
is that under the guise of investigating claims
against the Crown, this man was tried by a
kangaroo court composed of officials from the
provincial office. There are two federal laws
which cover cases of this kind. One is the
Inquiries Act (Part ID, the other is the authority for conducting investigations into the
conduct of a federal employee, which at that
time was vested in the Civil Service Act.
Without the legal authority of either of these
acts, this kangaroo court subjected this man
to an inquiry and went so far as to take
statutory declarations under oath. By so doing
they committed an indictable offence-an
offence far more serious than that of the man
they were trying-but they themselves went
scot-free.
I know of another case where the person
concerned had been employed with a federal
department for over 20 years. Throughout
that whole period his services had been completely satisfactory. His ratings had been consistently good and he had been promoted up
to the position of storekeeper. Unfortunately,
although employed continuously for 20 years
he was still classed as a casual employee and
had no permanent status. In time the department closed down the station where he was
employed and he was out of a job. Although
he had given 20 years of good and faithful
service, this department could not or would
not give him another job, and after a while
he found employment with another federal
department, where he had to start again from
scratch in a job as janitor, which was quite a
downgrading from his former position in both

December 11, 1968

status and salary. Moreover, after proving
himself for 20 years he was again on probation. He found it very difficult to orient himself to his new environment and adjust himself to his new status and duties.
To make matters more difficult still, he was
beset with all sorts of trouble which came all
at once. There was a bereavement in his
family, another member of his family was
injured in a car accident and had to be hospitalized, and there were a number of other
domestic problems. The foreman under whom
he worked in his new job seems to have had
no sympathy or understanding at all. The evidence suggests that the foreman was determined to get rid of him one way or another.
When the time came to rate the employees
under him, the foreman gave this man a "C"
rating and asked him to sign it. With his
former department he had received mostly
"A" ratings, so never before having been
given a "C" rating he questioned it and
refused to sign, whereupon the foreman
immediately changed his rating down to "D"
and he was fired forthwith. Apparently had
he accepted the "C" rating he would have
been kept on until the probation period had
expired.
I tried to get this man reinstated but without success. I find that there is a tendency for
top civil servants to resent any intervention
by parliamentarians in cases like the ones I
have described. In fact, I have been told that
in many departments employees are discouraged from bringing their cases to the
attention of parliamentarians. In some departments it is actually forbidden. This is a fundamental human right and should be enshrined in the Civil Service Act and in a
Canadian Bill of Human Rights if we ever get
one.
Many federal employees suffer injustices in
silence. Threats of reprisals, spoken or
implied, make them afraid to have Parliament look into their grievances for fear it
might be held against them and might hinder
their chances of promotion or cause them
some other disadvantage. To have this sort of
sword of Damocles hanging over the "little
people" of the public service is incompatible
with a free and just society, and a Senate
Ombudsman Committee would go a long way
towards removing it.
These are all examples of what I call tyranny, and, as I have shown, in a large organization like the public service, composed of some
200,000 people, petty tyrants can be found at
practically all levels. No wonder there is such

December 11, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

an outcry against what is known as "The
Establishment". When injustices such as I
have described occur, the tendency is for the
higher echelons, from the deputy minister
down, to back up the person under him all
the way down the line, and I have found that
few ministers are prepared to do anything
that would make their top civil servants
appear to lose face.
So far I have mentioned cases of tyranny
arising mainly out the personalities of those
in authority, but there are other cases of tyranny which emanate from powers that are
enshrined in our laws, powers to make and to
enforce regulations. In theory Parliament
grants these powers to a minister of the
Crown. In practice, however, they are often
exercised by minor civil servants. I should
like to give one or two examples.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary (Carleton): Before my
honourable friend proceeds further, might I
ask him a question? I presume that all these
tyrannies he has been citing to us occurred in
Newfoundland. Did my honourable friend
ever think of drawing them to the attention
of Premier Smallwood, and if not, why not?
Hon. Mr. Carter: Because they were federal
matters and had nothing to do with the provincial government or with Premier Smallwood. This proposed Ombudsman Committee
relates to matters under federal jurisdiction.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary (Carleton): As I understood it, Mr. Smallwood had a lot of authority
with the federal Government and he might
have brought to its attention the fact that
these things were happening in the province,
under the auspices of the federal Government-his friends in Ottawa.
Hon. Mr. Carter: It was my job to do that.
I regarded it as part of my job as a representative of Newfoundland in the federal Parliament to bring these matters to the attention
of the federal authority, which is what I did.
I do not go to Premier Smallwood to fight my
battles.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: There is no tyranny under
Mr. Smallwood. No cases like that occur
under him.

minister of the Crown, but in practice they
are often exercised by minor civil servants.
I should like to give one or two examples.
Fisheries conservation is a federal responsibility. Fisheries regulations are made and
enforced by federal officials at the provincial
level. Some of these regulations are plain stupid. I remember one with respect to salmon
nets. Picture in your minds a straight piece of
shoreline with its little coves and indentations. This regulation selected a point on that
shoreline and decreed that east of that point
fishermen could use nets with 4-inch mesh,
but west of that point they had to use nets
with 5-inch mesh. In other words, two 41inch mesh nets could be set 100 feet apart
and one would be legal and the other illegal.
Fishermen's earnings are small and they
could not afford to scrap their 44-inch nets
to replace them with 5-inch nets. The capital
worth of these nets represented their lifetime
savings and in some cases that of their
father's savings as well.
In any case there would be no sense in
scrapping their nets even if they could afford
to replace them with the larger mesh, because
experience handed down from generation to
generation had taught them that a 5-inch net
would not catch any fish. So, having no other
choice, they continued using the same nets as
they had always used down through the
years, and one day along came the federal
patrol boat and the nets were confiscated.
Having no other means of earning a livelihood, these fishermen were forced to apply
for welfare.
I wrote numerous letters and memos about
this but I could not get the regulations
changed nor the nets returned. You may say,
"Well, it was necessary for conservation purposes." That is not the case because in that
very same area where the salmon fishermen's
nets were confiscated, other fishermen well
enough off to own and use cod traps caught
far more salmon than all the net fishermen
put together and the cod trap mesh was
smaller still, but it was all perfectly legal.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: The ombudsman could not
have changed the regulations.
Hon. Mr. Carter: I think at least he could
point out the stupidity of it.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: But we are talking about
an ombudsman; we are not talking about the
stupidity of the regulations.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Impossible.
Hon. Mr. Carter: The ombudsman would at

BUSINESS

OF THE SENATE

Honourable senators, before this question is
resolved, I assume that you would like me to
make a statement as to the agenda for next
week. In this respect, I wish to report as
follows.
When the Senate resumes on Tuesday next
we hope to have third reading of the supply
bill which is on the Order Paper for second
reading today.
We will continue the debate on the inquiry
by Senator Hayden, calling the attention of
the Senate to certain sections of the B.N.A.
Act, and on the motion by Senator Croll
regarding the establishment of an Ombudsman Committee.
The Fourth Report of the Special Committee on the Rules of the Senate will be considered, and I know there are a number of senators who wish to take part in the debate.
Bill S-21, to amend the Criminal Code, is
on the Order Paper for second reading, and
Senator Roebuck is ready to proceed with

that early next week. This is the Hate Propaganda Bill which was before the Senate last
session. At that session a special committee of
the Senate was appointed to deal with the
bill, and I understand the intention is to proceed in the same manner this session and
again appoint a special committee.
The Honourable Senator Thorvaldson will
resume the debate on the inquiry of Senator
Dessureault calling the attention of the Senate
to the Fifty-sixth General Conference of the
Inter-Parliamentary Union, held in Lima,
Peru, in September.
Senator Aird has given notice that on Tuesday next he will call the attention of the
Senate to the Fourteenth Annual Conference
of the North Atlantic Assembly held in
Brussels in November, and Senator MacKenzie has given notice that he will call the attention of the Senate to the Twenty-third
Meeting of the General Assembly of the United
Nations, which he attended in November.
The Committee on Transport and Communications will meet to consider and report
upon Bill S-19, to amend the Navigable
Waters Protection Act. We would like to pass
this bill and send it to the other house before
the adjournment.
It is expected that next week, possibly
quite late, we will receive from the other
house a bill respecting anti-dumping. There is
a deadline on this legislation arising out of a
treaty and it is hoped that it can be passed
before the adjournment. The Banking and
Commerce Committee now have before them
a White Paper on the subject matter of this
legislation. The committee is to meet again on
Wednesday of next week to continue consideration of this matter.
The Science Policy Committee will meet,
and the Finance Committee will continue
with its examination of the Estimates.
There will be divorce petitions, reports and
resolutions to be considered and adopted. In
addition, we expect to have another bill for
introduction in the Senate in the first
instance.
Also on the Order Paper for consideration
on Tuesday next is the report of the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce on the
inquiry authorized by the Senate on October
10, 1968, into existing legislation regarding the
census and statistics and the administration
of such legislation. As honourable senators
realize, this is indeed a very heavy program
of work for the coming week.

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators,
we are grateful to the Acting Leader of the
Government for putting before us what is on
the agenda for next week. It is indeed a
heavy agenda, but I would point out that
there are only two matters which are of any
real urgency. The first of these is the appropriation bill which is to be debated this afternoon and completed next week, and the antidumping legislation which will possibly
reach us next week. This measure could have
reached us this week if the proper decisions
had been taken in the other place. In any
event, I agree we have no other choice but to
meet again next week. May I further point
out that the circumstances would not have
required us to be here next week and we
could have done what was required urgently
this week if we had received this anti-dumping legislaton.
Motion agreed to.
BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACT
INITIATION OF LEGISLATION IN THE SENATEDEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the inquiry of the
honourable Senator Hayden, calling the attention of the Senate to section 53 and section 91
(as amended in 1949) of the British North
America Act, 1867, and the effect of such
sections on the initiation of legislation in the
Senate.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, it is always nice to be first on the
Orders of the Day, but I regret that I cannot
give you the entertainment that has been
extended to you in this debate, neither the
wonderful oratory of my friend Senator
Prowse nor the Irish poetry of my friend
across the way, Senator O'Leary (Carleton).
As a matter of fact, my program for today is
rather prosaic, because I hope to state just
the facts and draw what I think is the obvious conclusion.
Honourable senators, one wonders just
what was the purpose of Senator Hayden in
putting this item on the Order Paper. It calls
attention to the authority of Parliament,
under the British North America Act as
amended, to amend section 53 of that act to
permit the initiation of money bills in the
Senate. As a matter of law, I have no doubt
that Senator Hayden was correct in the conclusions he drew, that under some fanciful
circumstances it might be made possible for
us to initiate money bills in this chamber.

December 12, 1968»

The amendment of 1949, with which I presume we are all familiar, inserts among the.
powers contained in section 91 of the British
North America Act which gives the Dominion
Government certain extensive powers, these
very simple but sweeping words:
The amendment from time to time of
the Constitution of Canada,
They could scarcely be more sweeping. They
are, of course, subject to certain exceptions,
of which this is not one, and I need not spend
time on these words. They refer to the
amendment from time to time of the Constitution of Canada, subject to these few
exceptions.
This inquiry calls attention only to that
power which, without doubt, is in the Parliament of Canada. It calls attention only to the
fact. It is not a bill. It is not a resolution. It is
not notice of either a bill or a resolution, and
as it stands it is purely academic. To give it a
practical significance two things at least
would be required. They are the repeal by
the Parliament of Canada of sections 53 and
54 of the British North America Act-and
this has not been stressed very much so faror, on the other hand, the repeal of section
53, and the active co-operation of the government of the day to this very notable change
in parliamentary practice, and of that we
have been given no intimation whatsoever.
We are not justified by anything that is
before us in imagining that the Government
of Canada, no matter what party is in power,
would join with us in this change in constitutional practice. Of course, not only would we
need the co-operation of the Government of
the day, but we would need the passage by
both houses of Parliament of a bill for the
alteration of the British North America Act.
Although they have been read several
times, let me read the sections in question.
Section 53 reads:
53. Bills for appropriating any Part of the
Public Revenue, or for imposing any Tax
or Impost, shall originate in the House of
Commons.
It could not be more simple or more explicit.
Section 54, which so far does not seem to
have come into our discussions to any extent,
and which is certainly not in the notice in our
Order Paper reads:
54. It shall not be lawful for the House of
Commons to adopt or pass any Vote,
Resolution, Address, or Bill for the
Appropriation of any Part of the Public
Revenue, or of any Tax or Impost, to any

December 12, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Purpose that has not been first recommended to that House by Message of the
Governor General in the Session in which
such Vote, Resolution, Address, or Bill is
proposed.
Honourable senators will note that there
are two points in that section. It refers first to
the House of Commons and, second, to a message from the Governor General in the session in question. We could, of course, very
easily add in section 54 the words "and the
Senate" to the words "the House of Commons" as the place where a money bill might
be initiated, but the abolition of the consent
of the Governor is to my mind positively
unthinkable. The Governor General is now, of
course, the Governor in Council, that is the
Government of the day, the Executive. To
dispense with that consent would be contrary
to the long-standing practice here, and also in
the United Kingdom and elsewhere. That is
not proposed by Senator Hayden.
Control of the raising of money, the public
revenue, and its expenditure is essentially a
task for a few men to undertake-experts, if
you like that word-men who are thoroughly
familiar with the overall picture of the
national finance, men who can correlate the
money raised with the money expended or, in
the reverse, the money expended with the
money available, men who are able to say
how you cut your coat according to your
cloth. The few men who performi that task
and recommend it to Parliament must be
supremely responsible to the nation, to the
electorate. Such a task, I submit to you, is not
within the practical competence of any general legislative assembly; so I think we must be
agreed that we must retain the consent of the
Government to the raising or the expenditure
of money.
If we undertook such a task in this bouse it
would undoubtedly require the consent of the
Government in each instance of the expenditures of money or the raising of money
involved in the money bill that would then be
fore us. In each instance we would need to
have the consent of the Governor General,
the Government of the day, as it is in the
other place at the present time, usually written and filed with the Clerk of the House of
Commons. That means that unless we have
the consent and co-operation of the Government, any such power as is envisaged in the
motion now before us would be futile and
without purpose. Unless Senator Hayden
knows that he bas the co-operation of the
Government in bringing this matter before

us, this debate, honourable senators, is absolutely without practical purpose. It is an exercise in futility. I think it is even worse than
that, because it involves the possibility, the
potential of a misunderstanding between this
house and the House of Commons, between
ourselves and the Government and certainly
the possibility of a misunderstanding with the
public at large.
Let me go a little further than anyone has
so far gone in this debate and call your attention to the preamble of the British North
America Act. The very first words of the act
are these:
Whereas the Provinces of Canada,
Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick have
expressed their Desire to be federally
united into One Dominion under the
Crown of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and IrelandTo this, I call your attention especially.
-with a Constitution similar in Principle
to that of the United Kingdom.
It bas long been an essential principle of
the Constitution of the United Kingdom that
money bills originate in the Commons, never
in the House of Lords, and always with the
consent of the government of the day. Any
other procedure, I submit to you, is practically impossible here or there. The two conditions necessary are that the money bill originate in the Commons and that it be with the
consent of the Government. Anything else is
fraught with the probability of misunderstanding and mistakes, bad judgment and a
lack of that necessary intimate knowledge of
the over-all financial affairs of the nation.
Without government co-operation in the
present ostensible purpose of this proposal, it
is not only futile, it involves the possibilities I
have mentioned of misunderstandings.
I have stated before and I state now that
one of the virtues of our bouse, over the
many years that I have been here, has been
the fact that we have been able to get along
smoothly with the other bouse. In all that
time there bas never been a confrontation
between ourselves and the other bouse. I can
remember that we delayed one measure and
it was brought in again the next session in a
different form and passed. We made a very
great improvement in it by doing so.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Was that
te Foreign Exchange Control Act?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No, that is not what I
had in mind. I was thinking about the act

SENATE DEBATES

December 12, 1968

which would have placed in the hands and
control of the Department of Public Works
the harbours of both Hamilton and Toronto.
When the enormity of that bill was pointed
out in this chamber the Government did not
go on with it. It died on the Order Paper, and
in the next session it came back to us in very
much improved form.
There is another instance that I can mention, and I am sure there are a great many,
where we have made changes, but in my
experience we always came to an agreement
with the other house. There has never been a
quarrel or a misunderstanding or any confrontation between ourselves and the other
bouse in the 23 years I have been a member
of this bouse.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: But if you had passed the
bill, it provided for his discharge. He did not
have ta resign, once the bill was passed.

Hon. Mr. Choquete: The "class or kind"
bill never passed here. We tried to meet with
the other place, you will recall, but the bill
never passed.

Hon. Mr. Grosari: He had still been fired.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I remember it very
well. It was dropped by the other bouse when
we pointed out the absurdity of it and the
very bad principles that were involved in it.
We saved the nation from bad legislation on
that occasion, and we did not get into a quarrel with the other house in doing so.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: We respect your opinion.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: That does not say we
share it.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The case most often
mentioned in this connection is the Coyne
aff air. I think it would be well if I said what
that affair was, as there was a good deal of
misunderstanding about it. You remember
that the Finance Minister of the day demanded the resignation of Mr. Coyne, the Governor of the Bank of Canada. The Governor
refused to resign, and, since the Government
was determined to have his resignation, they
introduced a bill in the Commons in effect
discharging him.
The bill came to us. We gave him his day
in court-which had not been given in the
other house. Then-I know what I am talking
about, because I made the arrangement-I
told the Governor that we could not possibly
refuse to pass the bill and leave a warfare
between the Bank of Canada, a very important institution, and the Finance Department,
another very important body. So it was
arranged that, if we passed the bill, he would
resign. We got what the Minister of Finance
could not get.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: He had undertaken with
me that he would resign.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: But if the bill passed he
did not have a choice.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: If the bill had passed,
yes; but what we did was to give it the hoist,
on an understanding clearly made between
Mr. Coyne and me-and he did resign the
same afternoon. So really that was not a confrontation between us: it was co-operation
between ourselves and the Department of
Finance or the Government.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I did not hear you.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: He still lost his job.
Hon. Mr.
resigned.

Smith (Queens-Shelburne):

He

Hon. Mr. Grosart: It is one way you lose a
job.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: He resigned, but he
resigned honourably. That was the distinction
between a resignation which was demanded
and a resignation which he voluntarily gave.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: In retrospect, it is rather
subtle.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There are many subtle
things in this world, and you must not overlook them because they are subtle.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: There is another version
to the story.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I
can conclude with a few sentences. I submit
that it will be all right for us to pass money
bills in this house, provided we have the
active consent and the desire and the co-operation of the Government of the day, so that
we can table here the consent of the Government in fact and of the Governor in form, as
they do in the Commons.
The utmost control still would remain in
the Government of the day. We might then
pass the bill, as they do in the Commons.
However, without that co-operation, it would
be impossible, contrary to the spirit as well
as the letter of the British North America
Act, something which we should not undertake, and which we have no facilities to

undertake. What senator would like to be
involved in that kind of thing?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Thank you. My friend
agrees. Under these circumstances, 1 repeat
that this debate is an exercise in futility and,
worse than that, possibly the provoking of
misunderstandings.
Far be it from me that it go abroad from
this chamber that we are attempting to
deprive the House of Commons of its longestablished and essential powers and privileges. We do flot need to do that. We have our
own work to do. As Senator O'Leary (Carieton) so well pointed out yesterday, we have
our constitutional work to do here and it
should be satisfactory if we do that work
well. We have added to what the British
North America Act seems to imply we could
do, by the making of many inquiries and by
the promotion of needed reforms. The last
reformn was the greatest yet, the divorce
reform. There are many others we have
accomplished. We have carried public opinion
with us on a number of occasions, and we
will do so again. We should flot be fussing
over our position, or be too over-anxious with
regard to it. Let us do the work that is fundamentally ours, work that we are capable of
doing, and let us do it weil. Let us flot even
appear to be trying to take from the Comnions one of their long-established rights and
customs.

APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 4. 1968
SECOND READING

Hon. Leopold Langlois moved the second
reading of Bill C-141, for granting to Her
Mai esty certain sums of money for the public
service for the financial year ending 3lst
March, 1969.
He said: Honourable senators wiil recail
that, on October 4 last, Royal Assent was
given to an interim supply bill for the current
fiscal year, which released a general proportion of nine-twelfths of ail of the votes in the
Revised Estimates for 1968-69.
Since that time, Supplementary Estimates
A, containing three items totalling $84,250
29234-49

have been presented to Parliament. The bill
now before us will release the remaining
three-tweilths of the revised Estimates 196869 and the full amount of the Supplementary
Estimates A to whîch I have referred.
Honourable senators, for the better understanding of the remarks which I propose to
make, I arn having distributed now to honourable senators a memorandum-a short one of
two pages only-summarizing those appropriation acts which have been passed so far,
and the present bill.
The total of the Estimates tabled in Parliament to date is $1,355,461,660, consisting of
revised Estinates (budgetary expenditures) of
$10,670,850,598, loans and investments and
advances totalling $684,526,812 and Supplementary Estimnates (A) $84,250. 1 wish here to
refer honourable senators to pages 476 to 581
of the revised Estimates for the list of the
boans, investments and advances to which I
have iust referred. 0f this sum, $4,886,054,377
is statutory and the remainder, some $6,469,407,283, must be voted by Parliament. The
interim. supply bill, Appropriation Act No. 3,
1968, to which I referred, released $3,776,197,303.75. The bill now before us wiil release the
remaining $1,575,007,182.08 of the total to be
voted in 1968-69.
I should remind honourable senators that
the Revised Estiniates have been examined
by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance, with the assistance of the Secretary of
the Treasury Board and members of his staff
on two occasions, and also that; these Estimates have been before this committee for
some time. In the case of the Main Estimates,
the original ones which were tabled on February 13, 1968, were referred to the Standing
Committee on Finance on the same date. The
Revised Estimates were tabled and referred to
the Finance Committee on October 1, 1968,
and the Supplementary Estimates (A> were
tabled and referred to the Finance Committee
on November 19, 1968. These Estirnates being
still before the Standing Committee on
Finance, honourable senators wiIl be in a
position to obtain any further information
which they might wish about them by refering to the committee, even after the passage
of the present bull.
However, I shail endeavour to supply any
further information which honourable senators may wish to have.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators,
once again we are indebted to a sponsor of an
appropriation bull for providing us with a
breakdown and explanation of the moneys

SENATE DEBATES
that we are asked to vote-in this case $1.5
billion.
I am not criticizing the fact that it was a
very brief explanation, but I have some doubts
whether it is an adequate justification for
any hurried disposal of the bill for him to say
that the Estimates have been referred to our
Finance Committee. True, our Finance Committee dealt with the revised Main Estimates
on two occasions, but I doubt if any honourable senator will suggest that two half mornings on a Blue Book of some 500 or 600 pages
is sufficient scrutiny to satisfy this chamber
that we need to do no more to discharge our
responsibilities in respect to scrutiny of the
spending of public funds.
I was surprised that the sponsor of the bill
did not call to the attention of the chamber
that this may be a most historic occasion. It
may well be a milestone in the history of
Parliament. Certain proposals have been
made by the Government and are now being
considered in the other place, and if these are
accepted this will be the last occasion on
which the Senate of Canada will have before
it an appropriation bill that has been discussed in the Committee of Supply of the
Whole House of the House of Commons.

entirely relevant to a discussion of the bill
before us. We are not dealing with a normal
situation. We are not dealing with a normal
bill, and I would respectfully suggest that it
is entirely within the rules for me to point
that out to honourable senators and also to fill
in the background of this bill and the context
in which we are asked to pass it.
The honourable senator says that a senator
may not rise here to discuss the background
of a bill that is sent to us for approval,
involving $1.5 billion. But his reading of the
rules is very different from mine.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Does my friend suggest
that the appropriations next coming to us are
the background of the appropriation now
before us?
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Would the honourable
senator repeat the question? I did not understand it.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Do you suggest that the
appropriations which may come to us later
on, carried perhaps under different arrangements in the House of Commons, are the
background of the resolution that is now
before the house?

Hon. Mr. Grosari: My answer would be
yes, very much so, because the background of

SENATE DEBATES
spokesman, a "scandalous method of dealing
with public funds."
The fact of the matter is-and I am being
very careful here not to contravene Mr.
Speaker's ruling-that this bill proposes to
grant supply for all departments of government; and of those departments, the Estimates for only some twelve have been scrutinized in committees elsewhere and the
remainder by and large have not been scrutinized at all. They have come to us reasonably
free of any kind of legislative scrutiny. I
mention that to indicate that we need to proceed with considerable caution. Let me add
that I will be very glad if the sponsor of the
bill or anybody else can show me any evidence of previous scrutiny of the Estimates of
at least half of the departments covered here.
I have looked very carefully through what
evidence there might be of any kind of previous scrutiny. I find no evidence of scrutiny,
for example, of the Estimates of the C.B.C.,
or Central Mortgage and Housing, to indicate
only two whose combined requests from the
public treasury total at least $300 million.
In looking through the bill I notice, as usual, that some acts of Parliament, whose purpose is to control and regularize the expenditure of public funds, have again been set
aside. There are some eleven examples of
this, and lest any honourable senator should
think I am picking on something that is not
of very much financial importance, I would
indicate that the "notwithstanding" items
which I will deal with in a moment-5, 8, 16,
18, 19, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29-total something
like $370 million, which we are asked to
regulations or
approve, notwithstanding
statutory enactments in other acts.
I am not on that account saying that there
is necessarily any reason why in some situations exceptions should not be made, but I
would ask the honourable sponsor of the bill
if he would be good enough, in due course, to
provide us with an explanation of the reasons
why on at least eleven occasions here the
provisions of the Financial Administration Act
are set aside.
I ask that because at a past meeting of the
Finance Committee I raised this question, and
the then Secretary of the Treasury Board
agreed that it was important that a reason be
given when the Financial Administration Act
and other acts were set aside and, in respect
of the individual item concerned, the act was,
in effect, amended by the Appropriation Act
of Parliament. For example, there are at least
two occasions in this bill where section 7 is
set aside.

December 12, 1968

When we read section 7 of the Financial
Administration Act, we find this:
Subject to the provisions of any enactment respecting the powers and functions
of a separate employer, but notwithstanding any other provision contained in any
enactment, the Treasury Boardhas the exclusive power to determine manpower requirements, to provide for classification, to regulate pay and so on.
On several occasions in the bill before us
that protection provided by the Financial
Administration Act is set aside without explanation. I repeat, I am not saying there may
not be very good reasons for setting it aside.
On other occasions it has been explained to
us that emergency situations do arise when it
is not practicable to amend another act of
Parliament, having in mind the legislative
time schedules in the other place and here.
But it is my view that in each case there
should be an explanation, and the proceedings of our own Finance Committee will indicate that on one occasion at least in connection with these "notwithstanding" items and
$1 votes, which have the sarne effect, the
an

promised
Finance
explanation.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Otiawa West): Did it
get it?
Hon. Mr. Grosari: No, it has never been
received, and I am not blaming or criticizing
anyone for that.
Perhaps the last occasion it happened was
when Dr. George Davidson was before us.
Then there was a change in his position and a
new Secretary of the Treasury Board was
appointed. As far as I know, it may not have
been called to his attention. However, I am
mentioning it to indicate that I am not alone
in believing that this is a dangerous custom
that has grown up of setting aside acts of
Parliament in a supply bill which is, of course,
an act of Parliament itself.
I have always been amazed that my friends
in the legal profession have not protested
this, because it is beyond me to know how
anyone in that profession would be sure that
any act of Parliament, as it stood in the published statutes or even in an office consolidation, would contain these amendments. I have
asked this question before and no one has
given me an explanation.
The fact of the matter is that there is no
way of knowing-even in the case of any act

December 12, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

one is attempting to understand, one is prepared to go back to the last consolidation of
the statutes-that that particular act has been
amended by an appropriation bill.
A very good example was an appropriation
bill we had before us in which provision was
made for the payment of certain benefits under the Veterans Act to certain semi-civilian
forces from Newfoundland. I believe it affected persons engaged in firefighting, attached to
the armed forces. The Appropriation Act in
effect amended the governing act, so that this
group of persons was made eligible under the
Appropriation Act. I am sure that any solicitor
looking at the Veterans' Act to advise anyone
whether he might be entitled to a pension
under that act, would have told him, "No,
you are not", unless by some method he was
aware that an Appropriation Act had amended the act.
We have that situation here eleven times,
not only in respect of the Financial Administration Act but one or two others as well. I
have given the honourable sponsor of the bill
the pages, and if he wishes I will be glad to
give him my marked copy.
I notice that some of my friends opposite
today are a bit touchy about the broader
aspects of our financial management, but I
think I would be remiss if I conclude my
remarks without saying that I hope the general financial picture that has been placed
before the Canadian public, of which this bill
is a very important part, will result in the
closing of what appears to have become a
very large credibility gap between the Estimates of the Government and the amounts
they spend. I am not going to detail that. I
am quite sure all honourable senators are
aware of the situation to which I am referring.
The honourable sponsor of the bill gave us
a total figure and it appears in the summary.
I think we are entitled to assume that it is
the total amount, because this is the last
Appropriation Bill for 1968-69, other than a
possible supplementary. So, is this the total
amount of public money the Government will
spend this year?
On an earlier occasion there was a guarantee given by the minister, but circumstances
that he claimed were beyond his control, and
which I will not discuss, proved him wrong.
It is my hope that every effort will be made
by the Government to bring its Estimates, as
presented to us today in this bill, strictly in
line with what we will read in the Public
Accounts when they come before us.

Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators,
I shall not detain the house long. I should
like to make a few comments not so much
upon this bill but upon the method by which
this chamber deals with appropriation
measures.
I agree with Senator Grosart, particularly in
the latter part of his speech when he commented on the $1 items and others which set
aside the provisions of the Financial Administration Act. This is not a desirable practice in
the first place. In the second place, if it has to
be resorted to, then I think there should be
an adequate explanation given as to why this
step is taken. I say in all frankness-and I
would have said it had I been the Leader of
the Government-that it is right and proper
for this body to inquire into points of this
character.
I remind honourable senators that we have
come a long way in this respect. I can
remember, in the days when I was going to
college in this city, coming to this chamber
and listening to the debate on an appropriation bill. In those days every time such a bill
was presented in the Senate-and it could
have been a bill concerning interim supply,
final supply, or supplementary estimatesregardless of what party was in opposition it
would always complain, "We are going to do
nothing by rubber stamp this", and usually
the rubber stamping was done at 4 o'clock in
the morning.
It may be repetitious, but I think it bears
repetition, to say that we did decide on a
course of action which is responsible, and
which should help every honourable senator
who is interested in the expenditure of public
money. It is a practice which I am glad to say
has been continued, by which the Estimates
and Supplementary Estimates are, upon
tabling, immediately referred to the Standing
Committee on Finance. Senator Grosart has
pointed out that this committee has sat but
twice on these estimates which, in effect, we
are now debating. If any member of that
committee, or indeed any honourable senator,
required more detailed information than he
had in connection with an appropriation bill
or with the Estimates, then he had the right
to go to the chairman of the committee
and suggest that the time had come when
there should be another meeting, or ask that
another meeting of the committee be held.
The very fact that Senator Grosart has
been able to speak in the way he has this
afternoon about setting aside the Financial
Administration Act, the $1 items, the scrutiny

SENATE DEBATES
of the Estimates and Crown companies, and
things like that, is evidence of the value of
the work that committee has done. I do not
say it has been done in every session, but it is
evidence of the work that can be done by the
Standing Committee on Finance towards
satisfying the members of this chamber that
all the appropriate action is being taken in
connection with the expenditure of public
money.
We have to realize, of course, that when it
comes to varying the Estimates we are in an
entirely different position. Once the Estimates
have been approved in the other place and
we receive a final supply bill we are then
boxed in. We cannot change the amounts up
or down without either increasing the levy of
tax or interfering with ways and means. On
both counts we would be wrong. We have no
authority to do it. We could reject the bill,
but I suppose we would precipitate an election if we did.

if he is going to answer some questions he
should tell us his intentions before he makes
a speech which might close the debate.

However, I will endeavour to find that out
and provide the answer to my honourable
friend before this bill is passed.
Hon. Mr. Grosari: I wonder if the honourable senator, who has referred to loans, investments and advances, would agree that whereas they are officially regarded as loans,
investments and advances and therefore
repayable, there are items in there that
nobody expects to be repaid. I refer specifically to the CBC; there is no possibility of
that money ever being repaid. Is it his

in that way as mere bookkeeping items until
they can be disposed of?

SENATE DEBATES

RULES OF THE SENATE
MOTION FOR ADOPTION OF FOURTH REPORT
OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

The Senate proceeded to consideration of the
Fourth Report of the Special Committee on
the Rules of the Senate which was presented
on Thursday, November 28.
Hon. Hariland de M. Molson moved adoption of the report.
He said: Honourable senators, in moving
the adoption of the report of the Special
Committee on the Rules of the Senate, I
should perhaps comment on the background
which gave rise to some of the suggestions,
observations and recommendations which it
contained.

In the first place, the committee recommended that the rules be published in bilingual form in accordance with the present
practice for the Statutes of Canada, and that
the responsibility for publication be entrusted
to the Clerk of the Senate. It was felt that this
task required time and that the proper order,
marginal notes, index, and translation, were
most important for the effective use of the
rules. There was some criticism of the previous translation, and certainly the old index
was inadequate; it was felt that in bringing
out a new volume these matters should be
rectified.
As the report stated, simply bringing the
rules up to date could not greatly change nor
improve the role of the Senate, which is very
clearly set out in the British North America
Act as one of the three parts with the Queen
and the House of Commons, which compose
the Parliament of Canada.
In their study your committee were
impressed by the fact that most of the
changes now required had their roots in the
British North America Act or other statutes,
or would require consultation and co-operation with the other place.
As to the need for change, I think that
honourable senators must be satisfied, from
editorial and other comment, that the public
desires, if it does not demand, change. Such
comment in the news media which has come
to my attention seems to indicate that instead
of going too far, your committee's report has
perhaps not gone far enough and is, perhaps,
very late in the day. This last criticism of
belated action is not too well founded
because, as the record shows, as long ago as
1951 the Senate was discussing this problem.
Since that time we in this chamber know how

December 12, 1968

much discussion there has been within this
building about the need of change or reform
in order to enable the Senate to carry out the
useful role which senators themselves are
convinced is within the competence and the
duty of this chamber.
Perhaps one respect in which the Senate
and its members are really completely misunderstood is their attitude towards change. I
do not think it is any exaggeration to say that
we are commonly pictured as a group which
wishes to cling to the position and privileges
of senators, with an ardent desire to live out
our term with as little disturbance or work as
possible. I know from personal conversations
with other senators how many feel that if
they have not a useful and constructive role
of value to the country they would just as
soon return to their occupations at home.
There is a deep dedication to public service
in this chamber which is certainly not fully
appreciated in the country.
In dealing with the specific subjects of the
report there are the observations and suggestions that this house, without being divorced
from politics, should be regarded as sufficiently independent and impartial to deal
with the matters brought before it only in the
light of the common good. I realize that this
may be controversial, but I believe it is time
we should express our views in this regard.
Although we have suggested no additional
powers for the Senate, there are suggestions
such as those relating to private bills and
money bills which should go some way
towards improving the performance of Parliament as a whole by a better distribution of the
workload. That Parliament is under severe
criticism for its slow rate of accomplishment
is undeniable. To suggest that this is due to a
lack of interest or competence of the members
is ridiculous. It is obvious that, in order to
carry out expeditiously the work imposed, a
system in tune with life in the 20th century is
required. Your committee has expressed the
view that the Senate wishes to play its part
not only by assuming its full share of the
work load but also by the application of modern processes within traditional forms.
Stress is laid on the very important role
played by Senate committees. In the Third
Report this was made clear by the reorganization of standing committees as approved in
this chamber, and in the Fourth Report the
function of investigation, as carried out by
special committees has been emphasized.
Comments are made on some matters which
it is felt are obsolete. One of these, the

December 12, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

suggestion that by virtue of holding property
senators should constitute an upper class, bas
no place in Canada today. Even more so is
the requirement that Quebec senators possess
such property in one of the 24 electoral divisions which pre-date Confederation by many
years.
The traditional procedure for Royal Assent
is seriously questioned, because in this day of
instant communication it no longer seems
necessary to disrupt the work of all three
components of Parliament for that purpose.
Another subject raised in committee was
the inequity of deductions from senators'
allowances because of non-appearance in the
chamber while at the same time giving no
recognition of attendance at a committee
meeting, perhaps held on that same day or
even more at a committee sitting while Parliament is adjourned. It was not put forward as
a desire for more money but simply to call
attention to an antiquated system of measurement of the contribution made by a senator to
his parliamentary task.
The suggestion that the Senate chamber be
used more in Committee of the Whole and by
some standing committees is put forward
because your committee is convinced that the
valkable work of the Senate will never be
recognized as long as it continues to be
hidden from the public. It is true that the
press and public are welcome at committee
sittings, but we know from a practical point
of view that it is rare indeed to see any
outsider there. However, there are thousands
of visitors to this building in the mornings
throughout the year who would be able to see
and, we believe, enjoy a committee in session
in this chamber.
Finally, as a means of giving weight to the
collective view of the Senate on its future,
the report of the committee recommends that
a motion be introduced in the chamber to
initiate a study of the changes which would
be required in the statutes to enable the
Senate to fulfil its duty in the fullest possible
measure now and in the years ahead.
Honourable senators, that was all I had
intended to say in moving the adoption of this
report, but I was persuaded that some comment should be made on one element of the
very able speech made yesterday by my old
friend and much respected colleague, Senator
Grattan O'Leary. On page 756 of Hansardhe
said:
Furthermore, honourable senators, I
believe-and I intend to say this if I am
here when Senator Molson's proposals
come before the house-it is nonsense to
29234-50

say that a man or a woman cannot be
appointed to this Senate who previously
took part in the political life of the country. Surely these are the people who
should be appointed to this chamber.
Have they always been partisan in this
house? If you are to argue that only nonpartisans should be appointed to this
chamber, then you also have to argue
that only nonpartisans should be appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada.
Honourable senators, that gave me the distinct impression that Senator O'Leary either
had not read the report or had obtained his
version of it from some news media. I must
read a short extract from the report, paragraph 12, page 654 of Hansard:
12. To preserve the vital democratic
responsibility of examination and thorough study in depth of legislation presented to Parliament, an impartial and
Senate, comprising the
independent
ablest talent which can be attracted to it,
is of paramount importance to our system
and, consequently, to the Canadian publie. This emphasizes not only the continuing and perhaps increasing need for our
Chamber but, also, the importance of its
composition as well as its procedures for
ensuring a full and fair examination of
public issues with as little distortion as
possible by the crisis atmosphere of the
daily political scene.
13. The experience of 100 years now
indicates that there is some reason for
the Senate to approach its task with full
impartiality and independence. To this
end it may be desirable that there should
be a constitutional change widening the
base on which senators are appointed. It
is apparent that when appointments are
confined almost exclusively to those who
have faithfully served the party in power, there is a modifying influence
imposed on their conduct by the natural
loyalty to that party. ThisAnd I emphasize these words:
This is not to suggest that either political
experience or party affiliation by themselves should be a deterrent to an otherwise suitable appointment, but that if the
Senate were more detached from the
political party process it would have an
immediate and beneficial effect on its
conduct and on its image.
There is certainly no suggestion that people
who have taken an active part in the political

SENATE DEBATES

parties of the country should not be appointed to this chamber.
In conclusion, may I say that my views,
and those of my very able colleagues on the
committee, are expressed in the report submitted to the chamber. The committee realizes that its 18 members may not reflect the
views of the Senate as a whole. Its recommendations are put forward with the conviction
that a debate on the observations and suggestions made will bring forth the wisdom of the
Senate as relates to the future of the Senate
itself. I-and I know your committee shares
this view-have complete confidence that
there is no body so well equipped to discuss
this subject as the members of this chamber.
Hon. G. Percival Burchill: Honourable
senators, unfortunately I will not be in
attendance next week, so this will be my only
opportunity to put forward some views on
this subject. I will be very brief.
I wish to congratulate Senator Molson and
the members of his Rules Committee on their
report. I feel he has done a masterly job.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: We all appreciate that.
We know the time, effort and study that he
and the members of his committee put into
the work. This report is a milestone in the
history of the Senate.
Honourable senators, it seems to me that in
making the Senate more effective, and that is
what we are aiming at, we must take into
account one weakness which has been shown
right here this afternoon. I refer to meetings
of special committees, such as the Science
Committee-and also the Committee on the
Rules-being held when the Senate itself is
sitting. Every senator who is in Ottawa today
should have been in his seat in this chamber
to hear Senator Molson move the adoption of
his report. Unfortunately some senators are at
this moment attending a meeting of the
Special Committee on Science Policy.
I have noticed during this session, particularly more than during any other time since I
have been in the Senate, a grave lack of
attendance when most important and informative speeches were being made, speeches
which should have been heard by all members of the Senate. Members have not been in
the chamber because they have been engaged
in other Senate business. That is a problem
which should be considered very carefully for
the future. It is a serious weakness to have
the business of the Senate dealt with here
while many members are in committee. Those

December 12, 1968

two committees. Rules and Science, are very
large-I think they have 18 members each.
That makes a big difference. They should
have been here, as I say, to hear the able
speeches that have been made on many subjects. I especially emphasize the point that
every available member of the Senate should
have been present in the chamber to hear
Senator Molson move adoption of his report.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Haig, debate adjourned.
COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY
ASSOCIATION
CANADIAN PARTICIPATION AT GENERAL
CONFERENCE IN NASSAU-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday,
November 28, the adjourned debate on the
inquiry of the honourable Senator Connolly
(Ottawa West), calling the attention of the
Senate to the 14th General Conference of the
Commonwealth Parliamentary Association,
held at Nassau, Bahamas, from 26th October
to 8th November, 1968, and the participation
therein of the delegation from Canada.
Hon. Fred M. Blois: Honourable senators,
the fourteenth Commonwealth Parliamentary
Conference was held in Nassau from October
26 to November 8. Delegates from 75 commonwealth parliaments took part. Our branch
sent a delegation of seven parliamentarianstwo from this body and five from the other
place.
Our delegation was led by Mr. James E.
Walker, M.P. In addition to the official delegates, our own Senator John Connolly was
there, because he is and has been for many
years, a member of the executive of the
C.P.A., and also he is a past president of the
C.P.A.
Incidentally, I would mention that Senator
Connolly gave the opening speech on behalf
of Canada in the committee, and I think it
was the unanimous opinion of the delegates
there that it was one of the better, if not the
best speech, delivered at the Conference.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Blois: The provincial branches
were represented, with the exception of Quebec. Following a tour of the outer islands during the first four days, the Conference itself
was opened on November 1 in the Senate
chamber by the Governor, His Excellency Sir
Francis Cumming-Bruce.

December 12, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Over the next few days, some of the more
urgent problems of the world today were
debated in plenary sessions. The subjects
included world security, the problems of economic growth, racial harmony or conflict.
There were also two committees that discussed the matters of "Aid-How Effective?"
and "Parliamentary Government-Where is
it Heading?".
I believe all delegates left the conference
agreed that these were extremely useful and
important discussions.
All the delegates met in the plenary sessions. The number of subjects to be discussed
made it necessary to work in two committees.
I was requested to attend the Committee on
"Aid-How Effective?"
In our opening remarks we stated that, following World War II, the world had seen the
commencement of large-scale aid programs to
contributed,
which Canada substantially
designed to provide relief and aid reconstruction in the countries of the Western allies
which had been devastated by war.
The year 1950 marked Canada's entry into
the field of external aid in the sense it is
understood today. I might say, honourable
senators, that these remarks are taken from
those I made before the committee. In that
year Canada joined Britain, Australia, New
Zealand, India, Pakistan and Ceylon in a discussion of ways to cope with the political,
economic and social problems confronting the
newly independent nations of south and
Southeast Asia.
The result of their deliberations was the
Colombo Plan, conceived as a Commonwealth
response to what was regarded as a Commonwealth responsibility.
In 1958 Canada decided to broaden the
scope of its contribution by undertaking a
new program in the Islands of the British
West Indies. In 1960 Canadian assistance to
Africa began. We gave some information regarding the type of aid that we were giving
to these countries.
Some of the delegates who spoke before we
did cited figures to show the amount of aid
they were contributing. We also gave a very
brief summary of Canada's aid, stating that
our aid program had grown from less than
$70 million a decade ago to $253 million in
1967-68, with a projected increase to $291 million in 1968-69, and, in addition, an export
credit of $350 million. We pointed out that by
1970 Canada would endeavour to raise the
level of foreign aid to one per cent of our
gross national product.
29234-50

Australia has passed this one per cent of
her gross national product and Great Britain
has either reached it or will do so this year.
We pointed out that the importance of
intelligent criteria for aid becomes apparent
when it is recalled that 85 per cent of the
population of the world live in developing
countries. The remaining 15 per cent, living
in the rich countries of North America,
Europe and the U.S.S.R., share between them
nearly 90 per cent of the world income, some
90 per cent of the world's gold reserves, and
nearly 95 per cent of the world's scientific
capacity. Furthermore, the rich minority produce 50 per cent of the world's wheat and 70
per cent of total meat production of the
world.
We pointed this out to the delegates there
to endeavour to show them why it was necessary for the developed countries to come to
the aid of the developing countries, because
we so-called rich countries had so much and
the so-called poor countries had so little.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the senator
where those figures come from?
Hon. Mr. Blois: I received them from what
I may say is a very highly reliable source, a
high ranking official of the Government of
Canada. I prefer not to give his name without
his permission. I believe the figures are
correct.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Was it from D.B.S.?
Hon. Mr. Blois: No, it was not. I could
name the source, if it is deemed necessary.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The figures are valuable. That is the reason I ask the question.
Hon. Mr. Blois: I think they are. I think
Senator Connolly knows where I got the
figures. We discussed the matter and I believe
them to be absolutely reliable.
We also stated that despite two decades of
aid, the gulf between the poor and the rich
nations is widening as population growth in
the underdeveloped countries runs ahead of
development. We stated that over the years a
number of effective criteria have been developed for foreign aid. Of greatest importance
is the amount of external assistance required
to help countries reach the point of self-sustaining economic growth. Because so many
countries lack adequate governmental administrative machinery, and because there
are so many things that need to be done, one
important criterion for aid is the existence of
a national development plan.

SENATE DEBATES
Some honourable senators may wonder why
I am harping on the matter of criteria, but I
was asked if I would bring out some of the
points of criteria to answer delegates who
wanted to know why aid is channeled in
the manner it is today.
If a country has a good plan, this facilitates
the provision, focusing and co-ordinating of
aid and it also serves to channel a country's
energies more effectively. To an increasing
degree, self-help and performance have
become generally accepted criteria for aid.
This implies a willingness on the part of the
developing country to invest and direct its
resources toward sensible development goals.
There has been some criticism from various
countries that in the past some of external aid
was not wisely expended. Hence my reason
for making such a statement.
We enlarged on the items I have mentioned, particularly as they related to Canadian aid.
After our talk we had several discussions
with individual delegates from other nations.
Perhaps it was not wise to go into detail, as
we did at a public meeting of the delegates,
but I think all of us on the delegation discussed with individual delegates from other
nations the things that Canada and other
nations were endeavouring to do to help the
developing nations.
Some of the countries do not like "tied
aid". They prefer to have the money and to
spend it at their discretion. We pointed out
our reason for "tied aid" in a number of
instances.
Some countries feel that Canada could do
more. We did not argue with them publicly,
but privately we did try to assure them that
we had problems in our own country and that

December 12, 1968

we felt we were doing all that should be
expected of us.
I am sorry to say that during the conference there was some bitterness, but I also
believe that because of the conversations
among the delegates of the various nations,
we all left with a much better feeling of
what the various developed countries were
trying to do to help the developing countries.
As I say, I think some of them were rather
bitter at times, but I felt we were able to
show them that some of their remarks were
not entirely justified.
We also heard certain remarks from the
delegates of some countries to the effect that
discrimination against the non-white countries was fairly prevalent. They had some
rather strong cases to tell us about. Again,
when we left they all admitted, at least those
to whom I spoke, that there was certainly no
sign of discrimination between the white and
non-white nations attending the conference.
That is a very brief report of what went on
at the conference. I believe others may have
more to say and will cover points which I
have not covered this afternoon.
Hon. Mr. Hastings: Honourable senators, as
one of the federal delegates attending the
Fourteenth General Conference of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association,
I
intend at a future date to make further observations and perhaps elaborate somewhat on
the very informative reports that have been
made by Senator Connolly (Ottawa West) and
Senator Blois. Accordingly, I move that the
debate be adjourned.
Motion agreed to.
The Senate adjourned

Motion agreed to.

Senate to the Fourteenth Annual Conference of the North Atlantic Assembly held
at Brussels, Belgium, llth November to
15th November, 1968, and in particular to
the discussions and proceedings of the
conference and the participation therein
of the delegation from Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, I warmly
welcome this opportunity to report to you on
the mid-November meeting in Brussels of the
North Atlantic Assembly, a meeting which
came at a most critical and crucial time for
our alliance.
I would also like to take this opportunity to
tell you something of my own views-very
much my own views-of the debate currently
under way in Canada over external and
defence policies. But before proceeding any
further, honourable senators, I must express
my sincere appreciation and gratitude to
Senator Flynn and Senator Lang for the substantial contribution they made to the work
of the Canadian delegation, of which I had
the honour to be the chairman. They were
both first-rate travelling companions.
Some senators may have noticed a report
concerning our delegation that appeared in a
recent edition of Time magazine, which
reads, in part:
When a group of 15 M.P.s and Senators
attended the NATO parliamentarians'
conference in Brussels, observers noticed
that something had happened to the usually quiet Canadians. For one, the M.P.s
seemed unwontedly well-briefed; they
put forward Canadian points of view
with remarkable congency.

As the Time report suggested, the Canadian
delegation to the North Atlantic Assembly
was indeed well briefed. The report represents a highly deserved tribute to the senators

had a good idea of how the North Atlantic
Assembly functioned.
As the Time story further suggested, the
members of the Canadian delegation are
greatly indebted to Mr. Peter Dobell, a very
able officer of the External Affairs Department for some 16 years and who recently
resigned his post as head of the NATO desk
to found the Parliamentary Centre for Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade. In his new
capacity, Mr. Dobell attended all of our preparatory sessions here in Ottawa, and during
the meetings of the Assembly itself he played
an invaluable role in briefing the Canadian
delegation on developments at Brussels, and
in offering sound and well-balanced advice
when it was sought.
Honourable senators, the gathering in midNovember of the NATO Parliamentary Group
probably had a greater impact than any of
the other previous conferences. This was due
in part ta the fact that the five-day meeting
immediately preceded and for two days overlapped the NATO ministerial session. We
began on Monday and went through to late
Friday afternoon, while the ministers arrived
on Thursday and went through to Friday, and
the communique was issued on the Friday.
But, in no small measure it was-as I suggested at the outset tonight and also in my
remarks at the plenary session in Brusselsbecause both meetings came at a critical and
crucial time for the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
Since the Assembly last met, the brutal
invasion of Czechoslovakia by troops of Russia
and other Warsaw Pact nations effectively
crippled the liberalizing forces that were
helping to promote increasing national
independence among the countries of Eastern
Europe. That invasion has also effectively dispelled the growing illusions that these liberalizing forces would continue to spread
throughout the Soviet bloc and, in turn, lead
inevitably to a growing detente between East
and West. As I told the plenary session of the
North Atlantic Assembly, this piece of summer madness by the Soviet leaders may have
done more than shatter hopes for moving
towards a detente in Europe. It may lead to
sharp setbacks on other fronts as well, and it
,could endanger effective implementation of the
nuclear non-proliferation treaty, as I told the
NATO parliamentarians. Not only could it
thwart other moves towards disarmament, it
could also prove to be the decisive element in
the launching of a new nuclear arms race
between Russia and the United States.

December 17. 1968

The timing of this assembly was crucial,
because over the next several months NATO
and each member country will be engaged in
developing their policies and plans for the
future beyond the 20th anniversary of
NATO's founding. These developments hold
special significance for Canada because of the
far-reaching reassessment of the nation's
foreign and defence policies that are at present being undertaken by the Government.
The recent election of a new government to
office, the present international situation and
the forthcoming 20th anniversary of NATO
all combine to make this re-examination
highly appropriate. I equally welcome the
public debate going on throughout the length
and breadth of Canada which this review by
the Government bas helped to foster.
Honourable senators, my own view, as I
told the North Atlantic Assembly, is that:
It is inconceivable under these radically altered circumstances that now confront NATO-if indeed it was not inconceivable before-that Canada would seriously contemplate withdrawing its NATO
forces to Canadian soil, or substantially
reducing the level of its forces in Europe.
It is undoubtedly true, honourable senators,
that the major deterrent to world war has
been provided by what has been well described as the balance of terror between East
and West. In the case of the West, a major
guarantor of peace has been the strategic
nuclear armoury of the United States. But
surely there is little room for doubt that the
tactical nuclear and conventional forces
mobilized under the NATO alliance have also
played an important part in deterring communist aggression in Europe. As Canada's distinguished former prime minister, Lester
Pearson, pointed out during his current series
of Reith Lectures over the BBC, the strength
of NATO's conventional forces would not be
sufficient to resist for long an attack by the
much more numerous conventional forces of
the Warsaw Pact nations. I quote from Mr.
Pearson's words:
If NATO wished to defend itself
against aggression from eastern Europe,
it could not do so successfully at present
by the use of conventional forces against
the same kind of attack. It could only
make its collective will prevail by the
threat or the use of nuclear force, which
would mean taking the responsibility for
beginning a nuclear war and destroying
both sides in the process.

December 17, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Now, honourable senators, I believe it is of
fundamental importance to understand the
role that NATO's forces in Europe are intended to play. You will recall that in the early
days of NATO these forces were regarded
only as a kind of trip-wire-any major
encounter on their part with those from the
communist bloc being the signal for an all-out
nuclear counter-attack. In more recent years,
however, a very different concept of the role
of forces under NATO's command in Europe
has gradually evolved. It is now accepted that
the alliance must be able to respond in a
more flexible way to a confrontation with the
Soviet Union. Rather than being limited to a
decision involving a choice between surrender
and all-out nuclear war, it is essential that
the allies have available a wider choice, a
wider range of options.
The crucial need to develop both the capability of a flexible response and the wisdom
on the part of the decision-makers to weigh
these broader options against the challenge
confronting them was vividly demonstrated
six years ago. In the Cuban missile crisis, a
firm but restrained response by the late
President John F. Kennedy slowly brought
the world back from the brink of a nuclear
holocaust.
By the same token NATO's forces in
Europe have been gradually developed and
strengthened. These forces give the alliance
the capability of resisting temporarily, in the
event of a limited conflict with the Communists, and just such a conflict might be possible
as the result of an uprising in Eastern
Europe, or communist action against Berlin.
Therefore, these NATO forces provide the
hope that sanity would eventually prevent
both sides from rushing headlong into mutual
destruction.
We must recognize and accept the factbecause we cannot change it-that in the
event of a sudden, full-scale Russian nuclear
attack these NATO forces in Europe would
probably play very little real part as the
Allies responded by unleashing their own terrible strategic nuclear weapons.
Under less extreme circumstances, however, these forces under NATO command in
Europe could be of critical importance. They
could offer precious hours and even days for
negotiations which might forestall the annihilation of the world. In the ghastly situation
about which we speak, I do not think-and I
repeat for emphasis-I do not think it is
over-dramatic to suggest that these forces

could serve to buy time for eternity. In the
dangerous and uncertain world in which we
live, can we afford to discard the chance,
however slim, that these forces of NATO in
Europe could serve to stave off a global
disaster? Surely the answer is "No".
During the course of his addresses in the
Reith Lecture series, former Prime Minister
Pearson ably underlined the difficulties and
dangers presented by the current state of
international relationships and the cool and
level-headed judgment which they demand.
Once again I quote from Mr. Pearson's
address:
For all this, and in anything that I
have suggested, I am not advocating that
we abandon our military defences whenever things seem to be improving politically; any more than we should rush in
panic to add to them when there is a
setback.
Strong military power will have to be
retained as an agent of deterrence, as a
basic on which you can give strength to
your diplomacy and your negotiations,
while avoiding its provocative or threatening display like the plague.
Honourable senators, I am firmly convinced
that our combined military defences are not
only our best insurance against war, but also
our greatest hope of winning a more secure
and lasting peace.
Despite the setback to hopes of progressive
detente caused by the Czechoslovakian invasion, I am equally convinced that we must
constantly strive to establish broader and
deeper contacts with the countries of Eastern
Europe based, as these must be, on mutual
self-interest. But as Mr. Pearson suggested,
progress will only be made if we retain reasonable strength so that the Communists will
not be tempted to exploit our weakness.
What then should be Canada's aims for as
far ahead as we can see? Clearly the avoidance of nuclear war and the securing of a
more assured peace must rank as the first and
foremost objective of Canadian policy.
In my opinion, honourable senators, Canada's self-interest and its responsibilities as a
partner in the western world demand that our
country continue to do its share in contributing to a collective defence force that could
one day just possibly spell the difference
between survival and destruction.
After nearly twenty years of maintaining
forces on the continent of Europe, a number

SENATE DEBATES
of Canadians have become weary of the burden, or overly optimistic about the prospects
for avoiding a confrontation with the Soviet
bloc. Others have contended that, with the
strengthening of the forces of our European
allies, Canada could now make a greater contribution to peace by concentrating on North
American defence, or by concentrating on
peace-keeping operations, or by sharply
reducing defence expenditures and increasing
aid to developing countries.
Considering what is at stake, this is no time
to falter in our purpose. The events of this
summer make it clear that the day of friendship and understanding between East and
West may still be somewhat distant-and this
is most regrettable.
I fail to see how Canada could make a
greater contribution to peace by concentrating
more fully on North American defence. Defence against what, we must ask ourselves?
Against manned bombers? Against land-based
intercontinental ballistic missiles or submarine-based intermediate range ballistic missiles? Considering the obsolescence of bombers
and the existing inadequacies of defences
against missiles, I do not understand what
additional role we could reasonably perform
in Canada that would add significantly to the
security of North America itself.
I consider that the choices posed by some
Canadians between defence and foreign aid or
between participating in NATO and maintaining purely peace-keeping forces are false
choices, false options. It is not a question of
"either/or", but a question of finding a proper balance between al of these important
objectives of our nation.
Perhaps one of the most persuasive arguments for withdrawal of Canadian forces
from the continent is that they have become
relatively insignificant as a result of the
build-up of forces of the European members
of the alliance.
It is true that the Canadian forces in
Europe are neither particularly large nor particularly powerful in comparison with those
of some of our NATO allies. Ironically
enough, but also practically enough, Europeans attach a symbolic importance to these
forces which far exceeds the significance
which Canadians attach to their own contribution. This is a fact that was impressed on
me and on other members of the delegation
time and again by representatives of other
countries during the meetings of the North
Atlantic Assembly. To our general surprise,

December 17, 1968

we found that the Europeans and the Americans value the contribution we make in
Europe both for itself and, even as important,
because it constitutes reconfirmation of our
commitment to the principle of collective
defence. In short, we discovered, on this and
on other issues, that it is a mistake to assume
that our allies see things as we do. This fact,
of course, works both ways. I am pleased to
report that as a result of the more vigorous
and, I hope, effective participation of our
delegation in the conference proceedings, we
were told privately by the Secretary-General
of the Assembly that several Europeans had
been surprised to discover how much the
point of view of Canadian members of Parliament differed from that of American congressmen and senators.
This leads to another element which must
be seriously considered when weighing the
alternatives for Canadian external and
defence policy in the balance.
Just as Canada's participation in the
defence of NATO is highly regarded, so
would the withdrawal of Canadian forces
from Europe threaten to touch off a strongly
adverse reaction among our allies.
In a recent editorial, the Financial Post
maintained that Canadian officials attending
the NATO ministerial meeting "left Brussels
deeply impressed by the trade and diplomatie
row that will erupt if Canada pulls out."
In my view, Canada's influence with other
economically developed countries in the formulation of diplomatic, defence, economic
and monetary policies would be substantially
diminished. It is true that under a go-it-alone
approach we would have greater freedom to
frame policies more to our own liking, but
they would count for little or nothing in the
councils of the world.
If for no other reason, our national selfinterest-to say nothing of our national selfrespect-requires us to continue to serve as a
full NATO partner.
While I am unequivocally opposed to any
significant reduction in our contribution to
the NATO forces in Europe, this does not
mean that I see no purpose in the current
re-examination of our present foreign and
defence policies or the current debate about
these questions. On the contrary, I believe
that both of these processes are necessary and
healthy.
Just in the context of NATO, for example,
it is obvious that some important decisions
must soon be made regarding the future of

December 17, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

the Canadian air division after the CF-104
tactical nuclear bomber squadrons based in
Germany are phased out of operation. Equally
important decisions must also be made shortly about the future of air force squadrons
based in Canada. Indeed, honourable senators,
my only regret is that the current public discussion about defence matters has been largely confined to the question of whether or not
to pull back Canadian forces stationed in
Europe.
In my opinion, the time is overdue when
we should be seeking answers to searching
questions about the whole of our defence policy and the validity of the concepts on which it
is based. What role is our navy intended to
perform and what is its capability of performing that role? What role should be filled
in future by the Canadian air force?
While there has been much discussion
about the function of the Canadian brigade
group based in Germany, virtually nothing
has been said about the intended roles of the
three brigades based in Canada, which apparently are in the process of being reorganized
into four combat groups.
What role or roles are these troops intended to serve and how many troops are reasonably required to fulfill them? Even more to
the point, how realistic are the assumptions on
which those roles are based? Is it more
important to maintain the equivalent of a brigade group stationed in Canada to meet what
may be a remote contingency than to maintain the same number of troops in Europe as
a direct Canadian contribution to the collective security of the alliance?
I do not profess to know the answers
myself, honourable senators, but I do believe
that these are the kinds of questions we in
Parliament and the Canadian people should
be asking and to which we have the right to
expect answers.
I believe it is essential that we learn a
lesson from the fact that a growing number
of well-informed and responsible Canadians
in recent years have been raising questions
about our foreign and defence policies, in
particular whether their forces in Europe any
longer serve an important function.
As I told the North Atlantic Assembly in
Brussels, Canadians by nature are neither
neutralist nor isolationist. Nor have they in
the past shirked their responsibilities abroad.
But Canadians are not militarists by nature
either, and the simple fact is that NATO has

been confronted by a growing credibility gap
or, if you like, information gap, in this
country.
It is fundamental that NATO must develop
a structure and formulate both diplomatic
and military policies that relate to the realities of today rather than yesterday. But, as I
also told the North Atlantic Assembly:
It is not enough for those responsible
for directing the alliance to gather behind
closed doors and convince themselves
that what they are doing is right and
proper. They must also convince the electorate which pays the heavy bills submitted by their respective governments that
this undertaking continues to be a very
necessary investment in their own peace
and security.
Those responsible for directing the course
of NATO have in the past tended all too often
to overlook the vital necessity of maintaining
public support for the alliance, which in turn
demands the promotion of public understanding as a first prerequisite. Not only have they
tended to ignore the people as a whole, they
have also tended to pay very little attention
to the NATO parliamentarians.
But it becomes less and less possible with
every passing year to take public understanding and support of NATO for granted,
because every year produces an ever-growing proportion of our people that knows nothing of world war and has little real awareness, based on past experience, of the dangers posed by Russian expansionism.
In Canada, for example, nearly 50 per cent
of our population came into the world only
since the end of the last war. It is of fundamental importance, therefore, that we realize
that the maintenance of an informed and
enlightened public in the countries which
make up NATO will become an ever more
pressing task.
Those charged with its responsibility must
never forget that the future of the North
Atlantic Alliance depends ultimately on the
support of the people. They ignore that
imperative at their peril, and at ours.

DEBATES
Deceber17, 969SENATE

Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourabie senators, as
you will recail, on Thursday last I undertook
to deal further at this stage with the points
then raised by the honourable Senators Grosart and Flynn.
Senator Grosart drew the attention o!
honourable senators to the fact that eleven of
the items in the scheduie to the bill contain
phrases beginning with the word "notwithstanding" which have the appearance of setting aside the provisions of the Financial
Administration Act. Most o! these phrases are
not new; they have appeared in the tities o!
Estimates items for many years. Moreover, ini
most cases they do not ask authorîty beyond
the lirnits established under earlier practice.
In some cases, indeed, these phrases constitute an extension of the control by Parliament over expenditures.
The eleven items can be grouped as
follows:
In the first group are items in which
current year commitmnent authority and the
authority to spend revenues is sought. These
consist of the items on pages 5, 16, 25 and 26
o! the bill.
The Goverament has announced in Parliament that it has accepted the recommendation o! the Glassco Commission that
revenues should be offset against related
expenditures, where appropriate. This is what
is being done in the items in this category.
There are times, especially during the first
months o! the year, when contracts have to
be entered into that cail for the spending of
the gross amount provided in the vote. Since
the amnount o! the vote is the net amount,
authority is sought in the vote title to make
additlonal current-year commitmnents equivalent to the difference-that is, the anticipated
revenue--so that the contracts entered into
may meet the requirements of the Financial
Administration Act. Examples o! these types
of items are found on pages 18, 26 and 28 of
the bill.
In some cases the revenue is sufficiently
small relative to the gross requirement, or
comes in so regularly that no additional commîtment authority is required. In such cases

Now I corne to the second group which

includes items coataining language limiting
reading.

The assistant to the chief editorial writer who
once refused to join the guild now has taken
out membership without pressure of any sort.
The Thomson newspaper chain is highly
successful in terms of profits, but its record
in human relations can stand major improvements. I have seen the statement made time
and agaîn by Lord Thomson that he hasn't
got Urne to read his papers editorially or
otherwise, but he reads the financial sheet
very carefully. Moreover, hie is allergic to red
figures. I think that is true. There is a great
responsibility here and I think that the people
of Peterborough should make their voice
heard in demanding that the Examiner give
the workers decent wages and fair treatment.
We have at the present time a task force
that has been appointed by the Government
for the purpose of making a report on labourindustry relations. Such anti-labour happenings are certainly not goîng to assist us in
reaching any conclusions. Before we can projeet ourselves into new methods of dealing
with labour, we should at least have learned
to get along with the laws that are on the
statute books at the present time. These peopie are badly mistaken who at the present
time in their present mood and in their present orientation are dreaming about things
that are likely to happen to labour in the near
future. This may be a time o! the year when
people dreami of certain things, but if these
people are dreaming that in the course of
events there will be compulsory arbitration, I
think 1 can tell them now that our free society will not accept it. Certainly that point will
not be reached unless we learn to get along
with the existing laws which provide that
where a unit has been recognized for bargaining purposes, the bargaining must not go on
and on and on, but must be done in good
faith and quickly.
Honourable senators, the time has corne for
us to speak out and indicate that we have a
very large and important interest in keeping
industriai and labour peace in this country,
and that we will not get very inuch of it if we
find that people in high places are not bargaining in good faîth.

SENATE DEBATES
the total of commitments that departments
may make in the current and future years.
These are the items on pages 16 and 27 of the
bill.
The Financial Administration Act provides
that contracts, to be lawful, can be entered
into only if there is sufficient money in current year Estimates to meet the expenditures
contemplated for the current year by the contract. The act is silent, however, on the
implications of contracts for future years'
expenditures.
In some cases it is deemed in the public
interest to establish clearly that a limitation is
intended. This is the purpose in the two items
in this category to which I have just referred.
I now turn to the third group. In the title
of External Affairs Vote 1, the Administration
vote, on page 8 of the bill there are three
references to section 7 of the Financial
Administration Act. Each of these is given in
connection with the appointment and fixing of
the remuneration for various representatives
of Canada abroad. By custom, such appointment are made by the Governor in Council.
For administrative convenience authority is
sought in this vote title for the fixing of the
remuneration concerned by the Governor in
Council rather than by the Treasury Board.
Honourable senators, on the same occasion
the honourable Senator Flynn, the Leader of
the Opposition, asked two questions. The first
was:
... would the Acting Leader tell us what

is the estimated deficit for the fiscal year
ending March 31 next?
The answer is that the estimated deficit, as
given in the Budget Speech delivered by the
Honourable E. J. Benson on October 22, 1968,
for the fiscal year 1968-69, was $675 million.
This is the latest estimate available. The revision to the forecast deficit is due mainly to
the large programs that are financed jointly
with the provincial governments. These programs were discussed by the Minister of
Finance in his Budget Speech, and honourable senators may refer to this speech for a
more detailed explanation.
His second question had to do with ". ..the

prospectus which the Government filed with
the Exchange and Securities Commission last
summer..."
Although the honourable senator referred
to "last summer," I take it that he was referring rather to the document which was filed

December 17, 1968

in May, 1968 before the Exchange and Securities Commission in Washington, D.C. I said
the other day that there was no assurance
given by the Minister of Finance as to the
total expenditures for the then coming year,
although the minister gave the forecast of
expenditures for that vear without giving a
definite assurance as to what the actual
amount will be.
The purpose of the prospectus tabled on
May 28, 1968 with the Securities and
Exchange Commission in Washington, D.C.
was to provide financial information on the
Canadian economy, external trade, government finances, public debt and other areas of
interest to the prospective purchasers of the
bonds which were being offered for sale. This
type of information or prospectus is provided
each time the Government of Canada goes to
the bond market.
As part of this financial information made
available to the commission and to the purchasers of the bonds, there was the
announced intention to hold the budgetary
expenditures to a level of $10,300 million,
apart from medical care insurance programs
and write-off of the Expo '67 deficit. Since the
Government has not been required to return
to the bond market, no further prospectus has
been filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
Hon. Allister Grosari: Honourable senators,
I thank Senator Langlois for the prompt
answer he has given to the questions I raised
on Thursday in connection with what I call
the "notwithstanding" items. I rise at this
time merely to make it clear that I am not
satisfied with the explanation he has given.
He bas covered the eleven items that I mentioned, but I must say that the first explanation given, that this has been going on for a
long time, does not, in my opinion, justify the
continuance of this unsatisfactory practice.
I associate myself with the remarks made
by Senator Connolly (Ottawa West) who followed me on Thursday last, and I take his
general conception of what might be done in
this regard as the text for my own position. It
still does not seem to me to make any sense
that a supply bill-one of many that come to
us in the course 'of a year-should of necessity set aside provisions of the Financial
Administration Act in respect of eleven items.
If this is necessary, then it seems to me it is
time to amend the Financial Administration
Act to provide for these situations.

December 17, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

One of these items concerns supply for the
Department of External Affairs and it
includes, as I understand it, the salaries and
expenses of all our ambassadors, high commissioners, consulates, and others abroad. If
it is desirable-and I can understand that it
may well be-to exempt those appointments
from the requirements of the Financial
Administration Act, which would put them
under the Public Service Commission, then
surely it is time to amend the Financial
Administration Act so that every time these
particular items of supply come up we will
not be asked to set aside its provisions.
My second comment is, as I mentioned on
last Thursday, that we have an undertaking
that in future these "notwithstanding" items
and the $1 items be explained individually to
the Standing Committee on Finance, and
through it to the Senate. I suggest to Senator
Langlois that he might do well to look up that
undertaking, so that when the Finance Committee meets again to consider a supply bill
we can expect to be given a mimeographed
sheet containing a specific explanation of
every $1 item, and of every item in a supply
bill that sets aside an Act of Parliament. The
honourable senator might find that suggestion, when pressed home, to be a better system than the present practice in which officials get into a certain mould and carry it
on because no member seems to object. I
strongly object to the setting aside of an Act
of Parliament year after year in connection
with the same items, when the proper course
seems to be the amendment of the governing
act.
Again, I thank the honourable sponsor of
this bill for the care he has taken, but I point
out that he has grouped the eleven items, and
given general explanations. What I asked for
was an individual explanation of each item. I
am not asking for it today, but I do think the
chamber is entitled to an explanation of the
reason for the setting aside of the Financial
Administration Act, and other acts, in every
single case in respect of which we are asked
to do that. An appropriation bill in this context is a request to this chamber to set aside
an act of Parliament for a specifie purpose
and for a specific reason, and all I am asking
is that we be given this specific purpose and
specific reason before we decide to set aside a
statute such as the Financial Administration
Act, the basic purpose of which is to control
the spending of public funds.

me to let go unchallenged a remark he made.
He mentioned that in respect of the items
setting aside some of the provisions of the
Financial Administration Act the first reason
I gave for this was that it had been the
practice to do so. I did not say that, as the
record will show. I merely said that these
phrases were not new.
The first reason I gave was that the Government had announced that it had accepted
the recommendation of the Glassco Commission that revenues should be offset against
expenditures, and that the Government was
merely doing this by the items in group one,
which items are to be found at pages 5, 16, 25,
and 26 of the bill.
As to the suggestion that in the future
honourable senators should be provided with
an explanation of each item in respect of
which the provisions of the Financial
Administration Act are being set aside, I am
told that the officers of the Treasury will be
very pleased to supply this information
whenever they are requested to do so by the
Standing Committee on Finance. As I have
mentioned earlier in this debate, the Estimates covered by the present bill are still
before the Finance Committee, and notwithstanding the fact that we are debating this bill
now, any honourable senator-and he does
not have to be a member of the Standing
Committee on Finance-can apply to that
committee to obtain whatever information he
needs as to any of the items contained in this
bill.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I rise on a question of
privilege, honourable senators. If I misunderstood Senator Langlois, or misinterpreted
what he said, of course, I apologize. I certainly had no intention of misinterpreting his
remarks.

Hon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson: Honourable
senators, it seems to me that Senator Croll
has taken the occasion of a debate on the
motion for the third reading of a supply bill
to make a vicious and personal attack against
a noted individual, against a group of Canadians, and against a Canadian company. My
sense of fair play tells me that the matter
should not rest there. In my view, the people
who have been attacked by Senator Crol
should be allowed at least to indicate to some
honourable senator on either side of the house
whether they have anything to say in reply to
this attack.
Consequently, I beg leave to move the
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, I
am sure that Senator Grosart would not wish adjournment of the debate.

SENATE DEBATES

On motion of Hon. Mr. Thorvaldson, debate

CENSUS AND STATISTICS
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ADOPTED

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the Report of the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce on the inquiry
authorized by the Senate on 10th October,
1968, into existing legislation regarding the
census and statistics and the administration of
such legislation, which was presented on
December 11.
Hon. T. D'Arcy Leonard moved adoption of
the report.
He said: Honourable senators, on October
10 last, on a motion by Senator Carter and
after a debate, it was resolved by the Senate
that the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce be authorized to inquire into and
report upon existing legislation regarding the
census and statisties and upon the administration of such legislation, and recommend any
changes in such legislation and administration
required to establish and develop the census
and statistics as a vital efficiency aid to the
good government of Canada, and the
advancement of proper business in the public
interest.
Since October 10 the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce has had probably
ten meetings or more in its legislative capacity dealing with bills referred to it by the
Senate, both public and private bills, and it
did not have the time or opportunity to
devote attention to this special inquiry directed to it concerning the census and statistics.
As acting chairman of the committee last
week, I brought the matter before the committee on Wednesday last, and after a discussion it appeared to the committee that the
subject-matter of the motion referred to it
was such that, in trying to work it out along
with its legislative duty dealing with bills
referred to it, it was not going to be able to
give the time and study required by a matter
of this importance. In the result, Senator
Carter moved the resolution that is now
before you, the effect of which is that the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, having considered the terms of the
inquiry so authorized, is agreed that such
inquiry should be undertaken by a special
committee of the Senate to be constituted for
that purpose, and so recommends. This is the

December 17, 1968

essence of the report submitted to you for
your consideration.
Motion agreed to.
CRIMINAL CODE (HATE PROPAGANDA)
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck moved the second
reading of Bill S-21, to amend the Criminal
Code.
He said: Honourable senators, in days gone
by this bill was a highly controversial measure, and I suppose it is yet, but as it appears
on the Order Paper tonight I think it is purely routine. With one very small and inconsequential amendment it is exactly the same
bill as the one we referred to a committee
prior to the election of 1967.
The original bill was S-49. It was read on
November 7, 1966, quite some time ago. In
that bill the very last item was:
(d) "judge" means a judge of a court
or, in the province of Quebec, a district
magistrate.
The present bill leaves out the words "a
district magistrate" and substitutes "a judge
of the provincial court". That is where an
application is made to a judge, or to the
magistrate previously, for a warrant for the
seizure of alleged hate propaganda.
The explanation is a very simple one.
Legislation was passed in the Legislature of
Quebec changing the name "magistrate" to
"judge of a provincial court", so that the parties are exactly the same. No change is made
except in the name. I mention it because that
is the only change in this bill from Bill S-49,
or the later Bill S-5.
I introduced Bill S-49 on November 9, 1966,
and I closed the debate on March 20, 1967.
That is to say, the debate ran on for five
months, and as many as 29 senators were
heard in that debate. I would not speak with
authority, but it seems to me that it was
perhaps the best debated bill we have had
before this chamber for a long time. We were
not all agreed on the measure, certainly not
entirely, but there were some things upon
which we did agree. The important one so far
as we are now concerned was that it should
be referred to a committee for further study.
There was not so much objection taken to the
objective of the bill as to the bill itself, so it
was thought at that time, on both sides of the
house, that the proper procedure was to refer
it to a committee in the hope that it could be
made more satisfactory to all of us.

December 17, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Very shortly after that the session was
prorogued and a new session reassembled on
May 8, 1967. Then, on May 9, 1967, a succeeding bill in exactly the same terms, numbered
S-5, was introduced. On Noveniber 2, 1967,
Senator Connolly (Ottawa West) moved,
seconded by Senator Bourget, that the bill be
referred to a committee. There had been a
discussion prior to that and he named the
committee and its personnel. On November
21, 1967, I moved, seconded by Senator Deschatelets, the second reading of Bill S-5, and
then it was that Senator Flynn moved, seconded by Senator Choquette, that the bill be not
read a second time but that the subject matter of the bill be referred to a special committee for study and report. That motion was
negatived and a further motion was carried
giving the bill second reading.
I would just like to refer to the debate,
which was very short on that occasion. Senator Flynn said:
I agree that we need not repeat the
debate we had in the previous session.

At the same time, of course, I am not standing in the way of anyone else who wants to
discuss it and exercise his right of free
speech, but if you see fit at the present
moment to give it second reading I will at
once move that it be referred to one of the
standing committees recently constituted.
That is all I have to say, honourable senators. It is purely a matter of routine at the
moment in order to let a committee go on
with its work.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators,
we will not stand in the way of second reading being given to this bill tonight, but I
really want to say that those who objected to
the bill were not objecting to the purpose of
the bill. We merely said that we did not see
the need for this bill, and I just want to put
on the record the fact that since the first and
second bills were introduced nothing has happened to show any necessity for such a bill.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Nor any change.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: Of course not. If it be the

and Constitutional Affairs.
And indeed we did have a very thoroughgoing debate.
The situation is almost exactly the same at
this moment. The committee did meet, but
only three times. They met on February 14
and 29, and on March 7, 1968. On April 23,
1968, Parliament was dissolved and so the
work of the committee came to an abrupt
end. A new Parliament re-assembled on September 12, 1968. Bill S-21, now before us, is
in exactly the same terms as was the original
Bill S-49 and its successor, Bill S-5, with the
slight changes in the names of the parties, in
that they are not magistrates now but judges
of the provincial courts.
It seems to me appropriate under the
circumstances of having sponsored the first
bill and moved second reading, that I now
sponsor this bill and move its second reading, because it is purely routine to send
it back to a committee. I do not intend to
make any comments with regard to the bill;
that, I think, is now the work of a coimmittee.

SECOND READING AND REFERENCE TO

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I

that Bill S-21 be referred to the Standing

Affairs. Our official advisers have informed
me that that comnmittee is not yet properly
constituted and the bill cannot now be sent to
it. Therefore, with leave of the Senate, I

we did not believe in the value of keeping in
personal touch with the rest of the world on
the parliamentary level. Be that as it may, I
must say that attendance at these conferences
causes one to be dedicated and imbued, as in
no other way, with the principle of the
supremacy of parliament.

The 56th annual conference of the Union
was held in the shadow of the Warsaw Pact
nations' attack on Czechoslovakia. Hence the
whole tenor of the debate on political questions such as the draft resolution on colonialism and neo-colonialism and on the United
Nations' resolution regarding non-intervention
of states in the domestic affairs of other states
and the protection of their independence and
sovereignty, reflected these recent events in
Europe.

December 17, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Grant Deachman, M.P., who spoke for
the Canadian delegation, reminded participants of the strong stand the Canadian
Government had taken against the intervention in Czechoslovakia's domestic
affairs by the invading foreign forces and
he asked the U.S.S.R. delegates to take
the example of parliamentarians in other
countries who had waged bitter and
successful battles for parliamentary
supremacy. Mr. Deachman stated that
"acts such as that committed against
Czechoslovakia were not made by nations
in which parliaments and people were
supreme".
Perhaps, and indeed I have no doubt of
this, the parliaments of the Warsaw Pact
nations, including the U.S.S.R., take great
pride in their efficiency, yes, their efficiency,
which means, perhaps, much more to them
than the freedom to speak.
Included in the report annexed as an
appendix to Hansard of December 10 is a
transcript of the resolutions accepted by the
Conference. In my remarks I will refer only
to one of those, namely, No. 3, headed:
"Methods of providing aid to developing
countries through stable prices for exported
products, development of primary industries
and effective financial assistance." I refer to
this because it was my privilege to speak to
this question at a plenary session of the conference in Lima.
This resolution brings up one of the problems of today's world, namely, aid to developing countries.
As you will see from the heading, there are
three facets to the problem:
(1) Stable prices for exported products; that
is, for the exports of these under-developed
countries.
(2) Development of primary industries.
(3) Effective financial assistance.
As to this problem, the members of the
Senate Standing Committee on External Relations were given, during the last session, an
excellent review of Canada's role in the field
of aid to developing countries, by Mr. Maurice F. Strong, Director-General, External
Aid Office. Canada is now a major participant
in this field, our present annual contribution
being over the sum of $300 million U.S. This
amounts to about 5 per cent of the total contribution of all donor countries. In fact, we
have now presumably made a commitment
with ourselves to increase this contribution

by 1970 to an amount equal to one per cent of
our then GNP. When we consider that in that
year our GNP may be up as high as $80
billion, one per cent of that will be a sizeable
amount. In this context I merely want to say
that many other nations seriously question
whether present methods of foreign aid,
involving these huge expenditures by donor
countries, are as useful as they ought to be to
these under-developed countries, and consequently many countries have in recent
months been reducing their commitments to
such countries.
I believe that a massive inquiry by some
committee of Parliament should be made into
this whole problem, and that should be done
soon. Consequently, considering the escalation
of the demands of the under-developed countries for aid; considering the fact that other
countries than Canada seem to be reducing
instead of increasing their commitments to
these countries; considering also the grave
doubts many people hold as to whether aid
dollars really help the needy or merely enrich
the well-to-do; considering the fantastie disparity in the wealth of people in these countries-considering all this, it is my view that
we in Canada should institute a far-reaching
inquiry as to how best to deal with this problem of external aid. This could be of importance both to ourselves and to the underdeveloped countries.
This is one of the problems which was
debated at great length in the Lima Conference. There was reference to the various conferences that had been held under United
Nations auspices. The conference at New
Delhi attended on behalf of Canada by the
Honourable Robert Winters last February was
one such conference dealing with this subject.
Unfortunately, that conference cannot be said
to have been a success. As you know, the
under-developed countries are most desirous
of having a system of tariffs whereby they
can get preferences from the wealthy countries of the world. They want a system which
these countries find very difficult under present
trading arrangements and in the light of the
Kennedy Round and the tariff arrangements
that are being made now. Consequently, I
say this is a matter of tremendous importance
not only to the world and to the underdeveloped countries but also to the big donor
countries-such as Canada is today.
There is a tendency at these conferences of
the Inter-Parliamentary Union to talk and
associate with parliamentarians from every
country in the world, and you receive a dedi-

FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE
FOUNDATION OF THE NATIONAL
UNIVERSITY OF RWANDA
VISIT TO FRENCH-SPEAKING COUNTRIES IN
AFRICA

Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators,
with leave of the Senate, I would like to
report about the trip to Africa I undertook a
few weeks ago on behalf of the government.
As you know, I came back last Saturday
from a trip which took me to several African
countries. The Prime Minister had asked me
to represent the Canadian government at the
ceremonies marking the 5th anniversary of
the foundation of the national university of
Rwanda. I took that opportunity to stop in
five other African countries and pay a call on
their leaders with whom I discussed matters
of mutual interest. That explains why, in
addition to Rwanda, I made successive stops
over in Niger, Senegal, the Ivory Coast,
Ghana and the Democratic Republic of the
Congo.
In Niger, I met the President of the Republie, Mr. Diori Hamani, the President of the
National Assembly, Mr. Abbou Baba, and
most members of the government. I discussed
with President Diori of the Canadian
representation to the conference he convened
in Niamey with a view to developing bonds
between French-speaking countries. I told
him that the Canadian government had
agreed to take part in that conference and
wished to send a delegation made up, apart
from representatives of the federal Government, of delegates from Quebec and other
provinces having a significant French-speaking minority. President Diori said he was
happy to see Canada reaffirming its interest
in the French-speaking commonwealth.
I wish to take this opportunity to commend
the eminent personality of President Diori
Hamani. As Chairman of the joint African
and Madagascan Organization made up of
fourteen African French-speaking countries,

he has become, along with President Senghor
of Senegal and Bourguiba of Tunisia, one of
the main builders of the French-speaking
commonwealth. He is the one who took it
upon himself to call that conference which
was to be held in Niamey on December
15th but which, as a result of the difficulty to
bring together at that time all the countries
concerned, had to be postponed. We hope it
will take place in the early months of 1969.
However, I could notice during these talks
between President Diori and the Canadian
government that there was a complete agreement as to the way the French-speaking commonwealth should develop. As I have stated
many times, when I was Secretary of State
for External Affairs, we see in it mainly a
means to promote cultural exchanges between
French-speaking countries and to assert the
presence of the French language in the world,
exclusive of any political objective.
I took advantage of my conversations with
Niger authorities to sum up the situation with
regard to the numerous co-operative projects
implemented by the Chevrier mission. I was
able to advise them that work would soon
start at the Mariamma Lycée at Niamey. That
lycée, founded 12 years ago by Canadian
nuns and run by them in an exemplary fashion, was the object of a special request from
the Niger government with which we complied. I myself visited the lycée during my
visit to Niamey and expressed vive voce to
the Canadian nuns the admiration of the
Canadian government and the Canadian people for the dedicated work they are performing over there.
I cannot stress enough just how favourably
impressed I was by that country with which
Canadians are not yet too familiar. Located at
the cross-roads in the heart of Africa, it has
been from the earliest times the ideal spot for
meetings and exchanges. Rich in minerals,
but less fertile than its neighbours to the
South, it is being faced with difficult development problems. I hope that within the
French-speaking commonwealth, an increasing number of exchanges will be possible
between our two countries.
The next lap of my trip took me to Senegal, where I met that great friend of Canada,
President Léopold Sédar Senghor. President
Senghor is, as everyone knows, the principal
promoter of the French-speaking commonwealth. I was able to discuss the matter with
him, as well as the main international problems of the day. I also took advantage of my

SENATE DEBATES
visit to discuss with several members of the
Senegalese government questions of common
interest to our countries and in particular to
review the progress achieved through the
implementation of the projects approved by
the Chevrier mission. I noted that the ties of
friendship between Senegal and Canada are
solidly entrenched. And I am happy to note
that, through the facilities of our embassy at
Dakar, our exchanges with this country are
ever increasing.
My next stop was the Ivory Coast where I
had the honour of meeting, for the first time,
its dynamic President, Félix HouphouetBoigny. I soon realized that Mr. HouphouetBoigny knows Canada well. He and I had
most interesting exchanges of views on some
international problems. I also spoke with him,
and with several members of the Ivory Coast
government, of the co-operative projects we
support over there.
The Ivory Coast, in full development, is
one of the few countries in Africa that can
hope to overcome its development problems in
the foreseeable future; it certainly deserves
very special attention. During my talks with
President Houphouet-Boigny, I expressed the
hope that the relations between our two countries may develop promptly.
I emphatically add that, in my opinion, the
Canadian presence in those French-speaking
countries is advisable and has become quite
essential.
After my visit in Abidjan, the capital of
the Ivory Coast, I made a brief stop in Accra
in order to board a plane for Rwanda. Nevertheless, I had the opportunity to meet the
Minister of External Affairs, Mr. Aanin, with
whom I had some profitable talks.
From Accra, I flew to Entebbe in Uganda
where a plane took me at first to Kigali,
capital of Rwanda, and finally to Butaré, the
seat of the National University of Rwanda.
I had the honour to take part, as a Canadian government representative, in the ceremonies marking the fifth anniversary of the
founding of that university. I had the pleasure of being present when President Kayibanda of Rwanda received an honorary doctorate. President Kayibanda is to be credited
with having realized the importance of education for his country. He sounded out Reverend Father G. H. Lévesque of Quebec city,the city where our Opposition Leader comes
from-to head that university, and he has
always sustained his efforts with a view to
establishing the institution on a sound basis. I

also had the pleasure of seeing there my old
friend, Father Lévesque, and ail the Canadian
professors who devote their time and energy
to promote the development of the university.
Canada and ail the countries which contributed to its success can be proud of
the National University of Rwanda. Education is, without a doubt, essential to the
improvement of conditions in developing
countries. I am particularly glad to have been
associated personally and right from the start
with this most important undertaking.
The Democratic Republic of the Congo was
the last stage of this African journey. In leaving Rwanda and going through Burundi, I
was able to fly over this vast country from
one end to the other and to realize its great
size and diversity. The Congo went through a
difficult period following its accession to
independence but, since then, order and stability have been re-established. This country,
one of the biggest in Africa both with regard
to size and population, will therefore be able
to devote itself entirely to the task of developing its great natural resources and its
economy.
I had the honour of meeting in Kinshasa
the young and dynamic President of that
country, General Mobutu. In the name of the
Canadian government, I invited him to visit
Canada, and he accepted. I therefore hope to
have the pleasure, along with the government
and the members of parliament, of welcoming
him in this country in the coming year.
I had the opportunity of talking with several Congolese ministers. Our conversations
with the leaders of that country dealt with
many topics, such as Canadian participation
in international conferences, the present problems on the international scene, and the cooperation projects which we have with the
Congo.
This too brief and too short a trip allowed
me to see and to know only one very small
part of the countries which I have visited.
However,
I have
been extraordinarily
impressed with the vitality of these young
countries and with the will of their leaders to
tackle intelligently and firmly the tremendous
problems of development which confront
them. Canada has already established worthwhile links with the Commonwealth African
nations. It seeks now to develop and extend
those which have already been established
with the French-speaking countries of that
continent. I felt that they were close to us,
due to our linguistic and cultural affinities,

Decernber 18, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

and was happy to see that Canada was undertaking with them the great task of co-operation. Now that this trip is over, I especially
remember the remark made to me by President Houphouet-Boigny, of the Ivory Coast,
to the effect that Canada, which unites two
great cultures, prefigured the future of
English-speaking and French-speaking Africa.
I come back from that trip with the very
distinct impression that Canada can make to
those uncommitted countries of the world an
actual and efficient contribution and that in
the process it can be of service to itself
through a clearer expression of what makes
its worth and its value as a nation.

ANTI-DUMPING
EXAMINATION OF WHITE PAPER-REPORT
OF COMMITTEE ADOPTED

Hon. T. D'Arcy Leonard, Acting Chairman
of the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce, presented the following report:
The Standing Committee on Banking
and Commerce to which was referred the
"White Paper on Anti-Dumping", has in
obedience to the order of reference of
December 9th, 1968, examined same and
reports as follows:
Your committee bas considered the
White Paper on Anti-Dumping tabled in
the Senate on December 9th, 1968, and in
particular the draft bill contained at
pages 40 to 100 thereof. Your committee
has also considered the amendments to
such draft bill proposed by the Standing
Committee on Finance, Trade and
Economie Affairs of the House of Commons as reported in the Journals of that
House on December 9th, 1968.
Your committee recommends the draft
bill, amended as so proposed, to the
Senate for its favourable consideration.
If Bill C-146, "An Act respecting the
imposition of anti-dumping duty", now in
the House of Commons, reaches the
Senate in a form materially different
from the draft bill as amended by the
Standing Committee on Finance, Trade
and Economic Affairs of the House of
Commons, then your committee recommends that such Bill C-146 be referred to
this committee for consideration.

December 18, 1968

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into
consideration?
Hon. Mr. Leonard, with leave of the Senate,
moved the adoption of the report.
He said: Honourable senators, the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce bas
had three meetings dealing with the White
Paper on Anti-Dumping and the proposed
draft bill. Two meetings were held last week
and a third was held this morning. We had
before us as witnesses Mr. Arthur from the
Department of Finance, Mr. Labarge, Deputy
Minister of National Revenue, Mr. Hind, the
Assistant Deputy Minister, and Mr. MacDermid, Chief of the Evaluation Section of the
Department of National Revenue.
As most of our senators were quite familiar
with trade matters involving tariffs and antidumping, the consideration that was given to
the reference to us was quite thorough and
sufficient for us to report back this afternoon.
To give you the background of the reference to the committee of the White Paper, I
should like to say that it is one of the results
of the Kennedy Round of tariff negotiations
between GATT countries. It was recognized
in those negotiations that no matter what
agreement was reached with respect to reduction of tariffs there would be other matters
that could interfere with the results of those
tariff reductions-matters involving things
like anti-dumping, where the prevalence or
the existence of dumping might in itself
either interfere with the other arrangements
as to trade or, in some cases, nullify them.
As various countries in GATT had different
laws and different methods of administration of dumping and of dumping legislation,
it was desirable to bring about some international code respecting dumping. This was
arrived at in the Kennedy Round negotiations, and those countries completing the
tariff agreements came to an agreement
to bring in an international code dealing with
anti-dumping. Canada was one of the countries that agreed to bring this code into effect.
In the case of other countries it has been
brought into effect as of lst July 1968, but in
Canada's case it was agreed that the changes
in our law should come into effect as of lst
January 1969. Therefore our legislation
should be enacted before that date.
I think I should say at the outset that the
form in which this international code is being
brought into effect in Canada is one that

December 18, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Senator Roebuck has often urged upon us,
and follows a principle with which I entirely
agree. The code is being brought into effect
by a statute which changes our existing laws,
rather than by an act which simply ratifies an
agreement already reached.
To deal with the changes that are intended
by this legislation it is necessary to go back to
the law with respect to dumping as it has
existed in Canada for a long time. Our law
goes back to 1904. Mr. Fielding, the then
Minister of Finance, brought in the first antidumping legislation, and it has not been
changed much in the intervening years.
Honourable senators, the subject is rather a
technical one, and I may not be fully
qualified to deal with it, but I think I can
explain it in fairly simple terms. Our law, as
it has existed for al these years, defined
"dumping" as the difference between the selling price of an imported product and its fair
market value. The difference by which the
fair market value exceeded the selling price
constituted dumping. This dumping was subject to duty if it applied to goods of a class or
kind made in Canada. The definition of
"goods of a class or kind made in Canada",
was made by order in council, and it too has
existed for a long time. That definition was a
simple one: If 10 per cent of the Canadian
consumption of the goods were produced in
Canada, then the goods were of a class or
kind made in Canada. If less than 10 per
cent, then the goods were of a class or kind
not made in Canada. So, the application of
a dumping duty was automatic if the selling
price of the goods was below the fair market
value, and if 10 per cent of the goods or more
was made in Canada.
The anti-dumping laws in other countries
were on a different basis. Some countries
complained about the Canadian system, and
in turn Canada and Canadian exporters
of goods to other countries sometimes
felt that they were up against unfair dumping
laws. This led to the bringing into effect of an
international anti-dumping code which would
apply to all countries signing it.
The changes that will be made by the new
legislation are material changes both in principle and in practice. In the first instance,
dumping is defined to be the export of goods
at an "export price" below the normal value
of those goods. There are regulations and sections dealing with the determination of "normal value", and while on the face of it there
may not be a great difference between this

and the former definition of dumping, in
actual practice I think it will be found that
the new definition is more accurate and is
more likely to prove whether or not dumping
in fact exists.
The other principle to be introduced in the
legislation and which is in the code, is something quite new to Canada. That is, in addition to proving dumping, the dumping must
cause injury or be capable of causing injury
to Canada industry, and particularly to any
Canadian industry that is in its infancy and
hopes to become greater in size and importance. Previously, if the product of an industry was less than 10 per cent of Canadian
consumption it had no protection against
dumping, but under this new principle of
injury the infant industry can be protected if
it can show that injury would be done to it.
To implement this new concept the proposed
legislation sets up a tribunal of five persons
who will be full-time and who will be selected from outside the public service. This tribunal will determine whether or not injury to
Canadian industry is created or caused by
this dumping. These are the essential changes
in the proposed legislation.
Honourable senators, I do not think it is
necessary for me at this time to go into details
of the proposed legislation. I would simply
say that the White Paper and the draft bill
which is in the White Paper were submitted
to a committee of the House of Commons in
October, which committee dealt with it over a
period of time that concluded only recently
and it then made a report to the House of
Commons. The bill, together with amendments
proposed by the Commons committee, was
introduced last evening in the other place as
Bill C-146, and it is now being dealt with
there. As yet it has not reached us.
For that reason, our committee is reporting
to you today that we have considered the
White Paper and the draft bill and the amendments recommended by the House of Commons committee and report them to you for
your favourable consideration. The committee
goes on to say that if Bill C-146, when it does
reach the Senate, contains any material
change from the draft bill in the White Paper
and the amendments proposed by the House
of Commons committee, it should be referred
back to the Standing Committee on Banking
and Commerce. Otherwise, if the bill contains
no material changes it is in the hands of this
chamber to decide whether or not to refer the
bill back to the committee.
Report adopted.

from our hotel. We proceeded to Harbin, and
there took on supplies for our trip across
Siberia by train. Despite the fact that it was
already winter we were comfortable and well
looked after, but because of war conditions in
China and Manchuria there were few passengers on the train. From Moscow we proceeded
to Warsaw, which I had visited as a student,
then through Berlin and the Hook of Holland
to London, Southampton, and New York, and
finally, just before Christmas with about ten
cents in our collective pockets, we arrived
back in Toronto.
In 1958, while President of the University
of British Columbia, and also President of
our National Committee for UNESCO, I was
invited by the Canadian Government to go, as
the leader of the Canadian delegation, to the
General Conference of UNESCO in Paris.
This too was an exciting experience in that
the new buildings of UNESCO had just been
completed and were being formally opened.
The Canadian delegation was both a good and
a large one. France itself, with de Gaulle in
the wings but not yet in power, was an
interesting place to be.
Following this conference, Mrs. MacKenzie
and I spent a few days with our ambassador
in Bonn, Mr. Escott Reid, who is now the
Principal of Glendon College of York University in Toronto. This was a very happy
visit, because Escott Reid was one of my first
and best students at the University of Toronto. He was, as I remember it, a contemporary
of Senator Grosart and Senator Walker, and I
am sure they both remember him and have a
high regard for him.
Returning now to the real purpose of
addressing you, namely, to describe the two
weeks I spent as a parliamentary observer at
the Assembly of the United Nations in New
York, I should like first to pay tribute to our
permanent representative there, Ambassador
George Ignatieff and the young men and
women from the Department of External
Affairs who are with him, and our representatives and alternates to the Assembly itself.
They are all, in my opinion, excellent, and
Canada is fortunate to be served by men and
women of their ability, intelligence and education. George Ignatieff is particularly outstanding, and is probably one of the wisest
and most experienced of the representatives
of any nation present at the Assembly.
My colleagues, the other five parliamentary
observers, were all good. They took their responsibilities seriously, and were in attendance

December 18. 1968

every day at the committees of the Assembly
or the plenary sessions of that body.
One of the first things that impressed me
about the plenary sessions and the committee
meetings was the almost impossible task of
getting agreement among such a large and
varied group of representatives of the nations
of the world.
At the present time there are, I believe, 126
members, all of whom have equal votes,
although some, in terms of their populations,
are by no means equal. For example, the
Maldive Islands have a population of less
than 100,000, and other countries with similarly limited populations, resources, and
experience are represented at the United
Nations. In many respects it is absurd that
countries as small as these should be regular
members of the United Nations on a basis of
equality with the great powers, such as the
U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R., or with India which
has a population of 440 million people. This
situation is further complicated by the fact
that there are now some 42 African states,
some 25 Asian States, and some 24 Latin
American states which are members.
If these groups combine, as they frequently
do, they can completely out-vote and override
the representatives of the western nations. If
one adds the further complication of the communist bloc and of mainland China, which is
not represented at all, one begins to wonder
whether there is any place or security for a
country like Canada, or, for that matter, any
member of the Western bloc, save perhaps
the U.S.A.
However, it is important and valuable to
have a forum in which the representatives of
all these nations can express their opinions,
present their problems, and inform and educate each other about themselves and their
people. In addition, when practical matters
rather than political issues are being considered, sensible and important results are frequently achieved.
Then too the world we live in is one in
which realities must be recognized. One of
these realities is the power of such countries
as the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. This is recognized in the United Nations through the
Security Council, which is a relatively small
body with only fifteen members, five of
which-the U.S.S.R., the U.S.A., Great Britain, France and Taiwan-are permanent. The
other ten members are elected, and they
represent, or so it is hoped and planned, the
rest of the world according to the groups or

December 18, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

origins to which they belong. This small but
powerful body is further strengthened by the
fact that any of the great powers-that is,
any one of the permanent members-may
veto any proposal or decision of the Council
itself.
There were not many plenary sessions of
the Assembly while we were in New York,
but the Assembly did deal with some
interesting and important questions in its plenary sessions, including the decision to refuse
again admission to the United Nations of
Mainland China, which incidentally, in my
opinion, was a mistake.
There was also an effort to deal with the
problem of the former colony of German
South-West Africa, which has been under the
control and jurisdiction of South Africa ever
since 1919, the end of World War I. The
nations of Africa are most insistent that this
territory be removed from the control of
South Africa and established as a separate
and independent nation. With a view to
achieving this, the United Nations, on their
insistence, a year or more ago appointed a
council and a commissioner to govern the territory, but South Africa has refused to recognize this council or to allow the council or the
commissioner to enter South-West Africa. In
the meantime, the African members have
tried to have the name of the area changed to
Namibia and the United Nations will probably go along with this.
I spent some time in each of the six committees but gave most attention to the work
of the sixth committee, which was concerned
with the definition of "aggression", and so
within the general area of international law.
This definition of "aggression" would, if
agreed upon, justify intervention by the United Nations and the use of collective force
against aggression, as was done in Korea in
the early 1950s. Little if any progress was
made in this committee, and I was reminded
of the fact that in 1924, when I was present in
the Assembly of the League of Nations in
Geneva, the representatives there were discussing the same problem in very much the
same terms and with very much the same
results.
However, other committees were dealing
with less controversial and more practical
questions. One, for instance, was discussing a
matter which is in the headlines in Canada at
the present time, namely, the extent and the
nature of ownership and control of the bed of
the ocean, particularly those areas adjacent to
29234-51k

the shores that are known as the Continental
Shelf. It is my guess that in addition to the
claims now being voiced by our provincial
and federal governments we will find other
countries throughout the world laying claim
to a share in any resources or wealth that
may lie outside the territorial waters of any
nation, as they do now in respect of fishing
and fisheries.
Another committee was discussing the uses
of the resources of the oceans outside the
Continental Shelf for the common benefit of
all peoples, and there seemed to be some
hope that sensible and generous agreements
would be reached about this. These two matters are of special interest and concern to
Canada, because we have the greatest extent
of coastline of any country in the world, and
we must and should be represented on any
international bodies set up to deal with this
important matter in these important areas.
The two committees which were dealing
with the plight of the Palestinian refugees
gave perhaps the best evidence of how difficult it is to solve the problems of the nations,
even through and under the good offices of
the United Nations itself. There are no doubts
whatever about the unhappy condition of
these refugees, nor about the desire of many
nations, including Canada, to help them, but
there seemed to an observer like myself no
evidence whatever that either the Arab
nations or Israel are willing to budge an inch
from the stand they have taken. Unless these
nations show some willingness to negotiate a
settlement of their problems there is not
much that the rest of us can do. This situation
is further complicated and rendered more
dangerous by the fact that the U.S.S.R. and
the U.S.A. are on opposing sides, the U.S.S.R.
supporting, aiding and arming the Arabs, and
the U.S.A. determined that Israel will not be
destroyed.
Nigeria and the African states have refused
to allow the tragic war in Nigeria to be considered by the United Nations on the grounds
that it is a civil war and therefore a domestic
matter outside the jurisdiction of the United
Nations. However, we observers did get a
very interesting, up-to-date and full briefing
on this problem by our ambassador, Mr.
Ignatieff, and I have no doubt about the great
difficulties that confront Canada or any other
country in trying to provide effective aid for
the starving peoples of Biafra. Here too we
are told that international power politics
bedevil the situation, with the U.S.S.R. pro-

SENATE DEBATES
viding extensive assistance to Nigeria and
France, I gather, through some of the former
French colonies in Africa making arms available to the Biafrans. In that connection, while
the topic, as I have stated, was held to be
outside the jurisdiction of the United Nations,
the secretariat did prepare an interesting
report, a copy of which I have here, on the
humanitarian aspects of the problems of Nigeria and the war there.
In another committee the delegate of Spain
made a strong claim that the British should
give up Gibraltar and hand it over to Spain.
He tried to refute and deny the validity of
the plebiscite that was taken in Gibraltar
which resulted in the unanimous vote to
remain within the British Commonwealth.
The Spanish delegate rejected this, claiming
that the territory should be handed over to
Spain because the present inhabitants of
Gibraltar are not in his opinion indigenous
inhabitants but have come there during the
past 300 years. Unless my information is
incorrect, I seem to remember that the Rock
of Gibraltar was originally occupied and peopled by apes. The delegate from the United
Kingdom took a very dim view of the Spanish claim and stated emphatically and flatly
that the United Kingdom would not hand
over the inhabitants or Gibraltar to Spain.
Since I left New York this committee, as
reported in the press yesterday, passed a
resolution calling upon Britain to give up
Gibraltar to Spain before the end of 1969, and
I have noted that those voting for this motion
were nearly all African, Asian and South
American nations, and none from the western
bloc.
Another committee, in which we were
represented by Mr. Bruce Rankin, our ambassador in Venezuela, was dealing with the
scarcity of edible proteins in many of the
developing nations of Africa, Asia and Latin
America. This is particularly serious for children, and one report expresses the opinion
that if sufficient edible proteins were not
made available to these countries more than
300 million children would suffer seriously as
a result of this and would never grow into
healthy men and women as they should, or
make the contribution to their countries and
their nations that these countries and the
world need. The problem is complicated by
the fact that people, particularly infants and
small children, will not eat strange foods or
foods that are unattractive to them because of
their flavour or content.

December 18, 198

The United States delegate, Mr. Arthur
Goldshmidt, created some amusement and
made a lasting impression on the members of
the committee by presenting to them attractive looking and tasty cookies which after
they had been eaten and enjoyed he
explained were made out of fish meal and
had a high protein content. Incidentally, the
representative of the U.S.S.R. declined the
opportunity of sampling these cookies.
The United States also, I believe, has developed a soft drink that is popular in Latin
America, relatively inexpensive and which is
very high in protein content.
Our Canadian delegate, Mr. Rankin, along
with a number of other representatives of
nations sponsored a sound and constructive
recommendation in respect of this matter. But
this was fouled up by the representative of
another nation, India, who wanted to create a
new organization ta deal with the whole question of edible proteins. Our delegation and
many of the others seemed to feel that this
was unnecessary, and would only further
complicate the work of the United Nations
and add unnecessarily to its expense.
When I left New York the members of this
committee were still arguing about procedural matters and were not making much
progress in respect of the very important
matter before it.
I was interested and pleased to find in the
mail the other day a publication from the
University of Saskatchewan which states that
one of their professors, Dr. Gibson, has come
up with a development of very high protein
stock feeds for livestock and poultry. It is
through our laboratories, universities and
research work that we are likely to achieve
some progress in this field.
Another interesting and important matter
being discussed in one of the committees had
to do with what is loosely described as the
"brain drain." It is a fact that the United
States and to a lesser extent Canada, and
some of the other western nations, are attracting and keeping many of the highly trained
and highly educated citizens of other nations,
especially the underdeveloped nations where
they are most needed.
An extremely thorough report with many
interesting statistics was prepared by the Secretariat of the United Nations. This will provide interesting reading for any members of
this chamber who are concerned about this
matter. I have a copy of that report here on
my desk.

December 18. 1968

SENATE DEBATES

Another committee, in which General
Burns represented Canada, dealt with disarmament, and more particularly with the draft
treaty designed to prevent the proliferation of
nuclear weapons. Here it seems that for the
first time the United States and the U.S.S.R.
have agreed in principle, though for domestic
political reasons and because of the Soviet
invasion of Czechoslovakia in August last, the
United States is withholding formal approval
of this treaty. This delay may well be unfortunate because it may endanger the whole
treaty. In the meantime other nations which
do not have nuclear weapons are increasing
their demands for guarantees of assistance
and protection, and some of these nations, if
this matter is delayed too long, may very well
follow the example of France and China and
develop nuclear armament programs of their
own.
In the third committee our representative
was a very intelligent and attractive woman,
Sister Ghislaine Roquet, who is professor and
head of the Department of Philosophy of
Basile Moreau College in Montreal. I was particularly impressed by her ability and her
extremely happy and pleasant manner. In her
committee they were dealing with the world
social situation and in particular the program
of the International Year for Human Rights
which happens to be this year, 1968. As some
of the members of the Senate will remember,
a most impressive conference on human
rights was held here in Ottawa a short time
ago. It was addressed by our Prime Minister
and by a number of other distinguished
individuals. Sister Roquet came up from New
York for this conference and again made a
most useful and interesting contribution.
As honourable senators will appreciate I
could go on and I am tempted to go on at
great length about other interesting and
important problems and about the work being
done by the United Nations and the interesting debates and discussions taking place
there. But the Senate bas other important
matters to deal with and I do not want to
prolong this speech unduly. However, before
I conclude I do want to do two things. The
first is to read to you one or two quotations
that are relevant to this whole question-the
first of these from an address given recently
by our ambassador, Mr. George Ignatieff, and
I quote:
These days we find our nerve ends
titillated or depressed by a daily presentation of calamities, crises and predietions of doom from which none of us is

exempt because they not only appear in
the newspapers but are brought into our
living rooms by radio and television. In
the midst of this dally cavalcade of
melancholy international events, I believe
that we are apt to miss the significance of
that most historie drama of our timesthe struggle for a humane, rational and
peaceful world order to be turned out of
the chaos of war-making national sovereignties which we inherited from preceding centuries, and which have been
rendered obsolete by the sweep of revolutionary developments in modern technology. Some of us find it even now difficult to realize what technology has done
to the modern world. It bas not only
interlaced the whole globe with an
increasingly rapid communications network by jet aircraft, radio and electronie
devices, but it has also armed nations
with such weapons of mass destruction
that they do not even dare to use them,
relying on their mere threat as a deterrent by what is known euphemistically as
the balance of terror.
This is the drama and the challenge of
our age. The United Nations which was
created out of the ruins of the Leaguethat noble experiment in international
organization created after the First World
War-was intended primarily for the
maintenance of international peace and
security. Its structure, however, was
based on the then prevailing doctrine of
respect for the sovereign rights of every
independent nation. From this traditional
view flows the main limitations of the
United Nations today. Yet the world
organization, perhaps more than ever,
represents the imperishable hope of man
and his aspirations for peace based on
human brotherhood and respect for the
dignity of man, irrespective of differences
of nationality, religion or colour. It is
natural that the United Nations should be
the centre of the hopes of all men of good
will, because this world organization is
based on the recognition that international relations in the jet-nuclear-electronic
age, in this small and crowded planet
must ultimately be, through a world
organization, directed to developing a
world order. It is based on a recognition
that the problems of peace and security,
of ignorance, hunger, disease, human
misery, degradation and racial discrimination cannot be resolved within the

SENATE DEBATES
confines of separate national sovereignties, but must be grappled with on a
universal scale.
Then, a little later, quoting the late Adlai
Stevenson:
"We travel together, passengers on a little space ship, dependent on its vulnerable reserves of air and soil: all committed
for our safety to its security and peace;
preserved from annihilation only by the
care, the work, and I will say, the love
we give our fragile craft. We cannot
maintain it half fortunate, half miserable,
half confident, half despairing.. . No
craft, no crew can travel safely with such
vast contradictions. On their resolution
depends the survival of us all."
Then Mr. Ignatieff concludes:
Canadians demonstrated in our Centennial Year, that we stand in the van of the
arts, sciences and technology, all of
which are essential in the modern process
of communications and therefore stand at
the heart of modern international relations. It is the United Nations above all
other organizations which offers a world
forum before which is projected the
image of a new Canada grappling with its
problems of a pluralistie, bilingual and
bilcultural society, an image which gives
Canadians an advantage over many other
peoples in communicating with other
nations. Communication is not only the
art of speech or of music and technology-it is also the art of fellowship, of
giving a helping hand to those in distress
in the interests of greater understanding,
justice and harmony.
Honourable senators, I turn now to another
very different point of view. It is a report
which appeared in the Toronto Star on Saturday last, written by William R. Frye from the
United Nations, as follows:
The 23rd UN General Assembly, which is
due to adjourn this coming week, has
struck a new low, both in American influence and in constructive achievement.
It has saddened UN supporters and has
critics saying "We told you so".
The "Parliament of the World," as the
assembly is sometimes called, has been
bogged down in petty and short-sighted
wrangling on peripheral issues, its overall effectiveness hobbled by political
cowardice and lack of perspective.

December 18, 1968

The assembly did not have the courage
to deal head on with Czechoslovakia. It
dodged Biafra, and continued to have no
role in Viet Nam.
Its disarmament debates were largely
ritualistic, except for a deplorable smallpower effort to sabotage the nuclear nonproliferation treaty.
The most substantial contribution the
1968 assembly made to world peace may
well have been its decision not to hold a
debate on the Middle East, a debate which
could only have inflamed passions and
made mediation efforts still more difficult.
To be sure, no great and dramatic
damage was done to the fabric of world
society, nor was the UN itself torn asunder by explosive quarrels. The assembly's
shortcomings were for the most part sins
of omission rather than commission.
But it can be a serious matter to stand
aside when action is required.
I have just a few further things to say
about the United Nations, along the line of
what Mr. Ignatieff said, in terms of its real
importance and its real value; but, with your
permission, I will leave those for the record.
Honourable senators, in concluding this
part of my address I would like to draw
attention to the drafts of statements made in
the Assembly, in the plenary sessions and in
the various committees, by our representatives, while I was in New York. I do this by
way of evidence of the excellent and sensible
contributions that Canada and the representatives of Canada are making in the Assembly
on our behalf. May I in particular ask the
Senate for permission for the publication as
an appendix of part of a page from the New
York Times of November 21, 1968. It lists the
present members of the United Nations, the
officers of the Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, the
Trusteeship Council, the International Court
of Justice, the Secretariat and the specialized
agencies.
Honourable senators, having dealt at some
length with the United Nations and with my
visit to it some weeks ago, I would with your
permission make a few remarks of a personal
kind. As most of you know, on the 5th of
January next, I will be 75 years old. I will be
the first casualty-the first victim, if you
like-of the legislation which was passed
before I arrived here. Needless to say, I will
be sorry to leave the Senate, but I believe

December 18, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

realize that changes will have to be made in
respect of any timetable, but a timetable will
be valuable nevertheless.
The second matter is that I feel strongly
that the members of the Senate should be
frequent visitors to the areas and the provinces they represent and should visit these
areas and provinces at least twice each
month. In this way we could overcome in
part at least the claim that the provinces are
not represented effectively in the Senate.
Now, this is not difficult and it may not be
particularly important for those of you who
live in Ontario and Quebec, but to those who
live in the Atlantic provinces or in the prairies or in British Columbia, it is in my opinion very important. I am frequently told in
British Columbia that the majority of the
people there are not particularly interested in

this legislation and this regulation requiring
retirement at the age of 75 years is good and
wise, and I support it wholeheartedly.
I have found the three years I have spent
with the Senate very, interesting and worthwhile. I had many good friends in the Senate
before I came here and since coming I have
found a warm welcome and have made many
new friends, so I feel it no exaggeration to
say that I can count every member of the
Senate a friend whose companionship I will
miss when I return to British Columbia in
January.
The Senate, too, has provided me with
many opportunities for sharing in interesting
work and in making possible many new
contacts with individuals and organizations
here in Ottawa and throughout Canada.

SENATE DEBATES

be a great advantage and well worth the
expense involved.
One other matter that applies to most of
the members of the Senate, and will apply
increasingly if they are to have more committee work, is that senators should and must
have more secretarial assistance. At the present time I share one secretary with four other
senators. While this secretary is most obliging
and does her best, it is quite impossible to
expect her to do the work that we require. If
we are to look after our work in the Senate
itself and in our committees and keep up with
our correspondence and spend any time with
those who ask for appointments, we should
and must have in the Senate more secretarial
assistance, if we are to be efficient and do
effective work.
Again, may I say that none of this affects
me personally. As I said a moment ago,
knowing that my time in the Senate would be
brief and knowing it would be presumptuous
and out of place for me to attempt to play
anything but a minor role in the Senate, I
have limited myself to attendance at the committees to which I was appointed and others
in which I was interested; and to a few interventions in the Senate itself about matters
which are of particular interest and concern
to me.
So, in conclusion, honourable senators, I
would like to say again how much I have
enjoyed the all too brief years that I have
spent with you. I count myself most fortunate
to have had this experience. I will think of all
of you with happy memories and you may be
sure that anything I can do to support the
Senate and its work I will be most happy to
do. So this is, in a sense, au revoir, good luck
and good-bye.
The Hon. the Speaker: I understood that
during the course of his remarks, the honourable Senator MacKenzie indicated his desire
to have certain documents to which he
referred appear in whole, or in part, as
appendixes to the Hansard of this day. Is it
agreed?
Hon. Senafors: Agreed.
For the structure of the UN 1968-69, see
Appendix "A", pp. 815-817.
For Paper on "The Federal Problem and
the B.N.A. Act", see Appendix "B", pp. 818822.
Hon. David A. Croll: Honourable senators,
this has been a memorable moment in the

December 18, 1968

history of the Senate. We have just heard a
very interesting speech by Senator Norman
MacKenzie who came to Parliament and more
specifically to the Senate late in life-much
too late. He was then embarking on his
second career.
As he told you, on January 5 he will reach
that magic 75th birthday. That will be the
date of his retirement from the Senate. He
will leave as he came: with honour and dignity. For the short time that he has been with
us, we have had in our midst a most extraordinary Canadian who was born to public service. He is a total Canadian. He touched
much of Canada and rubbed shoulders with
many in Canada. A little of Canada was better where he was. He has enriched the
Senate.
He is one of our greatest living educationists. He is gifted, intelligent, broad in knowledge and understanding, a valued friend and
a good companion. The most tolerant of men,
he is intolerant of intolerance.
I think I speak for the Senate when I say
to him that as he, one of our most distinguished alumni, leaves this political Valhalla
he does so to embark upon yet a third career.
Good luck, good friend, and good voyage!
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, I had the honour to be the Leader of the
Senate most of the years-the all too few
years-that Senator MacKenzie has been with
us. I do not think I can varnish the language
that Senator Croll has just used, because it
does express the sentiments of all of us here.
Senator MacKenzie's career both as a public
servant and as a private member of this
organization, short though it was, has given
honour to this place. Indeed, all of us will
feel honoured to be able to say that we sat
here with him.
The Senate is as good as the people who
inhabit it and work here, and the work that
he has done, the distinction that he has
brought to our deliberations both in committee and in the chamber have indeed enhanced
the prestige of this house. If there is one time
when I really feel sorry about the retirement
age being stipulated by statute, it is now. To
Mrs. MacKenzie as well as to Senator MacKenzie we are all extremely indebted, and at
their going we ail feel extremely sad.
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, I
rise not to begin a practice but to emulate
briefly the initiative taken by Senator Croll
and concurred in by Senator Connolly (Ottawa West). I also had expected to say a word

December 18, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

about the event which Senator MacKenzie
himself has brought to our attention-his
retirement from this house-because of my
association as a student when he was professor at the University of Toronto, an association that goes back over 30 years.
He has been kind enough to refer to me in
complimentary terms. I say to him that his
life has greatly influenced my own. We
attended the same universities for the most
part. The post-graduate work I did at Harvard Law School and at Cambridge was
largely influenced so far as the selection of
these places of research are concerned as a
result of his own previous experience. When I
first went to Geneva to visit the League of
Nations and take part in some of its operations, I was infiuenced too by the fact that
Professor Larry MacKenzie, Professor of
International Law at the University of Toronto, had spent some time in Geneva.
There are many hundreds of men who have
contributed to the development of foreign
policy in Canada who owe a great deal to
Senator MacKenzie for what be did as
Professor of International Law, and for his
efforts in the establishment of the Canadian
Institute of International Affairs.
His life is by no means over; it is just
beginning. A new chapter is about to be written. But so far it has been a very interesting
book wherein up to now we find a record of
achievement in university work, in public
service, and, as President of the University of
British Columbia, followed by a series of
accomplishments in the educational field. It is
my hope that future appointments to this
house will be of the calibre of the appointment of the gentleman whose term is now
about to come to an end. I am sure that in the
person of Senator MacKenzie we see the best
opportunity we have for making this place
the effective body we want it to become.
Appointments such as that of Senator MacKenzie are a credit to the country and to this
chamber.
I want to thank Senator MacKenzie in the
name of the Govermnent of Canada for his
contribution to this house and to Canada. As
a senator I want to thank him for his contribution to the Senate, and as a Canadian I
want to thank him for his contribution to
Canada. As a friend I want to say that his
friendship has meant much; his life has been
exemplary, and that too has meant a great
deal.
29234-52

Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, I
have three brief comments. Senator MacKenzie has given us a report on the Twenty-third
Meeting of the General Assembly of the United Nations, and we are most indebted to him
for this report. In this connection I have a
suggestion to make. I believe that any Member of Parliament who wishes to do so should
be allowed to attend as an observer at a
meeting of the United Nations. I think one
week might be sufficient to give him some
knowledge of the procedures and the meaning
of the United Nations.
Hon. Mr. Croll: It would just give him time
enough to find out where to hang his hat.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: That too is important. I
remember when I started practising law it was
very useful to know where one should go to
get a procedure stamped out. You would look
ridiculous if you did not. I would suggest,
and I have been discussing this with members of the other place as well, that any member who has not yet had the occasion to go to
the United Nations should be given the
opportunity to spend at least one week there
as an observer.
The second comment I want to make concerns the suggestions put forward by Senator
MacKenzie. The fourth report of the Special
Committee on the Rules of the Senate is now
under consideration, and the suggestions
made by Senator MacKenzie in this field are
germane to that report. I hope that eventually
we may deal with these usages and practices
which are as important as the rules themselves, and perhaps the legal and constitutional provisions governing the Senate.
The third comment, of course, is to tell
Senator MacKenzie that we on the Opposition
side of the Senate are very sad at the thought
that he is leaving us. He could as easily have
been appointed by a Conservative administration as by the Liberal administration. We
accept him as a great friend. He bas made a
most valuable contribution to the Senate, and
we are indebted to him for his contribution.
As be leaves he may be assured that we shall
miss him very much in the Senate, but we
hope to see him around very often.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

whole of North America with papers of less
than 50,000 circulation. I am told that the circulation of the Peterborough Examiner is
approximately 16,000. Consequently, it is well
under the limit of 50,000 that I have just
mentioned.
I do not intend to go into the reasons why
the Newspaper Guild is not a factor in or is
not appropriate to such small newspapers.
However, we all know that in practically all
the larger industries in this country the
unions are a factor and are part of the machinery of industry and business; but you do not
find the corner store, or even a slightly larger
business than the corner store, unionized. Is
that not exactly the reason why the Newspaper Guild is not a factor in newspapers of
under 50,000 circulation?
There are some other factors that I think
should be stressed. Firstly, the scale of wages
in effect at the time the Peterborough Examiner was taken over by the Thomson group
was the scale established by the previous
ownership under Senator Davies.
Secondly, immediately after the Thomson
group took over, the Newspaper Guild moved
in to organize the editorial staff and to negotiate wage scales. The scales requested included increases of over 75 per cent on a 12month contract, which was approximately ten
times the federal Government's suggested
guideline.
Honourable senators, I should like to make
a remark in that regard. It might be quite
appropriate to ask for a 75 per cent increase
in wages, but whose wages was it intended to
increase? It was the wages paid by the Davies
group prior to the take-over of the newspaper
by the Thomson group. Perhaps the wages
paid by the Davies group were much too low.
I do not know. But, that was certainly not the
fault of the Thomson newspaper people. As
the wages were thus under negotiation it at
once became illegal for the new management
to introduce normal wage increases during
the negotiating process.
Senator Croll charges that the Thomson
company is attempting to break the union.
But, in fact, at Peterborough, as at other
Thomson newspapers, the company has contracts with, for example, the International
Typographical Union, and the International
Printers and Pressmen's Union of North
America. The company has well in excess of
75 contracts in effect with unions, and it
enjoys very good relationships, having little
29234-521

or no difficulty in contract negotiations. When
I refer to the company's having 75 labour
contracts I should emphasize that I am
informed that that is in Canada, and the company owns about 30 papers in Canada. I
would think that that is a pretty good record.
I am presuming, therefore-and, in fact, I
take it for granted-that there is probably not
a Thomson newspaper in Canada whose
employees are not represented by the International Typographical Union and the International Printers and Pressmen's Union.
Honourable senators, I am informed, and I
believe, that those are the facts in regard to
the Peterborough Examiner, and the Thomson
chain of newspapers.
There is another reason I am somewhat
surprised at the remarks of the honourable
senator. He stated there is at present at work
on the strike a task force appointed by the
Government-I presume the Government of
the Province of Ontario-for the purpose of
making a report. We all know, of course, that
newspaper unions and newspapers are subject
to provincial jurisdiction and not federal jurisdiction. Hence it is most inappropriate that
a strike of this kind should be under discussion in the Senate at the very time that a task
force appointed by the provincial Government is working on the problem.
Honourable senators, that is really all I
want to say. There was an innuendo contained
in the remarks of the honourable senator as
they are reported at page 787 of the Debates
of the Senate of yesterday:
Before we can project ourselves into new
methods of dealing with labour, we
should at least have learned to get along
with the laws that are on the statute
books at the present time.
This statement is clearly an innuendo, and it
does not indicate what laws are being broken
by the employers in this case. In any event, I
think I was justified in adjourning this debate
in order that some facts in regard to the
dispute referred to could be brought before
this house in reply to Senator Croll's remarks.

PRIVATE BILL
GILLESPIE MORTGAGE CORPORATIONSECOND PEADING

Hon. J. Campbell Haig, for Hon. Mr.
Beaubien (Bedford), moved the second reading of Bill S-22, respecting Gillespie Mortgage
Corporation.
He said: Honourable senators, on behalf of
Senator Beaubien (Bedford) I wish to make
the following statement. This bill has only
one purpose, and that is to change the name
of Gillespie Mortgage Corporation to City
Home Mortgage and Savings Corporation
and, in French, to Habitat Urbain, Société
d'Hypothèques et d'Épargne.

813

Gillespie Mortgage Corporation was incorporated in 1955. It is a loan company, subject
to the provisions of the Loan Companies Act.
It was operated by Mr. Harry Arthur Gillespie until 1967. In 1967 MVr. Gillespie sold the
company to another corporation by the name
of Home and Dominion Investments of Canada Limited.
Under the terms of the agreement for the
sale of the shares of the Gillespie Company,
the purchaser was required to take appropriate
steps to change the name of Gillespie Mortgage Corporation to something else, as "Gillespie" was the personal name of the former
owner and he wished to continue to use his
name in connection with other activities. That
is the reason for the present bill to change the
name of the corporation to City Home Mortgage and Savings Corporation, and, in
French, to Habitat Urbain, Société d'Hypothèques et d'Épargne.
If this bil receives second reading, I arn
prepared to move that; it be referred to the

Hon. Mr. Croll: I wil only vote for the

Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, honourable senators,
the French is in my notes but I did not have
a chance to practise my pronunciation. That
is the reason for the sloppiness of my French
translation.
Motion, agreed to and bill read second time.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shail this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I move, with leave of the

to have unanimous consent to waive Rule 117
before this motion can be put. I move, with

THE FEDERAL PROBLEM AND TH E BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACT
By Norman A. M. MacKenzie, B.A., LL.M.
Professor of Public and Private InternationalLaw, and Canadian
Constitutional Law, University of Toronto.
Before attempting a critical examination of
The British North America Act and the way
in which it has functioned, it is essential that
one should understand two things: (a) Why
we in Canada have a federal form of government, which is admittedly a clumsy device,
and (b) the views that are held by various
groups and individuals regarding it, and the
methods for changing it.
I have suggested that a federal form of
government is a clumsy device because it
divides authority, decentralizes administration and from the point of view of getting
things done, rapidly and effectively, is much
less desirable than a unitary system.
But efficiency and easy manipulation are
not the only, nor indeed the most important
considerations in a democracy, particularly a
democracy like Canada, which is composed of
different races and creeds and is divided by
reason of geography and natural resources
into half a dozen conflicting economie areas.
The fact is that the choice was not, and is not
between a federal system vs. a unitary system
but rather whether the various provinces of
Canada should unite in a dominion, or whether they should carry on indefinitely and in
isolation as Newfoundland has done. While
there are still those in certain of the provinces of Canada who feel that Confederation
was a mistake, and while secession is by no
means a dead issue, given sufficient dissatisfaction, as witness the recent agitation and
action in Western Australia, I am not a secessionist and in any event that subject is not up
for discussion here.
And so I suggest that if any of you at any
time feel impatient because the things you
want done in Canada are held up by our
constitution, or if you are satisfied by inaction, you should remember that your fellow
Canadians in the Maritime Provinces or on
the Prairies may have very different views
from your own about a great many matters.
In brief, a division of powers was and is
inevitable in Canada.
With regard to The British North America
Act, there are two views that are commonly
held. One that it is an Act of Parliament, and

like any other Act, may be amended by Parliament; the other that it is a compact agreed
upon by the contracting parties and that it
cannot be altered without the expressed consent of all these parties.
As a lawyer and a student of history, I
have no hesitation in saying that The British
North America Act is not a compact, and
from a legal point of view could be amended
by Parliament without considering the desires
of the provinces. But as a practical person I
realize that in the main, laws, in a democracy, are the expression of public opinion, and
as such are subject to interpretation, are liable to be ignored or even to be rejected
altogether. I am aware, too, that what is
legally possible is not always politically desirable. And if Mr. Ferguson and Mr. Taschereau or their successors insist, as they
have done very firmly, that the B.N.A. Act is
a pact and cannot be amended without their
approval, and if the electors of Ontario and
Quebec appear to support them in this view,
it is unlikely that either Mr. Bennett or Mr.
Mackenzie King, or even Mr. Woodsworth
for that matter, will push the legal rights of
the Dominion Parliament. The result is that
the obvious legal interpretation and what
seems to have been the intention of the framers of The British North America Act, is, by
what is termed a constitutional convention,
coming to have quite a different meaning
from the original one.
With this introduction let us turn to an
examination of the form and organization of
government in Canada. As one might expect,
the distribution of powers is wide and varied
and on the whole this is a desirable and
healthy practice for it places responsibility
where it should be placed, on the individual
and on the small group. For it seems that if a
normal individual cannot organize his own
affairs satisfactorily, or if a small group of
normal individuals organized into a municipality cannot look after their common interests
efficiently they have no right, in a democracy, at least, to expect that the larger unit,
the state, or even an internationally organized

December 18, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

body of states, will provide them with all that
they need or desire.
On the other hand, modern society has
become so complex, and the needs of the
individual so varied, and so difficult to satisfy, that a greater degree of co-operation and
organization is essential to-day if society is to
function and if the individual is to have his
wants supplied than it was sixty or seventy
years ago. And it is on this score that the
Canadian constitution is open to criticism.
Municipal organization and administration is
an interesting and important study, but I do
not propose to deal with it in this paper. The
provinces, however, must be considered in
detail, for their existence and powers constitute one of the major problems of Canadian
statesmanship. There seems little doubt that
the Fathers of Confederation, and Sir John A.
Macdonald in particular, alarmed by the
experiences of the United States of America,
which in 1865 was suffering so desperately
from the effects of the Civil War, aimed at,
and thought they had achieved, in the B.N.A.
Act a form of government which, while preserving some of the visible emblems of
autonomy in the provinces, would actually be
a strong centralized governiment with almost
unlimited powers, if it seemed necessary or
even desirable to exercise them. This is evident not only from the source material but
from the Act itself which provides that while
the provinces are supreme in their own field,
and may even amend their own constitutions,
the Lieutenant-Governors shall be appointed
by the Central or Federal Government; the
judiciary shall be appointed by the Federal
Government; that any provincial Act may be
disallowed by the Federal authorities and
even more important, that the Federal Parliament can make laws for the peace, order and
good government of Canada in relation to all
matters not coming within the classes of
subjects by The British North America Act
assigned exclusively to the provinces. In
other words, the provinces were given certain
defined and restricted powers of legislation
over matters of a merely local or private
nature in the provinces, whereas the Dominion was given control over a wide field of
defined subjects and in addition, general
powers over all matters coming under peace,
order and good government for Canada as a
whole. Later on I propose to deal with this in
some detail, but before doing so I want to
complete the survey of the form and organization of government in the provinces, in the
Dominion and in regard to those aspects of

the Imperial power which still affect Canada.
With the exception of Quebec, all of the
provinces have dispensed with the services of
a second chamber, and there is even a
suggestion voiced in many quarters during
this period of depression that the office of
and
whose salary
Lieutenant-Governor,
expenses are paid for by the provinces,
should be abolished.
The Dominion Parliament, like that of
Great Britain, consists of two houses, the
House of Commons and the Senate. With the
Commons there is no difficulty for it is directly responsible to the people who elect it and
must submit its actions and views to the
approval of the electorate at stated intervals.
The Governor-General, too, is no impediment
to rapid or radical legislation, if such is
desired, for he is to all intents and purposes a
figure head. Some interest and discussions
have been stimulated by the suggestion that
future incumbents of this office should be
Canadians but apart from satisfying our
national pride, and making us more Canadian
than we are at present, this question has no
practical importance.
The Senate, however, is another matter. It
was created, in part, because a House of
Lords existed in England and Second Chambers were the fashion in democracies, and in
part to provide for the permanent geographical representation of different sections of
Canada without regard to their numerical
importance. Unlike the House of Lords, it has
not been "reformed" and still has the unlimited power of veto (though not of initiation)
over all federal legislation. This in conjunction with the fact that its members are, in the
main, of advanced age, appointed for life by
the Government in power as a reward for
political services rendered, makes it potentially a real and almost insuperable obstacle
to radical legislation. If I am not mistaken,
the constitutional battles of the near future
will be fought over the reform of the Senate
and the methods of amending the B.N.A. Act.
Here may I interject one or two practical
suggestions, not with the view or even the
hope that you should adopt them but merely
to provide you with something of a controversial nature for purposes of discussion. While I
am quite prepared to dispense with the
Senate altogether, and to trust my fortunes to
the elected representatives of the people, as
we now do in Ontario, I do not expect this to
come about. At the same time I suggest that
the members of the Senate are individually
too old, and are not representative of all

SENATE DEBATES
bodies of opinion in the community. My
suggestion is that there should be an age
limit, and as professors are presumed to have
exhausted their usefulness at the age of 65, I
would set that as the limit for Senators. And
in order that the various parties and groups
should be more adequately represented, I
suggest that the Senators should not be
appointed for life by the government in
power but on a basis of proportionate
representation for a period of, say, nine
years. In detail the scheme would be somewhat as follows:
The Senate would be divided into three
groups. One group retiring every three years,
their places to be taken by new appointments
made on the basis of votes cast for the various parties at the last federal election, and
nominations to be made by the leaders of the
parties represented in the House of Commons.
In this way, the Senate would be composed of
younger men, more representative of the
views of the various parties, and because it
changed on the basis of a rotation system,
would be in closer touch with the various
elements in the community than is the case at
present. In addition, I would provide that
after any bill had passed the House of Commons in two succeeding years, it should
become law, regardless of the Senate's attitude toward it. This last is in line with the
practice in Great Britain, and is much more
in accord with democratic principles than the
present system.
The amendment of the B.N.A. Act is, I
suggest, the other obstacle that must be dealt
with if the Canadian Constitution is to be
the flexible instrument it should be to deal
with the rapidly changing conditions of the
modern world. During the past week you
have heard a good deal about its inadequacies
in the field of economics and social legislation.
May I add that the inadequacies persist
simply because we, the Canadian people,
either want them to persist or are too lazy
to change them. There are no provisions in
the present Act for its amendment but being
an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain,
it was assumed that that Parliament could
amend it at will, and in a number of minor
matters it has done so. As I have pointed
out, however, the convention has grown up
that the provinces must all be consulted and
must all give their consent before any amendment becomes law. The result is, that under
the existing practice, no amendment is ever
likely to be made. I sympathize with the
attitude and the desire of the provinces in

December 18, 1968

this regard for I know that they are jealous
of their privileges of language, religion,
education, etc., and are afraid that they may
lose these privileges if the existing safeguards
are removed. At the same time I am convinced that all of these privileges could be
maintained, and The British North America
Act made much more flexible and easy of
amendment by the adoption of some such
device as that in use in Australia. There, a
few subjects of primary importance are put
in a special reserved category and cannot
be tampered with. The rest of the Act can
be amended by much simpler procedure. My
plan, then, would be to put religion, language,
education, and such other matters as seemed
of fundamental importance to the provinces
in a separate part of the Act and state
definitely that these sections could not be
amended without the consent of all the interested parties or provinces. The rest of
the Act I would have capable of amendment
by the Canadian Parliament itself without
any undue formalities.
Here it should be noted that the Statute of
Westminster, which redefines the position and
powers of the Dominion, expressly states that
the powers conferred by the Act are restricted
to the enactment of laws in relation to matters
within the competence of the Parliament of
Canada or of the provinces and does not
enable the one to invade the field of the
others. It also states that the powers given
to the Dominion Parliament by the repeal
of The Colonial Laws Validity Act shaH extend to the powers of the provincial legislatures, both further indications of the jealous
way in which the provinces guard their rights,
often to the exclusion of the wider Dominion
interest. Given these two changes, it would
be possible for the elected representatives of
the people to enact any legislation they
chose.
The part played by the Imperial Parliament
or authorities in Canadian affairs is now
almost negligible and is confined to matters
like the position of His Majesty as head of the
state, appeals to the Privy Council, which are
optional, and certain procedural technicalities
in connection with treaties and trustee
securities.
It is stated from time to time either that
The British North America Act is perfectly
satisfactory and should not be amended in
any way or that it is obsolete and archaic,
and that it does not permit either the Dominion or the provinces to deal satisfactorily with
a great number of subjects, among them,

December 18, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

insurance, the control of the sale of stocks
and shares, social legislation, including unemployment insurance, the settlement of industrial disputes, and in the field of external
affairs, the making of treaties. That there is a
real limitation upon the powers of the Federal Parliament and Government in these and
other fields is unquestionable but whether
changes should be made or not is decidedly a
matter of opinion. Here, however, it is desirable to look at the Act itself and see just what
it does provide. As pointed out above, the
intention of the Fathers of Confederation was
that all matters of national importance should
be in the control of the Central Government.
In actual practice, however, due partly to the
views of the Privy Coundil, in a whole line of
decisions and partly to the growing strength
of the provinces, many matters of national
importance have been held to be within the
exclusive competence of the provinces. Down
to the decision in Russell vs. the Queen
(about 1880) the tendency was to strengthen
the hands of the Dominion and in that case
the Privy Council held that as the legislation
in question (having to do with the prohibition
of the sale of liquor) did not fall within any
of the classes of subjects assigned exclusively
to the provincial legislatures, it did (under
the scheme of the B.N.A. Act) come within
the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament,
seemingly a logical conclusion. In addition
they suggested that it might have come under
the section "Trade and Commerce," which is
one of the Dominion's defined fields, as was
pointed out by the Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court of Canada. In 1925, however,
in the case of Toronto Electric Commissioners
vs. Snider, Dominion legislation for the regulation of labour disputes (the Lemieux Act)
which had been in force and operating satisfactorily for nearly twenty years, was held
invalid. Lord Haldane, in discussing the Russell case and being hard put to it to distinguish the principles in that case from the
Snider case, stated: "It appears to their Lordships that it is not now open to them to treat
Russell vs. the Queen as having established
the general principle that the mere fact that
Dominion legislation is for the general advantage of Canada, or is such that it will meet a
mere want which is felt throughout the
Dominion, renders it competent if it cannot
be brought within the heads specified in section 91. Unless this is so, if the subject matter
falls within any of the enumerated heads in
section 92, such legislation belongs exclusively to provincial competence. No doubt there

may be cases arising out of some extraordinary peril to the national life of Canada, as a
whole, such as the cases arising out of a war,
where legislation is required of an order that
passes beyond the heads of exclusive provincial competency. Such cases may be dealt
with under the words at the commencement
of section 91 conferring general powers in
relation to peace, order and good government.
Simply because such cases are not otherwise
provided for-their Lordships think that the
decision in Russell v. the Queen can only be
supported to-day-on the assumption of the
board, apparently made at the time of deciding the case of Russell v. the Queen, that the
evil of intemperance at that time, amounted
in Canada to one so great and so general that
at least for the period it was a menace to the
national life of Canada, so serious and pressing that the National Parliament was called
on to intervene to protect the nation from
disaster. An epidemie of pestilence might conceivably have been regarded as analogous."
This statement of Lord Haldane's, absurd
as it is, gives in its most extreme forin the
difficulty that the Dominion Parliament
experiences in legislating on matters of
national importance. For section 92 of the
Act, which states that "in each province the
legislature may exclusively make laws in
relation to (among other matters) 'property
and civil rights in the province'," and "property and civil rights" has been interpreted so
widely by the Privy Council, as instanced
above in the Snider case, that practically
every matter which is not specifically enumerated in the twenty-nine heads of section 91
(given exclusively to the Dominion) is included within it or affected by it, and so without
Dominion jurisdiction.
However, in all fairness to the Act itself
and to those who framed it, most of those
matters essential to the national welfare are
included within the twenty-nine enumerated
heads. Among them are "the regulation of
trade and commerce" (though here again the
Privy Council have intervened in defence of
provincial rights and have relegated "trade
and commerce" to the limbo of forgotten
things), "the raising of money by any mode
or system of taxation," "navigation and shipping," "the regulation of seacoast and inland
fisheries" (but not the proprietary interest in
the fish themselves), "currency and coinage,"
"banking," and all matters associated with
finance; "copyrights," "naturalization and
aliens," "marriage and divorce," (but not the
forins of marriage,) "the criminal law," etc. It

SENATE DEBATES
is only in regard to new developments
brought about by a changing economic and
social order that the defects in the B.N.A. Act
become apparent, e.g., the whole field of
social legislation, the control of radio and
aviation, the development of hydro-electric
power and again in the field of external
affairs.
I have in my possession a thesis which I
have just received from an English Colleague
in Europe, some 178 pages in length, dealing
with the inability of Canada to become a
party to international conventions. I shall not
read you that document to-day, but it is a
fact that section 132 of the B.N.A. Act, which
states that "the Paliament and Government of
Canada shall have all the powers necessary or
proper for performing the obligations of
Canada or of any province thereof, as part of
the British Empire, toward foreign countries,
arising under treaties between the Empire
and such foreign countries" does not provide
for the changed international status of Canada, and despite the broad interpretation given
to that section by the Privy Council in the
recent Radio and Aviation Cases, it should be
amended and brought into line with modern
needs.
Hydro-electric
development might
be
declared to be a work or works for the general advantage of Canada and so brought under
federal control but this would undoubtedly
meet with strong opposition from the provinces. At the same time the whole question of
the development and particularly the export
of power is of the utmost importance to the
whole of Canada, as it affects our relations
with the United States and should be subject
to federal regulation.
Much more could be said with regard to the
whole question of subsidies, of natural
resources, of provincial issues which become
federal issues, e.g., the question of "Maritime
rights" and "the western wheat pools," but I
have already said enough to provide you with
some basic facts at least, and some controversial suggestions, and I prefer to leave the rest
for our discussion at the end of my remarks.
In conclusion, may I say that I have
attempted to give you an objective statement

December 18, 1968

of the existing situation without in any way
suggesting that you should accept or adopt my
views on any matters of opinion or reform?
The British North America Act has on the
whole been an admirable solution of the
problems of a federation of British colonies in
North America, and if you are satisfied with
things as they are, and feel that under the
existing constitution you can work out a satisfactory solution of our common problems,
then there is nothing more to be said on the
subject.
But might I urge that you look at the whole
matter not only as loyal citizens of Toronto or
Ontario with an eye to defending local and
provincial rights, but that you take a larger
view as Canadians of the welfare and
needs
of our
country
as
a whole.
Looking at it in this latter light, I must
confess that I am not satisfied with the existing machinery for I consider it inadequate for
our present purposes. Without surrendering
any of the fundamental privileges that are so
precious to the provinces, I believe it is possible and necessary to work out a method for
more rapid common action in many fields of
legislation and government. Provincial conferences are slow and unsatisfactory and should
be superseded by other devices. The simplest
of these, of course, is to give to the Dominion
the temporary or permanent power to legislate in regard to any matter of national concern, save for a few excepted subjects, like
education and language. If the Dominion Parliament proves too cumbersome a body for
emergency action, it is quite possible for that
body to delegate certain of its powers to the
executive, as it has done in the past, and is
doing to an increasing degree to-day.
This would require the amendment of the
B.N.A. Act, but if that is desired by the people of Canada, it is a very simple matter to
arrange for.
In addition, the Act should be amended so
as to give the Dominion full powers in regard
to the making of treaties and conventions and
the enacting of the legislation necessary to
carry out such treaties.

ANTI-DUMPING BILL
FIRST READING

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill C-146, respecting the imposition of anti-dumping duty.
Bill read first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. ihe Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second
time?
Hon. Harry Hays moved, with leave of the
Senate, that the bill be read the second time
now.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a substantial bill relating to the imposition of anti-

dumping duties, including provisional duties,
the establishment of an anti-dumping tribunal, and certain consequential amendments to
the Customs Act, the Customs Tariff, and the
Tariff Board Act.
In the course of the Kennedy Round a new
international code governing the application
of anti-dumping duties was negotiated
between the major trading nations in an
effort to achieve a certain degree of uniformity in the use of anti-dumping policies and
procedures. Canadian representatives participated actively in these negotiations to
ensure that the code would enable the
application of anti-dumping duties quickly
and effectively when dumping caused or
threatened injury to Canadian industry, and
at the same time protect Canadian exporters
against the unreasonable use of anti-dumping
duties by other countries.
Other signatories to the code have been
complying with these provisions since July 1,
1968, as agreed at the end of the Kennedy
Round. It was not possible for Canada to
meet that date, and our trading partners
agreed that Canada could delay its implementation until January 1 next.
The existing anti-dumping provision, which
is section 6 of the Customs Tariff, remains
little changed from the original law enacted
in 1904. New legislation is required for Canada to meet the terms of the anti-dumping
code.
Honourable senators will recall that a
White Paper on anti-dumping was tabled on
December 9, and a draft anti-dumping act,
designed to meet Canada's obligations under
the international agreement, was included in
it.
The Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce has carefully examined the draft
act, together with certain amendments which
were recommended by the standing committee in the other place. The bill before you is a
consolidation of the draft act and these
recommendations. As you know, the chairman
of the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce reported that the committee had
considered these documents, and directed that
Bill C-146 be adopted.
I should now like to comment briefly on the
principal features of the Anti-Dumping Bill.
Goods are to be considered as dumped if the
normal value exceeds the export price. "Normal value" is to be taken generally as the
price at which goods are sold at arm's length
in the ordinary course of trade in the country
of export at about the same time as the goods

SENATE DEBATES
are sold to the Canadian importer, adjusted
for allowances to reflect price comparability
between the home market sales and the sales
of the Canadian importer. "Export price" is
defined as an amount equal to the lesser of
the exporter's sale price for the goods or the
importer's purchase price for the goods established on an f.o.b. basis.
The Department of National Revenue will
retain responsibility for deciding whether or
not goods are dumped into Canada. They will
also be responsible for making preliminary
determinations of dumping and the consequent levying of provisional duties. The
department's decisions regarding the margin
of dumping and the category of goods
involved are to be subject to appeal to the
Tariff Board and, on points of law, to the
Exchequer Court. These appeal provisions are
analogues to the appeal provisions now set
out in the Customs Act.
The most significant change required of
Canadian anti-dumping legislation relates to
the requirement that there must be a formal
inquiry into the impact of dumping on production in Canada. An anti-dumping tribunal,
to be composed of not more than five members, is to be established for this purpose. The
tribunal must within three months from the
date of the deputy minister's preliminary
determination of dumping make a decision of
injury, threat of injury, or material retardation to production in Canada.
In so far as the consequential amendments
are concerned, the principal provision relates
to the proposed deletion of subsection 7 of
section 40(a) of the Customs Act, which provides for the establishment of arbitrary or
fixed valuations for customs in respect of
goods which are not dumped, but which are
judged to be causing injury to Canadian
producers. The bill provides that this section
is to be replaced by a new provision which
will achieve the same result as the present
law through the use of a surtax rather than
anti-dumping duties. Emergency action of this
kind is contemplated under section 19 of the
GATT.
In closing I would like to take this opportunity to state that in the Government's view
this bill provides a comprehensive framework
within which action can be taken swiftly to
counteract dumping that is injurious to the
Canadian producers. In the other place,
honourable senators, the White Paper which
was examined by our Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce, has been subjected
to a detailed examination by the Standing
Committee on Finance, Trade and Economic

December 19, 1968

Affairs which held 22 meetings for this purpose. In the course of this study the committee heard extensive evidence from representatives of industry and government. I highly
commend this bill to you.
Hon. Mr. Martin: May I ask the honourable
senator how many committee meetings were
held?
Hon. Mr. Hays: The Commons committee
held twenty-two meetings and our Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce held
three.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators,
the problem of dumping is closely connected
with the function of tariffs. Dumping can
defeat the intention and purpose of any
agreement on Customs Tariff. That is why the
present legislation is consequential on the
Kennedy Round negotiations and on the bill
which was recently passed concerning the
Customs Tariff. It was part of the agreement
reached at the Kennedy Round that Canada
should enact legislation to implement that
part of the agreement concerning dumping.
It was agreed also that we would implement
it by legislation in order that it come into
force on January 1, 1969. Consequently, it is
urgent that this legislation be approved by
Parliament.
Honourable senators, even if the bill comes
to us at this late hour, just as we are about to
adjourn for Christmas here and in the other
place, it is important to put on record the fact
that we have had a prior opportunity to study
it. In September last, the Government published a White Paper on Anti-Dumping,
together with a draft bill; and this document
has been available to members of Parliament
and to all interested parties since that time,
that is, for over three months.
As has been mentioned by the sponsor of
the bill, the House of Commons Committee on Finance, Trade and Economic Affairs
held many meetings and made several
suggestions to improve the draft bill. These
amendments generally were not material but
did much to improve the form of the bill.
Also, our own Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce bas considered the
White Paper, the proposed bill, and the
report of the House of Commons Committee;
it has heard officials of both the Department
of Finance and the Department of Revenue on
the purposes of the bill.
The bill is clearly an improvement on the
present practice. As has been mentioned by
the sponsor of the bill, our present legislation

December 19, 1968

SENATE DEBATES

is very old and has been left without any
revision for quite some time.
The bill contains mainly two new ideas.
First, it provides a more flexible and more
practical definition of dumping. The definition
used up to now has proven to be very rigid;
the new definition tries to fnd really if there
is dumping-it is not merely an arithmetic
solution, it tries to find the facts.
The second new idea is the requirement for
the imposition of anti-dumping duty, that the
dumping, if it exists, once it is proven, must
be such as to cause injury. If dumping does
not cause injury, what is the purpose of
imposing an anti-dumping duty? Yet that was
the situation up to now.
Therein lies the essential improvement
deriving from the bill.
Honourable senators, the bill provides for
procedures to achieve this end. These are
rather complicated and I do not think it is
very useful at this time to go into them. As I
have said, the House of Commons Committee
and our own committee considered the procedure. Several amendments were suggested by
the House of Commons Committee and were
embodied in the bill. Some further amendments were made to the bill yesterday in the
other place, but none were really material.
They were merely to improve the procedure
itself.
I do not think it would serve any purpose,
after the study we have made in our committee, to go into details at this time. I think the
efficiency of the legislation will be proven
only by experience, and, if it is not speedy
enough, if it does not achieve the purposes
that I have mentioned, then it will be the
duty of the Government to suggest amendments. But at this time we have to wait to see
what will be the result. It seems to me that
the system proposed by the bill should prove
to be practical and efficient; but if it does not,
we can always improve on the present bill by
amending it.
Therefore, we need not have a long debate
before giving second and third readings to
this bill. The sponsor has given us a thorough
explanation, for which we are indebted to
him. I am happy to join with him in commending this bill to the Senate.
Hon. John J. Connolly: The debate that we
are having here this afternoon must be related as well to the explanation given yesterday
by the Acting Chairman of the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce, Senator Leonard, at which time the report of that
committee was discussed by this house. I am

sure every honourable senator feels very
much as I do, that we are indebted to the
sponsor, Senator Hays, who has made the
high points in this very important legislation
crystal clear, and for the supplementary work
that was done on it in the speech just delivered by the Leader of the Opposition.
As I say, yesterday we had the privilege of
receiving a report from Senator Leonard
about the work of the committee. For a good
many years the manufacturers in this country
have been concerned about the problem of
dumping. We live beside a neighbour which
produces manufactured goods in great quantities. Sometimes ends of runs and end of season materials which are not readily saleable in
the United States are thrown onto the
Canadian market at prices very much below
the prices at which they could be manufactured here, and below the selling price in the
country of origin. Sometimes, of course, this
practice results in a benefit to the consumer.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): And to
that extent the dumping or the alleged dumping may have a beneficial effect. But we have
now this new proposal before us in this legislation which, particularly in a country like
Canada, is highly important, namely, the
provision for the anti-dumping tribunal
proposed in section 21 of the bill as passed by
the House of Commons.
As was discussed in the committee, we
have infant industries in this country, industries that are growing and struggling, and if
dumping occurs to the detriment of that
growth, the tribunal, which is intended to be
full time and which will be-as one of the
members of the committee said-a sort of
poor man's court, will be available to the
people in such industries. They can go there,
and if in fact dumping has been found to be
the case on a mathematical basis by the
department, they can argue: "If you allow
these goods to come in here, we are going to
be severely hurt, and our industry will not
develop, though it is a viable industry and
could otherwise develop."
I think this is a great step forward, and I
am particularly pleased that it should come
out of an international conference like the
Kennedy Round which had as its main purpose the freeing of trade all over the world,
and the freeing of manufacturers, producers
and exporters from artificial barriers and
shackles that bind them. From that point of
view, I think a great advance has been made

SENATE DEBATES

for Canadian manufacturers, producers and
industrialists who have been arguing for
years that this was the kind of provision we
should have in our law. Even though it took a
large international conference to bring it
about, nevertheless I am delighted that it has
happened.
Honourable senators, at this point I want to
say a word about our procedure. More and
more we are getting to the point where we
can complain less and less about legislation
coming to us at the last minute and that we
have to rubber-stamp it. This is a wonderful
example of prescience on the part of Senator
"Hammy" McDonald. It was feared that this
bill would not be here until the dying moments of the session. What he did was to take
the White Paper which contained substantially the bill now before us and send it to a
committee for consideration. Under the leadership of Senator Leonard and with the assistance of the sponsor of the bill and the Leader of the Opposition-perhaps I should not
single out persons-and with the assistance of
honourable senators who obviously had
knowledge of the dumping provisions of the
Customs Act, there was a very thorough discussion of the bill. The result is that today we
are in a position where we know exactly
what we have before us, even though we
have not had the bill itself for more than an
hour. There may be one or two who saw it
last night.
This reflects good management in the
Senate, and the more of this kind of thing we
do, the better off we will be. Certainly, from
the point of view of our consciences we are
much better off because we know that we
have passed legislation that has had consideration from one of the best committees of the
Senate. We are indeed indebted to the sponsor, to Senator Flynn, and to Senator Leonard
for the speech he delivered yesterday, in connection with the bill.

SENATE DEBATES
this morning I made a recapitulation of the
work we have done so far in this present session of Parliament.
As to the legislative program of the
administration some 16 bills were introduced
in the other place and 13 were introduced in
this house. We have passed eight, as compared
with ten that were passed in the other place.
Nine private bills were introduced in this
house, of which we have passed eight. Two
private bills have been introduced in the
other place, and one has been passed.
The legislative record this session, particularly to me a newcomer to this chamber, is an
impressive one. When one considers that in
addition we have had debates on various
motions, beginning with the motion for the
re-appointment of a special committee of the
Senate on the Science Policy, and when one
takes into account the important meetings that
committee has held during the past two and a
half months, one recognizes that in addition
to our legislative program the committees of
this house are engaged in important work.
We have had, of course, several days of
debate on the motion for the adoption of the
report of the Special Committee of the Senate
on the Rules of the Senate. That debate is of
a fundamental character. While we have
adopted a certain portion of that committee's
report, the debate itself is not over. The
report represents a great deal of work, as we
all know, on the part of the committee and of
this house.
We were given the responsibility of examining the Estimates and the revised Estimates
for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1969.
These were considered by the Standing Committee on Finance. We have debated a motion
for the establishment of a committee of the
Senate to inquire into and report upon existing legislation regarding the census and statistics. We have received from the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce a
report suggesting that this matter should be
dealt with by a special committee of this
house. I should mention that the subject matter of this study was brought to our attention
by Senator Carter, who felt that there were
some aspects of our census operations that
could be improved upon. The report of this
committee will provide a valuable preliminary study to the introduction of legislation at
the next session of Parliament.
We have dealt with the supplementary
Estimates for the fiscal year ending March 31,
1969, which were considered by the Standing
Committee on Finance. We have debated a

December 19, 1968

motion for the appointment of a special committee of the Senate on Poverty. This took up
at least seven debating sessions. We have had
referred to us, as a result of the initiative
taken by Senator McDonald, the White Paper
on anti-dumping. We have just passed the
legislation that was embraced by it.
From this brief summary it can be seen
that we have had, during the past two and a
half months, a program of work which points
up the usefulness and importance of the
Senate. In addition to the record I have
outlined, we have debated various aspects of
Canada's commitment to the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization. From time to time we
have discussed certain other aspects of
foreign policy.
Honourable senators, while we are not here
to applaud ourselves for what we have done,
it is only right we should indicate that we
have not failed to discharge our obligations as
members of Parliament.
ADJOURNMENT
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators,
with leave of the Senate, I move that when
the Senate adjourns today it do stand
adjourned until Tuesday, January 21, 1969, at
3 o'clock in the afternoon.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, I
think the occasion of this motion was properly chosen by the honourable Leader of the
Government to recapitulate what has been
going on in this chamber since the beginning
of the session last September 12. It is useful
to have a record of what has been accomplished, not so much for the information of
members of this house, because we know the
Senate is performing efficient, useful, and
arduous work, but for the information of the
violent critics of the Senate who are usually
the least informed about it.

CANADA SHIPPING ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

Hon. Leopold Langlois moved the second
reading of Bill S-23, to axnend the Canada
Shipping Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this bull contains a variety of amendinents to the Canada
Shippmng Act which, as you know, is one of
the most lengthy of our statutes. As wiil be
recalled, only recently the Minister of Transport announced plans for a complete revision
of the Canada Shipping Act. However, the
amendinents we now have before us cannot
wait for the revision.
The bull contains oui first legisiative provisions concerning the new type of conveyance
called "air-cushion vehicles."1 Until now these
vehicles have been subi ect to regulation
under the Aeronautîcs Act, but as they are in
fact surface vehicles, that is not the appropriate act. I should make it clear that it is not
intended that they be regarded as ships, but
only that they be subject to some of the
provisions of the Canada Shipping Act ini the
saine manner as ships when they are being
operated over the surface of the water. The
provisions now proposed in this respect must
be regarded as an interimn measure only.
There seems to be no doubt that ultimately
we wifl need special legislation for air-cushion vehicles, but I believe this would be
premature at this time until we know much
more about these new craft and how they are
likely to develop.
There is provision in the bill to ailow landed immigrants to hold certificates as masters,
mates and engineers on ships, a privilege now
restricted to British subjects.
Provision is also made to permit regulations to be passed requiring ships of nine tons
gross tonnage and over to, be subject to inspection requirements. The present lower limit
is 15 tons gross tonnage.
In order to complement the provisions of
the Canada Labour <Safety) Code there is
provision for making regulations on the subject of accident prevention aboard ship, and a
provision respecting the reporting of accidents that occur on ships. Another clause
requires the reporting of other accidents such
as collisions or groundings of ships in our
waters. Heretofore, only accidents to British
ships were required to be reported.
There is a provision for regulations to be
made on the subi ect of pollution of oui

waters by garbage, sewage and other matters
from ships and, as has been recommended
by the Auditor General, there is a provision
that will allow any wrecked vessel to be
removed at the expense of the owner if it is
causing pollution or likely to do so.
There is also provision for regulations to be
made requiring ail vessels ini our waters to be
fitted with radio installations and to be provided with operators. This has been found
necessary for traffic control purposes.
In order to remove some doubts as to the
validity of some of the by-laws and procedures in the administration of pilotage, there
is a provision stating that ail existing by-laws
are valid.
In order that we may give effect to the
provisions of the International Convention on
Load Lines, 1966, there are amendinents to
bring the provisions of the act into Une with
that convention.
Finally, there are a number of miscellaneous items such as the repeal of certain
archaie sections relating to seamen and provisions giving some uniformity to the sections
relating to off ences and penalties.
Honourable senators, 1 recommend this bil
for favourable consideration by the Senate.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Flynn, debate
adjourned.

Resolution 500, for the relief of Marie
Denise Lisette Leroux Holmes.
Resolution 501, for the relief of Maria Mak
Kramer Papp.
He said: Honourable senators, I should like
to make a remark or two on this motion. Our
commissioners have not made quite as much
progress in the last month or so as I had
anticipated, but we are nearly through the
work in its bulk, though I do not know about
its timing. We have about 35 contested cases
still to be heared and about the same number
of uncontested cases. Some of them have been
taking an undue length of time because they
are old, and I suppose they have not been
brought to trial because they are difficult. In
the result, there has been more delay than I
had anticipated in the reports I had received
from our officials at an earlier date.
At the same time, I think I can say that we
have finished the bulk of the work. However,
there will be some reports to present after we
return. It is exceedingly difficult to say just
how long these 35 contested cases will take,
but I can assure the house that we are doing
everything possible to bring them to a
conclusion.
Honourable senators may have noticed that
a number of cases have been dismissed in our
reports for want of prosecution. We have
returned some money on some occasions
when that was justified, but for the most part
to those who have not attended to their petitions, not paid the fees, we have been giving
15 days' notice to signify their intention of
going on and satisfying the rules, or their
case would be dismissed for want of process.
That has been going on, and the work will be
conducted along those lines during the recess.
I think that some time about February, I will
have quite a number of petitions to be
dismissed.
I wish to let honourable senators know that
we are doing what we can to bring this matter to a conclusion, but properly to a conclusion and not just hurriedly. It will not be so
very long before, as honourable senators
seem to desire so greatly, we will have concluded this hundred years of work.
Resolutions adopted, on division.

RULES OF THE SENATE
MOTION FOR ADOPTION OF FOURTH REPORT
OF SPECIAL COMMITTEF-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday,
December 12, the adjourned debate on the
motion of Hon. Mr. Molson for the adoption
of the Fourth Report of the Special Committee on the Rules of the Senate which was presented on Thursday, November 28.
Hon. J. Campbell Haig: Honourable senators, after listening to the brilliant discussion
and introduction of the motion for the adoption of this report by Senator Molson a few
days ago, I have a few remarks to make. The
Special Committee on the Rules of the Senate
was a most interesting committee to work on.
The chairman and the staff had the work well
organized. We went back to the B.N.A. Act
and even prior to that, but I do not think that
any changes we make in our rules will be the
complete answer to the success of the work of
this chamber. I have a few suggestions to
make for discussion at some future time.
I recommend a better allocation of our time
and more co-operation with the government
of the day in scheduling our work. An example was indicated this afternoon by the
honourable Senator Connolly (Ottawa West)
on the question of referring to committee the
White Paper on Anti-Dumping. This type of
procedure could be used more often, enabling
us to discuss matters in conmittee with
departmental officials before the legislation
itself has been introduced in the Senate. We
would then gain a knowledge ahead of time
which would be of benefit to us.
I also think that our system of recording
our attendance is obsolete, and in fact it is
entirely wrong. It is not in accordance with
the Senate and House of Commons Act. In
the other place each member makes a declaration. We do not do that. Our attendance
record is kept as though we were in grade
school. It is printed in the Minutes of the
Proceedings each day. We can absent ourselves from this house by producing a doctor's letter, but a letter from us is not acceptable. This is something that could be
considered by a committee at some future
time.
The $4,000 real property qualification was
all right in 1867, but today $4,000 will not buy
10 feet of a vacant corner lot 50 miles from
any city. I think this requirement is obsolete
and useless, but we still have it. I also think
that a membership in this house should not
be considered as a part-time occupation. I

SENATE DEBATES

know certain senators who conduct their business from this place. This, I think, is wrong.
A person does flot need to accept the position
when oifered it, but we accept it knowing the
responsibilities attendant upon it, and therefore we should devote our full time to it.
I also think, as mentioned by Senator
MacKenzie yesterday in regard to secretarial
help-although that is flot a problem. of mine
at the moment-that there should be something done in the Senate, as they do in the
other place, in regard to research staff. If we
had the suggested timetable I arn recornmending, we would know two to three weeks
in advance what bills were coming up. The
whips and the leaders could allocate to the
senators what they should speak on, and then
they would have time for research.
This chamber has in it some of the leading
professional and business people ini our
nation, and I know from talking to some of
them. that they suifer a great deal of frustration here. In their own businesses they were
willing to work a five-and-a-half to six-day
week. As it is now they sit for two or three
days and then they become bored. That is not
an idie statement. I mentioned this before,
and several members came to me and said
that six months after they were summoned to
the Senate they were ready to resign. I asked
them why, and they replied that they had flot
enough to do. They said they had always
worked hard. I think that is what most of
honourable senators wish to continue to do.
I also think that when we return in the
new year consideration should be given to the
idea of having Senate comimittees sit while
the house is in session or in periods of recess.
If a committee sits in the morning of a certain day a senator should be given credit for
his attendance, or if a comrnittee sits during a
recess of the Senate, such as has happened in
the past, he should be credited for that
attendance. Consideration should be given by
the leaders and the whips to having certain
comnùttees meet on certain days of the week.
It has been traditional for our standing Cornrnittee on Banking and Commerce to sit on
Wednesdays, and perhaps the Standing Cornmittee on Transport and Communications
could sit on Tuesdays, and the Standing Commnittee on Finance on Thursdays. A suggestion could be made to the Governiment Leader
and the Government Whip that we adjourn at
4.30 p.m. on certain aftemnoons to enable us to
attend committee meetings. In other words,
honourable senators, I would like to see a
better allocation of our time.

SENAE
DEATESDecember
19. 1968

I tried in the Committee on the Rules of
the Senate to have the Senate commence its
sitting at 2.30, but I got slapped down hardmuch harder than yesterday afternoon on my
pronunciation of French.
I think the Governmnent Leader could
arrange for us to get rnoney bis, Estimates,
into the Senate a littie in advance of 3.30 p.m.
on the day before the end of the month when
the money is required. We have had this rush
in the past and we have passed Estimates
only to find that the Governmnent had enough
money for about 13 or 14 days in the next
month.
What I want to see is what happened with
respect to the anti-dumping législation,
material being given to us early enough so
that a thorough study can be made in
comrnittee.
On the motion of Hon. Mr. McDonald,
debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

At 5.45 p.m. the sitting was resumed.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
