OFFICIAL REPORT
THE SENATE
Thursday, January 27, 1938.
The Parliament of Canada having been
summoned by Proclamation of the Governor
General to meet this day for the despatch of
business:
The Senate met at 2.30 p.m., the Speaker in
the Chair.
Prayers.
OPENING

OF THE SESSION

The Hon. the SPEAKER informed the
Senate that he had received a communication
from the Governor General's Secretary informing him that His Excellency the Governor
General would proceed to the Senate Chamber to open the session of the Dominion Parliament this day at three o'clock.
NEW SENATOR INTRODUCED
Hon. Norman Platt Lambert, of Ottawa,
Ontario, introduced by Hon. Raoul Dandurand
and Hon. H. H. Horsey.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
At three o'clock His Excellency the Governor General proceeded to the Senate
Chamber and took his seat upon the Throne.
His Excellency was pleased to command the
attendance of the House of Commons, and
that House being come, with their Speaker,
His Excellency was pleased to open the Third
Session of the Eighteenth Parliament of
Canada with the following speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
It affords me much pleasure to greet you
upon the resumption of your parliamentary
duties.
The interval which bas elapsed since the last
session witnessed the Coronation, in the month
of May, of Their Majesties King George the
Sixth and Queen Elizabeth. The event was
one of special significance to the nations of
the British Commonwealth. In the Coronation
service and ceremonial, recognition was given

to the relationship between the Sovereign and
his peoples in the several Dominions, as embodied in the Statute of Westminster.
Members of the Government participated in
the deliberations of the Imperial Conference
which followed immediately after the Coronation. The Summary of Proceedings of the Conference will be placed before you at an early
date for your consideration. It is the belief
of the Government that the opportunities
afforded for the exchange of views and information on questions of common interest and
concern, will serve to further the well-being of
all parts of the Commonwealth.
It is gratifying to note that, during the
past year, there bas been a further substantial advance in Canada's economic recovery.
Revenues have reached new levels. Trade with
other countries has materially expanded. There
has been a general increase in employment and
a marked decrease in the numbers receiving
unemployment aid.
The recurrence, in a more acute form, of
drought conditions in certain areas of Western
Canada has unfortunately made it necessary
to provide assistance on an unprecedented scale.
The Government intends to continue its activities under the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act.
In view of the success which has attended
efforts to assist in the training of unemployed
young people, it is proposed to extend the
scheme during the coming year.
The Department of Agriculture bas been
reorganized and its services consolidated along
lines designed to improve the standard and
acceptability of Canadian farm products.
Arrangements are being completed for the
inauguration of a national trans-Canada air
service.
The National Employment Commission, the
Royal Commission appointed to inquire into
conditions in the Textile Industry, and the
Commission appointed under the provisions of
the Veterans' Assistance Commission Act, 1936,
have concluded their duties. The reports of
these commissions will be tabled in due course.
The strains and stresses, which economic and
social developments since Confederation have
placed upon Canada's governmental structure,
have disclosed the necessity for adjustments
which will enable it the more effectively to
serve provincial and national needs, and to
promote and preserve Canadian unity. My
Ministers are of the opinion that, with exact
and adequate information, it should be possible
for the appropriate authorities to work out
satisfactory solutions. As a first step towards
this end, a Royal Commission of Inquiry bas
been appointed to re-examine the economie and
financial basis of Confederation and the distribution of legislative powers in the light of
the new conditions which have arisen in the
past seventy years. The Commission has already
held sittings in many parts of the Dominion.

SENATE
The co-operation of the provinces has been
sought with a view to an amendment of the
British North America Act, which would empower the Parliament of Canada to enact
forthwith a national scheme of unemployment
insurance. My Ministers hope the proposal
may meet with early approval, in order that
unemployment insurance legislation may bc
enacted during the present session of Parliament.
Members of the House of Commons will be
invited to consider the report of the Special
Committee on Elections and Franchise Acts,
and you will be asked to enact such legislation
as may be necessary to implement such of the
Committee's recommendations as meet with
their approval.
A measure will be submitted to extend the
authority of the Board of Railway Commissioners.
Legislation will be introduced with a view
to furthering the principle of parliamentary
control of the export of electrical power.
The international situation generally continues to give much ground for anxiety. My
Ministers have endeavoured, as opportunity has
afforded, to promote international understanding and good-will. They have sought to join
the efforts of Canada to those of other countries
which are seeking by co-operation and conciliation to effect a settlement of questions and
issues which concern the world's peace.
The Administration has followed with deep
interest the course of the negotiations being
conducted with a view to the conclusion of a
trade agreement between the United Kingdom
and the United States of America. My Ministers are fully alive to the importance of these
negotiations, and to Canada's interest in their
outcome.
In August last, the Canadian Goverument
approached the Government of the United
States with a view to extending and revising
the trade agreement concluded between them
in 1935.
Exploratory conversations followed
which have resulted in efforts to effect a new
agreement on a broad and comprehensive basis.
It is hoped that negotiations may so progress
as to render it possible to submit the new
agreement to Parliament, for its consideration,
during the present session.
With a number of other countries, adjustments have been made, during the past year,
in our commercial relations in order to facilitate
a wider exchange of commodities.
The Covernment is convinced that, in seeking
to co-operate with the United Kingdom and
other countries in efforts to promote international trade, it is pursuing one of the most
effective means of ensuring economic security
and progress in Canada, and the betterment of
conditions in other parts of the world.

TRIBUTES TO DECEASED SENATORS
AND TO THE LATE SIR ROBERT
BORDEN
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, since we separated we have had to
record the loss of three of our colleagues, the
honourable senators Lemieux, Arthurs and
Bénard.
It was my privilege to live near Senator
Lemieux in Montreal. He had an exceptional
career.
During his student days lie was
actively interested in law, journalism and
politics. In 1891, when twenty-five years of
age, he was called to, the Bar. Five years
later, in 1896, having decided to enter
Parliament, lie sought a seat in the extreme
easterly portion of the province, in Gaspé,
where he had never set foot. He was returned by that riding, and for thirty-four
years sat as a member of the House of Commons. Becoming a Minister of the Crown in
1904, he served in that capacity until 1911.
In 1922 lie was made Speaker of the House
of Commons, a post that he occupied for
two terms, and in 1930 lie entered this Chamber.
During his parliamentary career Rodolphe
Lemieux was at one time returned for both
the ridings of Gaspé and Nicolet. He later
represented the constituency of Rouville, and
at another election was returned simultaneously
in Gaspé and Maisonneuve. On one occasion
when leaving for Gaspé, where a meeting
was to be held a few days before the nominations, he said to me: "If there is no candidate in Nicolet I will try to carry that constituency." This lie did. He liked the life
of an active politician, and was always ready
to mount the rostrum and address the people.
The late senator was a highly cultured
man and a polished speaker in both the
English and the French languages. He was
also a writer. As a university professor he
lectured on international law and the history
of Canadian law. In 1918 he was elected
President of the Royal Society of Canada.
His international activities were numerous.
He was the first Canadian to become a member of l'Institut de France, succeeding Cardinal
Mercier, of Belgium. This was a very great
honour not only to the late Senator Lemieux,
but to the whole of Canada. For a whole
term the senator lectured on law at the
Sorbonne, in Paris, and the people flocked to
listen to him and to applaud him. In 1907
he was appointed special delegate to Japan
to try to settle the question of Asiatic immigration to Canada, and in 1910 was Canada's
representative at the inauguration of the Parliament of the Union of South Africa.

4

SENATE

He obtained from the French Government
the gift of the Vimy Plateau, where, beside
the trenches they defended for years against
the Germans, a splendid monument bas been
erected to the memory of Canadians who fell
in the Great War. Not far from there lies
the body of the senator's only son, who was
killed in action in the last months of the
War.
The senator leaves behind a beloved wife,
the daughter of Sir Louis Jetté, one-time
member of Parliament, Chief Justice of the
Court of Appeals in the province of Quebec,
and Lieutenant Governor of that province.
During the senator's term as Speaker of the
House
of Commons, Madame Lemieux
graciously played the role of hostess to the
parliamentary representatives.
I know of few Canadians who have taken so
important a part in the affairs of Canada as
the late Senator Lemieux. He performed
admirably all the functions he was called upon
to perform.
I know less of the honourable Colonel
Arthurs, because he was with us for but a
short time. My right honourable friend who
faces me (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) had a
much more intimate association with him
and can speak of him with greater knowledge
than I possess. Seven times Colonel Arthurs
was returned to Parliament. He had the confidence of his community from 1908 to 1930.
During the Great War he served at the front,
having previously raised and commanded a
regiment which he took to England. After
tha War his special interest, so far as I could
follow his career from this end of the building, was the welfare of the returned soldiers.
He served on all committees of the Commons
which dealt with that subject, and gave all
his attention to the betterment of conditions
among returned men. Though be was with
us, as I have said, but a short time, he won
our friendship and ýesteem.
Senator Bénard was born in the Richelieu
Valley, in Iberville County, in the province
of Quebec. He had hardly passed his
twentieth year when be beard and answered
the call of the West. Settling in Manitoba,
be became interested in financial ventures
which must have brought him affluence, inasmuch as we find him the owner of 5,000 acres
of farm land under constant cultivation, a
large dairy farm stocked with 200 pure-bred
cows, and a ranch with about 1,000 head of
cattle. He served in the Legislative Assembly
of Manitoba from 1907 to 1917, when he was
summoned to the Senate. Being so much
absorbed in his large interests in the West,
he was not able to give as much time as he
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

would have liked to the work of this Chamber. He was a genial companion and broadminded citizen. His life is a proof to the
young men of Eastern Canada that courage
and perseverance bring success.
To the families of our departed colleagues
we offer our whole-hearted sympathy.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, I am not sure that since
I have been a member of this House we have
opened a session whose first days were not
saddened by the absence of tried and true
and intimate associates who had passed away
during the recess. This time there are three.
To them tribute bas just been paid by the
bonourable leader of the Government.
I shall refer first to him whom I knew first,
as a political associate and personal friend in
old days in Manitoba, Senator Aimé Bénard.
In the third of my elections he was one of
my constituents, but in earlier years when I
was but an unknown student, he, though of
the same age as myself, was already prominent
in the political and business life of his province. Of French Canadian extraction. he had
not the particular characteristics which are
so pre-eminent in that race. His mind was of
a practical turn; his ambitions were business
ambitions. His scope of operations in his own
field of activity w'eas undoubtedly in his day
the largest in the province of Manitoba,
and among the largest in the entire Prairie
West. He never did things in a small way.
He had big ideas; his mind looked ahead to
large achievements.
His heart was in his
farms and in his stock. He suffered the
vicissitudes which all have had to undergo in
that somewhat afflicted country, but nothing
daunted his spirit. nothing weakened his determination, and never was he more hopeful or
more active thon in the last years of his
life.
I never knew a man farther removed from
racialism in its unfavourable sense than was
Senator Aimé Bénard. He was beloved by
both races; proud of his own, but generous
to all.
Senator Arthurs entered the House of Commons in 1908, the sane year that I had the
honour of entering that House. His endowment of perseverance was doubtless greater
than mine, greater than that of most men, for
he remained there from that time until he was
elevated to this House in 1934. He was one
of those solid, substantial fellows with no high
opinion of their own excellences. His greatest
joy was to do the every-day work of life to
the best of his ability, to be of help to those

FEBRUARY 1, 1938
nearest him-his family and bis friends--and
ta live up ta the best standards of a private
citizen ail the days of ail the years.
Wben the War came upan us he raised a
regiment in bis district, having first suffcred
a.very severe personal calamity. H1e went
with bis regiment ta England, where, like
many others, it was braken up. But, nothing
daunted, he reverted ta the ranks, went over
ta France as a captain and served there until
1917, by which time he had attained the rank
of colonel. Since bis return ta Canada bis
dearest interest bas heen tbe care of thase
who, like himseli, suffered an the fields of war.
That be was quiet, unabtrusive, dependable,
a real]y good Canadian-such is the tribute
properly paid ta Colonel Arthurs.
Tbe last af aur late members ta whom I
refer, the Hon. Rodolphe Lemieux, was a
man wbo occupîed a prctty large space in the
recent history af this country. H1e was already
very prorninent in aur public if e when rnost
af us were rnerely aspiring ta take a humble
part therein. H1e was distinctly gifted in
tbose special talents in whicb, as I have always
thought, those ai bis race excel. His tastes
wcre for literature, for the fine arts, and
particularly for the arts ai speech, in which
fcw cauld equal him. It is one tbing ta speak
gracefully and forceiully in ane's native
tangue, but be who achieves like excellence
in anather tangue bas rny admiration, indeed
my envy. Thaugh many attain a measure
ai effectiveness, of skill, in twa languages,
few arrive at that stage which could be
described as approaching perfection, camplete
comnmand, as did Sir Wilfrid Laurier, who
passibly is aur rnost conspicuous example,
and Hon. Rodolphe Lemieux. On no occasion
did 1 ever bhear Han. Rodolphe Lemieux
utter a sentence irnproperly constructed or
one which was lef t blemished by the sligbtest
flaw. His taste in literature was af the purest,
bis commrand af language was ai the best.
And be loved the tbaughts af literature, and
loved ta discuss the writers af bath great
races, which writers no one knew better
than be.
In polities he was an ardent partisan, active
and energetic, who loved the fray. It is with
sorne sadness that rny mind goca back naw
ta conflicts in the other Hause in which I bore
a humble part and he a very canspicuaus part.
Many ai bis speeches corne ta my mmnd at
tbis very marnent.
Han. Rodolphe Lemieux was a big figure in
tbe public lufe af Canada. A reference ta him
shoulil nat he concluded without sorne mention
nf that great tragedy wbicb robbed bim of

5

bis only son. Tbe boy insisted an serving
bis country when bis country was in trial,
and with the passing ai that boy much went
out from tbe spirit ai Mr. Lemieux. It
emptied bis lufe ai hope, ai the source of
strcngtb in later years, ai tbe elixir ai age.
The sympathies ai alI wbo knew him went out
ta bim, and clung ta him, and bave been with
him ever since, because ai that great loss.
Ta the widows and farnilies ai thase wbo
are gone we extend aur deepest sympathy.
1 icel that I sbould like ta make reference
to-nigbt ta anather loss whicb this country
has sustained in the interval between aur
sessions--the passing af anc wbo neyer was a
member ai t-his House, but who occupied sa
tremendous a place in aur palitical history
tbroughout the last three or four decades that
I think it fitting somiething in the way ai a
special tribute should be paid bis memory
here. I refer, af course, ta Sir Robert Borden.
I rememober meeting Sir Robert soan aiter
I bad arrivcd at man's estate, boping some
day ta be ai same hclp in the task wbich
then was bis. Circumstances so turncd out
t-hat I was able ta accupy positions which,
enabled me -ta study the man and ta knaw
him in a way tbat fell ta the lot ai iew atbers
in aur country.
Sir Robert Borden did not possess in outstanding degree the ligbter but very valuable
persanal attributes whicb aiten give politicaI
influence as well as political success to men
na-t endowed with those deeper and more
solid and enduring qualities which in s0 large
a measure belo.nged ta him. H1e was a mat
ai strcngth, of in-tegrity ai purpose, ai pawerful physique, ai commanding intellectual farce,
a man with a stern and unchanging sense ai
duty, oourageous bath ai mind and ai heart.
It became bis great -task to guide this nation
thraugh the most difficult, certainly 'the heaviest, ai ahl the years ai its bistory. We often
are tald that times arc strenuaus and the task
ai public men severe. That is truc. Neyer
is there a period when the duties ai leaders
in public hife are not aneraus.
But I
cannot think that the time was before or
bas been since whýen respansibiliýties ai leadership involved so rnuch, and causcd sa fearful
and appalling a strain. as during the years
ai that war. Ail thýose experiences were new.
The t.ragedies wbich aur people endured were
necessarily refleeted in .tbe souls ai aur leadiers.
People were irritable, impatient. They scemed
ta be mired and unable ta extricate themselves and find eny direction ahead. Evente
crowded an events; grievances whicb always
beset public men werc multiplied; eertainly
they were more severe than anc could conceive them ta be at other times.

SENATE

It was no wonder that in every country
then at war governments fell and leaders
disappeared. In this Dominion alone, of all
countries engaged in the conflict, the statesman who was Leader of the Government
when the War began was Leader when
it ended. I know something of the strenuous
moniths and years which he passed through.
Many a night I went with him to his home
and saw him as he suffered distresses in
the nature of a Cethsemane until one, two
or three o'clock in the morning; but I
never knew his courage to fail. And I never
knew any selfish interest to intervene. In
fact, I can say without reservation that never
at any time in my contact with him did I
observe that he had the slightest interest in
any credit which might accrue to himself,
or any criticism which lie might have to
endure. These things became to him a matter
of utter indifference. He knew that he had
one high duty to perform, and with all the
intensity of his nature hie set himself to its
discharge.
Sir Robert Borden had a lawyer's analytical
mind. but he had the wiider grasp and outlook of the business man as well. He was a
lawyer of the first rank, a public servant of
unimpeachable integrity a.nd devotion, always
constuctive, always creative. He was a big
man, abundantly equipped. His talents were
pre-eminently practical, but he possessed at
the same time an ample and penetrating
vision, and withal a tolerant mind and sympathetic heart. When he laid d.own the sceptre
of office at the age of sixty-six he left behind
him a record of intense toil and a volume
of achievement rarely equalled among men.
His place in history will loom larger as the
decades pass.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, when I was speaking of the loss of
our own colleagues it did not occur to me to
refer to the demise of the former Prime
Minister, Sir Robert Borden. But I had the
honour of being the acting Premier when he
died, and on that occasion I expressed publicly
my regrets at his departure. I then stated that
Sir Robert, whose career I had followed from
the day he entered Parliament, had shone as a
very bright light at the Bar of Nova Scotia.
He stood there without a peer. And I noticed
when he was leader of the Conservative party
in the Commons that all his speeches were
prepared with great care and left very few
openings for his opponents.
He had as his opponent Sir Wilfrid Laurier,
and for a number of years met defeat, but at
last, in 1911, he came to power. I had frequent occasion to meet him socially and found
R:ght Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

him to be one of the most agreeable friends.
I was Speaker of this Chamber from 1905 to
1910 and came into contact with him at funetions where the leaders of both houses met
under our roof. When he entered the House
of Commons lie was nearing the meridian
of life, yet he studied assiduously to master the
French language. I remember that often lie
would repair to the apartments of the Speaker
of the Senate, where he found in the Speaker's
wife a very good French teacher. When I lost
my wife he told me in a long letter that he
owed to her encouragement the persistence
which he put into his study of French, for
she had pointed out to him from time to time
that half of his English vocabulary came from
the French language. Thus our social relations were very close.
After his retirement from Parliament he
became president of Barclay's Bank, and on his
frequent visits to Montreal we would get
together and dilate on past events. We would
discuss, somewhat objectively, policies of his
on which we had been sharply divided, and
often we closed our discussions by agreeing
still to disagree.
I noticed in his character a strong spirit of
tolerance, a spirit which helped one to get
on intimate terms with him. I mourn his
loss, and I share with my right honourable
friend opposite (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
the desire he expressed that this House should
bear testimony to the great qualities of the
late Prime Minister of Canada, Sir Robert
Borden.
(Translation):
Hon. JULES PREVOST
Honourable senators, I wish in my mother
tongue, which was also his own, to pay a brief
and last tribute of affection and mournful
regret to our late colleague, Hon. Rodolphe
Lemieux, one of the most distinguished men
that the old province of Quebec ever gave to
Canadian public life.
There is no higher praise to give Rodolphe
Lemieux than an acknowledgment that his life,

wholly devoted to study and to ever worthy
public activities, may well be cited as an
example to his fellow-citizens, especially to
the younger men who hope some day to play
a useful part, and wish to serve their country
well.
Let our thoughts wander back to the past,
and they will soon rise to the lofty sphere
where Rodolphe Lemieux always stood. Born
of plebeian stock, he was possessed of all
their strong qualities. Through his own
efforts, his personal merit, his solid character,
his incessant labour, he came up to the top,
and won in a brilliant fashion his titles of
nobility, those which alone are worth while and

FEBRUARY 1, 1938
stand for something in our country; I mean
the nobility of work, of mind, and of character.
As a inem-ber of the legal profession, university profeasor, lecturer, public speaker,
writer, member of Parliament, Minister of
the Crown, Speaker of the House of Gommons, senator, director of large financial institutions, envoy entrusted with diplomatie
missions, lie was neyer inferior, but always
equal to the tasks which lie had to fulfil.
I sh-al repeat here that Rodolphe Lemieux
thouglit, spoke, and wrote with sucli clearness,
logic and warmth that al bis thoughts, his
words and lis writings made up a harmonious
and well-ordered whole in which each part
wus in its right place. And it was9 so, not
only because lie was .possessed of talent, but
because lie was sincere, well informed, well
read, and liighly culturcd.
Witliin the limited scope of tliese few
o~bservations, I do noV intend to outline even
briefly tlie fruitful career of Senator Lemieux.
I sliould like Vo recaîl, liowever, that lie, a
stauncli Liberal, liad been soliooled by Laurier,
wlio limself had dcrived lis political faitli
froin Lafontaine and tlie renGwncd old leaders
of tlie Britishi Liberal party. That explains
the broadness and extent of Rodolphe
Lemieux's liberaliam.
Thougli Possessed of a very tliorough and
refined French culture, lie was, like Laurier,
imbued witli the Liberal prineiples of thie
En-glisqh scliool. H1e had, moreover, a well
recognized conception of the moderating influence of Britishi institutions. And tlie reason
why lie becaine one of our foremost parliamentarians is that lie was impregnated with
these Britishi principles upon whicli our representa-tive governient, and the Canadian Constitution are founded.
I also wisli Vo add 4that Senator Lemieux,
Frenchi Ganad-ian Vo, the core, without fear
and without reproacli, true to lis nationality
and Vo the best traditions of hie race, wus
first of ail a Canadian. Ris political mentallty
was profoundly Canadian. He looked upon,
and loved, tlie whole Canadian land; lie belield
the past, tlie present, and the future of this
nation; lie knew liow Vo, deteet and was
prone Vo advocate thie riglits and duties devolving upo-n every component part of tlie
Ganadian people.
Tliat eminent man is no more. H1e reaelied,
the end of lis course in Vths transitory life,
and in the great beyond lie will continue to
live through aIl that wae best in him.
Thie generation which preceded mine, and
which is for tliose of my years like a connecting Iink with that of our fathers, is fat
disappearing. During tlie seven years that I

have been a member of Vhis House, liow many
of our colleagues have passed away! The
ime of Rodolphe Lemieux is now added Vo
the long list of those wliom we liad known
in the early days of our public life, and wlio
liave passed on, one after the other, leavîng
many pleasant memories, but laying bare
more and more the scenery of our youth,
whicli is gradually fading away.
Honourable senators, let us bow respectfully before the grave wherein lies one of the
last eurviving men cf a wliole era, and of a
long list of great Canadians.
When Laurier died, Rodolphe Lemieux
uttered in the House of Gommons tliese words,
whîcli I am applying Vo li'im to-day witli
a feeling -that you will share witli me:
Ris spirit passed gently, serenely. as tliough
mýidst the darkening shadows of 11f e's f alling
night the faith of bis forefathers had already
reVealed the gleain of dawn, presage of
eternal day.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable senators, 1 join feelingly in thie words cf praise
for the life, and deep regret for the demise,
cf Sir Robert Borden and of our departed
colleagues.
In the name of a very old fTiendship, 1 wish
Vo mark my special sorrow at the loss cf
Senator Lemieux. For forty years I had been
consistently among hbis political opponents
and, I confess, among those not thie lest
violent. Perhaps, by reason cf the past, the
words cf the present may be ail the more
appropriate. Truc it is that our old friendsliip
survived -many an acrimonious, encoi.mter on
the publie platfcrin. This was due largely Vo
the feet that even in thie ardour cf tlie fray
Rodolphe Lemieux always was dignified in
demeanour and cou-rteous in language. Rarely,
and only under extreme provocation, did he
resort Vo personal invective, but when a-roused
lie was a formidable f ce. For inany years he
was Laurier's choice as leader and the spearhead of lis shock troops in Quebee.
This Bouse knew lim when circurnstanees
had wrouglit in lim a measure of political
detachment and, through. a long tenure cf the
speakership in thie Gominons, a rather judicial
consideration of controversies. It was aiso

If with the years our colleague appeared
less active, lie continued to be an indefatigable
worker. The outstanding quality of his rare
make-up was, I should say, his determination
and capacity for work. Although gifted with
a rema-rkable personality and a brilliant and
well-balanced mind, it was his untiring industry that made of him a journalist, a member of Parliament, a Minister of the Crown, a
statesman and a great Speaker of the House
of Commons. His unremitting energy kept
him ploughing ahead, even after his political
activity had ceased, and made of him the
best professor of constitutional law that Quebec has ever produced and one of its most
gifted lecturers. He read copiously and wrote
constantly, and kept himself abreast of all
events and "au fait" of the trend of literature, both in French and in English.
Our late colleague deserved and obtained
many honours, some of which helped to enhance the renown of his native land. It was
indeed a great tribute te Canada that lie was
selected to replace Cardinal Mercier as a
member of the Institute of France. It was
aiso a proud day for us when he delivered
in the great hall of La Sorbonne a series of
lectures on Canadian political history, which
ranked with the very best the University of
Paris had ever heard.
Outstanding for his untiring industry, for
his achievements, but also for the dignity of
his life. Lemieux will stand as a model for
young men, particularly of my province.
Truly Lemieux built, step by step, the ascending course of his career. Many young people
in our day, who spend most of their time in
lanenting the conditions in which they are
constrained to live, and put all their hope in
the overthrow of these conditions, might well
ponder the lesson of courage, of industry, of
dignity, that comes to them from Lemieux's
life. His death has been a cruel blow to his
family and te his friends, a real loss te his
province and to his country. He was among
the very few Canadians who were mourned
not only in the Dominion but also in France
and England.
I wish te associate myself whole-heartedly
with the message of condolence so eloquently
voiced by both leaders of this House.
Hon. O. TURGEON (Translation): Honourable senators, I hasten tc express my
admiration for the splendid tribute which,
from both sides of this House, has just been
paid to our departed colleagues and for the
sympathy tendered to their families, in all of
which I join most heartily.

Arthurs rendered great services during the

gratitude.
The honourable Senator Bénard, from
Senator
and the honourable
Manitoba,
Patrick Burns, from Alberta, also deserve
the gratitude of their respective provinces
for their generous contribution toward their
progress.
I learnt witb inexpressible grief of the
demise of our colleague Senator Rodolphe
Lemieux, one of Canada's most distinguished
sons, and I take this opportunity to render
him a tribute of affection, esteem and admiration, although I am indeed unable to
express it according to his merit. At least
my words surge from the bottom of my heart
in reverence for the memory of a most devoted
friend whose generous soul and powerful mind
it was my privilege to know, whose eloquence
could sway any audience, regardless of political
affiliations. His eloquence and his wonderful
learning were also appreciated outside Canada,
and especially in France.
I shall not undertake to review all the
successful results he achieved in his missions
to the most remote countries, such as Japan,
South Africa and others, and which some
honourable senators have just recalled more
fittingly than I could have done it. But I
do wish to refer te his great merit in having
obtained from the French Government the
gift of Vimy Ridge, comprising 25 acres of
land where lie the remains of our soldiers
who fell during the War, and among them his
only son.
Such a deed shall never be forgotten. That
parcel of land on French soil is now wholly
Canadian. He it was who signed the agreement on behalf of the Canadian Government.
In France, lie was ever appreciated and
admired not only for his eloquence, but also
for his equally wonderful learning and for
the valuable relations he was promoting
between Canada and France.
In 1906, the Government of the French
Republie made him a Knigbt of the Legion
of Honour, and in 1924 the Vatican bestowed
on him the title of Commander of Saint
Gregory the Great.
Forty years have now elapsed since I first
became acquainted with him, and from that
time to his last moments he was to me as
a devoted and generous brother, ever ready
to help me with the problems of my constituency and my province, and especially on
behalf of New Brunswick fishermen, a class

But I bave been asked to undertake a

SENATE
Now, I must be very brief. I want to point
out that I think we should do well on this
occasion to tender our felicitations to the
Senate as well as to Hon. Senator Dandurand
upon the fact that be bas occupied so many
prominent positions in this House, in this
country and elsewhere, during the past forty
years. He is to my mind the most energetic
man I have ever met, and bis speed does not
seem to be lessened with the years. He bas
a mind that scintillates, a power of expression
that keeps step with bis mind, and a physique
like that of a trained athlete. May Senator
Dandurand long live to adorn the Senate!
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I have been
asked to present a resolution, and I deem it
a privilege and an honour to be permitted
to move the following:
Resolved, that we bis colleagues express our
felicitations to the Hon. Senator Dandurand,
and our appreciation of the valuable work lie
bas accomplislhed on behalf of Canada, both in
this country and abroad. As Speaker of the
Senate and subsequently as leader in this House
for the Governmîent, which he so ably represents,
he has been untiring in his devotion to the
onerous tasks to whieh lie lias been assigned.
We wisli specially to mention the great
honour bestowed upon him, as a representative
of Canada at the League of Nations, in his
election as President of that body. The indefatigable efforts whici lie put forth while
representmog Canada in the Assenbly of the
League have brought about resuits tending
toward the peace of the world and the betterment of conditions among all nations.
We desire to extend to him our sincere
wisles for prolonged life and continued usefulness, not only at home, but also in the wider
sphere of international relations, where he bas
brought honour to the Empire and to bis
native land.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, it is with real pleasure, a
pleasure which I shall prove to be unfeigned,
that I second this resolution. One can harbour
only a spirit of congratulation towards a man
who bas spent forty years in the Senate of
Canada. I do not know whether this sets a
new record or not, but in looking around me
I feel that it will stand for a long time in the
annals of this country. Who is there here
who hopes to be present forty years from the
date of his introduction into this Chamber?
But years count for little; achievement
counts for much; and I doubt if any others,
whether their time bas been long or short,
have done the volume of work accomplished
by Senator Dandurand in the Senate. He
was fortunate in coming here early. The
right honourable senator from Eganville
(Right Hon. Mr. Graham) bas said he took
the easy road. I do not know. The other
road is hard enough, but, looking back

twenty-five or thirty years. I think it would
have been vastly more difficult for any of us
to come by the path taken by Senator
Dandurand. He must have possessed some
latent virtue, some long credit early in bis
history, to enable him to advance to the
envied post which he reached at so young
an age.
Not only bas the senator occupied every
post of consequence here, not only bas he
done every piece of work imaginable, and
done well every task to which he set bis
hand, but at the same time ho bas taken a
most active part i0 government, an active,
if not too active, part in electionsSome Hon. SENATORS:

Oh, oh.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: -and
bas
been all the while an international figure of
real consequence and moment. I have felt
proud that a Canadian was considered qualified
to occupy the post of President of the
Assembly of the League of Nations. The
talents which are bis, and of which so few
of us can boast, bis ability to speak in two
languages, bis knowledge of the politics of
two
hemispheres-these
are qualifications
which marked him for that great distinction.
We are witnesses of that tireless energy
which
characterizes
him
everywhere. It
makes one think that life is worth living if
one can hope to reach the age of our distinguished leader and be able to maintain
the steam, the vivacity and the vitality that
seem to be bursting from him at every point.
I am sure I speak the thought of everyone on
this side when I say we heartily join in our
congratulations to the honourable leader of
the House. Speaking for myself, I say there
is nothing which makes the post of leadership
more pleasant and more satisfying than to
have opposite a man whom one respects. And
that respect, let me testify, knows no reservation.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN:
Honourable
senators, I feel like apologizing for rising a
second time in this House to-night, but I
have many personal reasons for joining in the
congratulations that have been extended to
the leader of the House by the right hotourable leader on this side (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) and the right honourable gentleman
fron Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham)congratulations which our colleague so well
deserves.
My first impression of the honourable
senator was that of a fiery, irrepressible and
almost untractable Liberal. He personified
what, in the first blush of our Conservative
faith, we young men of the day qualified as

FEBRUARY 1, 1938
a "rouge," unrepentant and past redemption.
Then, when for a time in charge of the
Conservative forces in my province, I had
to meet the worthy blade of my honourable
friend, I found, to my dismay, that it was a
trying and often costly experience. He was
an army by himself, fighting on all fronts
and at all times.
But when we were negotiating in the name
of our respective parties, on some common
ground of accord or compromise, I found him
as scrupulously honourable and dependable as
he had been, in conflict, fiery and relentless.
Friend, confidant and adviser of Laurier,
the Liberal party was wise and most fortunate
in having him so long as the strategist and
marshal of their main forces: those of Quebec.
In the Senate, for more than twenty years,
I have known him mostly as a leader of one
side or the other of the House; and I venture
to say that it would be difficult to find in the
annals of this honourable body a leader who
has to a higher degree merited the admiration
and possessed the confidence of both parties.
His exceptional physical and mental capacity for work has allowed him to carry on for
years, without respite, a task which very few
His frankness, bis
men could undertake.
loyalty to the House, have been subjects of
astonishment to many of his political foes
when entering the Senate.
I shall always remember the resolution of
congratulation, so highly complimentary to
the honourable gentleman, spontaneously
moved on this side of the House by Hon.
J. D. Reid, a dyed-in-the-wool Conservative
if ever there was one. Hon. Mr. Reid had
been at first surprised and subsequently conquered by the sterling qualities of heart and
mind of the honourable senator for De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Dandurand).
In the realm of legislation, the services
rendered by him during his long tenure of
office are so great that it would be difficult to
over-estimate them.
It is a pity that the country at large is not
as well aware as are his own colleagues of
his untiring devotion to duty, for if it were
the mighty voice of the people from ocean
to ocean would rise with our own in expression
of appreciation and gratitude.
But Canada bas still other reasons for pride
in and gratitude to the honourable senator.
At the League of Nations his ingratiating
personality, his sturdy figure, full-blooded
complexion and white hair, and his clear and
commanding voice, have for years typified
Canada. At Geneva everybody knows Senator Dandurand and calls him respectfully
"Monsieur le Président,' because not only

il

Canada's prestige but also his own recognized merit have led him to the presidency of
the Assembly, the only Canadian who has
attained, perhaps the only one who ever will
have attained, this honour.
The remarkable portrait of the honourable
gentleman which his many friends presented
to the League of Nations inaugurated the
portrait gallery of its presidents, and will,
for very many years, I trust, commemorate the
brilliant tenure of office of Canada's first
representative in the chair of the presidency.
Despite his many occupations, the honourable senator is always willing to add more
to his tasks, especially at the call of philanthropy or public duty. No one in his city
has more effectively worked for the co-ordination and expansion of charity, and its many
pursuits of mercy. No one has better served
the interest of higher education in his province. In fact, in this respect, his efforts have
not relaxed, as he is about to crown fittingly
his long and fruitful labours. Scan his life
and always you will find his industry intensely
applied to the development of an idea or the
pursuit of a cause, with many brilliant successes and no great failure to record.
If, in my province, I had to choose an outstanding personality typifying my race to
best advantage, it would indeed be difficult
for me to select anyone more intellectually
brilliant, more thoroughly informed, more
generous in his natural dispositions, more
public-spirited, more firm in his convictions
and more courageous in their defence, yet
more tolerant and comprehensive of the views
and opinions of others. Truly, it can be said
that our colleague is a fine specimen of the
best Canadian type.
The resolution was adopted.
My honHon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
ourable colleagues and friends, I confess that
I can hardly find words to express my appreciation of the very kind attitude of this Chamber towards me on this occasion. These last
few days I have wondered why newspapers
and friends had noticed the fact that I have
been forty years in the Senate. I did not
see any personal merit in that fact. I lived.
Yet, apparently, to be a member of one of
the Houses of Parliament for forty years is
something to be noticed.
My right honourable friend opposite (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) has wondered how I
reached this Chamber without passing through
the House of Commons, forty years ago, when
I was thirty-six years of age. It is somewhat
of a mystery to him. I desire to state that
probably the experience whieh I had gained

loss of forty ta fifty million dollars yearly
incurred by the country ta caver deficit and

Hon. JAMES MUJRDOCK: Honourable
senators, 1 rise ta a point of order. It seems
ta me that the notice of motion which has
just been given goes inta argument and discussion, whicb, under the Rules of this House,
are not permitted in such a notice. It is quite
proper ta give notice that representatians will
be made, but the argument that it is intended
ta raise should not be contained in the
resolution.

I have observed similar resolutions being

The Speech frorn the Throne this year has
been regarded in certain quarters and by some
correspondents of the press as being largely a
review of outstanding incidents of the past
year; and it has been said that its references
to the principal matters to come before Parliament this session are rather vague and
indefinite. Any element of uncertainty contained in His Excellency's references to future
legislation is, to my mind, fully justified by
the character of the situation in which Canada
finds herself at the present time. While we
have gratification expressed at the "substantial
advance in Canada's economic recovery" and
the attainment to new levels in our national
revenues, plans are still discussed for assisting
unemployed young people, reminding us of the
ever-present spectre of that unsolved problem.
Vividly, too, are we reminded of the dire misfortune which drought has brought to once
fertile and productive areas in Western Canada.
Further references are made to the "strains
and stresses" upon Canada's governmental
structure and to "the necessity for adjustments." The international situation "continues
to give much ground for anxiety." If, therefore, the future of the Government's legislative programme in some respects appears veiled
in uncertainty, is the explanation not to be
found in the fact that all of us in our personal
business affairs, as well as in relation to
public questions, are trying to feel our way
along carefully from day to day and from
week to week?
Yet at the same time one feels that the
Speech from the Throne affords much ground
for hope. For one thing the interests of agriculture as a basic, social and economic
factor in our national life are recognized in
the continued activities of the Prairie Farm
Rehabilitation Scheme and in the improvement of marketing facilities organized under
the new marketing branch of the Department
of Agriculture. We may all hope and pray
that more favourable natural conditions will
bless the Prairie farmer this year. His has
been a valiant fight against adversity during
the past seven years, but it has been made
easier by Dominion-wide recognition of the
fact that it is a struggle of national importance.
The prospect of new trade agreements which
will further facilitate a wider exchange of
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT.

comimodities throughout the world gives added
soundness to our econornic outlook and contributes a welcome note of improved international relations. The details of these agreements will be awaited with keenest interest.
Overshadowing in importance all references
to economie and financial matters is the
issue of national unity foreshadowed in His
Excellency's speech. A prolonged discussion
of this subject at the present time would be
out of place, in view of the current sittings of
the royal commission of inquiry. It would
seem to me, however, that this great question
is one that should appeal with peculiar appropriateness to the mind of this House, and
that we should all take the earliest opportunity
of expressing the faith that is in us. The test
of financial hardship appears to threaten the
existence of Confederation, if some of the
wild words spoken of late by men in responsible positions are to be taken seriously. I
thoroughly believe, however, that the very
adversity of these times already gives evidence of stirring to unprecedented heights of
achievement the potential spirit of Canadianism, which throughout all the provinces
has been quietly gaining strength with the
years.
One of the few pieces of new legislation
promised in the Speech from the Throne is
that arising out of the report of the Special
Committee on Elections and Franchise Acts.
While the recommendations of that report
will not come personally close to any honourable member of this House, they will have a
vital bearing upon the character and development of the communities in which wc live.
Democratic institutions of government in the
final analysis are based on the exercise of the
franchise by a free people, and I am convinced that certain far-reaching and fundamental changes should be made in our electoral laws to mýake them more consistent with
the democratic ideas we profess. For much
enlightenment on this subject one is indebted
to several honourable senators for their contributions to a debate in this House some
five years ago. I was much struck at the
time, and have been more forcibly impressed
since, by the remarks of the honourable
senator from Saint John (the Hon. the
Speaker) and the honourable senator from
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae) about the cost
of elections. I believe that the suggestions
made so frankly by these honourable gentlemen then apply with even greater need and
greater truth to conditions prevailing to-day.
The present Dominion Franchise Actwhich, one assumes, will be almost conpletely enveloped in a new Elections Act-

FEBRUARY 2, 1938
was approved by Parliament a few years ago
with comparatively little opposition. It was
based on the idea of establishing closed lists
such as exist in the United Kingdom, with
provision for annual revision. The cost of
maintaining this system in Canada, where
the shifting of population in certain urban
areas is as great as 30 per cent per annum,
was found to be prohibitive. The closed list,
however, is a sound accessory to a democratie
system of government; and it is to be hoped
that a fair compromise may be found somewhere between the extremes of the present
open list and the proposed expensive system
of revision under the original Franchise Act.
In this connection, it is also time to consider
seriously the adoption of a measure of compulsory voting such as exists in our sister
Dominion of Australia. Privileges carry with
them corresponding responsibilities; and a
democratic community such as we are
supposed to be has every right to expect its
members to vote at election time, thus removing an all too common complaint on the
part of a select but increasing number of
well-to-do people that politics, as an active
interest, is something to be avoided.
May I thank honourable ,members for their
courtesy in listening so patiently to my remarks. I now have the honour of referring
th.em to the resolution which I have already
moved.
Hon. GUSTAVE LACASSE (Translation):
Honourable senators, I desire first of all, in
fulfilment of the pleasant duty called for by
the occasion, to thank the Government leader
in the Senate for having invited me, for -the
second, time since my appointment to this
Chamber, to second the Address in Reply to
the Speech from the Throne. You will understand the emotion I feel at this moment, for
the present occasion brings back to me the feeling I experienced when, for the first time and
when still a young man, I participated in the
deliberations of the "Sages of the nation."
I think it is exact to say that in the course
of the last decade this Chamber has renewed
its membership to the extent of forty per
cent, and still the Grim Reaper continues to
decimate our ranks, apparently bent on disproving the theory of senatorial irremovability.
No more than the common run of mankind
can we place ourselves beyond his reach.
Death accomplishes periodically what the Constitu*ion does not allow the voters to do.
It is therefore with a feeling of sincere admiration that I join my personal congratulations to those which were tendered yesterday
to our still very active leader (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) on the completion of forty years

15

of uninterrupted devotion to his country in
the public life of Canada. The zeal and
enthusiasm he has brought to the service of
his fellow-citizens is and will remain the inspiration of his juniors.
I wish also, in the name of this Chamber,
to tender to the new occupants of the seats
recently made vacant by death the hearty
congratulations of their colleagues on the
official recognition which their appointment
to the Senate constitutes of the services they
have rendered, in some capacity or other, to
the Canadian community. I am sure that the
judgment, intelligence and goodwill that they
have already shown elsewhere will prove most
valuable in the consideration of the matters
of public interest which constitute the work
of this Chiamber.
Coming now, honourable senators, to the
examination of the official document which is
called the Speech from the Throne, a document which sets forth each year, at least in
outline, the sessional programme, I shall endeavour to make as complete an analysis of
it as possible; keeping close to its text, without
attempting more or less justified digressions.
Some will probably say of this document-the
phrase has become quite familiar to me since
I have had the honour of sitting in this
Chamber-that it is far more remarkable for
what it omits than for what it contains. Be
that as it may, I think it is substantial enough
to form the subject of many interesting studies.
Following a brief reference to the Coronation of Their Gracious Majesties King George
the Sixth and Queen Elizabeth, as well as to
the Imperial Conference held immediately
after these imposing ceremonies, the Speech
from the Throne briefly mentions the return
to a state of relative prosperity which has
become more and more marked in recent
months. The Speech notes particularly the
increase in revenue, the expansion of our trade
with other countries and the gratifying decrease in the number of unemployed. This
general improvement, the Speech however
admits, has been somewhat marred by the
unfortunate situation of that vast area of
Western Canada at one time proudly called
the granary of the Empire. Mention is also
made, and very properly, of the means taken
by the Government to remedy these conditions and if possible prevent their recurrence.
As to the other undertakings of the Government, such as the Employment Commission,
the inquiry into the textile industry, aid to
returned soldiers, inquiry into the economic
and financial bases of Confederation, and distribution of legislative powers, we shall soon

This analysis, honourable senators, which I
have condensed as rnuch as I could, of what
the Speech fromn the Throne expresses and
suggests, will be the extont of the remnarks 1

debato on the Address in Reply to the Speech

to detain the House any longer, I have scrupulously endeavoured to stick to the ideas
and facts mentioned in the Speech from the
Throne. May I, however, in closing, emphasize the nécessity of peace within as well as
witbout the country. What, in fact, is the
foundation of social ordor and peace within

and immense country like Canada, wbore

I have ploasure, honourable senators, in
seconding my honourable friend who s0 dloquontly moved the Address in Reply to the
Speech from the Throne.>
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourablo
senlators, I regret to inform this honourable
Chamber that just a short timne ago I roceived a telephone message from. our rîght
honourable leader on this side (Righýt Hon.
Mr. Meiglion), stating that ho is indisposed
and will not be ablo to take bis seat to-day.
It will thei'efore be impossible for him to
make -hie eloquent address, on the subject
of 'the Speech fromn the Throne, of which wo
know ho is capable.
I crave the indulgence of honourable senators
while I make a few extempore remarks on
this <ocasion. I wan-t first of ahl to tender
my heartiest congratulations to the honourablo
the junior senaýtor from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert) and to our eloquent friend the
honourable senator from Essex (Hon. Mr.
Lacasse) on the very able and fitting manner
in wb.ich they pr.oposed and seconded the
Addrees in Reply to the Speech from the

moderate and informative speech, and I am
quite satisfied thst it lias made a most favourable impression on Vhis buse.

because no one could possibly do so unless
the details of -the proposed treaties were known
to him. I have only this to say. Our experience with the Imperial pact during the
last few years has proven that it is most
beneficial to Canada and to the Empire as a
whole, and I trust the Government will not
do anything that would impair this pact, or
be to the detriment of Canadians, or tend
to lessen our export and import trade within
the British Empire. On the other hand, I
recognize that Canada must do everything
she possibly can to meet the wishes of her
powerful and friendly neighbour to the south.
It is necessary, especially in these times of
world unrest, that we should draw closer together. I know that our American friends
are good traders, and I realize that the members of this Government will be alert to
sec that the agreement, if arrived at, shall
nfot be too much to the disadvantage of
Canada or the Mother Country. I know the
Mother Country is going to conduct her
negotiations direct. She is perfectly capable
of taking care of herself. But too much care
cannot be exercised in regard to our arrangements with the United States.
The present trade agreement has now been
in effect for some years. According to the
figures it turned out very well until a few
months ago, when the recession in trade commenced in the United States, causing the
price of Canadian cattle and dairy products
to drop to such an extent as to interfere
with Canada's export trade to the United
States. When we come to manufactured goods
the situation is this. The Amerinan nation
being one of 130 millions of people, highly
specialized in mass production, their costs
are so much lower than those the Canadian
manufacturer can hope to reach that at the
moment we are in danger of having American
goods dumped into Canada at less than fair
market prices. I am satisfied, however, that
the Government is alert to this situation and
wil l see to it that for duty purposes a fair
market value shall be established on all imports
of manufactured goods from the United
States.
Some reference has been made to proposed
changes in the Elections Act. I share the
opinion of the mover and the seconder that
these may bring about an improvement over
what some of us have been accustomed to.
Anyone who has ever been a candidate in a
Montreal division bas some idea of the difficulty of working under the Elections Act. I
hope this new Act will prevent from voting
the thousands of people who generally vote
in various divisions of Montreal when there
is no rhyme nor reason in their doing so.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

Whether the Act will explain the difference
between a contribution and a levy, I do not
know. Possibly that point will be taken
under advisement.
My eloquent friend from Essex (Hon. Mr.
Lacasse) bas -referred, in his usually graceful
manner, to His Majesty the King. I want
to say to him and to the House that those
of us who had the great privilege of being
present at the Coronation were tremendously
impressed with the unanimity of loyalty displayed on all occasions towards His Majesty
George VI and his gracions consort the Queen.
I came away from the Coronation impressed
more than ever with the solidarity and the
greatness of the Empire. The Coronation
made us prouder than we had been before
of being Canadians, and of the fact that Canada is a part of the great British Empire.
The world is in a serious state of unrest at
the present time. The gifted leader of the
Government in this House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) knows more about that than I do.
The vast amount of money that the United
Kingdom is spending and will continue to
spend on defence will do more than anything
else could possibly do for the maintenance
of peace. We know that the Imperial Government, as well as the governments of all
other portions of the Empire, stands for peace,
but, with some nations arming in a feverish
way, it is only right and proper that the
United Kingdom should take the step she
has taken in regard to defence.
Now may I say a word or two in reference
to domestic trade? To me, as a business man,
connected with a number of manufacturing
industries, it has been very gratifying that
the trade of Canada has kept up as well as
it bas, notwithstanding the serious business
recession that has existed across the border
for the last five or six months. Difficulties
are ahead for the United States, and also for
Canada. If the recession proves to be but
temporary, as everybody hopes, then all will
be well, but if it continues for a prolonged
period we are bound to feel its effects in
this country. That brings me to say that
the policy of the Government and of Parliament, as well as of business and of all citizens,
must be one of rigid economy.
I apologize to honourable members for
these imperfect remarks. As I have said, I
was commandeered only at the very last
moment.
May I take this opportunity of welcoming
the honourable junior member from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) to this Chamber. His
speech of this afternoon was a splendid one.
Because of his experience we know that he
will be a very useful member. May I also
be allowed to express our pleasure at the

FEBRUARY 2, 1938
appointment of the honourable senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Marshall), who was introduced ta the House yesterday. I should like
ta say ta them that, as the honourable leader
has remarked, they will find in this Chamber,
not a political atmosphere but an atmosphere
of co-operation, and an opportunity of doing
most interesting and constructive work. I
wish them a long term of years ta enjoy
the important positions which they have
now been called ta occupy.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, I am sure we have all listened with
pleasure and interest ta the speech just coneluded by my honourable friend from Alma
(Hon. Mr. Ballantyne). I wish that his leader
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) had been present
ta hear hira discuss the situation, as he secs
it, in the country. I was sorry ta hear that
the right honourable leader on the other side
was unwell. I proposed ta my honourable
friend from Alma that this debate should be
adjourned until to-morrow if his leader could
be present then; but the right honourable
gentleman, having heard of my proposal,
demurred and asked us ta proceed.
I want ta join with my honourable friends
in congratulating the honourable junior member from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) and our
good friend and colleague from Essex (Hon.
Mr. Lacasse), on their speeches in moving and
seconding the Address. We echo the encomiums
that have appeared in the press, Conservative
as well as Liberal, with respect ta the appointment of Hon. Mr. Lambert, and we applaud
that appointment. His presence here means
that we shall have one more ripe economist,
able ta give valuable assistance towards solution of the many problems coming before us
from time ta time.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Hear, hear!
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I take this
opportunity also of welcoming Hon. Mr.
Marshall, who bas had a long experience in
political life. Because of his knowledge of
agricultural problems his advice will be especially valuable when we are dealing with such
problems, of which there are.so many at this
time.
The honourable senator from Essex (Hon.
Mr. Lacasse) bas made a very interesting and
valuable contribution ta this debate. I followed his speech closely, and I desire ta pay
tribute ta the level-headedness and good
common sense which prevailed throughout his
remarks.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hearl

19

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: May I say a few
words as to Canada's present economic situation. We all know that the year 1936 was a
surprisingly good one. Prosperity continued on
the same level during the first nine months of
1937. From 1932 onward there was a marked
and regular improvement, as will be seen from
these figures showing the growth in our
exparts:
546,000,000
1932................$
596,000,000
1933.. ............
758,000,000
1934.. ............
825,000,000
1935.. ............
1,015,000,000
1936.. .............
The figure for 1937, I believe, will be in excess
of that for 1936.
The last three months of 1937 showed a
slight recession, which was attributable ta the
disturbed American market and also ta our
small wheat crop in the West. But our mining
industry, which made a new record of $450,000,000 in production value, amply compensated for the small wheat crop. Businesses
and trades having ta do with supplying of
equipment and materials in relation to mining
likewise benefited largely.
Building activity also showed a marked
improvement, due principally ta the Dominion
Housing Act and the Home Improvement
Plan. Under the Dominion Housing Act, for
the calendar year 1937, there were 2,150 loans
approved and 3,018 family units provided, the
total amount of approved loans being
$13,034,858. During the same period 32,946
loans were made under the Home Improvement Loans Guarantee Act, totalling $12,850,379. These loans, I may say, are being fairly
generally met at their maturity, and they are
no charge on the taxpayer. It is important ta
realize that private capital expenditures have
been three or four times 'the amount of the
loans which I have mentioned.
In 1937 our pay rolls reached the level of
those for 1929. There was an increase in all
main sources of revenue, and I believe that
but for the drought situation in the West our
national budget would have been balanced
this year. The training camps were closed.
My honourable friends will remember that
douibts were expressed as to the wisdom of
closing those camps; it was said they likely
would have ta be reopened when the temporary work which was being offared ta the
men was exhausted. Well, the camps have
not been reopened. Some forty thousand
men were put on farm and forestry work in
the Western Provinces, under the Farm Employment and Improvement Plan. In Manitoba 6,380 men were taken care of, in
Saskatchewan 26,808, and in Alberta 4,314,

SENATE
while in British Columbia 2,422 were absorbed
under a forestry plan.
I should like to quote from a report of
some figures given with regard to the unemployment situation in Canada by Mr. A. B.
Purvis, Chairman of the National Employment Commission. He presented an analysis
of the unemployment situation, as follows:
In September, 1936, he stated, there were
956,000 unemployed; in September, 1937, there
were 752,000. Of these 303,000 were distressed
agriculturists, not out of work, not in the
labour market, but waiting for an act of God
to provide crops once more. Another 292,000
were non-working dependants such as wives, and
children under 16 years of age.

Still another

42,000 had been declared unemployable, or
partially so. There remained a maximum of
115,000 really employable, on relief, 88,500
males and 26,500 females.
Mr. Purvis went on to say that no one
plan could successfully cope with those 115,000
actually employable, but out of work, many
of whom had never been gainfully employed,
and so what was needed now was individual
action. I think that is a very fair statement,
which it is interesting to analyse if we wish to
understand the present unemployment situation. An effort will have to be made, as Mr.
Purvis suggests, to have the case of every
unemployed person considered and dealt with
in the very commlunity where the individual
lives. It will be remembered that last session,
upon the recommendation of the National
Employment Commission, Parliament voted
$1,000,000 to carry on training and development projects for unemployed young people.
Under agreements the funds from this vote
allocated to all the provinces have provided
opportunities for approximately 30,000 young
men and women.
The four main categories of the projects
specified as coming within the scope of the
vote were: training projects of an occupational nature; learnership courses in industry;
work projects to combine training with conservation and development of natural resources; physical training programs to maintain health and morale. These projects were
open to all young people from eighteen to
twenty years of age without gainful employment and in necessitous circumstances. It
has been stipulated that wherever possible
existing facilities be used and the fullest
possible
co-operation obtained from local
organizations, both public and private. Advisory committees, representing employers,
labour, educational authorities, womens and
youth organizations, and so forth, have been
established in many localities.
The ceoperation of employers has been sought in
the training of apprentices and learners.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Courses of training in farming and agricultural subjects have been given in every
province through co-operation with the provincial Departments of Agriculture. In New
Brunswick, Ontario and Alberta provision has
been made for the placing of seven hundred
selected young men from urban centres as
farm apprentices with experienced farmers,
who have agreed to instruct the young men
in the various phases of farm work.
During the summer and autumn months
over thirteen hundred young men have been
trained in forestry work on Crown lands in
New Brunswick, Ontario, Manitoba and
British Columbia under the direction of
forest service officials. Similar projects for
winter training have been provided for some
four hundred young men in Prince Edward
Island, Quebec, Manitoba and Alberta.
Approximately six hundred young men are
participating in mine training projects in
Nova Scotia, Quebec, Ontario and British
Columbia.
In Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba there
are plans to assist in the training of apprentices and learners in industry. A canvass of
employers has been made, and whenever they
agree to take on young men and train them
in specific trades or occupations, they are
allowed a weekly sum to defray the cost of
instruction on the job. Most of the provinces have plans for occupational training of
urban young people in technical schools or
other centres.
Opportunities are also provided for young
women.
Schools
for trained household
workers have been established in some two
dozen cities in the nine provinces. In rural
districts courses of instruction are being given
in home economics, appropriate farm subjects, health, handicrafts, and so forth.
In British Columbia and Quebec there are
definite projects to provide physical education, recreation and group activities for both
young men and young women. In British
Columbia the plan is province-wide.
In
Quebec it is confined to the cities and carried
on in co-operation with various private
organizations.
It is estimated that about thirty thousand
will receive instruction under existing arrangements during the present fiscal year. Full
details as to the exact number who have
actually participated under the various projects in each province will in due course be
laid on the tables of .the two Houses of
Parliament.
With leave of the Senate, I will put on
Hansard what has been undertaken by each
of the provinces:

-and 1 say this with ail due modesty-to

September 4, 1919, when we were asked to

without being assured of the United States
becaming a member-nation of the League
which its representatives had praposed and

The Leag-ue is in many directions doing

My honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr.

fram Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert), bas referred ta the proposed revision of the Electians
Act. 1 have not yet had occasion ta read
the report made ýby the ýcammîttee af the
House of Commons, but I understand it did
flot entertain a certain proposai wbicb I had
no opportunity of discussing and supporting
before that committee. The query generally
is: "Haw cao we reduce the cost af elcctions?" 0f course, it is a matter whicb does
not specially concern this House. but fer tbe
bealth af the body politie evcry bonourable

this question. How can xve reduce the cost
af elections and purify the atmosphere araund
the ballot box? Before the matter engages
aur attention I intend ta peruse the repart
of the committee of the House of Commona,
and I shaîl he happy ta find there same
solution which will make elections lesa costly.
I say "leas costly" becauso an election is
always costly ta someibody, and the question
aiten arises as ta wha is that "somebody"
who contrihutea large suma for electian expenses.

The speech with which. His Excellecy opencd Parliament, and whicb we are now con-

FEBRUARY 2, 1938
sidering, naturally envisages Canadian, British
and, to some extent, world conditions. It is,
I think, shorter than usual. Nevertheless, it
very properly, in my opinion, gives five paragraphs to trade questions, mentioning what
the Government has already done to facilitate
a wider international exchange of commodities and what it hopes to accomplish in the
same direction. To my mind, nothing else
in the world could contribute so much to the
peace, progress and happiness of mankind as
free international trade; therefore it is with
extreme gratification I observe the great
English-speaking nations of the world coming
closer together on this most important subject. I hope I may live long enough to see
at least all the great free nations of the
world remove many of the impediments to
trade among themselves. I feel so keenly
interested in this question that I cannot refrain from expressing a few thoughts upon it.
To me it seems to be elementary to say
that in times of peace, at all events, all or
nearly all trade, both national and international, is carried on by individuals and corporate bodies, and that these persons or bodies
will not begin to trade with one another
unless they expect it to be to their mutual
advantage. And most certainly such trade
will not be continued unless it is to their
mutual advantage. Therefore it follows, as
the day follows night, that if traders living in different countries trade with one
another they are benefiting not only themselves but the countries to which they belong.
And from this it seems to me to follow that
governments should concern themselves with
removing as many obstacles to trade as possible, leaving their nationals who are business
men to work out the details to suit themselves. These nationals will certainly not
injure themselves; and if they do not hurt
themselves I cannot see how they can possibly hurt their respective countries.
Another thing I cannot understand. Others
may see the sense of it, but I cannot. With
one hand we construct railways, dig canals,
bridge rivers, build and subsidize ships, send
commercial agents abroad to promote international trade; and with the other we discourage such trade by fining or levying tolls
upon the men who engage in it, and at great
expense build customs houses and employ
armies of men to collect these fines or tolls.
According to my reading of history the first
tariffs and customs houses began in a queer
way. Long years ago, when the great rivers
were the principal arteries of commerce in
Europe, strong men, who wished to live by

23

preying on the industry of their neighbours,
built their castles or forts on the banks of the
Rhine, the Danube and other rivers, and
levied fines or tolls on all the commerce that
passed up and down these natural highways.
In time this lawlessness became a custom,
hence the name " customs houses." After a
while kings thought this would be a good
way to raise revenue, and they adopted it,
at the same time abolishing, or greatly curtailing, the activities of the freebooters. Later
still governing bodies took over this method
of raising revenue, excluding by law all others,
and while the system was still inherently bad,
this change removed some of its evils, because
the public got the money thus raised, or most
of it. However, keen-minded, covetous persons
never lost sight of the personal advantages
that might be obtained through the manipulation of tariffs; hence the continual pressure
and the skilfully devised arguments brought
to bear upon all governments to make the
rates as high as possible, and so, in practice,
give the manipulators and the smugglers
another chance.
One of the greatest fallacies which the tariff
people inculcate is that it is more advantageous
to export than to import. It would be easy,
I think, if time permitted, to prove that one
activity is the necessary complement of the
other; that, in fact, one cannot properly be
earried on without the other. Is this fact
not significant? In time of war, when nations
are trying to injure one another in every
possible way, they instinctively feel and know
that to blockade the frontiers of the enemy
and prevent imports will cripple hirm more
quickly and to a greater extent than will
the prevention of exports.
One other thought will terminate my views
on this phase of trade. In the long ages when
this planet was being prepared for the habitation and use of man, when the seasons and
the climates and the vast variety of productions were being arranged for, surely it must
have been in the mind of the Creator that
His children would freely exchange products
with one another to the immense advantage
of all; that this exchange would of itself be
the most important industry and the greatest
civilizing agency in which they would be
engaged. If there is anything in this thought,
man, because of his covetousness and lawlessness, has done much to thwart the will of
Providence and injure himself.
Changing somewhat, but not dropping this
line of thought, I proceed. The conquest of
the air, the discoveries and inventions of the
scientists, have so reduced the size of this
earth that no part of it is any longer remote
from any other part, and neither nations nor

24

SENATE

individuals can any longer live unto themselves alone. In a broad sense, but nevertheless in a very real sense, God made us one
race and one family, the members of which
must either live and work together or in large
measure perish together. The war which was
openly declared in 1914 is still going on, and
with greater intensity than ever. The Treaty
of Versailles provided only a breathing spell.
All the causes whic'h produced open hostilities
in 1914 are still at work. Anger, hatred,
ill-will, covetousness and greed abound on all
sides and among all classes. Every nation is
either engaged in actual war or preparing for
it on a tremendous scale, and in nearly all
realms of thought, temporal and spiritual,
there is the utmost confusion. Never within
our memory, and possibly not in the records
of history, was there a time when the sea of
life was so turbulent. There must be a cause
for this state of affairs, and surely it is
correct to say that before a remedy can be
found and applied the cause must be
discovered.
A Christian philosopher writes thus of man:
Man is miserably weak, even physically; he
is mortal, limited in all his powers, even those
of the reason; subject to all manner of suffering and apparently unable to help himself,
even where the path to a tolerable existence
lies clear.
But at the same time man is
gifted with a mind which can conceive the
universe; he is the child of God and in the
image of God; all beauty is at his command;
he can even in a sense create; he is vastly
greater than anything else there is within
our immediate experience, yet he is immeasurably less than what he knows he might
be. He is at once despicable and awful, petty
and supreme.
I suppose we are all agreed [hat the universe, of which this world is a part, did not
make and cannot sustain itself. Any person
who looks at the sky on a clear moonless night
will see multitudes of worlds far larger than
ours, and multitudes of suns far larger and
more luminous -than ours. Herschell is said
to have countcd twenty millions of such worlds
and suns in the Milky Way alone; and lately
I have read of the newest discovery of a sun,
called Super-Nova, three hundred million light
years distant fron this earth and five million
times larger and more luminous than our sun.
All these bodies are traveling through space at
an almost incredible rate of speed, yet the
order is such that scientists can tell us in
exactly what part of space they will be in
relation to one another one year from now,
ten years from now, a hundred years from
now. If we take our minds from the contemplation of immense bodies to small things,
we shall find that in a drop of water there
are great numbers of living creatures, all
obeying the law of their being.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES.

The Author of this creation and regulation
must be omniscient, omnipotent and eternal.
This Omniscience, this Omnipotence and this
Eternal we call God, and He has been pleased
to reveal te His creature, man, much concerning Himself which man of himaself would
never and could never know. Among other
things, God revealed that He created two
orders of beings, angels and men, to both of
which. for a cause worthy of Himself, He
gave free will. To Lucifer, one of the leading
angels, He gave a large part of the administration of this world. We know this because
of the work this fallen angel has been able
to do; and when Our Lord was on this earth
He called Lucifer "the prince of this world."
Lucifer and a large number of the angels, as
individuals, abused their free will, and through
the sin of pride disobeyed God. Their sin
of disobedience
was irremediable. When
Lucifer fell, the intelligence and power which
Cod had given him were not taken away from
him; and, being at enmity with God, he
wanted to oppose Him in every way possible.
He had the power to tempt, and did tempt
Adam and Eve to disobey God.
With the fall of our first parents fel the
whole human race-for it is a race. That
fall entailed terrible consequences. It was
net. however, irreparable, and it must have
been different from that of the angels, for
God Himself, in His pity for man, undertook
to repair the fault, man co-operating; and
the story of the reparation is the story of
Christianity. The second person of the Godhead clothed Himself with our humanity,
became one of our race, and thus by His
passion and death redeemed mankind. The
fruits of this redemption are obtainable by
all who believe in Him and ask for pardon.
Nevertheless, many of the sad and bitter consequences of the fall remain to be borne by
ourselves, and ainong these are sickness,
decrepitude and death.
When our Lord and Redeemer was visibly
present on this earth, Satan, though bis intelligence and power were in many respects far
greater than those of man, probably did not
know, or else doubted, that Jesus Christ was
God.
Therefore he decided to tempt this
wonderful being and miracle worker, as he
had successfully tempted many others from
Adam and Eve down. The Bible tells us
that he took our Saviour up into a high mountain, showed Him all the kingdoms of the
world, and their glory, and said: "All these
will I give you if you will follow and worship
me." This was no idle boast on Satans part.
Already he had tried, and since has tried,
that temptation on many men in all walks
of life and in every calling; and multitudes

FEBRUARY 2, 1938
fell and since have fallen, and received their
share of the guilty partnership in this life.
This temptation of our Saviour, if meditated
on as it should be, will give every person in
the world sufficient thought for a lifetime.
If properly understood it would enable us Vo
account for the state of the world that was
swallowed up by the Deluge; it would enable
us to account for the populous and flourishing chties which once existed and whose ruine
are now uncovered by the spade of the
archaeologist; it would enable us Vo. account
for the civilizations that are littie more than
memories; it would enable us to account for
the political-religiaus upheaval of the sixteenth century, and the anultitudinous consequences of that evenit; it would ena-ble us Vo
accouat for the eighteenth and the nineteenth
century surrender of Christianity to plutocracy, when Christians essayed to serve both
God and Mammon at the same time; and
finally, it -would enaible us to account for
the awful state of the world to-day.
I have said that when Lucifer fell he did
flot lose his intelligence and power; and man
would be in a bad way indeed if he had noV
a stronger power than Satan to ea-u on for
aid. As Adamn's f ail consisted mn disobeying
God and trying to make himself equal to
the Most High, we, Vo eounteract that disobedience as far as we can, must acknowledge
God's omnipotence and our dependence on
Him by asking Him for ail spiritual and
temporal necessities. If ChTistianity be true,
this is the essential duty of *man; but iV is
juat the d.uty that the great mxajority of men
and nations refuse to, perform. 1V follows,
then, that so far as this world is concerned
the kingdoa -of Satan is more extensive than
the kingdomn of Christ; and this gives us
the explanation of all, or nearly all, our
troubles and misfortunes.
And now as Vo the credibility of Christianity.
When our Lord, the founder of Christianity,
was on this earth, He said Vo those who
doubted Bim, "If you do noV believe me,
believe My works." Bis works were entirely
beyond the power of man, and were performed Vo prove His divinity. I know that
I arn safe in saying that the miracles of
Jesus would be accepted as proved by any
court of justice in the civilized world, capable
of hearing evidencie and weighing its value.
Moreover, it will, I think, 'be admitted even
by those who> deny or doubt Bis divinity,
that Jesus was the most honourable, upright
and truthful man that ever lived. And He
declared Himself Vo be God. Be said, "The
Father and I are one ;" and again, "AlI power
is given unto Me in heaven and on earth;"

25

and further, "I arn the Way, the Truth and
the Life." No merely hum!an lips could utter
such expressions as these. Therefore, if the
Bible is an inspired record of those events,
or is even authentic history, the position of
the Christian is impregnable.
Fu.rthermore, while Christ was on this
earth as man, Be gathered around Bim a
nunmber of ordinasy men whom He daily
instructed and finally formed into a body
corporate, or church, passing on Vo it the
commission Be had received from, the Father.
Be told it that He would Bimself be with
it ahl days, even Vo the consummation of the
world, and in addition would send the Boly
Ghost, the Spirit of Truth, Vo be its companion and guide it unto all truth while time
would endure. Again I say that if the Bible
is not a book of faibles these promises were
made 'by God, and are as enduring as God
Bimself-"-ýHeaven and earth, shail pass away
before My word shall pass away." Bence iV
inevitably follows that that Church must be
in the world and functioning to-day with al]
the powers which God committed to it, and
which are necessary for the proper performance of its work. God instructed that Church
Vo teach every huanan creature on earth, and
commanded ahl men Vo hear it. Hence it
follows that Be would not and could flot allow
it Vo apostatize and lead men astray. Be
would, if neceesary, use His omniscient power
Vo prevent such an occurrence. Individual
members led by Satan might faîl away,
might in fact do anything that bad men
coul 1 do,, but Jesus, because He was and is
God, would, under the circumstances, take
care of the corporate teaching body.
Some persons say that Christianity is and
has been a failure. Other persons say it has
neyer been tried. Both statements are at
best but part truths. When Christ was born
the Roman Empire, which then embraced
practically the inhabited world, though at
peace was sunk in abominable iniquities. Twothirds or three-fourths of the people were
slaves Vo the others. Possessing no rights of
their own, they had Vo subrnît Vo the injustices, the cruelties, and the vices of their
masters. In three or four hundred years a
tremendous change for the better took place.
It was brought about entirely by the Christian
Church, though she had Vo live for the most
part of that time in the bowels of the earth.
During that time she absorbed and took Vo
herself nearly everything that was meritorious
in Roman civilization. When in the fifth
and sixth centuries the empire was overthrown by the barbarians of the North, the
Church had Vo undertake their civilization

garb of righteousness. For instance, he frequen.tly enters homes and, under the pretence
of promoting do'mestic felicity, dissolves the
marriage tie. thus undermining the most important princîple of ahl human society. Again
he gets many Christians, even clergymen, to
work against the entrance of God into tlie
national schools, thus gathering many éhildren
and future generations into hie -net. It lias
been well said tha-t "lie goeth about like a
roaring lion seeking wh.om he may devour."
It is now generally admitted that the League
of Nations has been a failure. Bowever,
many say that if the United States had
adhered to it, as it should have done,' it would
have been a success. I doubt this, and shall
give my reasons for doubting. A temporary
success it might have been, but, if Christianity
is true, a permanent success it could not be.
Once again, I have to quote the words of our
Lord: "Without Me you can do nothing?"
Nobody even pretends that Christ was invited
to the conferences that establishcd the League
of Nations, or to the conferences that drew
up the Treaty of Versailles. And both the
League and the treaty are gone the way the
tower of Babel went. Should I be correct in
saying that God's rightful place in the affairs
of the world, or at lcast in the affairs of
Christendom, is not so much doubted or denied
as it is ignorcd? But is there any difference?
Until Christcndom, at least, learns to put first
things first, I do not think it will get anywliere. Now it seems to me, and I hope 1 arn
sensible on this point, that the first thing
Christendom has to do is to get itself united
in spirituals, at least. That would be putting
first things first. Some clergymen criticize
the League for not having done more than
it lias. But are they in a position to criticize
effectively while their own hbouse is in such
disorder? The world conferences and the other
great conferences of the churdlies to promnote
unity, which are hcld or talked about from
time to time, show the yearning of the human
heart for such a desirable end. They also
show that man bas noV entirely forgotten the
carnest and beseeching prayer of our Lord
and Saviour: "Father, I pray that tliey ahl
may be one, as Thou, Father, in Me, and I
in T.hee, that they also may be one in Us:
that the world may believe that Thou hast
sent Me." That gives us hope. Yet the
conferences accomplish very little, if anything.
Thcre must be a cause for this, and surely
it cannot be impossible for men of goodwill
to discover iA. As I see it, that cause is the

endless number of sects or confessions into
which Christianity has become divided, and
the large number of divisions within many of
the confessions, weakening and in some cases
nationalizing Christianity, and leaving it
unable to cope with great world or even
national *evils. What the future will be I
know flot, but I arn certain of this: that
Christianity will flot perish from the earth,
and that the Church which Christ founded,
with which He promised to remain tili the
end of time, and to which He said Be would
send the Boly Ghost to be its companion and
to guide it unto aIl truth, will flot be overOn one occasion our Saviour

SENATE

CANADA'S

RAILWAY PROBLEM

NOTICE OF MOTION

Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable members, yesterday I gave a notice of motion
to which exception was taken. The matter
was submitted to His Honour the -Speaker,
with the result that from a moral point of
view I have won a beautiful victory; but,
thanks to His Honour's ingratiating manner,
I have conceded absolutely everything I could
yield, and so my honourable colleague from
Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) also has won
a victory. I now give notice that at the
next meeting of the House I shall move:
That in the opinion of the Senate the Government should be urged to settle the railway
problem of Canada at an early date, in order
to stop the ruinons loss made each year by the
Dominion through the Canadian National Railways, and which already amounts to several
billion dollars.
EXTERNAL RELATIONS
CREATION OF STANDING COMMITTEE

Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN:
Honourable
senators, I give notice that at the next sitting
of the House I shall move:
That a new standing committee of this
honourable House be created, to be called the
Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, for
the purpose of dealing with matters of international concern; and that the rules of the
House be amended accordingly.
I think that, with the permission of the
House, I should add just a word of explanation. Canada, willy-nilly, is drawn into the
vortex of international affairs. We have in
the Senate valuable sources of information
concerning international affairs, but unfortunately these sources are denied to us because
many of the matters involved are of such a
nature that information with respect to them
cannot be given openly in the House. At
a meeting of the members of all the committees of the House this morning it was suggested, and I think the suggestion was accepted
almost if not quite unanimously, that it would
be advisable for the Senate to create a new
standing committee for the purpose of dealing
with international affairs, so that all the members of the House could get first-hand information with respect to such matters as they
concern Canada. I need not tell honourable
members that we have in our midst, in the
leader of this House, probably the best informed authority on all matters of that kind,
and I feel sure that if he were protected, So
to speak, by the secrecy which would be
obtained in such a committee he would be only
too glad to give information of great interest
to each and all of us. Besides, we have public
servants of the highest competence, like Dr.
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

Skelton, who could be called in; and perhaps
the Prime Minister himself, if he could find
the time, might greatly enlighten us on many
important international affairs.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
I know I am not quite in order in speaking
to a notice of motion, but, as it deals with
a subject to which I have given a great deal
of thought, I ask the House to bear with me
for a few minutes. I would say first that I
am entirely in accord with the proposal for this
committee; indeed I made a similar suggestion to this honourable House about two years
ago. In the interval I have enlarged my views
as to the matters that could be dealt with by
such a committee, owing to my acquaintance
with a number of issues on which our people
are seeking opportunity to make representations to Parliament. One such matter, for
instance, to which I referred earlier in the day,
is the International Migratory Birds Convention, which has been so disappointing to our
thousands of sportsmen throughout Canada.
In my own province, I believe, we get a
revenue of about $200,000 a year from sportsmen by way of licences. This year they had
one week's shooting. They are very desirous
of having some means of presenting their case
here, and I think it would be helpful to all
concerned, including the Government of the
day, that a way should be open to them.
Another matter that has been mentioned is
the preservation of our wild life, which could
come within the scope of this committee.
The suggestion I wish to leave to be considered when this matter comes up is that if
the proposed standing committee is established it should include internal, external and
all other affairs not within the jurisdiction of
existing committees. It may be said that
the practical method would be to appoint
two additional standing committees, but I
think that the one proposed would suffice for
all these matters. That is the only suggestion
I have to make, and I thank honourable
members for letting me make it at this time.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATEADJOURNMENT
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, I have been asked whether there
would be any bills from the Commons to
engage our attention at this time. I have
inquired of my colleagues and am advised
that nothing will be forthcoming for the next
three weeks, and I have no firm promise that
even then there will be important legislation
for us to consider. From an examination of
the matters to come before the Commons I
have concluded that we could well afford to
allow the members of this House who live

FEBRUARY 3,1938
at a distance, east or west, an opportunity of
returning home and attending to their affaire
whule the Commons are dealing with bills
before submitting them ta us. It may be
said that the Government might have insisted
on certain of its members relinquisbing to
this Bouse some of the measures emanating
fromn various departmnents, in order that the
Senate might be kept occupied during the
ncxt f ew weeks, but on examining those
measures the Government deemed it advisable
to have them initiated in the Bouse of
Commons. A couple of the proposed Bills
might have been introduced here, but as
similar measures had already been dealt witb
in this Chamber and had not been discussed.
in the other Bouse, I tbought it as well that
the Commons should have an opportunity of
expressing their opinion upon them.
With this statement, I move that wben the
Senate adjourns this afternoon it do stand
adjourned until Tuesday, March 1, at 8 o'clock
in the evening.
IRight Bon. ARTHUR METOHEN: Bon..
ourable members, there are two matters I
should like to mention in relation to thie
motion.
The first bas to do with the National Employment Commission. It may be that my
information is not up ta date, but I have
heard it is intended to conclude the work of
that commission immediately. I am informed
that the chairman has handed in hie resignation. I shall in a minute give the honourable
leader of the Government (Bon. Mr. Dandurand) an opportunity of saying whether the
chairman's resignation is to be taken as a
prelude ta the termination of the commission.
I am flot at ail objecting if such is the case,
much as I admire Mr. Purvis and believe
hie bas done the utmost that couid be
accomplisbed.
The next point bas to do with another
phase of the bonourable gentleman's remarks.
It appears the Goverument is not disposed to
initiate legisiation at the present time, in the
Senate anyway, and that this applies even
in respect of a class of legislation which
hitherto has had initial and very lengthy and
earnest consideration at our bande. I refer
at the moment to the smail-loans legielation.
I believe the intention is that soins general
bill shahl be introduced in tbe Commons this
session, shahl wade tbrough ite long course
there and then come to us. Everyone, of
course, knowe that tbe whoie subject, arising
as it did out of specifie individual bills, was
treated by the Banking and Commerce Comnmittee of the Senate session after session with
Witnessee were
the utmost thoroughness.
beard almost endlessly and, as we thougbt,

2

a very intelligent conclusion was arrived at
and submnitted to the Commons; but there,
at the hands of the Administration, it was
summarily cast aside, and nothing was done
about it. Now, we understand, it is intended
to introduce a general bill in the Commons.
We wish them weli. But what is the abject
in our dealing, in the meantime, with inidividual measures anent the samne question?
One was brought before us the day before
yesterday by the honourable senator from
London (Bon. Mr. Little). If the Commons
are taking up this subi ect in a comprehensive
way, trying to better the work we have done
in other years, why flot let them deai with
this individual measure too? Let thema take
the whole pie--crust, contents and ail. To my
mind we are going to work at cross purposes
if the Senate atteinpts to deal with the bill
of the bonourable senator from London while
the Commons have the general measure under
review.
Those two points occur to me and I ehould
like to hear from the honourable leader of the
Government on them.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am under the
impression that a bill similar to that which
is now proposed by the honourable senator
from London was deait with by the Senate
and sent to the House of Commons last
session.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
I confess that
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I was not consuited as to bringing such a bill
again before this Chamber. 1 feel, like the
right honourable gentleman, that perhape our
honourable colleague from London might retrace his steps and have the bill presented in
the House of Commons, there ta he deait
with either separately or with the generai bill.
It was felt that when our legielation reacbed
the Bouse of Commons last session the general
opinion of that Bouse had not been educated
to the point of passing an impartial judgment
on it. This legislation is of a speciai character.
Interest and other charges were objected to
as being oppressive and usurious. We grappled
with the probiemn and came to the conclusion
that some of the figures were justified. Now,
if the Department of Finance submaits a
general bill on the samne line it will perhaps
meet with the samne objection in the House
of Commons, in which event the committee
there wiIl have to make an investigation
similar to that which. we undertook lsst
session, and will have at ite disposai Mr.
Finlayson, who, I think, supported generally
the decision of the Senate in the matter.
That is why I believe a general measure
similar to the bill of last session, which was

30

SENATE

not then studied to the same extent in the
other House as in this, should be initiated
there.
As to whether the National Employment
Commission bas concluded its work, I cannot
give a definite answer to my right honourable
friend, but I was under the impression that
this was the case and that the commission
would be dissolved. We are about to adjou.
for a time. Wben we return to our duties
I shall be in a position to inform my right
honourable friend as to what will take place.
I cannot state what is the policy of the
Government in the matter.

Hon. Mr. DUFF: Explain.

Hon.

Mr.

DANDURAND:

Honourable

senators, this Bill does not emanate from
the Government, but I think it was given
unanimous support in the other House. Its object is to strengthen the application of the
Lord's Day Act by adding to section 14 of the
Act the following subsectIon:
(2) Any person, being a director, an officer,
a superintendent or an employee of a corporation, to whose direction or orders any employee
is by the terns or conditions of his employment bound to conform, who authorizes or
directs

any such last mentioned

employee

of

that corporation to carry on any part of the
business of the corporation iii violation of any

of the provisions of this Act, shall be liable,
on summary conviction before two justices of
the peace, to similar penalties as those to which
a corporation is liable under subsection one
of this section or, for a first offence, to imprisonment for a teri nîot exceeding three months
and not less than one month, with or without
bard labour, and for each subsequent offence,
to imprisonment for a terni not exceeding six
nmntlhs and not less than two montlis, with or
without liard labour.
Of course I do not desire to take charge
of the Bill. A member of the House of Commons who introduces a public bill should
arrange with a senator to take charge of it in
this Chamber so that it may be furthered
here. Apparently this has not been donc. I
doubt whether this Bill will meet with much
objection from any member of this House.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: May I suggest that the
Bill stand until we have a chance to look
into it? It is a very serious Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Perhaps the
honourable member would be satisfied if the
Bill fell, instead of standing. I should be.

cement industry. The honourable member
who sits beside the right honourable leader

that. It is a continuous process, and if the
machinery is allowed to cool it is a long time
before the process can be commenced again.

point of order.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I move the second

The bon. the SPEAKER: The honour>ble

out of ýorder. Someone might move to have
the Bill set down for second reading.

suggesting th.at the Bill stand.
Hon. Mr. MURD-OCK: I move that the

it means that we adopt the principle of the
Bill.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No.
bon. Mr. DUFF: I arn asking that this
Bill stand until we have an opportunity of

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It will stand
only if it he set down for second reading.
The motion is that the Bill 'be placed on the
Order Paper to be read a second time on
Thursday next. At that time the principle of
the Bill wil be discussed.
The motion was agreed to.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This Bill simply
provides for reappointment of auditors for
the Canadian National Railways, which must
be done every year. With leave of the Senate,
I move that the Bill be put down for second

much time, it seems to me.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I was expecting
to receive an important bill, but I am under
the impression that it has gone to a comnmittee of the other bouse. So I can give no
answer just now.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I wish to suggest that we put down second reading of the
Shipping Bill for to-morrow instead of Thursday. This is the first proposed amendment
to the Shipping Act, which was initiated and
reviewed in this House four years ago. I
think it is rather significant that an Act of
such complexity was in operation four years
hefore any amendment was found necessary.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: With consent of
the bouse we could rescind the motion which
was passed and have second reading taken up
to-morrow.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think that
would be well worth while. And I suggest

DEFICITS OF CANADIAN NATIONAL
RAILWAYS
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: Before the
motion to adjourn is put, I should like to
point out that according to an item in this
morning's Gazette the revenue deficit of the
Canadian National Railways for January was
$1,510,753.
The item says, in part:
The statement of operating revenues and
operating expenses of the Canadian National
Railways all-inclusive system for the month of
January issued here to-day shows operating
revenues were $13,321,632, as compared with
$14,043,352 in January, 1937. Operating expenses were $14,832,385, against $13,960,130
during the corresponding period of last year.
I am bringing this up now as a matter of
urgency. I am sorry that I shall not be here
to-morrow, for I have to attend a meeting of
the Canada Steamships in the morning.
Honourable members will notice that in
January of 1937 the operating revenue was in
excess of the expenses, the respective figures
being almost the reverse of those for January
last.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable senators, following the cue given by the honourable the senior senator from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. McMeans), I submit that this
discussion is out of order, and particularly
so since there is on the Order Paper a motion
to be made to-morrow with respect to the
whole railway situation.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Before the point
of order is discussed, I suppose I may say
a word. I hold in my hand a copy of La
Revue des Deux Mondes, a very serions
publication, which I see is in its 108th year.
It contains an article that deals with the
railway situation in France and discusses an
Act recently passed there. The writer is one
Louis Marlio, de l'Institut. So far only one
Canadian has ever been a member of l'Institut, the late Rodolphe Lemieux, who was
elected to succeed Cardinal Mercier. I find
that railway conditions in France are similar
to those in Canada: there is about an equal
division between private and public ownership.
The article is in French, and, as I know some
honourable members are not as proficient in
both languages as I am, I would suggest that
it be translated into English, if the House
will consent. It is long and would require
some time to translate, but the work would be
worth while because of the similarity between
many of the conditions dealt with and those
we have in Canada.
I bring this up as a matter of urgency; so
I cannot be stopped by a point of order. The
situation is certainly urgent, for we are losing
a million and a half dollars a month, accordHon. MNr.
DANDURAND.

ing to the statement in the Gazette. And this
loss is on operations alone.
I do not know how to go about having the
article translated, and I leave it to honourable members to say whether it can be donc.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I understand
that my honourable friend will not be here
to-morrow, when the honourable senator from
Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) will move
a motion with respect to our railway situation.
I can state with assurance that the debate on
this motion is not likely to close this week;
at all events, it will not close to-morrow. My
honourable friend will have plenty of time,
after he comes back, to give us a résumé of
the article-the meat of it-in support of any
argument that he desires to make.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Having in
mind the lamentable figures just recited by
the honourable senator from De Lanaudière
(Hon. Mr. Casgrain), I make this suggestion
to him. He should spend the time between
now and his return to the House in asking
forgiveness for not having voted as I urged
him to do two years ago.

CANADA'S RAILWAY PROBLEM
MOTION-DEBATE

ADJOURNED

Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN rnoved:
Be it resolved, that, in the opinion of the
Senate. the Government should bie urged to
settie the railway problem of Canada at an
early date in order to stop the ruinous loss
made each year by the Dominion, through the
Canadjan National Railways, and which already
arnounts to several billion dollars.
H1e said: Honourable members, I crave the
indulgence of the House while I attempt to
support my motion by a brief for the for.gotten *taxpayer of this country. Now that
ivo have reached the prornised ]and of pros-

perity, the taxpayer clarnours for relief. H1e
is entitled to sympathetic consideration.
Throughout the depression bie bas done his
duty bravely and without complaint, tbough
hie bas had to carry a heart-breaking and
-ever-increasing load.
Tirne and again it bas been affirrned thaLt
the public indebtedness of Canadat exceeds
.eight billion dollars. I confess that to me,
at ail events, a figure of that size, almost
astronomical, conveys but a vague impression,
:and it is only by breaking it down and applying
it to every member of the community that
I can get a fair idea, of wbat it means to
our population. By this process I corne to
the conclusion that every standard family of
five in the country is answerable for $3,500
of public debt. I rernember that Mr. Godbout, wbo was for rnany years Minister of
Agriculture and afterwards Prime Minister of
-Quebec, used to say that the average farmer
in that province was worth $8,000. That
included the value of bis farm, his impIe:ments and everything else that bie owned under
the sun. Now you see, honourable senators,
that against the possessions of such a farmer,
.at the bead of a family of five--often the
'farnily numbers as many as ten-there is a
liability for 33,500 of publie debt.
lon. Mr. HUGHES: Is that the federal
-debt or the total?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The total public
.debt.
The Government proclairns that under its
guidance we bave corne back to plentiful
years. There is no denying that the federal
revenue has reached an unprecedented figure.
It wilI exceed $525,000,000 for the year. But
this, of course, also means that federal taxation bas reached its highest peak*in Canada.
To the sumn that I have rnentioned mnust be
added the provincial tax, w-hich, according to
the Canada Year Book for 1936, is $175,000,ý000. Then there are the municipal taxes.
'The Citizens' Researchi Institute, in February,
1937, states tbat they aggregate $225,000,000.

33

Add these together and you get a total of
$925,000,000. So it bas corne to pass tbat
the average Canadian family of five bas to
provide for federal, provincial and municipal
governments no less tban $420 a year, before
setting aside anything for the necessities of lîfe.
It is difficult to conceive that in a dernocratie country, under governrnent by the
people for the people, the taxpayers should
be so abused. Why has this corne about?
The reason is that the taxpayer is nlot merely
tbe forgotten man, but the unknown man.
The masses think that taxes are paid by the
rich. Many people have accepted, almost with
glee. the slogan, "Soak the ricb." But, honourable senators, the taxpayer is not, and cannot
be, the ricb man alone; bie is the consumer,
rieh or poor, wberever bie may be. A glance
at the federal revenue and its sourcjes is
sufficient to dernonstrate this truth. The eustoms, excise and sales taxes and most of the
incorne tax, at least that portion provided by
corporations, are passed on from hand to
hand, in the course of business, until they
reach the consumer. This is also true of a
large portion of the incorne tax paid by individuals. Professional and business men pass
on their incorne tax, or as rnuch of it as they
can, like the rest of their expenses, to their

clients or customers. The incorne tax, in its
higher brackets, is steep to the point of
frightening capital away from the country, yct
it provides but a small proportion of the national revenue.
It is a pity tbat taxes are indirect and, therefore, invisible. Otberwise the people would
soon learn that what tbey take from the public
funds witb one band tbey mnust replace with
the other. So long as the tax collector, hidden
in every store or shop and in every nook
and corner where business is transacted, conti-lues stealtbîly and invisibly to snatcb incussant contributions frorn the public, so long
Fhiall we have excessive expenditure, and
finances in jeopardy.
Federal taxation is predicated on consumption; wbicb is a fair principle. The rich consume more and therefore pay more tban the
poor. Besides, the cost of adrninistering the
country is so beavy that it would crusb any
class or section and can be borne only if
apportioned on all -the people. So in raising
rny voice for the forgotten taxpayer I arn
conscious that I plead not for a class nor
for a section, still less for any one party

against another party, but for the whole
nation. I arn ternpted to say the forgotten
nation, since per capita the Canadian people
have the largest publie debt and the heaviest
taxes in the world.

lion. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

MARCH 2,1938
And this is but the first step, to be followed
by many others through the propagation, within the land, of the new philosophy of social
service.
Indeed, when we have provided
security to part of our urban population and
protected the source of their livelihood, by
what equitable argument and for what time
can we refuse the giving of similar assurance
to our rural population? This no doubt will
entail crop insurance, at a colossal additional
cost.
Besides the expenses that stare us in the
face, there are thers which, if not as apparent and immediate. are just as unavoidable.
As an example, may I refer to the promises
made during the recent election campaign in
the constituency of St. Henry, in Montreal,
when ministers virtually bound themselves
to fill the hole bored in the heart of Montreal
for the Canadian National terminals. This
would call for the expenditure of millions
for the decent burial of millions improvidently spent in the past. However, I do not
wish to bring political controversy into this
discussion. Both parties have been responsible for extravagance in the past. I need
only think of the Hudson Bay Railway to remind myself of that. All I want to do here
is to make clear to the House that, apart
from expenditures plainly discernible at present. there remains the wide-open field of
political exigency. This is the price we must
pay for democracy; the price for even-handed
justice and liberty for all, and the privilege
we enjoy of looking other nations in the
face, with heads up, as free men.
This prompts me to state what I trust
no one. at least in principle, will dispute.
Whatever else we may be forced to do, we
can and must practise the strictest possible
economy in the administration of public
affairs. I am aware that of the ordinary expenditure of the country less than twenty
per cent is susceptible of retrenchment, and
that only to a moderate degree. As.to our
extraordinary expenditure, the position is
totally different. We have still practically the
full-flow wastage of the Canadian National
Railways. Is it not time for the Government
at long last to do something in 'that respect?
This is the background against which I
have thought proper to set up the argument
I now submit on our railway problem, a
problem which the Senate thought it its duty
to consider thirteen years ago. It did so in
an atmosphere from which was banished every
motive other than the desire to serve the vital
interests qf the nation. As that problem has
with time grown singularly more ominous
and pressing, this honourable House will no
doubt be willing to consider it anew in the

5198--3i

35

same spirit, with the same competence, and
again with the sole desire to give help in a
moment of need. In what I shall say I want
it clearly understood that I have no wish nor
reason to blame the president, the board, the
officers or the personnel of the Canadian
National Railways. I hold them to be men
of high standing, competent, industrious and
loyal. The fault is not theirs. In my opinion
they are pitted against impossible conditions.
The railway debt of Canada has grown to
huge
proportions.
It
has passed
the
$3,000,000,000 mark and constitutes more than
half of our federal indebtedness. Let me
quote a paragraph from the Duff report on
the capital structure of the Canadian National
Railways:
At December 31, 1931, the long-termi
debt
of the Canadian National Railways due the
public (funded debt unmatured) amounted to
$1,276,457,207.
The money invested subsequently in loans to the Canadian National Railways to meet annual deficits, interest accrued
on these loans, and deficits on Eastern Lines,
together total $1,393,469,164. The total of these
two sums is $2,669,926,371.
To-day our continual contributions for loans
and deficits exceed $1,724,000,000.
Our $3,000,000,000 railway investment is
not only totally unproductive of interest; it
increases by an average of more than
$100,000,000 a year. This huge amount of
$3,000,000,000 must cost Canada at least two
and one-half per cent in yearly interest, which
totals $75,000,000, besides an annual deficit,
which last year amounted to $40,000,000.
Whcre will all this lead us to?
Let me direct the attention of the House to
the concluding paragraph of the Duff report:
We feel

compelled,

as a

matter of public

duty, to strike a serions note of warning to
the people of Canada. Unless the country is
prepared to adopt the plan we have proposed,
or some other equally effective nbcasures,
secure the efficient and economical working to
of
both railway systens and thereby not only
reduce the burden on the federal treasury but
improve the financial position of the privatelyowned railway, then the only courses that would
be left would be either to effect savings in
national expenditure in other directions, or to,
add still further te the burdens under which
the industries of the country are suffering by
the imposition of yet further taxation. Failing
the adoption of one or other of these courses
and there are obvious limits to their application, the very stability of the nation's finances
and the financial credit of the Canadian Pacifie
Railway will be threatened, with serions consequences to the people of Canada and to those
who have invested their savings in that railway.
Every year since this report was drafted
experience has added te the truth and gravity
of its warning, and public opinion is being
aroused more generally and more intensely
every day. At its annual convention, held on

SENATE

36

the 30th of October last, the Federation of
the Chambers of Commerce of the Province
of Quebec, grouping together no less than
forty boards of trade and chambers of

commerce, adopted the following resolution:
Whereas a Royal Commission on railway and
transportation in Canada, comprising men of
international reputation and outstanding merit,
submitted a report on September 13, 1932,
designed to rentedy the situation, admitted
by all to be of potent concern to Canada's
welfare;
Whereas said report was prepared after this
Commission had condiiuted a searching inquiry
from coast to coast, and after it ltad heard all
interested parties and public bodies who had
representations to imake;
Whereas five years have passed since then,
and no subsequent progress lias been achieved
towards a solution of this problem, which
weighs so heavily tbrouglt taxation on the

Wheras it is the urgent duty of the Government of Canada to find proper and effective
remedies in the circumnstances, either along the
lines suggested by the Royal Commission or in
some other way;
Be it resolved, that representation be made
to the Government of Canada urging the pressing necessity of adopting effective measures to
secure the most economical operation of Canada's railway systems, in order not only to
eliminate the deficits of the Canadian National
Railways, thereby reducing the drain on the
federal treasury, but also to improve the financial position of the privately-owned railway,

averagedi approximately $1,200,000 annually instead of the amount of $30,000,000 annually as
estimated;
And whereas it is in the vital interest of the
Canadian people that the Government of Canada
should explore all avenues which would lead
to a more substantial reduction or to complete

elimination of the present annual deficits on
the operation of the National Railway Systen;
Be it resolved that this annual meeting of
the Ontario Associated Boards of Trade and
Chambers of Commerce urges upon the Government of Canada the vital necd of further consideration of the proposals made to the Duff
Commission. and of a further examination of
all potentialities for effecting economies in the
operation of the National System whici would
reduce the present severe drain upon the taxpayers of the Dominion resulting from the said
eficits of the Canadian National

was to be preserved this problem had to be
settled without any further delay. The Government that followed took no other position.
Two years ago Hon. Mr. Howe, speaking in
the Railway Committee of the House of
Commons, said that it was unreasonable to
expect the Canadian nation to continue to pay
$50,000,000 every year for deficits of the
Canadian National Railways. Further, Hon.
Mr. Howe said that it was the duty of the
Government to lift this load off the backs
of the taxpayers of Canada.
Well, honourable members, what happened?
The Bennett Government endeavoured ta implement the conclusions of the Duff report.
It did not meet with a great deal of success,.
perhaps, but although it had not much time
at its disposal, it did make some retrenchment. What has the present Government
donc? I will not say that the Government
has thrown its responsibility upon the hands
of time. The Government trusted Providence,
trusted to the return of prosperity, and it
said that with the return of better times and
greater activity of business the difficulty would
disappear.
Well. honourable members, we
have just recently had the reports of the
various banks as delivered at their annual
meetings-one of the last being submitted by
the honourable the leader of this House-and
I think I can say without danger of being
contradicted that nearly all of them have
demonstrated that we have now reached the
shores of better times. I am going to give
you one of the typical testimonies in that respect. This is what Mr. Morris W. Wilson,
President of the Royal Bank, said on the
31st of January last:
During 1936 the rate of recovery in Canada
was phenomenal, and the high level attained in
that year was maintained in 1937. In spite
of the moderate recession at the end of the
year, induced by uncertainty of the business
outlook in the United States, the volume of
activity in most lines of business compares not
unfavourably with the record year 1929, and
in many lines, particularly mining, new high
records have been established. . .
The manufacturing industries of Canada
continued to operate at high levels during 1937,
and in October the volume of production
established a new record, exceeding even the
highest point attained in'1929.
However, Mr. Wilson says this in respect of
the Canadian National Railways:
Notwithstanding the materially better conditions that ruled during the major part of
1937, the railways received only slight benefits.
Increased gross revenues were largely absorbed
by increased operating expenses, and the year
will probably result in only a small reduction
in the heavy operating deficit of the National
Railways. This is distinctly discouraging and
only serves to emphasize the unwisdom of
expecting the situation to right itself through
increased traffie rather than through a more

37

intelligent handling of existing traffic by the
elimination of duplicating and overlapping and
uneconomic services.
The patience of the
Canadian taxpayer in this respect is almost
beyond understanding.
Well, honourable members, notwithstanding
the fact that we have had better times for
two years, where do we stand with respect to
the Canadian National Railways? We are
still mulcted every year to the extent of more
than $100,000,000: $40,000,000 for deficits and
at least $75,000,000 for lost interest on our rail.
way investment.
What has the Government done?
Here
again, I am tempted to criticize the Government; to say, perhaps, that it has adopted the
policy of Mr. Micawber, in "David Copperfield," who waited for something to turn up.
But I will not do that. In my opinion it
would be too grave an accusation to say that
the Government Las complacently allowed
Canada to bleed to the extent of $100,000,000
every year without doing anything to staunch
the Lemorrhage. That would be accusing the
Government of -heartless criminal negligence.
The truth, I think, is different. I think the
Government Las been searching for a remedy
without being able to find one.
I am
encouraged to think so by what Hon. Mr.
Howe said recently at Moncton. In receiving
a protest requesting immediate settlement of
the problem he said the pity was that no
useful suggestion had been made.
Well, honourable members, I am now going
to offer to the Government a suggestion
unanimously made by this House in 1925,
when conditions were not at all as grave as
they are to-day. It seems to me that if the
Government would listen to good advice it
surely would consider carefully the recommendation made by the Senate after the most
thorough investigation, perhaps, ever made
in this country; an investigation in which
the best minds of the country-the best railway experts and the best business men-were
called upon to contribute fully and freely behind closed doors. At the close of that investigation the Senate recommended joint
managership-something which did not disturb the property in either railway company,
and which left no ground for the contention
that it was impossible
to unscramble
scrambled eggs. The Senate was very wary
of that, and recommended only unification
of management. If I may, I shall refresh
your memories by reading the conclusion of
this honourable House, and I shall do so
with pride. Here is the project suggested by
the Senate:
That both the Canadian Pacifie Railway and
the Canadian National Railways should be
placed under the management of a Board of

transp.ortation, public utilities, government
and business. For years he has probed our
railway situation, and in January, 1935, he
published in the Financial Post a series of
remarkable articles which were an able and
exhaustive study of his subject-matter. He
concluded, in part, as follows:
But one has only to study the operating
results over a period of years to realize that
the policy of developing a strong government
railway system as a competitor of the Canadian Pacific has proved to be extremely costly
and uneconomie. Nor does there appear to be
any escape from the huge deficits of the Canadian National as long as it is operated as a
competitor of the Canadian Pacific.
The fact is that there is not enough traffic
on Canadian railways to support a competitive
railway structure.
This was true eleven years ago when the
Canadian National administration began to
build up the services and properties of the
system in order to strengthen its competitive
position. It is infinitely more truc to-day because in the meantime there have been capital
expenditures of over $800,000,000 on the two
properties, while the volume of traffic is far
below the level of 1923.
Tlerefore, if past standards of railway service are to be preserved, and if the burden of
cost on the taxpayer from the deficits of the
Canadian National is to be reduced, there must
be a cessation of competitive railway operation
in Canada. This is the most important lesson
that can be derived from the experience of
the past fifteen years.
In a book published subsequently, under the
title "Railway Nationalization in Canada,"
Professor Fournier writes as follows, at page

347:
As it becomes generally evident that adequate
savings cannot be achieved by co-operation, it
may be expected that the demand for a more
effective solution of the railway problem will
grow. In the writer's opinion, unified management of the two systems is a means whereby
annual economies of fifty million dollars or
more are possible. It is a logical solution of
the railway problem, because it is the only
proposal which offers the promise of adequate
economies and because it would provide a
sound basis for the future development of
railway transportation in Canada.
Mr. W. T. Jackman, Professor of Transportation at the University of Toronto, speaking in that city on ýthe 20th of January last,
said in respect of the cost of operating the
Canadian National Railways:
For every dollar paid for that railway's
service, there was an additional fifty cents
paid for its financial defaults.
Let us note the financial record of the Canadian National. At the time the roads included
in this system were taken over from their
private owners by the Government, in 1917-20,
the funded debt due to the publie was $810,000,000 and the amount on Dominion Government
account was $524,000,000, or a total of
$1,334,000,000; but by 1936 the funded debt

39

due te the public was $1,185,000,000 and the
Dominion Government account including deficit
contributions was $1,948,000,000, or a total of
over $3,132,000,000. This shows an increase of
liabilities to the end of 1936 of about
$1,800,000,000.
The net income deficit of this system before
taking account of interest on Dominion Government loan averaged, in 1932-36, $52,541,000 and
the unpaid interest on these Government loans
averaged about $36,000,000.
These are the
figures obtained from the railway's annual reports. From the same source we learn that
the total net loss for 1932-36 was $496,242,111,
or an average annual loss of over $99,000,000.
Professor Jackman is quoted as favouring
unification of management, in the following
terms:
Noting some of the objections to unified
management of the two railways, Professor
Jackman stressed that it did not mean amalgamation. " Amalgamation " means combined
ownership of two or more properties, while
unified management means the combined operation of these two systems, leaving the ownership as it is.
The stage had long been passed, the speaker
held, when it was considered that "competition
is the life of trade" so far as public utilities
were concerned. "Rather is it the death of
trade," he thought.
Stressing the advantages of unified management, Professor Jackman said it would eliminate
the expense of operating a large amount of
mileage which is unnecessary. The Duff Royal
Commission in 1932, he recalled, had reported
there iwere 4,000 miles of unnecessary lines.
Of course, lie commented, the existence of
this large amount of useless mileage means that
stations along the line, together with their
officers and attendants, the unprofitable train
operation, the expenditure for fuel, the depreciation of equipment, the expenses of road maintenance, etc., produce a vast waste which is
not offset by revenue.
No community would be deprived of reasonable transportation facilities and services, he
pointed out, but added that where two lines
of railway parallel eacli other for long distances
and are almost within a stone's throw of each
other, the operation of both lines is a "gross
extravagance."
Unified management would also eliminate
large amounts of duplicate overhead expense,
too, lie continued. There would be no need for
two terminals, "with their heavy expenses of
maintenance
and operation"
at Montreal,
Winnipeg, Vancouver and other cities, no need
for duplicate accounting and office staffs all
over the country, no need for two competing
groups of freight solicitors, for two separate
supervisory staffs, for two independent tariffissuing services with the great cost connected
therewith.
Instead
of duplicate
express,
telegraph and hotel services and advertising
expenses, these could be performed at least as
effectively and with great economy under one
management.
I could also quote to the same effect Mr.
Swanson, Professor of Economies in the University of Saskatchewan; but I shall refrain,
so as to condense my argument as much as
possible.

SENATE

40

How has publie opinion responded to the
policy propounded by the Senate and, in
1933, voiced by Sir Edward Beatty? Let me
quote editorials of newspapers in varions parts
of the country, which, I take it, were a fair
indication of public opinion. These commentaries appeared between the 16th and
19th of January, 1933.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

What year?

1933.
Oh,

1933?

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I have others very
much more recent, which I shall quote later.
The Toronto Telegram said:
As put by the President of the C.P.R., the
choice before Canada seems to be whether this
country wouldi best be served by two insolvent
railroads or by one solvent road. The natural
preference would be for two solvent systems,
since belief in competition and public ownership
is not dead. and since it is generally recognized
that the privately-owned road lias other claims
to this country's benevolne than as its
greatest taxpayer. But if overbuilding and
overoperating means present ruin to both if
separatcly oprated, how is the gap to be
bridged between tlhe present period of depression

and that

indefinite time in

the

future

when increased population
and increased
business will tax the capacity of every foot
of rail?
The Ottawa Citizen concluded a general
survey of the amalgamation proposals with
the following paragraphs:
Mr. Beatty's view that the railways should
he amalgamated into one system with one
management is obviously in accordance witi
the general inovement, as it is coming throughout the world, toward indiistrial reconstruction.
There wvill doubtless be muelh debate about
whîether one system should be under private or
puîblic ovnership,
control and operation.
Actually tiere is a far more vital issue to be
settled. Thie people of Canada need to decide
wlether they are to continue to have the
financial means to enjoy the benefit of an
essential railway service.
The nature of the management is important,
but it bas been demonstrated that Canada eau
have efficient railway management with national
ownership as well as with private ownership.

Wlie the people lad money, they enjoyed the
pris ilege of railway service under both plans.
At present they are apparently confronted with
the possibility of having neither, unless the
necessary steps toward financial reconstruction
are taken.
Now let us look at what was said by a
paper in British Columbia. In the Colonist,
of Victoria, appeared this statement:
The new Budget introduced in Parliament
a few days ago provides for some economies.
It may be doubted if they are sufficient to
avoid the necessity for furtber taxation. It is
well, however. to know that Mr. Bennett is
fully seized with the difficulties attendant on
any fresh taxation. He bas been speaking in
plain language on this matter, as well as on
the subject of the imperative necessity of finding
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

a solution for the railway problem. As far
as the latter is concerned what is done during
the present session will have an important
bearing on the future, for good or ill. The
present legislation is regarded in many quarters
as a mere palliative and not as a solution.
No palliative will substantially reduce the
$1,000,000 a week which the taxpayers have to
contribute to state ownership. On the other
hand unified control, as proposed by Mr. Beatty,
would mean the introduction of ail those
economies which are essential. Mr. Beatty's
plan is substantially the same as that which a
special committee of the Senate endorsed and
recommended after careful study in 1925. The
conditions in that year seemed to warrant
unified control. How much more so do they at
present after the experiences through which
the two transcontinental railway companies
have been passing. It is a significant thing that
of newspaper comment
the preponderance
throughout the Dominion is favourable to
unified control. The House of Commons in
considering the matter bas a responsibility to
do wliat is best for the country, irrespective of
party political considerations.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

What year was

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: 1933. A great number of newspapers at the same time, that is,
froin the 16th to the l9th of January, 1933. expressed their views much in the same strain,
all being very insistent on immediate action by
the Government. I will not weary the House
by quoting further from these newspapers. I
will simply give a list of them and call attention to the fact that they cover practically
every section of the country. This is the

As further indiHon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
cating public opinion, I have at hand editorials of the same nature published by Canadian newspapers in 1935, and again in the
latter part of 1937, and even within the last
few weeks. These articles appeared in the
last days of January or first days of
February, 1935, in the following papers: Ontario Grower, Hamilton, Ont.; Vancouver
Sun; Brantford Expositor; Calgary Herald;
Daily Colonist, Victoria, B.C.; Telegram, Saint
John, N.B.; Calgary Albertan; Sarnia Observer; Sherbrooke Record. The last series
was published in December, 1937, and January, 1938, in the following publications: Chilliwack Progress; Windsor Daily Star; Moose
Jaw Times-Herald; Scarboro Post; Regina
Chronicle-Telegraph;
Quebec
Leader-Post;
Brantford Expositor;
Toronto Telegram;
Chatham Daily News; Mercury, Guelph;
Montreal Daily Star; Financial Post; Trail
Times; Daily Sentinel-Review, Woodstock.
May I close my reference to the press by
a short extract from the Montreal Gazette
of the 5th of February last:
The central Government bas assumed and is
assuming very heavy obligations. What those
obligations will be after the Rowell Commission
bas reported, and its report bas been acted
upon, no one can foresee. What the Dominion's
income will bo in the next twelve or fourteen
months, even at the present terrific rate of
taxation, no one knows. Yet every year money
is being thrown away which could be saved,
and not in small amounts, but in millions.
Mr. C. L. Burton, President of the Robert
Simpson Company, addressing the Canadian
Industrial Transport League on Thursday night
in this city, declared that unless the solution
for the railway problem is found, enterprise
in the Dominion will languish and business and
services will be throttled through constant and
unnecessary increases in taxation. Mr. Burton,
who quoted at some length from the arguments
advanced by Professor Jackman, of Toronto,
in support of unification-as distinct from
amalgamation-offered his own opinion that
elimination of needless waste through duplication might easily lead to fuller employment,
and he suggested the retirement of senior men.
The tax burden he described as colossal and as
responsible for much of the existing civil and
political unrest, which undoubtedly it is. The
organization addressed by Mr. Burton adopted
a resolution urging that steps be taken for
study of the railway problem by a non-partisan
body, and that closer co-operation between the
two systems be promoted.

I quote now from MacLean's Magazine of
March 1, 1938:
In 1922 the British railways were in a
Throughout the country
chaotic condition.
there ran 20,000 miles of track, most of it
paralleled, and in some cases short-circuited,
by good highways, along which ran efficient
and growing road traffic. . .

To-day the position is completely changed.
The bewildering network of railway undertakings is replaced by four companies, which
work in harmony together and whose profits
rose last year to £23,000,000.
Redundant and duplicate posts have been
been
have
services
duplicate
abolished;
eliminated; rolling stock and appliances have
been standardized. . .
They were given time in which to arrive at
a harmonious agreement, after which a Government tribunal stepped in and took control
of the amalgamations.
The workers, of course, had their own difficulties, but were well provided for under the
Act. Primarily, it was recognized that reduction of staffs must be gradual and by reduction
of the compulsory retiring age to fifty-five.
The Act dealt thoroughly and comprehensively
with the question of compensation for displacement. It provided first of all that "every
existing officer and servant shall, as from the
date of amalgamation or absorption, become
an officer nr servant of the amalgamated
company."
It then laid down that, although an amalgamated company had the right to abolish any
office held unnecessary, no officer or servant
could be transferred without his own consent
to a position he held to be worse either in the
nature of work, salary, conditions, or pension
prospects.
Provision was made in such a case for reference to a special tribunal in which compensation
must be made if his case was proved.
Compensation was also to be paid to anyone
who suffered a reduction of salary or standing
"on the ground that his duties have been
diminished" or who otherwise suffered a financial loss by reason of the amalgamation. . . .
Large sums are being spent in improving
the standard of maintenance of certain absorbed
lines.
Despite these factors, the companies have been
enabled, while substantially maintaining their
revenues, to grant material concessions in rates
and charges of all descriptions.
Before the grouping, these rates and charges
were 112 per cent above pre-War level. They
are now only about 50 per cent above pre-War
level.
Sir Felix Pole, retired general manager of
the Great Western Railway, said three years
after the amalgamation: "I can say positively
that the grouping bas produced added economies
and efficiency, and has been of direct benefit
to the trader and shareholders. By producing
greater security of tenure and increased prospects of advancement, it has also been directly
to the advantage of the employees."
There are many more editorials to the same
purpose, but they have escaped me. Those
referred to, however, clearly indicate the
trend of public opinion.
I think I am justified in submitting anew
to the Government the resolution of the

42

two railways and selected as trustees of the
nation at large, permit such an outrage? How
could the Railway Commission tolerate it?
How could Parliament permit communities
to be marooned in the midst of the nation?
This objection is preposterous.
Another objection, honourable gentlemen,
is one that you can deal with better than I
can myself: it is that Parliament should
hesitate before taking any irretrievable step.
Parliament can always undo what it has done,
but the pity is that we cannot always undo
the consequences of leaving a task undone.
Finally, some people are still wedded to
public ownership administration for our
railways. They object that we are going to
abandon the principle of state ownership in
the administration of our railways. How are
the Canadian National Railways operated
to-day? They are operated by a board named
by the Government. How would the combined
railways be administered under one management? There would be fifteen men, five of
whom would hold the balance of power in
every matter of importance. These five
trustees of the nation would be named partly
by the Government and partly by the Canadian Pacifie. So, as far as that is concerned,
public ownership would have a great deal to
say, and undoubtedly any man who was objectionable would be eliminated. That would
be the whole difference. Is it worth a loss of
$100,000,000 a year to maintain the present
system?
I have been requested to produce evidence
of the savings claimed for joint managership. I am, of course, not qualified to furnish
a detailed list of retrenchments on hundreds

of items totalling some $56,000,000 to $75,000,000, but I can estimate the savings on one or
two major items. Joint managership would

do away with from 4,000 to 5,000 miles of
railway. The upkeep of railway lines costs
yearly, on the average, from $2,000 to $3,000
a mile. If we take the minimum of 4,000
miles of abandoned lines and multiply by
the minimum yearly upkeep of $2,000 a mile,

we shall find that we can effect a saving of
$8,000,000 a year. Furthermore, joint managership would dispense with the services of 26,000
railway employees whose average salary is
$1,700 a year. That would bring about a
saving of $44,000,000.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: These men
would have to be looked after, would they not?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Just a second. If
my honourable friend will permit me, I think
he will find me fair. By adding the two totals
together we get a figure of $52,000,000.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Would my honourable friend also check up on -the salary of

$1,700 a year?

I wish that were the average.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I am not in the
railway business by any means, but I have
endeavoured to get my information from a
good, honest source. Perhaps my honourable

friend will bear with me. I admit that on the
first item, the upkeep of the railway, not all
the saving could be realized; and that on the
second item the total economy on labour would
be attained only after three or four years. But
this does not touch the wide field of suppressible duplication in railway stations and
ticket offices, passenger and freight services,

express and accounting departments, ani practically every other branch of the railways.
I wish to call attention to the very excellent pronouncement made by Mr. J. J. Gibbons, President of the Board of Trade of
Toronto, at the

annual convention

of the

Canadian Chamber of Commerce at Vancouver on the 9th of September, 1937, which
strongly recommends the unifying of administration, and answers much more effectively
than I have done the possible objections to
the adoption of such a proposal. What answer
has been made to the Senate recommendation for joint managership? None but vague
and malicious assertions; for example, that
there is afoot a conspiracy against the Canadian National Railways. Think of the conspiracy that would gather together such elements as the Senate, our best railway experts,
professors of economics, boards of trade and
chambers of commerce and the overwhelming majority of newspapers in the countrynewspapers which, I believe, clearly reflect
public opinion. Such a conspiracy could be
nothing but the manifestation of the will of
the people throughout the country.
The plain truth is that the hand of the
Government is stayed by political apprehension. It fears the political reaction of the
West. But the West needs assistance and
must help us to find it. The Government,
with its ear to the ground, must know that
the weight of public opinion is against any
May I now, therefurther procrastination.
fore, strongly urge the Government te adopt
the suggestion made by this honourable
House? If, perchance, it fears to follow too
closely in the footsteps of the Senate, let
it at least adopt the same process and call
into consultation the best authorities in the
land. By so doing it will undoubtedly reach
the best practical conclusion, a conclusion
which, unless I am much mistaken, will approximate that of the Senate.

44

SENATE

The resolution submitted by me to the
flouse only requests the Government to address itself without further delay to the
nation's No. 1 problem-a most pressing and
most dangerous problem in that it feeds and
grows on time.
I recall the clever jibe made by the Right
Hon. Arthur Balfour at public life. He said
that in polities it was casier to repeat a
stupid thing often than to do a wise thing
once. I surmise that the Government is very
sensitive to the currents of public opinion. I
think I have shown how these currents are
running now. He who wishes to ride must
stay in the saddle; but he who from fear
drops the reins and grips the saddle is bound
to come a cropper. Has the hour net struck
when political expediency should give way
to national necessity and the highest order of
patriotie duty?
For years financial experts have repeated
again and again that the credit of Canada was
gravely affected by unemployment, by the
parlous condition of soue of the provinces,
and by the constant enormous deficits of the
Canadian National Railways. The Government bas addressed itself to the unemployment problem.
Mr. Purvis, in a masterly
way, lias analysed and classified it. Now we
know clearly how to attack it. The Rowell
Commission is now investigating the provinces,
and I am confident that the Chairman of
that Commission and his colleiagues will meet
our highest expectations, which are based on
their ability and standing. But as for the
railway problem nothing lias been donc. The
nation is pouring out its life-blood at the
rate of two millions of money a week. and the
Government, se far. bas donc nothing!
The nation, with its ever-increasing burden,
is growing more and more weary, and, unhappily, ifs credit on money markets of the
world is weakening. The partial failure of
our recent con ersion loan in London is a
warning that should net be disregarded. Canada must bo strong and magnetic enougb to
retain the faith of ber own people, and to
draw to ber shores the men and the money
required to build her up to the full stature
of ber marvelous destiny.
The present situation reminds me of the
frightful fate of two foreigners joyfully rowing
down the Niagara river, unaware of the approaching danger of the falls. On both shores
individuals, then small groups and finally
crowds, shout to them that there is danger
ahead. They laugh and jeer, and pay no
attention: they are happy, and the sun is
shining brightly. Suddenly, when they are
close to the brink, they see disaster before
them and bend desperately to the oars in an
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

effort to save themselves; but it is too late,
and, as the crowds on both sides of the river
cover their faces in horror, the men are swept
over the falls.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:

Are they dead?

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
I am net going
to answer my honorable friend's question,
but I will offer him a simile. For years
warnings have come to the Governnent, now
from the Senate, now from men of high standing on both sides of politics, then froin the
press and from the great mass of the people.
These warnings have gone unheeded, but if
we continue the course followed in the past
inflation is inevitable, and the result will be
nost disastrous. Will the Government not
strive for safety whilst there is yet time?
Conditions are uncertain: the present recession may lcad to a further depression; war
may break out at any time. While we are
on an even keel let us clear the decks. If the
hurricane breaks we may be too late.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I am sure we
have listened to the honourable gentleman
from Montarville with great interes.
I am
sure also the honourable gentleman desires
that the Senate express an opinion, or that a
numiber of senators give the country the
benefit of tlcir views on the very important
problemi
before us. The Government will be
most inferested in having the opinions of the
members of tis House, many of whom have
had considerable experience in mafaters connected with the administration of railways,
before it asks its representative in this House
to reply on its behalf. The Government, of
course, has some views to propound. These
views will be propounded in due time, though
I may make the reservation, perhaps, that
they may be somewha t influenced by the
weight of the argumoents that come from tbe
members of this Chamber.
Riglht Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable gentleman assumes, of course, that this
House would not be at all influenced by the
views of the Government.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
If no other
member of this House desires to follow my
honourable friend, I will move the adjournment of the debate until Tuesday next.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am quite
agreeable to Tuesday, but I always like to
get our work donc as exipeditiously as possible. We are to be here this week and I
would suggest to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
If my right
honourable friend wishes to express his opinions
to-morrow, I shall gladly give him precedence.

MARCH 2,19384,
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: My opinions
are pretty well on record, and I arn now
eagerly awaiting expression of the Governrnent's opinion. It is usual for the Government leader t-o speak early on a motion such
as this.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My rigbt honourable friend bas reference to a venerable
tradition of another place, one that was followed while be was a member there and is
stil] followed. But our custorn bas been to
the contrary. When a motion is made calling
for an expression of views by the Senate,
the stand of the Government is expressed at
the close of the debate-the Government
being wiser then, perhaps, than when the
discussion began. I know that my right
honourable friend bas stated in no uncertain
terms bis opinion on the Senate's action ini
1925. I bave an impression that I alluded
to it in this Chamber that year, and I shaîl
look up the debates to make sure. But one
always bas the rigbt ta express one's views
and to change them in the ligbt of experience.
I suggested that the debate be adjourned
until Tuesday next because I feel that the
speech of my bonourable friend from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien), wbich covered
considerable ground, ought to be dealt witb
by me in a manner wbich, at least as to
form, would satisfy this House.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: AhI right.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But if my right
honourable friend desires to speak to-morrow,
I shaîl move adjourn.ment of the debate until
then.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: My honourable friend knows that I arn neyer eager to
speak at any time.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Neither arn I.
Then shahl we make it Tuesday?
On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
debate was adjourned until Tuesday next.

He said: Honourable senators, this Bill

MARCH 3, 1938
to public attention. I do wish, however, in
fairness to the Senate, to say that at least
three times since I have been here the question of a monument to Sir Charles Tupper
has been raised in this House. In 1931, when
the Committee on Public Buildings and
Grounds was reporting, the honourable member from Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner) and
other honourable members spoke of the necessity or advisabili-ty of statues to the memory
of some of those who had not already been
commemorated on this Hill. The honourable
member from Pictou said he bad noticed that
there were statues on the Hill to Sir George
Etienne Cartier, Sir John A. Macdonald and
Queen Victoria.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: D'Arcy McGee.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: He intimated that he
could net quite understand why the Queen
was placed third in the list. Then he went
on to mention D'Arcy McGee, George E.
Brown, Sir Wilfrid Laurier and one or two
others.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Baldwin and Lafontaine.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: He then called attention to the fact that no statue ihad been
erected on Parliament Hill te Sir Charles
Tupper, Sir Leonard Tilley and Joseph Howe.
On that occasion I, too, made some remarks,
but I will net take up the time of the House
by repeating them now. I simply want to
point out that the question was raised then.
In 1932 the honourable senator from Rockcliffe (Hon. Cairine Wilson), Chairman of
the Committee on Publie Buildings and
Grounds, being unable to attend a sitting
of the House when one of that committee's
reports was to be presented, asked me to
make the report on ber behalf. In doing
so I spoke, in part, as follows:
Among other matters that came before the
committee was one .brought up in the House
a year or two ago-and no doubt on other
occasions also--namely, the desirability of
erecting a statue to Sir Charles Tupper, one
of the Fathers of Confederation. It is my
opinion that you cannot mention the three
strongest characters who took an active part
in Confederation without including the name
of Sir Charles Tupper. Even down to recent
times he has been a prominent figure in the
life of Canada.
I will net read more than that now. At
that time I drew attention in particular to
the absence of a statue to Sir Charles Tupper
and pointed out that he was one of the most
prominent figures in the whole picture of
Confederation. He was longer in the public
life of Canada than any other man has
been, up to the present time. A member of

47

successive governments, he reached the high
office of Prime Minister of Canada. It seems
to me that because of his long and eminent
service to the Dominion he has a stronger
claim than perhaps any other public figure
from the Maritime Provinces to the honour
of a statue on Parliament Hill.
In the same discussion I also mentioned
Joseph Howe, as did others. He was probably one of the greatest orators that Canada
has produced; undoubtedly the most eloquent
public man who has come from the Maritime
Provinces. His reputation for possessing a
silver tongue and wonderful brain was widespread not only in this country, but also in
the United States and Great Britain. Canada
would do well to commemorate Joseph Howe
by the erection of a statue on Parliament
Hill. Of course, it may be said that, after all,
he was a Maritime rather than a Dominion
figure. Nevertheless, be was a great Canadian, a man whose name is worthy of being
perpetuated by a statue here.
I think that a statue should be erected to
another great figure of Confederation days,
Sir Leonard Tilley. It would seem to be but
right that the lives and services of these three
men should be commemorated on our grounds
here.
In speaking on this matter in 1932 I said
that the last previous statue erected on Parliament Hill had cost $18,000, but it was felt
that, because of lower costs prevailing aL that
time, a considerably smaller sum would be
sufficient. An estimate then given to me was

around $10,000.

I do not believe a statue

could be erected for that amount: it seems
to me the cost would be probably $18,000.
But after listening to the array of figures
presented to us yesterday, when the raiiway
deficits were being discussed, it seems to me
it would be paltry to consider so small a sua
as an obstacle to the erection of a statue
to Sir Charles Tupper.
I want to make it clear that the request
for a statue to Sir Charles Tupper was
originated in this House, and not by anyone
outside it. The absence of a statue to that
great statesman has been deplored here on
three occasions, and strong recommendations
to remedy the lack were made to the then
leader of the House, the same honourable
gentleman who leads the House at this time.
He said that he would be pleased to bring the
matter to the attention of the Government.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: I am under
the impression that already this session, in
the House of Commons, the attention of the
Government bas been drawn to the desirability of recognizing Sir Charles Tupper's
services on behalf of Confederation by erect-

SENATE
ing a statue to bis memory on the Hill. Unfortunately I have not had time to look up
the answer of the Government, but I am
pretty certain it would be sympathetic. At
all events, I will draw the attention of my
colleagues to the suggestion that for the third
time bas come from my honourable friend
opposite (Hon. Mr. Black).
Hon. Mr. BLACK:

Thank you.

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I desire to add a word on
the subject. Usually I am not very impatient of delay in erecting monuments, but
I think the country is justly charged with
neglect in the case of Sir Charles Tupper.
There were, in broad outline, three parties
to Confederation: the province of Ontario,
the province of Quebec, and the Maritime
Provinces. Those who conducted the long
struggle and helped to bring about its consummation on behalf of the two central provinces have for many years been commemorated by statues-Sir George Etienne Cartier
as the chief figure from the province of
Quebec, Sir John Macdonald and the Hon.
George Brown as leaders from the province
of Ontario; but as yet there bas been no
recognition in the same way of any statesmen
from the third party to Confederation, the
Maritimes.
Of those who took a prominent part on
behalf of the Atlantic provinces, I do not
think it would be claimed for any of the
others that their services equalled those of
Sir Charles Tupper. Not only was he most
prominent and most aggressive in the battle
for the confederacy, but subsequently he took
the largest part in the political history of
the confederated Dominion. We lose something by too great delay in commemorating
his services. Even yet there are personal
friends of his who feel deeply grieved that
this recognition bas been so long delayed. I
know a very prominent man in the city of
Halifax-his sons are in the far West-whose
dearest ambition is to see this monument
before ho dies, or at all events to see the
claim to a monument recognized and a commencement definitely made for its erection.
I sincerely urge the Government to consider
the subject now, and I am sure that if it
does so it will not feel we are justified as a
country in ungratefully neglecting this matter
much longer.
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: Honourable
members, I think Peter Mitchell, of New
Brunswick, deserves a share of recognition.
In Nova Scotia the people were in favour
of
Confederation.
Even Joseph
Howe
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

favoured it, and became a Cabinet Minister
in the first administration of Sir John Macdonald. But the people of New Brunswick
were hostile to the proposal-I suppose,
mainly because they were trading so much
with the United States-and turned it down.
Yet Peter Mitchell fought and won a general
election on the issue and brought bis province into Confederation.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I may be pardoned,
honourable members, for making one further
remark. While it is true Peter Mitchell did
take a prominent part in the Maritime Provinces on behalf of Confederation, still Sir
Leonard Tilley was the outstanding figure
so far as New Brunswick was concerned, and
it was he who actually brought New Brunswick into Confederation. I could relate some
rather interesting and romantic history in
that connection, but I will not take up the
time of the House.

Hon. R. F. GREEN moved the second

Copyright Amendment Act, 1931.
He said: Honourable members, I am not
going to discuss this Bill. I ask that it
receive second reading and be referred to a
committee. The Bill passed the other House
unanimously, and I think its provisions are
very well known te members of this House.
It corrects some matters in connection with
the Copyright Act, limits the powers of the
Canadian Performing Rights Association, and
requires them to publish a list of all music
in which they claim copyright.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN:
I
understand the Bill is te be referred to the
Banking and Commerce Committee, and with
that reference I am in thorough agreement,
but perhaps at this point it would be well to
direct attention to one or two things. The
Bill provides by the first section that any
applicant for a licence shall be furnished with
a list of all the musical works, and so on,
owned or controlled by the party who grants
the licence. I notice in the course of the
debate which took place elsewhere it is stated
that the list, if inclusive of all claims of this
association, would be larger than the telephone
directory of Montreal. Now, what is the value
of such a list unless it is indexed and the
principle of the indexing is clearly defined?
I do not think the section is of the faintest
value unless there is an addition to that
effect. As this would require some drafting
in advance, it seems to me well to mention
it now. I am not objecting at all to the Bill,

MARCH 3, 1938
and I hope to give it earnest attention in
cornmittee, but a good deal of mechanistic
work should be done before. it is passed.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO OOMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. GREEN moved that the Bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think it quite
proper that this Bill should go to the Banking
and Commeice Committee, for, if I remember
correctly, it was the session before lutHon. Mr. BLACK: Two years age.
Ho>n. Mr. DANDURAND: During that
session we had many sittings of the Banking
and Commerce Committee, and I recall one
which lasted until past midnight, and during
which we discussed many questions that are
involved in the present Bill.
The motion was agreed to.
LORD'S DAY BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. JAMES MURDOCK moved the
second reading of Bill 13, an Act to amend
the Lord's Day Act.
He said: Honourable senaters, when this
Bill camne hefore us hast Tuesday it was
evident that no one had been requested to
sponsor it in this House, and somne honourable
gentlemen apparently wanted to dispose of the
T-hat was why I
measure immediatehy.
undertook to move that it be placed on the
Order Paper te be read a second time to-day.
I have examined the Bill in the meantime,
and 1 find what appear to me to be mistakes.
The proposed amendment would in my
.iudgment-and I arn not a hawyer-make the
Act much less drastic than it is, and would
afford epportunity for its violation. For
example, the word "permits"'' is by this
proposed amendment stricken out of section
14. It was se stricken out-if I may
be permitted to say so-on the representations
of two distinguished gentlemen in another
place, one of whom 1 have since tahked with.
He said te me, "Yes, that was a mistake, and
the Bill shouhd go to a committee te be
straightened eut."
When we discussed this Bill last Tuesday
a question was raised as te its constituting
further encroachments upon the liberties of
Canadian citizens in the handling of necessary
work on Sundays. Section il of the Act
contains twenty-four exceptions, which of
course are not touched by this Bill. Those
twenty-four exceptions cover almost every-

49

thing. However, from my study of the Act
I find that hast Sunday I unwittingly viohated
one of its provisions when I drove my automobile up the Gatineau te, watch the skiers,
for there is no exception which wouhd permit
me to do that. Neither is there any exception
which would permit a trucking companry to
transport a truck-load of goods from Toronto
to Ottawa, or from. Ottawa te Montreal. I
think some changes might be made in the
statute in view of the fact that conditions
have changed materialhy since its enactment.
Se far as this proposed amendment is concerned, in my opinion it is entirely wrong
to suggest that
Any person, being a director, an officer, a
superintendent or an employee of a corporation,
to whose direction or orders any employee is
by the terms or conditions of his employment
bound to conform, who authorizes or directs
any such hast mentioned employee of that corporation to carry on any part of the business~
shahl be hiable te certain penalties. The Bill
says "authorizes or directs." There is no question at alI of permission. The word "permit"
is struck out. I can imagine many cases in
which it would be unfair to hold responsible
a director of a Canadian companry who hives
in the West Indies, the United States, England
or some other place far removed from the
scene of the company's operations. I think
it is absurd te say that he shaîl be hiable to
imprisonment for three or six months, as the
case may be.
But surely we can adopt t.he principhle of
the Bill, which is that there shahl be a
reasonable and proper observance of the
Lord's Day. I hope the Senate will give the
Bill second reading and ahlow it to go to
the Committee on Banking and Commerce.
In committee it can be thoroughly discussed,
and if it is not thought desirable that it
shouhd proceed further it can be stopped.
Another reason why I think the Bill shouhd
be dealt with in that way is that the complete
report of the discussion on the second and
third readings of the Bill in another place
occupies only two pages of printing. It commences at page 912 and ends at page 914
of Hansard of the Huse of Commens. To
my mind this indicates insufficient consideratien of an important matter.
Hon. E. D. SMITH: Honourable senators,
I quite agree with what has been said by the
hast speaker regarding the consideration given
te this Bill in another place. As he has said,
the discussion on the second reading, the
committee stage, the third reading and the
reporting of the Bill eccupies only five columns
of Hansard. Furthermore, in the whehe of
that discussion there was net one word said
about the principhe of the Bill.

The Sonate xx'rked oe thc
Bill fer tw'e or tbrco days, aed flnally passed

MARCH 3,1938
it, I remember, at three o'clock in the morning.
Because every province had its own Lord's
Day Act, this House insisted upon the
necessity of obtaining beforehand the signature
of the Attorney-General of the province in
which action was to be taken. Inasmuhi as
the legislation was intended to cope with
large corporations which insisted upon Sunday
labour, and whicl employed hundreds of men,
it was felt that the Attorneys-General of the
provinces should be asked to further it.
Well, the law was passed. One difficulty of
which I have often heard is that some of the
large mill-owners or corporations feel that
they must press on their work, and therefore
insist upon operations being continued on
Sunday. Just as I entered this Chamber I
was told by a member of this House in whose
constituency there are many such institutions
that some of those corporations are regularly
being prosecuted for operating on Sunday,
but that they simply pay the penalty imposed
and continue their operations. I understand
this Bill increases the penalty for the purpose
of strengthening the law. I think the Senate
might give the Bill second reading and send
it to committee so that we may hear the
testimony of those who think there is good
reason for strengthening the sanctions already
in the Act.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, when this Bill was mentioned
yesterday, or the day before, I heard for the
first time that directors were to be included
among those to be punished in the event of
Our
violation of the Lord's Day Act.
Companies Act already imposes upon directors
penalties that are out of all reason and sanity.
In the case of a director who acts fraudulently,
or who acts as between himself and his
company under the stimulus of selfishness,
there is very little in the way of punishment
that can be too severe; but on directors who
are acting in good faith and with a view to
their company's good, and that alone, our law
already imposes penalties which are not in
the nature of fines, but almost take the
haggard form of ruin. This is true to such an
extent that shrewd men, really careful men,
will not consent to become members of
boards. Therefore when I found the present
measure contained this further penalty I was
opposed to it. My opposition in that respect
was largely removed when I had carefully read
the Bill. I saw that it would not make a
director liable merely because of being a
director; that lie could be liable only if lie
was a company officer or employee who gave
an order to another employee. Therefore not
much objection can be taken, provided that
the present law in this regard is good.
51958-44

I think the honourable senator who moved
the motion (Hon. Mr. Murdock) is right in
what he says as to the word "permit." If it
was proper to have that word included in the
former law, there is no reason why it should
not be included now. I understand it was
stricken out in the other House. The argument showed apprehension that a director
might be held to have permitted a violation
without learning of it. But that is all circumscribed by the proviso to which I have
referred, for a director could not become
liable without knowing of the violation.
But I am impressed by the words of the
honourable senator to my left (lon. E. D.
Smith). I do not think he has been answered
at all by the honourable leader of the House.
The point is that it is the corporation which
should suffer for an offence. It may be that
the present Act does not impose sufficient
punishment upon a corporation for breaking
the law. We are told that corporations get
off by paying moderate fines; that they consider it better to pay such fines than comply
with the law, and therefore they persist in
breaking it. Tiat can be cured, by an increased
fine. There is nothing a corporation fears
except the loss of money, and it would be a
simple matter to make the penalty heavy
enough to prevent indifference to the law. The
honourable senator to my left points out that
under this Bill an employee would be punishable for an offence committed by the corporation itself. That employee may be a
sub-foreman or occupy some minor position.
I do not think the law can go farther than to
pursue. through the corporation, the general
manager. I doubt if it could go even so
far, because a general manager is, after all,
merely an employee of the directors.
Hon. Mr. CASCRAIN:

Exactly.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think the
case made by the honourable senator to my
left is unanswerable. The penalty should be
restricted to the offender. Something must
be wrong with the law if the penalty cannot
be made heavy enough to prevent infractions.
After all, no corporation is going to persist in
a practice that results in a serious loss of
money.
I did not go
lon. Mr. DANDURAND:
into these details, because I took it that the
Bill would be sent to a committee, where the
whole matter would be examined.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: When the Lord's
Day Act was put through it was the subject
of a good deal of discussion. I went to see
the then Minister of Justice, now the honourable senator from North York (Hon. Sir

SENATE
Allen Aylesworth), with Honoré Gervýais, the
member for St. Mary, whom the honourable
senator from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien)
knew well and my leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) knew better. It was decided-and I
hope there will be no change in this respectto insert a proviso that no prosecution could
be undertaken without leave of the AttorneyGeneral of the province concerned. I asked
that that proviso be made applicable to one
clause, and it was. Then I wanted it made
applicable to another. There was some objection, but I insisted. It was also made
applicable to a third clause, as it should have
been. Mr. Aylesworth, as he was known then,
said, "That is flot the way we lawyers make
laws." I replied, "Well, that is the way we
land surveyors make them, and we do nlot
have any trouble."
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK moved that the Bill
be referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking- and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: May I ask the sponsor
if he does flot th-ink the mensure should be
referred to the Committee on Miscellaneous
Private Bills?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It is a public Bill.
Send it to Comimittee of the Whole.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think it should
go to the Banking and Commerce Committee,
for it affects the industries of the country.
Hon. Mr. CANTLEY: It should not go
'o any committee.
The motion was agreed to.
BUSINESS 0F THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Honourable senators. as we ha\,e very little on the Order
Paper for to-morrow, I intend to move that

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: It is on the Order

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It will corne

Wednesday if my right honourable friend
desires.

THE LEAGUE

0F NATIONS

INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. SAUVE inquired of the Government:

1. What has been the cost of the League of
Natins since its foundation?
2. How much has it cast Canada?
3. What Canadian matters has it considered?

MARCH 8, 1938
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have an answer
for the honourable gentleman, but as it consists of some nine or ten pages I will abstain
from reading it unless my honourable friend
wants me to do so.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Dispense.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The answers will
appear in Hansard to-morrow.
Following are the answers to the inquiry:
1. The cost of the League since its foundation till December 31, 1936, the last date for
which the audited accounts are available, has
been approximately 380,480,589 gold francs.
This figure is somewhat in excess of the exact
cost for the reason that since September
27, 1936, expenditures previously expressed in
gold francs have been expressed in Swiss francs,
which were betw een that date and December
31, 1936, at a discount of approximately 30
per cent.
2. Canada's contribution to the League since
its foundation till the present has been
17,543,086 gold francs.
3. It would be quite impossible, so great is
the scope of the League's activities, to give
an adequate idea in a summary statement of
the questions affecting Canada which have
been considered by the League. These questions, however, include, apart from the provision of means for peaceful settlement of disputes and efforts to further disarmament, such
matters as the following:
The publication of treaties and conventions;
The co-ordination of statistics of production and trade;
The simplification of customs formalities;
Expert studies of a wide range of economic
and financial questions and questions of intellectual co-operation which couldi not be usefully undertaken by national bodies;
Restriction of the illicit traffic in opium and
other dangerous drugs;
Suppression of the traffic in women and the
traffic in obscene publications;
The co-ordination of technical work in
various fields of preventive medicine;
The standardization of sera;
The standardization of morbidity and mortality statistics;
Supervision of sanitation and quarantine in
certain areas with a view to preventing epidemies;
Child welfare;
Studies directed to securing the greater
equality of the sexes in regard to nationality;
The codification of international law and
the progressive unification of penal law;

53

Careful and intensive investigation and research with respect to hours of work, weekly
rest, labour conditions, industrial hygiene, prevention of industrial accidents, factory inspection, workmen's compensation, the protection of women workers, the protection of
children and young persons, annual holidays
with pay, unemployment, social insurance,
remuneration of labour, salaried employees,
professional workers, home work, special problems of agricultural workers, seamen, etc.,
etc., resulting, in many cases, in conventions
designed to improve the general position of
labour, and to prevent the competition of
countries with low labour standards dragging
down the standards of the countries, including:
Canada, which have achieved, through long.
years of effort, relatively high standards.
In addition to the matters covered in these
conventions, methodical research work is carried on and studies published on technical
progress and unemployment, rationalization,
collective agreements, statistics of aliens, the
mechanization of office work, technical and
vocational education,
and apprenticeship,
regulation of hours of work and of rest of
truck drivers, and many other questions of
value to Canada and to all countries interested in social legislation and improving general living conditions.
These conventions are set forth, for
convenience of reference, in two lists-the
first showing conventions ratified by Canada
and the second showing the conventions not
yet ratified by Canada though many of them
deal with matters of interest to Canada.

EXTERNAL RELATIONS
CREATION OF STANDING COMMITTEE

Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN moved:
That a new standing committee of this
honourable House be created, called the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, for the
purpose of dealing with matters of international
concern, and that the rules of the House be
amended accordingly.

SENATE
He said: Honourable members, I need say
very little, it seems to me, in explanation of
the motion which stands in my name. Perhaps I should say, however, that since I furnished the House with explanations when the
notice of motion was placed on the Order
Paper, conditions in Europe have become much
more ominous. The shadow of Hitler has
been cast over Austria. The Prime Minister
of Great Britain, as he stated in the House of
Commons, lias thought it necessary, in order
to prevent war, to deal directly and immediately with Italy, and lias even dispensed
with the very valuable services of a statesman
like the Right Honourable Anthony Eden.
If the situation was dangerous before, what
is it to-day? It seems ta me that every thinking person in Europe or on this side of the
water must be asking himself, "Whither are
we going?" In the darkness we should like
to have some light, and in my opinion the
creation of this committee would afford a
means by which the members of this House
could get, from a gentleman whom I might
refer to as the ambassador-at-large of the
Government, the honourable the leader of this
House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), all the information that it is possible to have on foreign
affairs. I have discussed this matter with a
number of my colleagues in this House, and
the conclusion lias been unanimous that we
need ail the information available, so that we
may make up our minds as to what we would
do if in the darkness the lightning were to
strike and another war were to sweep over
the world.
To these few remarks I would add only the
suggestion that in order to make the committee wider in scope we might change its
name to "the Standing Committee on External Relations and on matters relating thereto."
This would permit all international matters to
come within the ambit of the committee.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, I do not know whether I spoke on
the occasion when my honourable friend gave
notice of this motion, made a short explanation, and was followed by my honourable
friend from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae). If
I did not say so then, I desire to say now that
I sec no objection to the motion. Many questions would come within the purview of the
committee to be formed. I realize that we arc
breaking new ground, and we shall have to
walk circumspectly when dealing with matters
that concern not only Canada but also other
parts of the Commonwealth. However, we
shall attend to these matters to the best of
our ability.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
it is unnecessary for me to say again that I
am favourable to the formation of this standing committee. Th change of name proposed
by the honourable senator from Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) will include, I understand, a rather wide field. I have particularly
in mind some resolutions that I have received
from the Wild Game Maintenance Association
of the Western Provinces, who are particularly anxious to have the subject of game
conservation presented. Many similar questions will arise from time to time, and, as I
understand, the proposed committee would b&
empowered to consider these matters. I am
therefore in favour of the establishment of
this standing committee.
Hon. W. M. ASELTINE:
Honourable
senators, I am not opposing the motion. In
fact, I think that such a committee would be
a very important one and could do a great
deal of good. At first I had it in mind to
move in amendment that the work of the
comnittee be broadened to include internai
affairs as well. My idea was that the conmittee would be able to deal with conservation of the wild life of our country. As the
honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. MeRae) lias just stated, petitions have
come to us from the Western Provinces,
where, in the last few years, game birds have
been depleted to a greater extent than I
should like to state. Wild game are becoming
less and less numerous as the years go by.
It seems to moe very important, therefore, that
we should have a standing comnittee of the
Senate Io deal with conservation of the wild
life of this Dominion. When I was a boy,
living in the Ottawa valley, I did a great
deal of fishing. At that time fish were plentifuil in ail the lakes and streams surrounding
Ottawa and in Lanark county.
Now you
have to go miles and miles, sometimes hundreds
of miles, to get good fishing, and probably
farther still to get good hunting in the fall.
At a later date I shall probably bring in a
motion for the appointment of a standing
(ornmittee on the conservation of our wild
life. While agreeing to this motion, I did not
want lo let the occasion go by without giving
some notice to honourable senators of what
I may do in the future.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, the Manitoba Game and Fish Association have written to a number of honourable
members of this House, I believe, requesting
that we do something along the line suggested by the honourable senator who lias

MARCH 8,1938
just taken his seat (Hon. Mr. Aseltine). The
association points out that the Senate of the
United States formed a committee on conservation of fish and wild game, and that it
has already made great strides. Further,
large areas have been set aside over there for
preservation of wild life of all kinds. It is
suggested that if a similar course were followed in Canada we should be very much
benefited. Some game birds, such as ducks
and geese. travel north and south, and both
countries have much the same problem with
regard to them. At a recent meeting of game
preservation associations from the whole of
the United States, it was announced that more
than ten million persons had been signed up
as members of these organizations. This
gives some idea of how active they are.
I was asked to propose that a committee
be established in this House along the lines
of the committee of the United States Senate
If the present motion is wide enough to
empower a committee to deal with this subject of game and wild life, I am perfectly
satisfied; but if it is not, I should certainly
like to have it broadened.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable senators, it is quite a long cry from ducks and
geese to the situation that was pictured by
the honourable gentleman to my right (Hon.
I am not opposing the
Mr. Beaubien).
motion, but for the life of me I cannot see
where in the world the committee will ever
get. There is a most complicated situation
in Europe. A dozen countries or more are
involved most intricately, and their governments are dealing with that situation in many
ways that we never hear about and may never
expect to hear about, though we may see the
results sometimes. We must not get the idea
that if we appoint this committee we shall
be given all the information possessed by
the governments in all those European countries. Never in the world could we get it.
Where would our information come from?
What would be the source of the committee's information? Would it be the Prime
Minister of Canada? Well, I doubt very
much whether be would tell us a great deal.
Hon. Mr. POPE: He is a wise bird.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes; people have to
be wise in such positions. It may be desirable to set up a committee as proposed, to
deal with some problems. No harrm would be
done anyway, and we could see what value
it had as we went along. But I am afraid
we never shall get any information that will
enable us to conclude how the European
situation should be handled. That is my
view at the moment, I may be wrong. How-

57

ever, as I have said, I do not see that any
harm can be done by creating the committee
and doing as much as we can to save game
fish and wild life.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, I should like to ask a few questions
with regard to this motion. I understood the
mover (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) and the honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr.
McRae) suggested that affairs of international
concern would come before the committee.
Would they include, for instance, such a
matter as that of an international bridge at
Niagara Falls, which is now before us? And
would they include the Copyright Amendment
Bill, also before us just now, which has a
direct bearing upon a convention entered
into by various nations many years ago? The
honourable mover of the motion (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien) nods his head to signify Yes.
Then may I ask, if the aims and objects of
the committee are to be as he bas outlined,
does he not regard this language in his motion,
"for the purpose of dealing with matters of
unfortunate?
concern,"
as
international
"Dealing with matters" would appear to
contemplate dealing with them to the point
of disposing of them. I think it would have
been more appropriate if the honourable
senator had said, " for the purpose of considering matters of international concern." One
gentleman said to me the other day, "The
Senate is now going to set up a committee to

usurp the powers of. the Department of
External Affairs of the Federal Government.
A Senate committee is going to deal with all
those matters." Now, I know my honourable
friend does not intend that, but would his
motion not be clearer if be would substitute
in it some such words as I have suggested?
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, I certainly will not oppose
the motion. I am not sure that I should be
so complacent were I sitting in the seat
opposite, but I presume the leader of the
Government feels the committee would do
no harm.
The Senate of the United States is of course
not at all analogous to this House as regards
foreign affairs. In that country all foreign
treaties must be approved by that single
body, and only by it. Here treaties are
indeed effective even if not approved by
Parliament at all, though the present custom,
becoming a constitutional practice, is to
obtain the approval of Parliament. Clearly,
therefore, we cannot expect any committee
of our Senate to have anything like the same
status of authority in respect of external
affairs as the committee of the United States
Senate possesses.

SENATE

58

Nor should I expect that officers of the
Department of External Affairs, who alone
would havc information which is denied even
to the press, would likely give a committee
of this louse information that they were net
A
to disclose to Parliament.
prepared
committee might be able to make some
special sudices of certain phases of our external
relations, but these could be only in the nature
of informative studios for the benefit of the
House, and in no sense could they be
administrative acts. I should think that at
first the comnmittee would probably confine
itself to matturs of immediate and practical
concern whii liave to do with external
relations, such as the protection of migratory
birds.
Hon. M.

CALDER: Trade treaties.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) asked if such a matter as an
international bridge would be dealt with by
the commiteoe. If the matter were before
us in a bill. it would he for the House te
choose whether the bill should be sent to
this comnmittee or te the Railways Committee,
to which hitiherto such measurcs have been
sent. The same procedure would apply te
the otier instance mentioned by the henourable senator from Parkdale. But undoubtedly
he is right in suggesting that the resolution
should read rather less poremptorily than it
does now.
I would suggest that it read
ihis waY:
That a new standing committee of this
hoinourable iouse be oreated, called the Standing Conmnittee on Exterial Relations and all
matters having to do thlierewith, to consider
ani report uponf t le samte, ain< that the Rules
of the House be anendedi accoidiigly.
Then certainly the conitotee would be
wide enough Le include the subject emphasized
by the ionourable the junior senator from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig).
I doe not like at all the term "foreign
affairs" in relation te Canada. Perhaps I am
out of date. but it seeis to me very prosumptuous for us to be talking about a
forcign policy. Professors write very ioarned
books and magazine articles on the subject.
I read a book a little while ago, before it
was finally published, about the foreign policy
of Canada. The term is altogether too cmbracing. If we are to have a foreign policy
we must launeh upon a course of conduct
wholly different and mightily more portentous
than we are embarked upon to-day. We have
external relations, of course, but that is a
less ambitious term. It does seem hard to
comprehend how people take this country so
seriously as a great, influential factor in
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN,

world affairs. I do net want te minimize our
strengih and our growing consequence, but
this picture of Canada constantly assuming to
lead denocracies in matters of foreign affairs
is cealy pretty tiresone.
We had botter
realize just where we are and wliat we
amount to, and behave accordingly.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I do net think I
can give any further information. My motion
lias been very happily revised, and I am
thankful to the right lionourable leader on
this side of the House for his suggestion. I
might tell him that I liad no such ambition
as that which has been iinted at.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I know that.
Hon. 'Mr. BEAUBIEN: We are not the
makers of world conditions; but we may
find it ver y liard to get away from the consequences of those conditions.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Hear, iear.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: That, I take it, is
net open to contradiction. Therefore should
we not try to get all the liglt that can prudently be cast upon the road we are travclIing
-against our will, if yen like? What objectien is there to our seeing ahead as far as
we can? Why should we in the slightest
degree hesitate te ask our Department of External Affairs to give us ail information that
can prudently be furnished?
Righi
riglt.

lon. Mr. MEIGIEN: That is all

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Surely, honourable
members. to-morrow we may have a full-dress
discussion on foreign affairs. After all, this
House lias te deal with every treaty that
Canada enters into, and cvery phase of foroign
affairs. Would it net be much more satisfactory for us to be well informed, so that,
being much better posted than we are to-day,
we may, as the honourable leader of this
House ias said, tread warily on thin ice,
if thtre be any?
I do not want te prolong the discussion,
but I nay add there are many phases of
external affairs as to whieh I should like to
know what the Government intends to do.
For instance, now that the Prime Minister
of Great Britain las declared his country's
attitude towards the League of Nations, what
is to be our attitude towards it? Surely there
is no objection to our being informed as to
that. I repeat, I had no ambitious intentions such as have been hinted at. All I
want to get is such light as may be prudently
thrown on external relations, and that I think
I am fairly entitled to.

59

MARCH 8, 1938
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: I am very sorry
not to be able to agree with the honourable
member from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien). If we are to be furnished information
here in the open, how can we prevent that
from reaching a potential enemy? One of
the weaknesses of the League of Nations was
that it discussed ticklish international affairs
in public. Diplomacy is never conducted in
the open. Talleyrand said that language had
been given to man to disguise his thoughts.
How can we disguise our thoughts in frank
discussion? I bave great faith in the Empire.
If the possession of such faith constitutes an
Imperialist, then I am one. British statesmen
and diplomats are the best trained in the
world. Look at the way in which they have
extended the Empire within my lifetime.
Even if we locked the doors of this Chamber
and had secret sessions, the gist of our
discussions would leak out, to the advantage
of any potential enemy. I do not think it is
wise to show your hand. I have never played
cards in my life, but I know you never show
your hand in a card game.
Hon. Mr. POPE: I would suggest that a
better name would be the League of Notions.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Does my honourable friend intend to amend his motion as
suggested?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Yes. I asked leave
a moment ago to change the wording.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The remarks
of the honourable the junior member from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) suggest a question
to niy mind. Every province has its own
game laws. The proposed committee should
take into account that in several of the
matters mentioned we cannot interfere with
provincial laws.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The protection of migratory birds comes under external
relations. It has nothing to do with provincial jurisdiction.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: No, not that.
I was thinking of local fish and game laws.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is not intended to bring those matters before the
proposed committee.
, Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I am glad to
hear that; otherwise I should have had to take
objection. The provinces have their own
inspectors to enforce provincial fish and game
laws.
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
as amended will read:

House be created, called the Standing Committee on External Relations and all matters having

TRANS-CANADA

AIR

LINES

BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 29, an Act to amend the
Trans-Canada Air Lines Act, 1937.
He said: The purpose of this Bill is to
correct two omissions in the Act of last
session. Under agreement made some two
years ago by ' the Governments of Great
Britain, Ireland, Newfoundland and Canada,
eacb Government is to take a proportion
of stock in a company to be formed to
operate a trans-Atlantic air-line service. The
first amendment gives authority to TransCanada Air Lines to purchase Canada's share
of stock in that company. This authority was
inadvertently omitted from the Act, although
the Minister of Transport stated last session
that the necessary funds had been provided.
The purpose of the second amendment is
to correct anoither omision. It will be recalled by honourable members that the route
of TransCanada Air Lines as originally laid
out between Montreal and Moncton goes over
the State of Maine. A strict reading of the
Act would not permit Trans-Canada Air Lines
to operate ouitside Canada. Accordingly subsection 1 of section 15 is amended to cover
operation "between points in Canada and
points outside of Canada, over routes wholly
within or partly within and partly outside
of Canada."
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Is not the
consent of the United States Government
necessary for the crossing of its territory?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Yes. I think
an agreement has been arrived at between
the United States and Canada in this regard.

SENATE

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I have read the very brief
discussion which took place in the other
Chamber, and if I offer anything by way of
criticism, or even question the whole policy,
I cannot boast of having found any encouragement to do so from my perusal of that discussion. There all parties seemed to be
agreed; one had only to be air-minded in
order to sec virtue in every enterprise having
to do with aviation.
When, two years ago, we passed a measure
authorizing the establishment of a Canadian
air service, I questioned its wisdom. Generally
speaking, in business the shrewd, long-headed
fellow waits for the other fellow to carry out
experiments. If after one, two or three trials
success is attained, the experimenter is lucky
and usually does very well; but as a rule the
man who sits by and waits until new things
are perfected and become stabilized is best
off by the time he reaches old age. The same
principle operates in the life of a nation.
I cannot see why Canada is rushing to the
front to become a pioneer in aviation.
I know we must have certain aviation
services. Where a commercial demand for
any such service exists it will be satisfied by
private enterprise. Possibly some little encouragement should be given in the way of
training, or provision for training, and the like,
for aviation services in districts where it
cannot be furnished by our other transportation agencies, such as in the North.
So far as I am aware, the plan which we
launched two years ago for the establishment
of an air service across the Dominion has not
succeeded; nor has anything on such a scale
suceeded anywhere.
If my information is
correct, no commercial success has attended a
corresponding venture in the United States.
Yet that country has thirteen times our
population; its land contour is better fitted
than ours for the establishment of such a
service; its climate also, regard being had to
the entire year, is more favourable to air
travel.
Would it not have been wiser to wait
until we could measure the financial results
of a similar enterprise over there, and not
consider ourselves lacking in vision if we did
not keep step with them? I venture to say
there is a great deal more to be learned about
transcontinental aviation, and I should like to
observe its operation from the side-lines rather
than plunge into the financial risks involved.
This is especially true because of the situation
of our National Railways. We are continually
bemoaning our awful railway burden. And we
cannot bemoan it too much, for as a result
of the enormous railway debt and annually
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

recurring operating deficits, taxation is crushing us to-day. But although so lamenting,
we are at the same time engaged in throwing
millions of dollars into an enterprise which will
compete to take away business from our
railways.
This Bill, of course, does not launch the enterprise. I believe its purpose is merely to
correct two omissions, though I cannot just
understand why the first omission was made.
The Act of last session provided for the
establishment of an operating company, the
whole of whose stock was to be subscribed by
the Dominion of Canada-that is to say, by
the National Railways. We were told then
that the Canadian Pacifie Railway Company
had stepped aside because it could not get
control. I do not know why it stepped aside,
but I am thoroughly sure it did step aside.
But we did not: we stepped right into the
middle, and had the privilege of acquiring all
the stock.
The Act also provided that the corporation,
in addition to establishing this Canadian transcontinental air service, could also take stock in
an international company, to be subscribed for
co-operatively-a very fine word-by Great
Britain, Ireland, Canada and Newfoundland;
Newfoundland's share being kindly put up by
Great Britain. Great Britain is to have 51
per cent, which is quite right, I suppose, as
she is doing all the pioneering. I can realize
that Great Britain has a real object to serve
by pioneering this way. If she does not do it,
who will? Certainly she cannot afford, because
of her international position, to be behind in
respect of training of this kind.
But it is said that two years ago we provided the money to do all that we are now
taking statutory power to accomplish. That is
an agreeable way of putting it. I do not
think we provided the money. What is meant,
I think, is that we provided stock that can be
taken up when we get the money. But we
have to get the money.
So we are now right in the forefront of
trans-Atlantic aviation, and we are putting
in more money-a vast amount of money, I
should say, because I do not think $1,250,000
is going very far. It will get us just about
as far as the first $10,000,000 got us with the
Canadian Pacifie Railway; or perhaps it would
be better to say about as far as our first
contributions to the Canadian National
Railways got us in the establishment of that
system. We are launching into trans-Atlantic
aviation, going in as a junior partner to the
extent of the 24J per cent which the Canadian
National Railways will have. That means,
of course, removing its deficit. I hope this
suggestion will cheer the heart of my

of the north country, even though -they are
not served by a railway. But there must be
some justification for organizing at once a
service that will link our provinces together
and will provide transportation from the
Atlantic te the Pacific in about one-quarter of
the time taken by the railways.
As te the trans-Atlantie line, Great Britain
is very much interested. Ireland-I think
it is Southern Ireland, because the route will
pass through Southern Ireland-is also very
much interested; and I have read of a
discussion which indicated that the United
States felt they should have the advantage
of the terminal of a British trans-Atlantic line.
Since we have established a transcontinental
line of railway, it seems quite justifiable te
link up with British institutions, and te allow
them te join with us in feeding our transcontinental line. The aviation principle is
developing rapidly, and I think that the
experiments made justify countries in establishing regular lines across the ocean. Some
twenty years ago, when Bleriot flew across
the Channel for the first time, I foresaw that
before very long someone would be hopping
over the Atlantic. This bas come te pass,
and now there are in the postal services
gigantic aeroplanes capable of carrying dozens
of passengers and tons of freight. I believe
that those who are alive ten years from now
will be able te leave Montreal or Ottawa in
the morning, have dinner in London, and come
back overnight.

country is te measure its potentialities and
its present assets against its liabilities and te

will let richer and bigger countries do the
experimenting, and will gain wisdom by
observation rather than in the way in which
it was gained in connection with the Canadian
National Railways.

there is a service between Seattle and

I only give my way of looking at the

expense of our railways.

I should like to hear another discussion of
the merits of the whole situation when the
Minister is present.

was before the committee we had the Minister
present, and although the leader of the Government has said to-night that this transAtlantic service would be a feeder to our

No.

Hon. Mr. COTE: That was my impression
last year until .I went to the committee, and
I remember distinctly that the Minister expressed the opinion that the transcontinental
air line would not affect the railway lines
in any way. He said it would not compete
with then and would net help them. I remember that the Bill provided for only 51 per
cent ownership by the Canadian National
Railwiv,
and that participation to the extent
of 49 per cent by other companies was provided
for. Being green at the game, I wvas fearful
that the 49 per cent would be given to
other companies to the detriment of the
Canadian National Railways. I was told by
the Minister there was no fear of that; that
the trans-Canada air line would not compete
with the Canadian National Railways or any
other railway, but would carry only what I
think te called "created freight"-something
entirely new, which the railways were net
handling.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: It would go in circles.
Hon. Mr. COTE: It would carry freight
created by the service. If this Bill goes to
committee, I think it would be very interesting to learn from the Minister how the
service has been getting along. It has been
in existence for some months, and before we
extend it to cover the Atlantic that informatien would be of advantage.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I think my
honourable friend has misunderstood my statement in regard to the trans-Atlantic airway
bringing goods and mail here, and being a
feeder to our own transcontinental air lines.
I have no objection whatever to the Bill
being sent to the Committee on Railways,
Telegraphs and Harbours, so that we may
have an expert from the department present
to explain the whole situation and the funetioning of this new trans-Atlantic line. I
would move that the Bill be referred to the

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There is one
point of which I think honourable members
should be aware, even before they repair to
the committee. What the honourable senator
(Hon. Mr. Côté) says is rigtt. When the Bill
was expounded to the committee two years
ago it was contemplated that Canada would
own 50 or 51 per cent, and that the remainder
would be subscribed for-eagerly subscribed
for-by other aviation companies. But it is
clear, as related recently very close to where
we are sitting, that although the other conpanies did come forward they did not produce
any cash. What scems to be worth cold cash
to the Dominion did not seem worth it to
them. What they wvere ready to give, apparently, though it has not been statcd, was some
kind of stock. But the Covernimeut decided
to take the whole thing over, and a new situation tas arisen.

CANADA'S RAILWAY PROBLEM
MOTION-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion by Hon.
Mr. Beaubien:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the
Goverisment should be urged to settle the railway problem of Canada at an early date in
order to stop the ruinous loss made each year
by the Dominion through the Canadian National
Railways, and which already amounts to several
billion dollars.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, it is unnecessary to state that the
address delivered by the mover of this motion,
the honourable senator fromMontarville (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien), was very interesting indeed.
That is truc of the address as a whole, but
I have in mind at the moment particularly
his references to our federal, provincial and
municipal obligations, which are, in the main,
incontrovertible. I must confess, however,
that his conclusions on this subject were somewhat depressing and perhaps a little pessimistic. We all should realize that we are
just moving out of a period of depression
that bas staggered the world. But for our
unemployment problem and our Western
drought calamity, I think we should be able
to congratulate ourselves on the good condition of federal finances, at all events. We
should not forget that throughout that economic crisis our people displayed their native
stamina and withstood the strain courageously and well. I suggest with hope that we
shall have a return to the brighter days of
normal conditions. But, without going into
financial details, I may say that in the meantime the world envies our lot. They see,
as we ourselves have seen, that our people
are at work, doing wonderfully well. Our
exports are an evidence of our production.
Yet our railway problem is still with us.
I will not discuss the liabilities of the
Canadian National Railways at length. I will
only deal with that part of the honourable
gentleman's address in which he spoke of the
Canadian National debt as having passed the
three billion dollars mark and being added
to at the rate of $100,000,000 a year. I should
like to remark that this represents the funded
debt to the public, which is for the most part
guaranteed by either the federal or the provincial governments of Canada, and also what
is known as Dominion of Canada account,
which includes loans to railways $686,000,000.
interest on these loans accrued and unpaid
$530,832,000, deficit on interest charges $284,416,000, and cost of construction of the original
Government railways, built as a public work,

an interest charge of $75,000,000 on this immense sum, and then adds $40,000,000 as
deficit, forgetful of the fact that this deficit
item is already included in his total of three
billion dollars.
As to the original Government railways,
the.re is no more reason for calculating interest
on that investment than on the investment
in our canals, harbours or public buildings.
It should be borne in mind that the deficits
referred to are deficits consisting of interest
charges and that there are no deficits on
operation of the Canadian National, which
provides a net operating revenue of about
$15,000,000 a year. The Ottawa Journal of
yesterday supports this view in an editorial
headed, "A Fictitious Five Hundred Millions."
This does not get over the conviction that
we all have, that the situation is a very

serious one.
and was revealed when the War was on.
The Drayton-Acworth Royal Commission of
1917 surveyed the whole field ant that time
and went deeply into the various problems
which were engrossing the mind of the public.
After examining suggestions for private and
for public ownership it rejected both in the
following terms:
We do not think that a railway monopoly
is desirable either in the hands of a company
or in the hands of the State. We are convinced that the people of Canada who have
spent or guaranteed-whether wisely or not
is not now the question-hundreds of millions
of dollars, largely with the object of breaking
a private monopoly, would never consent to
the re-establishment of a still greater monopoly,
even if the Governsment were a partner in
the concern.
In 1925 a committee of the Senate made a
lengthy inquiry and also rejected any idea
of merger. The Duff Royal Commission of
1931 came to the same conclusion. It said:
To establish a monopoly of such a magnitude
would place in the bands of those responsible
for the administration of tie systei powers
that would, if not properly exercised, prejudice
the interests of the Dominion as a whole.
The Duff Commission also rejected the idea
of leasing the Canadian National to the
Canadian Pacific, in perpetuity or for a
definite time, and said it did so because the
lease would tend to a merger. It recommended separate maintenance of the two
entities.
What the Senate favoured in 1925 was a
middle-way proposal for continuing the
separate entities, but under unified management as to administration and operation.
The Senate committee's report asserted that
unified management would remove or dispense
with duplication in railway tracks and rolling stock, in passenger and freight services,
in railway stations from the Atlantic to the

64

SENATE

Pacifie, in telegraph, express and other services, in offices, in accounting and bookkeeping, in numerous other special offices and in
administrative boards, staffs, and so on. This
report came before us in the last days of the
session of 1925. During the election campaign which followed closely upon prorogation that year this matter was not discussed
before the people; nor was it discussed in
the campaign of the following year. Perhaps
a special reason for silence on the subject
during the election of 1926 was the recovery
which manifested itself in the latter part of
1925 and in the next year.
The recovery at that time was so marked
that Mr. Beatty became optimistie and was
then in favour of competition.
Speaking
before the Canadian Club at Montreal, on
March 15, 1926, he referred to a statement
which he had made before the Senate committee.
The Montreal Gazette report of
his address was given under the following
heading:
Says competition in transportation spurs
efficiency.
Referring to his appearance before the
Senate committee, he said:
I was asked if I believed in a railway
monopoly for this country, and I answered that
while no one should attempt to forecast the
conditions in this country for the next few
years with that certainty which would justify
a definite and unchangeable view, that I did
not believe in a monopoly, and I did not
believe in it for a reason that was perhaps in
a peculiar way the result of my own experiences. I said that I thought a merger of
these two principal properties would involve
difficulties in administration which were scarcely
contemplated and which would in time affect
the character of the service given to the publie;
that I did not know how it could be possible,
with the best executives, the most loyal and
efficient officers and most patriotic board of
directors, for an enterprise with one hundred
and fifty thousand employees to be maintained
in the highest state of efficiency without the
spur of competition. We must admit that
consolidations, properly conceived and carried
ont, are capable of effecting great economies.
There is no way in which the same amount of
money can bu saved in a short space of time,
and it nay be that the people of Canada wili
bave to determine at some stage whether the
obvious disadvantages of consolidation are outweighed by the financial interests or necessities
of the country.
I may be wrong in my point of view, but it
is extremely difficult to maintain a high morale
and that "on his toes" attitude of railway
employees when they have nothing to measure
their efforts against, and ihen, so far as they
are concerned, the struggle for results is taken
away because there is no one else in the ring.
And be adds this obvious remark, which
he has repeated since:
Railway rearrangements can save money but
they cannot create new traffic, and in the last
analysis traffic volume, whieh means the counHon. Mr. DANDURAND.

try's development and commercial prosperity,
will determine the extent of the transportation
burdens of this country.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: When did he
give that address?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: March 15, 1926.
We did not hear of the Senate, resolution
during 1927 and 1928, for they were prosperous
years and railway revenues were increasing.
The slump, which set in bowards the end of
1928 and gathered mo.mentum throughout 1929
and 1930, began to cause alarm among the
railway fraternity, and the raiiway companies
asked for an inquiry.
Hence the Duff Commission came into
being. It made an exhaustive study of railways and transportation, as my honourable
friend from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien)
has said, and absolutely rejected the principle
of a merger of the two railway systems either
under private or public ownership. The Commission also examined the possibilities of unified management. The Senate resolution was
brought to its attention, with the statement
that unification would effect an annual saving of about $75,000,000 through abandonment of rails t the tune of some five thousand
miles or more, and consolidation of stations,
yards and terminal facilities, of locomotive
and car shops, and of supervisory and managerial organizations.
Mr. Beatty-as be was when be appeared
before the Duff Commission in 1932-declared himself against competition, although
in 1926 he had urged its advantages. He
proposed consolidation of the two railways
by a lease of the Government lines to the
Canadian Pacific on a profit-sharing basis.
Here are his words:
I suggest to you, with deference, that the
object to bu sought is the securing of an incentive to efficiency, coupled with a sense of
responsibility which secures economical operations, and that this result eau only be achieved
under private operation of the railways of
Canada. This belief leads nie to the conclusion
that under existing conditions in Canada the
only solution which will stand the test of the
country's necessities is a consolidation through
a lease on a profit-sharing basis of the Goverument railways to the Canadian Pacifie.
He estimated that on the basis of the 1931
operating figures this would result in a saving
of $60.000,000.
A month lalter he filed a
statement with the Commission showing possible annual savings of $6,340,000 through cooperative arrangements and $75,000,000 by
unification of the two systems under private
management.
Mr. Beatty was asked whether there was
any method by which the lines merged under
his proposal might be "unscrambled" later.
He replied:

MARCH 9, 1938
I do not think they are "unscramblable" if
your effort is to secure maximum economy.
My view of that has always been that if you
approach this with the idea that you are
going to have maximum economies, you cannot
at the same time restore those in a few years
in the condition in which you got them. I
do not think that is possible. If you are going
to abandon a piece of track because you don't
need it, you won't save much if you say in
five or six years, "I have to give it back in
the condition in which I got it."
Sir Henry Thornton estimated a saving of
$60,000,000.
His opinion on amalgamation
under some unified form of administration
or private ownership will be found at page
668 of the proceedings of the Commission,
as follows:
Amalgamation under some unified form of
administration will, in theory, produce the
maximum of economies, of which a material
proportion will doubtless fructify. It has been
estimated that these economies would yield
a return of something like $60,000,000 per
annum, increasing progressively from the first
year and reaching the figure named perhaps
at the expiration of a five-year period. Whether
all of this sum can be salvaged by amalgamation
is arguable, but whatever it may be should not
be ignored in the discussion, and it would
represent after its full attainment a continuous
and annual return.
Speaking of the influence of polities on the
management of railways, he said, as reported
at pages 668 and 669 of the proceedings:
This difficulty would of course be removed
if the two railways were amalgamated under
private ownership; but at once there is aroused
in the minds of the citizens of our Dominion
that fear which is quite justifiably displayed
whenever a great and formidable monopoly
appears-a fear which the activities of many
monopolies in the past have justified. There
will also be the criticism that with the removal
of competition there is bound to be a deterioration in service and efficiency, irrespective of
the desire and effort of the management to
avoid such results.
In short, for a variety of reasons the amalgamation of the Canadian National and the
Canadian Pacific would be definitely repugnant
to the people of the Dominion in my judgment;
and, apart from anything else, it becomes
politically impracticable. I believe it must
therefore be discarded as a solution.
It will be seen from the foregoing that
while Sir Henry Thornton had theoretical
views on amalgamation and unification, yet
he definitely discarded the idea that either
was a solution of Canada's railway problem.
Later on Mr. Beatty was again examined
before the Commission, when he spoke on
the necessity of complete unification. His
views will be found at page 2410 of the proceedings of the Commission. I cite them:
I would point out the self-evident fact that
maximum economies are only possible thrnugh
complete unification.
The more favourably

ment of the two companies would be available
to carry out the combined operation in the
most efficient manner and at the least expense.
It is evident that complete unification bespeaks permanency. There would be but one
railway system. The Duff Commission saw in
unified management a permanent fusion, an
unscramblable proposition, and as it had rejected merger and monopoly under private
or public ownership, quite logically it also
rejected unified management, which in its
opinion meant a permanent merger. As the
two railway systems could not in that event
be separated subsequently and restored to their
former condition as individual systems, the
Commission, after examining the whole field
and considering the various proposals submitted, reported in favour of co-operation.
Sir Edward Beatty's unification plan would
doubtless ensure economies if it remained in
the realm of theory and did not touch the
earth. Unfortunately-or fortunately-railways
run on the ground. They are servifig human
beings, for whom they were built.
At the time Mr. Beatty appeared before
the Commission the railways had a free hand
as to abandonments and rail-lifiting; but under
an amendment made to the Railway Act about
a year and a half later no such steps could
be taken without approval being first obtained
from the Railway Commission. Mr. Beaudry
Leman, a member of the Duff Commission,
drew the attention of Mr. Beatty to the
change, and this interesting conversation will
be found at page 2459 of the proceedings:
Commissioner Leman: In your project of
unification do you visualize carrying on through
the instrumentality of the Canadian Pacifie
Railway, or have you been investigating the
advantages or otherwise of a third body stepping in and carrying on-a body upon which
the Government and yourselves would be represented and which, of course, would take the
responsibility for everything that is to be done
in the way of abandonments, including the dissatisfaction created thereby, and the bringing
together of the policies of the companies, which
would retain their identities?
Mr. Beatty:
That is feasible.
It has
two disadvantages. It brings the Government
into loser association with the administration
of the properties than I think is wise, and it
also renders doubtful the type that would be
selected for appointment to the Board. The
reason I suggested the Canadian Pacifie as
the means is that I would rather start with a
Board that is known. I did think there would
have to be added to the Board in course of
time men not necessarily nominees of the Canadian Pacific Railway.
If the Governmen't
selected the directors I would not like it, but
if the Government established a tribunal to
select them, an independent body composed of
men, as I have mentioned, from the Canadian
Bankers Association, the Canadian Chambers
of Commerce and a judge of the Supreme Court,
then of course you would he almost certain to
get the type of men whose ability would justify
the selection.

that the Senate resolution assured the Canadian Pacifie a dividend on its common shares,
which at that time were earning ten per cent.
For several years the company has passed
the dividend on its corninon stock. Surely
no one to-day would guarantee the Canadian
Pacific a dividend on that stock.
True, Sir Edward Beatty has often said,
"Let us first agree on the principle, and then
we will discuss details." I would suggest that
the principal conditions of any projected association are usually based on what each party
brings in and what it takes out as its share of
profit. I have often wondered whether, in case
the Canadian National capitalization were revalued on the basis of a part of its bonded
indebtedness, se as to bring it to the level
of the total bonded obligations of the Canadian Pacifie Railway and thus to put the two
systems on a fairly equal basis, the Canadian
Pacific Railway would join in a scheme of
unified management under which it would receive equal treatment in the apportionment
of profits. I understand that the Canadian
Pacific Railway was at one time desirous of
ranking the Canadian National obligations with
its own common stock, the Canadian Pacifie
to have the privilege of receiving interest on
its obligations and on preferred stock. When
the Canadian Pacifie Railway invites the

ward Beatty that he drop generalities and
give the public a fair outline of bis plan.
One must not lose sight of the fact that
any scheme of unified management would be
contingent upon a financial arrangement satisfactory to the Canadian Pacifie Railway. This
aspect of the question is but an aside, as the
Act of 1933 forbids amalgamation and unified
management and control of the railway systems which form part of the Canadian National
Railways. It must net he forgotten, and of
course my colleagues around me do net forget, that the Act of 1933 originated in this
Chamber and was unanimously adopted. I
think I am quite logical, therefore, in stating
that the Act of 1933 superseded the Senate
resolution of 1925, and that it is now the
law of the land.

proposition. Apart from line abandonments,
the co-operative measures which the two railways have put into effect since the passage
of the Canadian National-Canadian Pacifie
Act of 1933, are estimated to have resulted
in a joint annual saving of $1,092,500. These
co-operative measures have had to do with
the pooling of passenger services and the joint
use of certain facilities. In the matter of line
abandonments not a great deal bas been
accomplished. although a joint executive committee of the officials of the tiwo companies
bas been giving continuons study to the possibilities of various proposals in this respect.

mileages as a purely company matter. But

To secure the economies referred to, the

of the bondholders whose investment in former privately-owned lines would be affected.

SENATE

At the time the Canadian Pacifie abandonment programme was set up, proposals to abandon railway mileage did not require the approval of the Board of Railway Commissioners, but in 1933 the Railway Act was
amended to read as follows:
Section 165 (a). The company may abandon
the operation of any line of railway with the
approval of the Board, and no company shall
abandon the operation of any line of railway
without such approval.
It may be opportune to indicate the difficulties that are met in the matter of co-operation by the two companies in their efforts
to reduce expenses. During the session of
1934 the Minister of Railways desired to
introduce bills to unify the telegraph and express services, with the consent and approval
of the two railways, but he had to abandon
his projects because, forsooth, of ominous
rumblings which indicated that the bringing
together of those two branches of the railway
systems under a unified régime was regarded
as the thin edge of a merger.
So much bas been heard of Canadian National Railways deficits that the man in the
street is usually surprised when be is told
that since consolidation under the present
arrangement in 1923 the system bas never
failed to meet its operating expenses, even
during the worst years of the depression, and
that at the present time it is able to achieve
a net operating revenue of about $15,000,000,
and to contribute, notwithstanding the uncontrolled and unregulated highway competition of recent years, more than $6,000,000 a
year towards fixed charges due the public.
This bas been possible despite the fact that the
railways constituting the Canadian National
Railway System, unlike those of the Canadian
Pacifie Railway, were designed for operation not as a unit, but as competing systems.
Furthermore, it must not he forgotten that
the fixed charges of the Canadian National
lines, guaranteed by the Dominion and certain of the provinces, are an inheritance from
private ownership.
Inasmuch as the return of the National
Railways to private management would not
lessen the responsibility of the owners, the
people of Canada, the question may well be
asked whether it would cure our railway ills.
On the contrary, any arrangement for unified
management and operation would enlarge and
increase the responsibility to the extent that
the financial obligations of the private company
were involved in it. At the present time the
Government knows where it stands so far as
its railway obligations are concerned. Does
anyone know where it would stand under
unification?

Would not the obligations of the State increase
rather than diminish?
After all, the deciding factor in the railway
situation is the amount of business offering.
Unification would not increase railway traffic.
That it would decrease present working
expenses is doubtful in view of the fact that
the estimated saving of $75,000,000 was
predicated upon 1930 operations, and that
since that time the combined operating
expenditures of the two railways, even under
separate management, have dropped from

reflects the economies which the two railways
have been obliged to introduce in their own
interests. It reflects also the lessened volume
of business available to them. It is impossible
to suppose that under any plan of operation,
separate or united, an additional saving or
reduction of $75,000,000 on expenditures can
be made if the efficiency of the railways is
to be maintained and a reasonable service
provided.
Thus we arrive at the same conclusion as
the Royal Commission did. The extreme

railways have learned their lesson in this
matter and are co-operating whenever it is
possible to do so within lines of existing
legislation. Competitive branch-line construction is virtually a thing of the past, as are

Beatty's point that competition and co-operation were incompatible, my right honourable
friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) said that
as time went on the area of competition
would be gradually reduced, while the area
of co-operation would be proportionately
enlarged.

MARCH 9, 1938
As to hotels, I might mention in passing
that an agreement has just been entered into
by the two companies, to the very great
advantage of each, for joint and equal use of
the new Canadian National hotel at Vancouver.
Wholesale abandonment of mileage under
the unification plan is recognized as being impracticable as a policy. But that fact ought
not to prevent the two railways from studying abandonment projects that would not
result in leaving struggling communities without railway service upon which they were
dependent. In brief, the Government feels
that within the confines of the present legislation, subject to the will and desire of the
railway managements to co-operate, and subject also, if necessary, to the arbitral features
of the Act, it will be possible to achieve whatever worth-while further economies can be
.achieved, without inviting by completely
merging administration and operation of the
railways and consolidating their physical properties the very grave potential dangers to
which royal commissione have repeatedly
directed attention, and with much less hardship and disturbance of the social and economie
life of the country than would result from a
merger of the railways.
The Government fully appreciates the
gravity of the extent of assistance required
to enable the Canadian National Railways to
pay bond interest, and has explored every
possible avenue for improvement. The results
indicate clearly that any improvement possible ·through amalgamation or unified management would be trivial when compared with
the dislocation of business that such a move
would bring about. The policy of the Government will be to operate the Canadian
National Railways as economically as possible and at the same time to put forward
every effort to increase the volume of traffic,
which is the real key to the situation. The
Government is satisfied that only through
increased volume of traffic can the railway
problem be solved or the situation materially
improved from the national viewpoint.
Now I come to the motion before us. It
asks the Senate to urge Parliament to settle
the railway problem of Canada at an early
date. It offers no concrete proposal, nor any
other kind of proposal. But its mover, my
honourable friend from Montarville (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien), suggests that the Government adopt the Senate's resolution of 1925.
If he looks at its terms, though, he will
realize that no one, not even he himself, would
suggest them to-day. Present conditions are
not those of 1925. The honourable senator
adds that, if his suggestion is not acceptable,
the Government should call in the best
authorities in the land to give advice. But I

69

would ask him: What tribunal does he
suggest? Has he in mind another royal commission?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: They are no good.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Duff Commission was composed of the highest authorities. Its members were: Right Hon. Lord
Ashfield, of London, England, Right Hon.
Lyman Poore Duff, Sir Joseph W. Flavelle,
Mr. Beaudry Leman, Mr. Leonor Fresnel Loree,
of New York, Mr. Walter Charles Murray, and
Mr. John Clarence Webster. I am convinced
that if they were reconvened to-day-and I
doubt if my honourable friend or anyone
else, after exploring the whole country, could
suggest more capable men-they would maintain their conclusions of 1932, even under the
present changed conditions. The Senate in
1933 had a public and exhaustive inquiry
before adopting the Canadian National-Canadian Pacific Bill, which was based on the
conclusions of that royal commission. Will
the Senate in 1938 reverse its decision of
1933? Will it do so simply as a result of
Sir Edward Beatty's campaign throughout the
land? Will it do so without a serions inquiry,
and without hearing the views and arguments
of our own Canadian National executive?
My honourable friend has said that if the
Government wants more light it should call
in the best authorities in the land. To my
.mind, the best authorities are close at hand.
They are charged with the execution of the
will of Parliament. I refer to the members
of the joint co-operative committee appointed
by the two railway companies to effect
economies as d.irected by the Act of 1933.
The representatives forming that co-operative
committee are: for the Canadian National,
S. W. Fairweather, Director, Bureau of
Economics, chairman; C. S. Gzowski, Chief
Engineer of Construction, and N. B. Walton,
Chief of Transportation;
and, for the
Canadian Pacifie, H. D. Grout, Assistant to
the Vice-President, chairman; R. B. Jones,
Assistant Engineer, and G. C. Brooks, Chief
Joint Facility Accountant. This committee
initiates and considers co-operative projects,
and submits such definite proposals as may
result to a joint executive committee composed
of directors of both railways. The Canadian
National representatives are S. J. Hungerford,
President, H. J. Symington, X.C., and James
Y. Murdock, K.C., while the Canadian Pacifie
is represented by Sir Edward Beatty, President,
and two other directors, who at different times
have been W. N. Black, and W. N. Tilley,
K.C., or Ross H. MeMaster. Only this joint
executive committee deals with co-operative
proposals that are recommended. They have

of each railway, and if they involve abandonments they also require final approval and
authority of the Board of Railway Conmissioners.
The Senate could call these experts before
one of its committees and ask them to explain
what they have done, what they are doing
and what they expect to do. On maps that
were filed by the two companies with the
Duff Commission they could show us projected
abandonments.
These maps are no longer
secret. since they have to be presentedpiecemeal, it is true-before the Railway
Board when an application is made to have
an abandonment approved.
If the Senate appointed a committee and it
found any impediment in the way of more
effective co-operation between the railways,
Parliament and the public should be informed.
Perbaps there is a psychological situation
which should be sifted or removed.
If it were made clear that the idea of
amalgamation under any form must be
discarded, and that unified management would
mean amalgamation, perhaps then the present
campaign for amalgamation would come to
an end and the Canadian Pacifie authorities
would devote themselves whole-heartedly to
thorough application of the principles set out
by the Duff Commission and in the Act of
1933, so as to bring them to full fruition.
I feel that when the amalgamation idea is
dropped much more rapid progress will be
forthcoming.

leaders of both parties, when seeking a mandate
from the people, declared their railway policy.
In 1930 Mr. Bennett reached power with the
flamboyant
slogan,
" Competition
ever,
amalgamation never," and this principle was
embodied in the Act of 1933. He did not
recede from that position in the campaign
of 1935. In that campaign Mr. King, likewise,
told the people that the Liberal party stands
for the maintenance of the integrity of the
Canadian National Railways as a publiclyowned and publicly-controlled service.
My honourable friend from Montarville has
cited that part of the press of Canada which
in 1933 supported the views of Sir Edward
Beatty. But the opinions expressed by those
newspapers were not heeded by the party
leaders, Conservative or Liberal. In these
circumstances, if any different policy is to
be formulated for handling the railway
problem, is it not only just and proper that it
should be submitted to the people in due
time? No one, surely, would suggest that the
elected representatives could break faith with
their mandators.

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, there is nothing that so

of to-day presents fewer troubles and complications and a lighter challenge than it did

thought was rather unfair opposition. Now
that I know my honourable friend I can

which I heard from his lips at that time.
Our railway problem of to-day transcends
in every feature, especially its discouraging
and depressing features, anything which it
presented in 1921. There was nothing then
even dreamed of comparable to what faces us
right now. It has got worse every year since;
even in the good years. In a few moments
I shall recite why, as I believe, it is not difficult to assess responsibility for the present
situation.
My honourable friend engages to-day in a
very interesting debate with Sir Edward

MARCH 9, 1938
Beatty by way of answer to the motion of
the honourable senator fromn Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien). When lie ceases debating with Sir Edward Beatty lie debates
with himself, with his own conclusions of
1925, in attempting to show what babes in
the woods the Senate committee members
at that time were. In addition hie pleads
for the continuance of two railway systems
because, in his judgment, there must be coinpetition; yet in the very next breath lie is
showing that the day of competition is gone.
That is flot an answer to this motion.
1 arn glad my honourable friend said what
hie did about the Duif Commission. I do
not know how anyone could have a different
view. If ever there was a commission appointed by Parliament or Government which
was competent for its task, it was that one;
if ever there was a commission free of partisanship as between contending forces in
Canada, it was the Duif Commission; and if
ever a commission did its work intelligently
and thoroughly. that one did. I know it did
flot report in favour of amalgamation. My
belief is that it feit the people of Canada
were flot prepared for that. I do not know
whether they are prepared yet. It reported
in favour of something which it thought was
possible and practicable, and laid down lines
for getting results which it deemed sa essential. In its report the commission recommended as a cardinal principle that the administration. of the National Railways should
be removed fromn governmental influence altogether; should, in fact, be answerable in
future not to Government, but to Parliament. This was the considered opinion of the
Duff Commission, a commission, as my honouraible friend says, composed of the very
best men who could have been selected for
the purpose.
During the following session the report
took the form of legislation under the Canadian National-Canadian Pacific Act, supported
by bath houses of Parliament. This legislation implemented the report to the letter,
from its flrst Uine to its last. As soon as the
best available chairman of the floard could be
chosen lie was appointed by Order in
Council.
After one year and nine months of operation the Government of which my honourable
friend is a member repealed that legislation
in its chief feature, took away the supremacy
of Parliament and restored the supremacy of
Government, and did sa because of, or after,
a statement by its Minister of Railways that
lie was not going to see the National Railways run without the influence of the Goverument, as it might destroy lis political life.

71

To-day the report of the Duif Commission
is in ashes as to its cardinal feature. We
have now a return to governmental operation directly under the Minister of Railways,
and, if my information is within fifty per
cent of being correct, we have a restoration of
political patronage on a scale neyer known
before.
Somne disappointment was expressed as to
the achievement of the one year and nine
months' operation. That is not a long period
and neyer could give a fair trial to any system. Surely a man of the intelligence of
my honourable friend knows that. The cardinal principle of operation free fraim Government influence could not be tested within
that tirne. There could be a returu for only
one complete year. But the principle was
thrown aside. This mucli, thougli, was accomplished: a scale of precipitate indebtedness was reversed. For nine years, according
to the report, in respect of annual obligations, apart en'tirely fromn obligations to the
Government, wc had been running behind
at the rate of $50,000,000 a year, and for
new capital expenditures we had run into
debt to the extent of another $50,000,000.
We did not get rid of all the 650,000,000 deficit
in operation, thougli we got rid of s-ome;
but we did get rid of the whole $50,000,000
for new capital expenditures. The retirements in that year and nine months were
greater than the increased capital investment.
I now assess responsibility for the mire we
are in with respect to our National Railways.
We had nine years of a railway orgy under
Sir Henry Thornton; nine years of a railway
debaucli, during which we went into debt
at a rate exceeding 3100,000,000 a year. Yet
we wonder at our railway problem!
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: And the Canadian
Pacific, too.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Canadian Pacific, plcading by way of excuse, perhaps by way of valid reason, that it had to
follow the example set, had done so and
suffered sanie of the consequences. No wonder
it cannot pay dividends. Possibly it had to
follow; I am not a railway man and do not

acquired roads that were worthless, who built
hotels that have had to be closed for years,
who built boats that had to be tied up at

mercial world, growing in importance and in
consequence, that industry is sure to be
sunk. And the railway industry is not on
the ascent; it is on the road down.
Someone said we cannot possibly have
amalgamation because it would eliminate
competition. I do not know that we can have
amalgamation, but I know we never should
have needed it nor anything similar if we had
taken the right course. However, we need
never fear lack of competition. All railways
to-day have competition, the like of which
they have not known for a hundred years.
Railways in every country have competition.
They know now what competition is. They
are not the commercial aristocrats they were
twenty-five or thirty years ago. They have
now to cater to the public as other business
concerns in competition with one another have
had to cater all through the decades. The
railways have competition of motor trucks and
buses. they have still the old competition of
the lakes, and now they have the la-test competition of air services. The railways will
never lack competition. The lack of it is not
what they are suffering from. They are suffering from a contraction of the business they can
do, owing to the competition to which I have
referred. The National Railway System is
suffering as well from a multiplication of
liabilities because of attachment to Government. The Government in office to-day is the
-Government that did the attaching just two
years agoSome Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: -and the man
chiefly responsible is the Minister of Transport.
Now let me examine the defence made by
my honourable friend opposite. Apparently
the leader of the Government in this House
does not feel we have any very heavy or forbidding railway problem. He is not at all
afraid of it to-day.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the situation to improve.

I should ýlike

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes; I do not
doubt le would like it to improve. I wish
he would tell us what he is doing to improve
it. We have no figures from him. I know
where the system was two years ago: we had
all the figures then. I know at that time we
were running behind somewhat less than
$1,000,000 a week. We had reduced the an-

nual deficit by $2,000,000 or $3.000,000.

With

that reduction the present Minister of Transport proclaimed himself wholly dissatisfied.
He ridiculed such reductions as had been made
in connection with the merchant marine and
other services as detailed by Mr. Fullerton.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

There was a $48,000,000 deficit to be got rid
of, and he was going to amend the Act to
accomplish this. Have we had a report on
how much of that has been got rid of? Up
to last year we had a straight four years of
operation since the Act went into effect in
1933. We had the benefit of the accelerated

business era.
now, but up to 1937 we had had very good
years. I should like to know the operating
results to the end of 1937. The Minister of
Transport was not satisfied with a reduction of
$2.000.000 or so in the annual deficit and the
clear wiping out of all new capital expenditurcs. He was going to get into the saddle
and do things, and do them soon. Has he
done anything under his amending Act? I
cannot get any figures. I do not get any
from the leader of the Government. I have
not heard anything of the results for 1937.
They may be somewhat better. They ought
to Le a great deal better, for 1937 is the best
year we have had since 1928. But I venture
to suggest that when they do come down they
will be a disappointment to this House. I
do not believe they will be satisfactory. I do
believe they will show the great bulk, if not
al, of the deficit of 1935 continued. If that
is not a problem, then I know not how to
measure one.

The honourable senator from Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien), who introduced this
motion, in one of the best speeches I have
heard in either House in many a day, told us
that taxes are the very essence of the difficulties that we hear about from hour to hour
and from day to day. And they are. It is
for that reason we have unemployment. The
load of taxation keeps down the activity of
business; it presses on us so heavily that
business cannot expand; and if business cannot expand it cannot take on more labour.
It is only by expansion of business and production that we can ever reduce the volume
of our unemployment. Taxation is the burden
that prevents that expansion. Only the day
before yesterday I met in the hall of this
building one of the leading men in a great
industry in our province, an industry of first
magnitude, carrying on business in many
countries of the world. I know of no industry
better or more unselfishly managed; I know
of none where labour is happier. He told
me the management were discouraged. They
had given their lives to the expansion of the
enterprise; they had given everything. "But,"
he said, "last year we paid $3 in taxation
for every dollar we could pay our shareholders, and for the three years previous we
paid $300,000 in taxation although our shareI find now the manholders lost $100,000.'

MARCH 9, 1938
agement are buying some small Government
annuities. Their courage for expansion and for
more employment has gone, crushed out of
them by the burden of taxation. And the main
element in this burden of taxes is still our
National Railways. It is a tremendous problem. If we are satisfied with the pace we are
going to-day, well, I know business is not
satisfied, and I know no man out of employment, if he is intelligent, can be satisfied,
for it is one of the causes of his being where
he is to-day.
I come back now to the Senate resolution
of 1925, so frequently referred to by the honourable member from Montarville. I was
not a party to that resolution. I was in the
other House at the time and I think I commented somewhat severely on it there. I
have not changed my views in the interim.
I do not think we ever could operate on the
basis of that resolution. I do not see how
the members of the Senate committee then
thought the railways could operate under it.
The resolution provides that there shall be
joint operation under a board, five of the
members to be selected by one system, five
by the other, and five by those ten. I do not
think it is an unwise suggestion. I think the
suggestion is worth consideration as a method
of securing a unified directorate, if unified
operation is decided on. But the other terrms
of the resolution seerm to me utterly impossible.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: And so was
that one, utterly impracticable.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am not so
certain of that, but I do not intend to discuss
it, for the resolution as a whole could not
possibly be adopted. My honourable friend
opposite was a member of the Senate committee. The resolution provided that the
Canadian Pacifie should be guaranteed an
agreed dividend on its stock. I do not see
how that could have been wisely recommended even in 1925.
The Canadian
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Pacifie was earning ten per cent on its common stock at that time.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Then after
the Canadian Pacifie was paid all interest
on its bonds, presumably on its preferred
stock and also on its common stock, whatever
was left should be applied on a valuation, to
be fixed by the Government, of the Canadian
National. based upon the earning capacity of
the road. I am afraid not very much consideration was given to that resolution. My
honourable friend has become much more
thorough in his findings in the years that

have intervened. Imagine unified operation
with the cream all going to the one system!
If there was anything left after the bonds
and stock of the privately-owned system were
taken care of, the other system would get it.
I do not think my words in the Commons were
at all too strong to apply to a resolution
such as that.
But the main essence of the findings was
that there would have to be unified operation
some day. I must confess I am not sure there
will have to be unified operation. I have
lost a lot of confidence in Government operation from practical experience of it.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
know why it should be so. There is nobody
in the Dominion who should be more disappointed than I am.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is right.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In England
it is possible to have virtually unified operation. There they have a healthy public opinion.
They have four railway systems, it is truc,
but the legislation under which those four
systems oiperate brings about virtual unification as we seek to get it here. I should like to
get by unification something just like what
they have achieved in England.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is right.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But it all
rests upon a certain measure of capacity of
governments to keep away from undue interference.
Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They have
such freedom from interference in England.
We cannot get it in Canada. We struggled
to get it. For that purpose we put a certain
plan into operation, but it was no sooner
in than it was changed by our successors.
Such has been our experience from the very
birth of the problem to this hour. I have
for my part given up hope that you can do
anything so long as you are going to have
these alternate Governments, each smashing
everything done by its predecessor-so long
as you are going to have a return of govern-

ment interference after each election-so long
as you are going to have sectional appeals
to the employees of the railways against a
political party because it would dare even
to consider anything in the nature of unified
management. In England there was never
such care taken of other employees as was
taken of railway employees when its railway
legislation was enacted. Never in any branch

of industry has it been possible to show rr re

74

SENATE

concern for the workers. The Government
took care that, no matter what happened,
no employee should suffer. Whether his position was changed or he was reduced in salary,
he got compensation.
In every phase of
the settlement the first man looked after was
the employee. Nevertheless the four great
railway systems have made gains and savings
amounting to millions of pounds. As a result
of the legislation the hundreds of railways
were saved from bankruptcy, with losses
which would have run into millions of pounds.
Those railways have been put on a paying
basis with a good return to their shareholders. That has not been done at the
expense of labour, for the employees have
been protected at every stage. We could do
something similar in Canada if we had the
same healthiness of public opinion and the
same character of political appeal that they
have in the old land; but we have not. If we
continue the way we are doing now we shall
come to something worse than unificationto something such as other countries and some
of our provinces have come to. We cannot
continue on this path.
I appeal to my honourable friend to join
me in this. I hope the Senate will abandon
the findings of 1925 and address itself again
to the task of finding something practical and
applicable, and which at least will help. I am
not going to try to drive the Government
into something which it is afraid will defeat it.
In my heart of hearts I do not believe there
is any reason in the world why it has resisted
unification but fear of defeat. That would
affect any Government. There is none so
virtuous as to be prepared to accept defeat
as the price of service. But surely we can
do something to improve what exists ·o-day.
t
If the returns for 1937 are up to the expectations which were advanced two years ago,
very well; but I am certain they will disappoint us. If we get the same sad story,
surely we can do something to help pave the
way so that next session we can place on the
Statute Book a law which will be an improvement on the present position.
You ask me if I am in favour of unification.
I should like to think public opinion was such
that it could be done, and after it was donc
there would not be those selfish, vile appeals
to class prejudice which always seem to follow in Canada. If we had reasonable appeals
and reasonable statements of fact at election
time, there is not an employee of the National
Railways or any other railway who would
have any fear of unification. But I know we
shall not have reasonable appeals, and I can
see grave danger in the direction of unification when that unification is to be accomRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

panied by a tremendous organization as an
engine to defeat and destroy a political party.
It should not be so, but it will be in Canada.
I ask my honourable friend to bring down
at the earliest date the returns of actual
resuIts for the past year and, if he can, the
results of this year-which will be a great
deal worse. My honourable friend says we
are moving out of the depression. The last
time those words could have been used was six
months ago. Since then we have been moving
back down the disastrous trail. The unemployment figures given are six months old,
or older than that. If we had figures up to
date we should sec no bright star, and we
shall not see any, either in this country or in a
country near us, until some assurance is given
that a ýperson can expand his business without
being regarded as a public enemy.
But my point is this. We must not think
things are all right because employment returns
were getting better seven or eight months ago.
The problem is a big one, it is right on our
backs, and it will not be overcome as soon as
a committee of this House is appointed, even
though that committee may do its utmost to
improve the situation.
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators,
after the brilliant speeches made by the two
leaders of this House, I do not intend to
venture any very extended remarks on the
railway question. It is admitted by everybody that this is an extremely serious question, one which affects the whole economic
life of Canada, and that unless some relief
can be obtained from taxation we are headed,
as has been said by the right honourable
leader on this side (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen),
in the same direction as some of our provinces have gone. We are coming to the
point where the whole financial structure of
Canada will be in the mud. In other words,
if we continue our process of creating debt
we shall have to go into bankruptcy.
The remarks of the honourable leader of
the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) led me
to believe that he would like to sec this
whole question considered more fully by the
Senate, possibly in committee. In 1925,
thirteen years ago, we had a special committee on the subject of railways. The committee sat behind closed doors, and the evidence taken was not published. The information obtained was extremely valuable, and
its use in successive years would have done
much to prevent the enormous railway debt
which has been accumulated.
I gathered
from the remarks of the honourable leader
opposite that he would welcome something
in the nature of an investigation which might

MARCH 9, 19387
lead us to recomrnend, flot amalgamation,
not unification, but sorne method of joint
management whereby this enormous annual
deficit could be gradually reduced.
Bonourable members of this Chamber do
not believe that by one immediate act we can
cut off $60,000.000 or $75,000,000 of expenditure, but we do believe that over a period
of years it can ho done. That sueb a thing
was possible was very clearly set forth before
the committee in 1925 by the beads of botb
the railways, and by otber experts on traffic
problems, who rnentioned definite amounts
wbich could be saved. I do not believe that
any committee of tbis Bouse whicb conducts
its investigations along party lines will get
anywbere, but it seerns to nie that this railway problem is one question whicb is large
enoiigh to bring botb parties in this country
together. From wbat I bave observed of the

believe that tbey may be able to recommend
to the Governrnent some solution of this railway problem wbicha would bring about the
salvation of tbe country.
The right bonourable the leader on this
side of the Bouse (Rigbt Bon. Mr. Meighen)
stressed very strongly, and properiy so, the
situation wbicha confronted Great Britain and
the solution that was reached. Be particuiarly
called attention to a most important fact,
nameiy, that not one railway employee in
that country, from the bighest to the lowest,
suffered by the conversion of about one
hundred lines into four lines. It is true that
that sort of tbing cannot be done in a year,
or in two or tbree years. Througb process

In this business we find that tbere is an

the surplus will be very quickly eliminated.
I do flot think it would take more than three,
or at the most four years, to provide for al
ernployees who migbt at first be superfluous
if the railways were organized in such a way
as to eliminate duplication of employment.
It would be necessary to take care of the
ernployees eliminated during those tbree or
four years. The means of doing that bas been
well demonstrated in Great Britain.
I arn going to suggest for the consideration
of this House the advisability of appointing
a special committee to consider this railway
problem-a committee which will have power

and which, if it is unable to report this year,

the subject before them impartial and thorougb consideration, who will entirely disregard ail party benefit or party injury, and
whose only concern will he the reduction of
taxation and debt, the improvernent of our
economie situation, and the welfare of Canada.
With that end in view, I su'bmit to this Bouse
the following amend.ment:
That ail the words after "That" in the first
line of the resolution proposed by the honourable senator f rom Montarville be stricken out,
and that there be substituted therefor the
words- "a committee of the Senate be appointed
to inquire into and report upon the best means
to relieve the country f romn the extremely
serions railway expenditure, with power to
send for persons, papers and records."
In moving this resolution I do not like to
take upon myseif the responsibility of even
suggesting who should be the members of the
comrnittee. If such a committee is to be
formed-and I hope it will he, because I be.

An amendment

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I am not taking
exception to the amendment.
I am just
asking the question.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
I do not
know of any reason why this motion is not
amendable, like any other.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

It is a resolution.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
May I ask
a question? Is it not a mistake to confine
the inquiry to expenditure?
As a matter
of fact, the size of the expenditure might not
be a serious matter. If the business of the
railways increased, the expenditure also would
of necessity have to be increased from a
business standpoint. I think the wording of
the resolution should be carefully looked into.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would suggest
that the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr.
Black) postpone his amendnent till the next
sitting, so that we may sec what form is best
to cover what he intends to cover.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I have no objection
whatever to that suggestion. The amendment
was drawn in such a way as to make it as
brief and as broad as possible. The word
' expenditure " certainly covers the expenditurc of the railway. However, with the leave
of my seconder, I am quite ready to have this
regarded as a notice that I propose to move
an amendment at the next sitting. Then we
shall have time to consider more carefully
the wording of the amendment.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The amendment is in exactly the same words as the
motion of Honourable Senator David in 1925,
with the single exception that the adjective
before the word "expenditure" is "extremely
serious " instead of " ruinous"' This is a
great tribute to the moderation of my
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Black).
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should like to
examine into the form of the amendment,
because I think the committee, in order to
carry out the wish expressed by Parliament
in the Act of 1933, might well inquire into
what is going on. I am not quite sure the
amendment as proposed would cover that.
If my honourable friend will simply treat this
as a notice of motion we shall have time ta
consider the extent of the mandate to be
given to the committee.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Hon. Mr. BLACK: I shall be very glad
to d.o what has been suggested, because unless
we have harmony in our end-eavour to secure
an inquiry we shall not get anywhere with
the inquiry itself.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Has the honourable member (Hon. Mr. Black) leave to

The proposed amendment was withdrawn.

of the debate until Tuesday next.

Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are proceeded with, I wish to call the attention of
the committee that deals with public printing
and stationery, or of the chairman of that
committee, to the fact that the mucilage on
the flaps of the envelopes supplied to us is of
so very poor a quality that there is great
difficulty in getting the envelopes to stick.
This is particularly true of the larger sizes.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Use fish glue.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: This is a complaint I
have often heard in another place and here,
but there does not seem to be much improvement. The stationery appears to be inferior
ta that which is purchasable in the retail stores,
and I suppose a good price is paid for it.
Hon. G. V. WHITE: Honourable senators,
I will endeavour to see that there is a better
sticker put on the envelopes.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I have experienced
the same difficulty as the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Hughes). When I mentioned
it I was told that if I would exercise a little
patience after the sticker was moistened I
would find no trouble at all.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I have exercised a
good deal of patience.
OPIUM

AND

NARCOTIC

DRUG BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second read.
ing of Bill 24, an Act to amend the Opium
and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929.
He said: Honourable senators, may I be
permitted ta make a few remarks in regard
ta the proposed amendments to the Opium
and Nareotic Drug Act? There have been
no amendments ta this Act since 1932, but in
the interval a convention has been concluded
at Geneva by representatives of some thirtyodd world powers who met there ta consider
means of bringing about uniformity in legislation for further controlling international
traffic in narcotics and dangerous drugs.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: In what year
was that done?
Hon. Mr. KING: In 1936. Canada was
represented by Colonel Sharman, of the Department of Pensions and National Health,
the chief officer dealing with the administration of this Act. The convention suggested
severe penalties, including imprisonment, for

77

certain specifie offences in relation to illicit
traffic in narcotics. Some of .these, such as
conspiracy, are already covered by our
Criminal Code, and others have for years
been covered by the present Act. It is the
Department's desire that other recommendations contained in the convention be now
incorporated in the Act. After careful study
by the Department, in conjunction with the
Department of Justice, it has been deemed
advisable to amend our narcotie law so that
we may have legislation similar to that which
will obtain in other countries subscribing to
the convention. Our Act has been found
effective in the domestic field, but illicit traffic
in narcoties is essentially international, and,
if it is to be successfully coped with, international co-operation is required.
Canada has at times been a favourite
country for persons illegally selling dangerous
drugs. It is believed that if we tighten up
our laws and make them conform with those
of other subscribing countries we shall probably be able to rid ourselves of certain undesirable activities that have gone on hitherto.
When I was Minister of the Department of
Health, some years ago, we were able ta
uncover an international drug ring in the
city of Montreal, which was operated from
there in a fairly successful attempt ta supply
the neighbouring republic. We broke up
the ring, and persons connected with it were
imprisoned.
The convention provides facilities for extraditing persons connected with illicit drug
traffic. We should benefit greatly by cooperating with other countries in this respect.
Canada has always maintained at the League
of Nations that she was not interested in
the production or manufacture of narcotic
drugs. Our present law applies to imports
and distribution, and it has been fairly effective. But within the last year or two it has
been found that we are producers to some
extent. for the opium poppy plant has been
successfully grown in British Columbia, and
from it has been made a potion of very strong
narcotic properties. The Department was
able to make a seizure in some cases and
secure convictions. This Bill empowers the
Minister ta control by licence not only the
production of opium, but also of another
drug, known as Cannabis Sativa, which,
though a new product here, has been known
for centuries in the Orient. Within the last
few years the authorities in the United States
have realized that this drug is being used
extensively by the younger people. Cigarettes
are manufactured from the leaf of Cannabis
Sativa, commonly known as a hemp product,
and sold to pupils in high schools and to

78

SENATE

the young people at dance parties, and so
on. It is a rather interesting story, and I
would refer honourable members to an article
in the American Magazine of July, 1937. There
they will find a full account of the increasing
use of the drug in the United States and this
country. The writer states the police records
indicate that the smoking of cigarettes made
from Cannabis Sativa leaf has been the cause
of many sex crimes, murders, robberies, and
other crimes. We had not been much affected
until about a year or su ago, when inquiries
by the Department disclosed that increasing
quantities of the leaf were being brought in.
The plant is a common weed in certain parts
of Canada, and during the War an effort was
made to grow it for its fibre.
The Bill empowers the Minister to license
the growing of hemp, which is the common
term for the plant. Is is suggested by our
departmental officiais that this will enable us
to exercise control, as refusal to grant a
licence will be equivalent to prohibition. It
may be asked: Why not prohibit its growth
altogether? In reply, I may say that in certain
parts of Canada hemp is grown for its fibre,
though only in a small way. The fibre is
used in the manufacture of twine and other
fine cords; it does not enter into rope-making.
I think there would be no special advantage
in allowing opium poppies to be grown, and if
the cultivating of hemp is to be permitted it
must be done under very strict supervision, as
proposed by the Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I draw the
honourable gentleman's attention to the fact
that the Bill provides for licensing opium
poppy.
Hon. Mr. KING: It does so provide.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Why?
Hon. Mr. KING: The point was discussed
in the other House, and the Minister stated
that the licence requirement would give the
Department a measure of control not possible
under straiglit prohibition. It is the purpose
of the Bill that those who wish to engage in
the cultivation or production of opium poppy,
or Cannabis Sativa, must first secure a licence
to do su. The Minister is given discretionary
power to withhold the granting of such licence;
which, of course, would mean prohibition.
In the United States the Federal Government bas recently secured legislation to license
the growing of hemp, or Cannabis Sativa, and
so control its production. In that country
hemp is cultivated on a fairly large scale.
Within the last year the federal authorities
have seized and confiscated unlicensed crops.
lion. Mr. King.

Occasion may arise to justify the granting
of licences for the cultivation of hemp. Only
last year the Department of Agriculture cultivated hemp at the Experimental Farm to
test its fibre.
I will give a brief résumé of the suggested
amendments.
The first amendment is administrative and
deals with production.
The second covers three specific offences
mentioned in the convention, namely, the delivery, offering, and offering for sale of narcotics.
The convention contains nineteen
recommendations; sixteen are already covered
in our legislation.
The third amendment prohibits unlicensed
cultivation.
The fourth amendment brings Part I and
Part II of the narcotic schedule within the section.
The fifth, the amendment to section 17, deals
with opium pipes and opium-smoking parapher.
nalia, and provides that the occupier of any
premises where the paraphernalia is found
must satisfy the court that they were there
without his knowledge, or that he was fully
entitled
to
possess them.
Occasionally
museums or persons who have travelled in
the Far East possess such paraphernalia, and
they apply to the Minister for permission to
retain possession.
The sixth amendment, dealing with section
24, is purely administrative. The schedule is
divided into two parts. As the Act now stands,
the Governor in Council may add to the drugs
thereby affected, but legislation is requisite to
move a drug from Part I to Part II, or vice
versa, or to remove a drug from the schedule.
We are under obligation to keep our schedule
in line with the recommendation of the Health
Committee of the League of Nations. It is
considered that should it be necessary to move
a drug from Part II to Part I in keeping our
legislation up to date, authority for such action
might well be conferred on the Governor in
Council.
The seventh amendment relates to section
27 and is designed to have sections 6, 10 and
16 of the present Act applied to drugs in
Part II of the schedule.
The three remaining amendments refer to
the schedule itself.
Before resuming my seat, I should like to
commend the officiais of the Department who
are carrying on this work. Perusal of the
annual reports will show that we have a very
thorough administration of our Act. In this
connection a few figures are significant. In
1919 we imported 12,333 ounces of cocaine: in
1928 that importation had been reduced to
2,967 ounces, and in 1936 to 1,103 ounces. Of

MARCH 10, 1938
course, I am speaking only of legitimate importations. As to morphine, in 1919 our imports were 30,087 ounces: in 1928 we imported
6,926 ounces, and in 1936 only 5,081 ounces.
With respect to crude opium, in 1919 we
imported 34,262 pounds: in 1928 the quantity
was reduced to 970 pounds, and in 1936 to
485 pounds. From these figures honourable
members will realize how active the Department has been in controlling legitimate traffic
in these dangerous drugs.
During 1936 and 1937 the Department made
several large seizures of morphine in Vancouver. This drug, originating in the Far East,
is smuggled into Pacifie Coast cities of the
United States and Canada. The seizures
seemed to have very seriously inconvenienced
those who were using illicit supplies, and it was
found inmmedia.tely afterwards that the importation of prepared opium came into effect in
very large measure. A seizure was made in
New Westminster of 550 tins of opium. A tin
contains approximately seven and a half
ounces.
I think it only fair to state that the Canadian Pacifie Steamship Company bas been
very helpful to the officers of the Department
in frustrating this illicit traffic. It is carried
on by seamen or other persons employed by
those engaged in the trade. The Canadian
Pacifie Steamship Company bas, at its own
expense, taken every possible precaution to
prevent this illicit traffic on its ships. The
company's very effective co-operation was
recognized at a recent meeting of the Opium
Advisory Committee at Geneva, and the delegate of another country stated:
The Canadian Pacifie Steamship Company
unquestionably maintains the best system of
preventive measures known. The company
spends a great deal of money yearly to prevent
smuggling of narcoties by its ships. All its
vessels are free from contact by unauthorized
craft in the Far East. It is the opinion of
expert observers that the Canadian Pacifie
systern could well be taken as the measuringrod to be maintaineli by every steamship
company.
As I have already stated, if illicit drug
traffic is to be successfully combated, similar
preventive legislation must be enacted by the
various countries participating in the international convention. I am pleased to say that
the officers of the Narcoties Division of the
Department have received full co-operation
from the United States authorities, and I think
the officers who control this traffic in both
countries are to be commended for the very
fine work they are doing.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I observe there bas been a
diminution in the legitimate importations of

morphine and opium, but as I listened to the
figures I wondered if the diminution had not
been mainly due to the fact that substitutes
for those two drugs, such as codeine, are
proving more popular. I notice they appea
frequently in police court reports in the press
while morphine and opium are never heard of
If the Minister or officers of the Departmeni
can give it to us, I should like to have some
information as to illegitimate importation,
and as to the extent of the drug habit in
this country. From a reading of the press one
would conclude-perhaps wrongly-that in
earlier years, if the drug habit was contracted,
it was almost always by members of the
medical profession, druggists or other persons
who had been in contact with drugs by reason
of their having been prescribed in cases of
illness, but in later years the main area of
the habit bas been among young people whose
morale bas not been taken care of and who
have come into contact with drug-runners.
Furthermore, it would seem that a large
proportion of those who appear in our courts
charged with crimes have acquired the habit,
and that many of them owe their criminal
propensities to it. I wonder whether the
Department bas any dependable information,
first, as to the degree to which the habit is
extending, or contracting-I should be
delighted to hear that it is contracting, but I
am afraid it is not; and, second, as to how
far, according to the judgment of our police
and law officials, the major crimes of our
country are due to the impulsion of the drug
habit.
I am glad the honourable member (Hon.
Mr. King) commended the officers of the
Department. I have never been in that
Department, but I have had reason to have
contact with it, and this would lead me to
believe the officers are efficient. Besides, I
have a great deal of confidence in the Minister
himself.
No effort could be too great, even if it
involved expense, which would sweep this
evil from the country. I have read the debate
in the other House. I would go further than
the Minister bas gone in relation to the
growth in this country of a plant, such as the
opium poppy, which bas no other worth-while
commercial use than as the ingredient of a
drug. I would provide not only that it should
not be cultivated, but that anyone knowing
of it should uproot it and destroy it, or, at
least, that he should bring it to the attention
of the authorities. To legislate that such a
plant may be grown by licence is to give it a
kind of semi-respectability. As to hemp
production it may be necessary, because of
farmers having worked up a certain measure
of business, to permit licensing for a time

80

until it is reduced and eliminated; but in the
case of the opium poppy this is flot necessary.
I arn sorry if it is necessary in the first case,
for there is great danger in it, particularly
after the puhlicity that has been given in
the press. I ar n ot complaining of the
publicity, which unavoidably originates in
Parliarnent, but I arn afraid that the possible
use of this plant, which grows so rank in
Western Canada, wili become known and that
the curiosity of the young will impel them
to experiment with it. I shouId like to see
the ban as prohibitive as possible, and the
penalties as stiff as they can be made. until
this curse is eliminated for good and ail.

As to bemp, or Cannabis Sativa, I tbink the
Minister feit that the granting of a licence
would bring out into the open those people
who might desire to grow the plant, and that
a neighbour or some other individual in the
community wouid ask, "Have you a licence?"
and could hring the matter to the attention
of the Government. I amn afraid that if you
mcrcly put on a prohibition people will be
stimuiatcd to break it, and the resuit may be
just what bas been accomplishe.d by prohibition in other fields.
At ail events. that
seemcd to be the thought of the Minister,
and I would suggcst that we accept tbe Bill
as it is in that regard.

Hon. Mr. KING: Wbat my right honourable friend has said about codeine is unfortunately truc.
The difficulty of seduring
morphine bas brought about a swing to the
codoine preparati ons, and statistics prepared
by the League of Nations showcd that Canada
was the iargest codeine consumer per capita
in the worid.
The Department bas taken
steps to rectify this situation by bringing it
under the Act so that it may be deait witb in
thc administration in the same way as some
other drugs. Representations have also been
made t.o the pharmaceu-tical associations
throughout, Canada, and to the provincial governiments. Some provincial government-s, I
belie%,e, have passed enactments permitting the
sale of codeine in retail drug stores only on
medical prescription, wbile we have a federal
requirement that not more than one ounce of
codeine monthly shal 'be supplied to retail
drug stores, and that sales must be re.ported.
Since this action was taken the consumption
of codeine bas been reduced, and I have no
doubt there wili bac a further marked reduetion. However, as my right bonourable friend
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) bas said, there
bas been a swing from morphine to codeine.
Codeine and morphine are both very useful
drugs. Codeine is now prescrihed 'by physicians
rather than morphine. I think the medicai
profession to-day realizes, as it did not do
some 25, 30 or 40 years ago, when I was a
student, the danger of prescrihing morphine.
It is hopcd that this legislation wiil make
possible a greater measure of control of the
internai trade in codeine.
I have rcad the Minister's remarks in regard
to licensing. I think bis -position is that the
opium poppy is the source of very important
deriv:atives produced or developed in certain
countries, and which are very necessary to
the buman race. In those countries tbey are
producedi under a lîcensing system. I do not
tbink we in Canada shahl ever prodýuce them
commercially.

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bihl 32, an Act to amcnd

He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this Bill is to extend the Jurisdiction of the

contiguous to those cities, and whicb desire
to do so, may come under the Act.

the absence of both the senior member (Hon.
Mr. MeMeans) and the junior memnber (Hon.
Mr. Haig) fromn Winnipeg. I do not desire to

MARCU 10, 1938
cast any reflection on the maritime importance
of Manitoba, but I must admit that this is
the first time I have heard there was a barbour there. Is there anyone present in the
House who can explain what this barbour
commission does? I have read the Bill and
the discussion upon. it in another place, and
I do flot know. Everybody knows that
there are no boats calling at Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I understand
that there is considerable dredging going on
and that the board is becoming more and
more important. I believe that in the circumstances the neighbouring municipalities
would like te obtain the advantages that will
accrue to th-em if they form part of the port.
If we passcd second readîng now we could
take the Bill up in committee on Tuesday next,
when the honourable members from Winnipeg
would likely be present.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Everyone
would pro.bably think me a traitor to the
province of Manitoba if I questioned this
Bill, but 1 have flot seen a boat on those
rivers out there since 1898. Is the Government dredging in the hope of establishing
a maritime trade in Winnipeg?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do flot know.
I had an impression that it was my right
honourable friend's (lovernment whioh had
started dredging there. However,' I shahl
know more about it by Tuesday.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Government my honourable friend refers to must
have been in office a long time back, before
the days of modern dredging. No dredging
was done there while I was in office.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable members,
I think this Bill had better be given second
reading and sent to committee as soon as
possible. Like my right honourable friend
(Right Hon. Mr. Meigben), I neyver heard
of boats of any consequence plying around
the city of Winnipeg or St. Boniface, though
I have known. the Red river and the river
that runs into it nearby for something like
forty-five years. How anyone could conceive of establishing a harbour there Icannot
understand. If the measure is sent to cernmittee we may be able to have it explained.
Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, I
remember very well that some years ago Honý.
Robert Rogers came to my office and told
me it was necessary to have piers or docks
built near Winnipeg in order to facilitate transportation of sand and gravel required in that
City.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That may be
the explanation. I did not think of that.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: But surely a board
of harbour commissioners would not be
required, if there were no more shipping
than that.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

in this matter.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It seems te
me that the Bill could be dealt with appropiately in Committee of the Whole. I think
I understand the situation now, since the

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK moved the second

He said: Honourable senators, the honourible gentleman from Victoria (Hon. Mr.
robin) asked me to move second reading of
this Bill to-day, in his absence. I understand
the purpose of the measure is to clarify the
jurisdiction of the Board of Railway Commissioners in connection with base-rate areas
or exchange areas and telephone tolls and
services applicable thereto. The amendment
is said to be necessitated by the decision of
the Board in the case of Quebec-Montmorency
Chamber of Commerce v. Bell Telephone Co.
(Canadian Railway Cases, Vol. XLVI, Part
2, page 203). I take it that the Board has
jurisdiction to in'vestigate telephone rates in
certain instances, but it asserted it did not
have authority to deal with matters that
arose in the Quebec-Montmorency case. The
object here is to give the Board power in all
such cases. It seems to me that there are
quetions involved which should be discussed
in the Railway Committee before the Bill
is finally adopted.

WINNIPEG AND ST. BONIFACE HARBOUR COMMISSIONERS BILL
CONSIDERED

IN
COMMITTEE-PROGRESS
REPORTED

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill No. 32,
an Act to amend The Winnipeg and St.
Boniface Harbour Commissioners Act.
Hon. Mr. Donnelly in the Chair.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: As I have
not yet received a memorandum on the Bill,
perhaps I might cite the explanation given
when it was introduced in the other House.
Thait explanation reads:
The purpose of this Bill is to extend the
jurisdiction of the Winnipeg and St. Boniface
Harbour Commissioners to the waters and
municipalities contiguous to the cities of Winni-

peg and St. Boniface, whieh desire to be brought
under the Act. The harbour hîmits now include
the Red river within the boundaries of Winnipeg on the one side, and St. Boniface on the
other. The municipality of East Kildonan has
requested that the portion of the river fronting
that municipality should be included.
It is

also probable that Kildonan West, Fort Garry
and St. Vital will make similar applications.
With the completion of the sewage system for
Winnipeg it is expected that the Red river
will be used more extensively by pleasure boats,
and for that reason the city has asked the
Government to introduce this Bill to extend
the boundaries of the harbour commission.
If these municipalities decide te come in,

each coucil will have the privilege of appointing one member to the Board.

MARCH 15, 1938
On section 1-municipality:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Mr. Chairman, can the Minister tell us who are the
present members of the commission, what, if
any, remuneration they get, and what, if anything, týhey do?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have sent for
the statute constituting the commission. It
was enacted in 1912.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The commissioners cannot have had very much to
do,'
since there lias been scarcely any navigation
on the river.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: They expect to
have pleasure boats plying on the river wlien
a sewage system, now in course of construction, is completed.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I think we
ought to ascertain whether any public money
is being expended. I arn not sayîng this in
criticismn particularly. I see the Bill was
passed in 1912.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It was your
child.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: No. It was
hefore my natal day, politically. I did not
arrive on the governmental scene until 1913.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Pre-natal.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: I do not
know what the commissioners of ithe harbour
of Winnipeg can find to do.
Hon. Mr. DAN'DUI{AND: I wonder, too.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: May I be permitted to explain?
A lock was built at
considerable cost to the country to enable
fish, stone, lum-ber and sand to ibe 'brought
from Lake Winnipeg up the Red river to the
city of Winnipeg. It must ýbe borne in mind
that within thirty miles of Winnipeg we have
one of the largest lakes on the continent. I
think the Government spent a good deal of
money on the canal. It was made a political
issue by the then local member, who threatened
to resign lis seat if the work was not undertaken.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Who was the
member?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Mr. Boyle. I remember lie got a good deal of publicity at the time.*
The canal was formally opened by Sir Wilfrid
Laurier, who was brouglit up the river in a
steamboat. We had a very good time on that
occasion.
Riglit Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I noticed that.
I was there.
5i95"-8

83

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: There are wliarves
built here and there along the banks of the
river. Steamboats used to ply between Winnipeg and the larger resorts on tlie lake.
TJndoubtedly the canal was of considerable
benefit to the whole district as a means of
control during flood time. These liarbour
commissioners look after the protection of
the river banks, the wliarves, and so on.
There are four or five swing bridges across
the river. In the old days the boats travelling up or down the river would toot their
whistles and the bridges would be swung open
to ]et them pass. Now there is a beautiful
bridge which is used by hundreds of people.
To-day, with railroads on either side of the
river, a good deal of the water-borne traffie
has gone, and during the winter months, of
course, tliere is none at all. Nevertheless,
this is a matter of importance to the city
of Winnipeg. This year there lias been a
tremendous amounit of snow in the surrounding country, and when the floods come there
lias to be drainage. The Red is a miglity big
river. In the old days people used to empty
their refuse into the river and pollute its
waters. It was to prevent this, amongst
other things, I understand, that the harbour
commissioners were appointed. I may not
be very exact as to the details of this matter,
but I arn familiar with the general prîncipie.
Hon. Mr. CASGHAIN: May I ask the
honourable gentleman what the dues would
amounit to on these wharves lie speaks of?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Will the honourable gentleman ask me something easy?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
Canais are obsolete. Years ago I was guilty of preaching
the doctrine of the Georgian Bay Canal. At
that time there was only one man in this
House, tlie late Senator Edwards, who seemed
to lie strongly opposed to it. He said that
a slip could go around by way of the lakes
in mucli less time than it would take for
it to pass througli the Georgian Bay Canal.
But in this case, even supposing there were
sorne trade, the canal would lie open only
seven montlis of the year; then it would have
to discontinue business for the five months
wlien it would lie frozen over. No railroad
could live on only five months' receipts each
year and pay its bond interest. We do not
want to go back to the stage-coach days. I
think that most canaIs are now absolutely
obsolete.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL:

Hon. Mr. MACDONELL:
you it is obsolete.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: I should not think
so. I have never heard of any harbour commissioners at Ottawa, and there must be
ten times as much traffic on the Ottawa river
as there can possibly be in the neighbourhood of Winnipeg. So I say that before we
pass this Bill we should have some definite
information as to what we are doing.

According to

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The Suez canal
is open twelve months of the year.
On the Red river
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
there is a lock to enable boats to get over
the rapids.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: I cannot understand
why the work referred to by the honourable
the senior member from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
McMeans) has to be looked after by a board
of harbour commissioners. I have not the
slightest objection to the work that is being
done, but it would seem to me that a small
canal and the banks of a river are matters
that might be attended to by the Department of Public Works. Why there should
be a board of harbour commissioners to look
after that area is more than I can understand.
I do not think this is a serious question.
Nevertheless, it is before Parliament. I dare
say this board was created at a time when we
did many things that should not have been
done, and if there is no real necessity for it
we should be aware of that fact. If money
can be saved in any way, we should endeavour to save it. What we should know,
I think. is briefly this. First, is there a harbour
that does business in the ordinary sense in
which a harbour does business? If so, what
are the nature and the extent of that business? Second, who are the harbour commissioners? For what length of time are they
What salaries do they get?
appointed?
What are their expenses? In other words.
how much does it cost to run that sort of
thing? I think we should have that information before we pass this Bill. I do not know
how we shall get the information except by
having one of the officers of the department
before us or by sending the Bill to the select
committee. As I say, I am not opposed to the
Bill at the present time, for I do not know
anything about it. I know a good deal about
Western Canada, but I never heard about these
harbour commissioners before. It may be
necessary to have someone to do certain
work there, but we do not know what it is.
My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. McMeans)
speaks about the amount of traffic that goes
through the canal.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Locks.

Are there not?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I draw the attention of my honourable friend to the fact that
all we can do with this Bill is adopt it or
reject it. It is simply an enabling Bill to
extend the jurisdiction of that port. To my
surprise, when I look at 2 George V, Chapter
55, assented to on the lst of April, 1912, I
find that considerable attention must have
been devoted to .the organizing of this commission. The Act says, in part:
The Corporation shall consist of five commissioners, three of whom shall be appointed
by by-law of the council of the city of Winnipeg
and two by by-law of the couneil of the city
of St. Boniface.

The Bill sets out the powers of the corporation to acquire property required for the barbour, fixes its borrowing powers, and so on.
However, as my honourable friends from

DIVORCE AND MATRIMONIAL CAUSES
BILL
MOTION FOR SEOOND READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

Hon. L. MeMEANS
ing of Bill B, an Act
Matrimonial Causes.
He said: Honourable
siderable regret that

moved the second readrespecting Divorce and
members, it is with conI find myself in the

MARCH 15, 1938
position of moving the second reading of this
Bill. I feel that some more competent member of this House should have the Bill in his
charge. I am consoled, however, by the fact
that my defects will be made up for by those
who follow me.
It is usual on moving the second reading of
a bill to outline its purposes. This Bill is an
adaptation of the Act passed by the British
House of Commons during the year 1937.
That Act was introduced by Colonel Herbert,
the writer of the book "Holy Deadlock," who
in it brought the attention of the people of
England to the condition of the divorce laws
of that country at that time. The preamble

to the English Act explains the Act itself. It
reads as follows:
An Act to amend the law relating to marriage
and divorce.
Whereas it is expedient for the true support
of marriage, the protection of children, the
removal of hardship, the reduction of illicit
unions and unseemly litigation, the relief of
conscience among the clergy, and the restoration
of due respect for the law, that the Acts
relating to marriage and divorce be amended.
This Bill was introduced in the Senate last
Tuesday. Two days later, on Thursday, the
Winnipeg Free Press, which we all know is
one of the leading newspapers in Canada,
published the following editorial:
There are very sufficient reasons why the
rigidity of the divorce law should be relaxed
in Canada as it was last year in Great Britain,
the situations in the two countries being largely
similar. It is a subject on which there is, of
course, great difference of opinion, and it is
important that, in the discussion of the Bill
introduced by Senator McMeans, there should
be calm consideration of the whole situation.
At present, divorce can be granted only for
adultery or the committing of unnatural offence.
There are many Canadians who believe there
are other valid grounds that should be recognized and that more harm than good resuIts
from not doing so.
The importance of the home as the basis of
our national life and the consequent need of
preserving the marriage bond as inviolate as
possible, may be fully conceded. There is no
intention of loosening that tie beyond the
requirements of sound and necessary consideration. To do so would be to seriously increase
many of our social problems closely related to
family life. But entirely unreasonable and
unwholesome conditions are resulting from the
refusal to grant divorce except for practically
only one cause.
If a worthless husband deserts his wife and
goes off to the United States and lives there
permanently, she is condemned under the
present law to a life of loneliness for the rest
of ber days. The same thing results if either
husband or wife becomes incurably insane.
Because one life has been fatally blighted,
should the other be sacrificed to an undue
degree?
If a sailor is missing and never
returns, must his wife be denied a normal
life? If a brutal husband is persistently cruel,

must the wife endure it with no hope of release?
If there is no natural affection, is there a home
worth preserving?
I have no desire to attempt a lengthy
historical review of the divorce law in England. Prior to the year 1857 it was almost
impossible for anyone but a wealthy person
to get a divorce in the United Kingdom. First
of all, it was neoessary to make application to
the ecclesiastical courts, which had sole control, and if the applicant was successful there
in getting a divorce a mensa et toro-meaning
from bed and board-it was necessary then
to take action in the superior courts, sue the
seducer in a claim for damages, and get
judgment there. The final step was the filing
of a petition in the House of Lords. Such
was the only procedure for obtaining divorce
up to the year 1857.
In 1857 the British Parliament passed the
Matrimonial Causes Act. Under that statute
adultery was the only ground for divorce, but
even if it was proved against ber husband,
a woman could not succeed in an application
unless she showed the adultery had been
accompanied by cruelty. The courts held that
to prove cruelty in a divorce action it was
necessary to establish that the woman was in
danger of losing her life or limbs, or that
ber mental suffering was so severe as to
endanger ber life.
That law remained
unchanged for eighty years, except for one
amendment, which I think was made in 1932
and was not very important. Under this
amendment women were given the right to
apply for divorce on the same ground as men.
There had been some minor changes with
regard to procedure in the courts and lowering
of costs. Otherwise the law passed in 1857
remained in effect until last year.
In 1908 the English people were somewhat
concerned about the divorce question and the
Government appointed a royal commission
composed of men of the highest standing in
the land. That commission sat for three
years and took evidence from leading persons
in the country---scientists, clergymen, professional men, ex attorneys-general, and so onand presented a voluminous report in 1912.
I need not read from that report, for it is
readily available to anyone interested, but I
might say that it recommended a change in
the law. It was suggested that four additional
grounds should be recognized for the granting
of divorce: imprisonment-which, I might
say, is not a ground in the present Bill-and
cruelty, habitual drunkenness and insanity.
But that report, like the reports of many other
commissions, was not acted upon.
As I have said, no very important change
was made in the divorce law until last year,

86

SENATE

when a bill was introduced by Colonel Herbert,
member of the British House of Commons
and author of the book called " Holy
Deadlock."
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: "Unholy," was it not?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: It was either holy
or unholy. In any event, the book stirred up
the people of England. Colonel Herbert's
bill was based on the report of 1912. I will
not quote from the debate that followed. The
bill did not meet with very serious opposition,
either in the House of Commons or in the
House of Lords. Even the Church of England
bishops with seats in the House of Lords did
not oppose it, though they would not vote
for it. Some amendments were made before
the measure became law. For instance, the
committee of the Lords to which it was
referred struck out the clauses specifying life
imprisonment and habitual drunkenness as
grounds for divorce.
The amendments to our own divorce law
that are proposed in the Bill before us are
not, it seems to me, very drastic.
They
provide three new grounds on which a husband
or wife may apply for divorce: cruelty,
insanity, and, the most important change of
al], desertion for at least three years. There
is also a clause which prohibits the bringing
of an action for divorce within three years after
the marriage. In the present law there is no
time limit within which application may not
be made. This restrictive clause would prevent
applications by some persons who might
otherwise make them.
It does not seem to me that anyone can
say the proposed extension of the grounds is
very drastic. Let me give you one instance,
having te do with the ground of lunacy.
Mr. Bowman, ex-Speaker of the House of
Commons, said to me a few days ago, "Something must be d.one about this matter." He
told me of a farmer who came to his office
in the town of Dauphin, Manitoba, where he
practises law, and asked for advice. The
man's wife had been in the
asylum for
thirteen years, and it was said there was no
possibility of her ever being released. The
farmer said: "I have a farm there and some
young children, and if I were free to marry
it might be possible to get a woman te act
as mother to them. Is there any possibility
of obtaining relief for me?"
Mr. Bowman
had to tell him there was not, because an
application for divorce could not be made
in his case, as the law stands at present.
There are hundreds of cases like that; I
would go further and say there are thousands.
My statement is based on numerous letters
that have come to me. I do not see how
anyone can justify refusing divorce to a man
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS.

or woman whose wife or husband is incurably insane. Why should one party to a
marriage, who is not personally at fault, have
to spend the rest of his or her life in misery?
A further point that we should consider,
and one which I regard as very important,
is that a law which refuses divorce in such
circumstances is likely te lead to perjury,
immorality and collusion. It is better that
an innocent party should be able to obtain
a divorce and marry someone else than be
forced to lead a life of immorality, as hundreds are doing to-day.
Desertion for a period of at least three
years would also be a ground for divorce
under this Bill. Perhaps that is as justifiable
a ground as any. Consider the case of a
woman whose husband has deserted her for
at least three years. She may have sorne
children, or none at all, but in any event she
receives no support from ber husband, and
is left destitute unless she goes to work.
Should her life be ruined by the conduct
of the man who had sworn to protect her?
Must she be forced to live alone the rest of
ber life, or follow the common course of
living with someone whom the law will not
permit her to rnarry? I do not know but
that desertion is, in some instances. a better
ground for divorce than lunacy. I receive
letters every day about unfortun-ate cases.
To talk about protecting the sanctity of
the home when the 'home is broken up by
desertion seems to me te be idle.
At the time of Confederation the British
North America Act gave the Dominion exclusive authority over marriage and divorce,
but our Parliament bas passed only three
laws on the subject. One gave women the
right to petition on the same ground as men.
That was done, I suppose, for the purpose of
conforming with the English Act. Then, after
a great deal of discussion in this House, we
enacted a statute giving Ontario courts jurisdiction to grant divorces. The third Act was
based on a bill, introduced by a gentleman
from the West, conferring the right of domicile
upon women in certain circumstances. That
bill had its origin in a case that I know
something about.
An exceptionally fine
young woman was married in Winnipeg to a
man from the Island of Guernsey. After
they had lived together for a little time the
husband went back to his native home.
Under the law at the time she could obtain
a divorce only by filing ber petition in the
Guernsey courts.
To remove the obvious
injustice and hardship Parliament enacted
legislation providing that the locality in which

MARCH 15, 1938
husband and wife have lived together for
two years shall be deemed to be the husband's domicile.
Sections 12 and 13 of this Bill deal with
I nïeed scarcely direct attention to
nullity.
the difference between nullity and divorce.
Section 12 specifies these grounds for a decree
of nullity:
(a) that the marriage has not been consummated owing to the wilful refusal of the
respondent to consummate it; or
(b) that either party to the marriage was
at the time of the marriage either of unsound
mind or a mental defective within the meaning
of any statute in force in the province of the
court concerned or subject to recurrent fits
of insanity or epilepsy; or
(c) that the respondent was at the time of
the marriage suffering from venereal disease
of a communicable form; or
(d) that the respondent was at the time of
the marriage pregnant by some person other
than the petitioner.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
May I ask
the honourable gentleman a question? Recently I noticed in my own city an annulment was granted on the ground of the
woman having been a few months under
twenty-one years of age at the time of her
marriage.
That is the law
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
in the province of Quebec. While the Federal
Parliament has authority over marriage, the
provincial legislatures have jurisdiction to
regulate its form.
I would remind honourable members that
all'great reforms have usually been brought
about after many years of effort. For instance, with respect to the right of appeal
in criminal cases, although a royal commission in England reported in favour of legislation for this purpose, fifty years elapsed
before the Parliament of Great Britain gave
effect to the recommendation. I had the
honour of introducing in this House a bill
along similar lines. It encountered keen
opposition, but eventually it was enacted,
and I am glad to say that statute has worked
out very satisfactorily. As honourable members are aware, it was not until the Married
Women's Property Act was paased in 1873 that
a married woman could own real or personal
property in her own right. Before the passing
of that Act, immediately on marriage all the
wife's property passed into 'the possession of
her husband. She had no separate legal estate
whatsoever. Another instance of legal disability
relates to the franchise. A woman could
neither vote nor hold a seat in Parliament.
To-day we -have two lady members in this
House, and there are also two lady members
in the Commons. Contrast their position

87

to-day with that of women prior to 1873
The progress of reforms is always slow, and
we often wonder how people were content to
live under conditions which to-day we should
consider intolerable.
Before I resume my seat I wish to
appeal to those honourable members who on
religious grounds are opposed to divorce. I
have the greatest respect in the world for
their conscientious scruples, but I would ask
them in considering this matter not to press
their opposition, but to regard sympathetically the plight of those for whose relief this
legislation is proposed.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I am afraid
I did not make my point clear to the honourable gentleman. Religion did not enter into
the case at all, with respect to either of the
parties whom I mentioned. The wife petitioned the court for annulment of her marnage on the ground that at the time of the
ceremony she was not of age, and she produced a birth certificate in support of her
statement. The court annulled the marriage
on that ground, not on religious grounds at all.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I was making only a
humble request to those honourable gentlemen who because of religious convictions are
opposed to divorce. I have the greatest
respect for their views, but I would ask them
not to press those views to the point of
depriving the thousands of people in this
country who are suffering to-day because of the
very restrictive nature of our present divorce
law. I trust honourable members will give this
Bill their favourable consideration.
I understand that the honourable senator
from West Central Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) intends to address the House, and I
am confident that he will deal with any phases
of the question which I may have overlooked.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Honourable senators,
I thought there would probably be some debate on this Bill, and I intended to wait until
I had heard what other members, not older,
but 'more experienced, might wish to say. As,
however, no one appears desirous of speaking,
I will move that the debate be adjourned
until the next sitting of the House.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, I believe it is intended to refer this
Bill to a special committee. If so, it would
be a mistake to have the debate adjourned at
this early stage. It would be better to
proceed and get the Bill to the special committee to be dealt with before we come to the
heavy end of the session, when all our committees will be exceedingly busy.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Then we can
hold our souls in patience until the honourable gentleman is ready later on.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Thank you.
Hon. W. M. ASELTINE:
Honourable
members, I should like to supplement the remarks of the honourable the senior member
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. MeMeans).
The Bill is largely a restatement of the
present law of divorce with certain additions
taken from the English Act. To those honourable members who are lawyers this no
doubt will be quite apparent, but for those
who are not lawyers some explanations may
be necessary.
As the House is aware, section 91, subsection 26, of the British North America Act
gave the Federal Parliament full jurisdiction
over divorce. Parliament has passed only two
enactments: one in 1925, giving a wife the
right to obtain divorce on the same grounds
as a husband; the other in 1930, enabling a
wife to petition for a divorce in the jurisdiction of the court of the province where
she is domiciled, if her husband bas deserted
her and on that account changed her domicile.
This latter Act was necessary because theretofore the wife had to follow the husband
and institute proceedings for divorce in the
jurisdiction of his new domicile. The Acts
of 1925 and 1930 are included in the present
Bill.
In other words, Canada has practically no
divorce law of its own. With the exception
of the two statutes I have just referred to,
the law of divorce in this country is the
same as that in England prior to the passing
of the new English Act in 1937. It seems
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

to me advisable that, even if there were no
other reason for the legislation now proposed,
we should have a divorce law of our own.
And that is one of the objects of this Bill.
Divorce has for centuries been allowed by
law. This Bill does not raise the question
as to whether or not divorce is good or bad,
or whether it should or should not be permitted.
In May, 1936, in this House, I made a speech
in which I traced the history of marriage
and divorce from the earliest to modern
times. I tried to show that marriage was a
contract, not a sacrament, and that divorce
had been allowed for hundreds of years. It
is not my intention to deal with that phase
of the question now.
The preamble to the new English Act
might, it seems to me, be happily used in the
drafting of this Bill. That preamble is as
follows:
Whereas it is expedient for the true support
of marriage, the protection of children, the
removal of hardship, the reduction of illicit
unions and unseemly litigation, the relief of
conscience among the clergy, and the restoration
of due respect for the law, that the Acts
relating to marriage and divorce be amended.
The objects of this Bill are the same as
those which the framers of the English Bill
bad in mind. This Bill proceeds to bring
about the desired objects in the following
manner:
First, it prevents hasty divorces by changing the law so that no divorce can be obtained
by either spouse during the first three years
of the marriage, unless there be exceptional
circumstances, thus affording the parties an
opportunity of straightening out their difficulties. This is a new departure, and except
in England, a similar restriction does not
exist in any other country in the world that
I know of. In my opinion divorces will be
lessened in number rather than increased by
this provision.
Second, by the addition of three new grounds
for divorce, the poorer classes-who were
formerly unable to afford the luxury of a
divorce where adultery had to be proven by
the hiring of detectives or other persons, sometimes at great expense-will be greatly benefited, and instead of illicit unions there will
be valid divorces and remarriages.
Third, the clergy are also protected by not
being obliged to marry a divorced person
unless they sec their way clear to do so.
Fourth.-For years the courts have been
complaining that with only one ground for
divorce there has been obviously much collusion and connivance between litigants, resulting in wholesale perjury, which in many

MARCH 15, 1938
cases cannot be detected. The additional
grounds for divorce will tend to remedy the
evil, as will the greater power given the
courts -to inquire into questions of collusion,
connivance and condonation.
As already stated, the Bill will give us a
divorce law of our own. I intend to vote for
the Bill and can assure those who may be
hesitating to support it that there is nothing
in it that should cause alarm to anyone. I
do not think we should worry over the fact
that the Bill will permit of a divorce being
secured on the ground of desertion. Many
honourable members may not be aware of the
fact that for more than three hundred years
desertion has been a ground for divorce in
Scotland. We do not find that Scottish homes
hav'e been broken up because of that, and I
do not anticipate that Canadian homes will
suffer if we accept desertion as a ground for
divorce. In almost every part of the world
except Canada and the State of New York
desertion is a valid ground for divorce at the
present time.
The mover of the second reading of the
Bill referred to four new grounds for granting
a decree of nullity. I shall not cite them
again, but shall content myself with saying that
every safeguard is provided. The petitioner
must show that he or she was not aware of
the facts at the time of the marriage. Furthermore, in order to secure a decree of nullity,
the petitioner must commence proceedings
within one year of the marriage and must
prove that marital intercourse has not taken
place since his or her discovery of the existence of these grounds.
Another new feature in the Bill is the one
dealing with the presumption of death. At
the present time there is no satisfactory law
on this question in the Dominion of Canada.
In fact, it is almost impossible to obtain a
declaration of death. In many jurisdictions
there is no procedure by which a person can
secure a declaration from the courts that the
absentee is dead, and many new marriages
take place without any declaration to that
effect. In this Bill a method is provided for
obtaining such a decree. There are many
safeguards around this feature also. Even if
a person has been proven to have disappeared
for seven years or more, the court has it
within its discretion to refuse the declaration.
I may say, honourable senators, that I have
read the debates that took place on the
English Bill in the British Parliament, but
have been unable to discover in them any
valid reason why such a Bill should not be
passed. The Bill was supported by clergymen,
lords and commoners, and received a large
majority on each reading. In this connection

89

I should like to read what was said by the
Lord Bishop of Birmingham in the House of
Lords on the second reading of the Bill. He
prefaced his remarks with these words:
I intend to vote for the second reading of
this marriage Bill. There is in my opinion
nothing in it which can encourage our people
to regard marriage lightly. It is, I am convinced, a careful attempt to bring our marriage
law into harmony with opinions now held by
an overwhelming majority of enlightened
Christian people in this country. One of the
great merits of the Bill, as it seems to me, is
that it will promote morality by lessening the
number of irregular unions among working
people. I hope that it will lessen the number
of collusive divorces among our fellow-citizens
of less narrow means. Some legislation as to
divorce is urgently needed at the present time,
for people generally-is it not so?-are made
profoundly uneasy by present circumstances.
It seems to me that the Bill is carefully balanced. No practical alternative to it has been
proposed.
I believe the Bill before us furnishes something we have been wanting for a long time.
The publie generally, as well as the judiciary,
are crying aloud that the problem of divorce
requires parhiamentary attention. I hope that
the Bill, after second reading, will be referred
to a special committee of the Senate, so that
every phase of the question may be carefully
considered. In view of the fact that the
Commission on Divorce in England made its
report in 1912 and that the legislation was not
introduced until 1937, I think you will agree
that in that country the matter received most
careful attention.
I would go even further than the English
legislation goes. I would make life imprisonment a ground for divorce. I do not think I
would go so far as to include habitual
drunkenness.
It has been a little difficult to follow the
honourable the senior senator from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. McMeans), by reason of the
fact that he covered most of the main points
involved in the Bill. In the few remarks I
have made I do not pretend to have covered
the whole field. I have simply referred to
certain points that I thought he might have
missed, or that he left for me to discuss.
There is one more point to which I may
refer. The Bill contains no definition of
cruelty. In my opinion such a definition is
not necessary. For years, in every province
of this Dominion, judicial separations have
been granted on the ground of cruelty without
its ever being defined. For this reason it was
thought inadvisable to inchude a definition in
the Bill.
Like the honourable the senior senator from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. McMeans), I hope this
matter will receive the careful consideration

90

SENATE

of the House, and that the Bill will be given
second reading and be referred to committee
without undue delay.

As to the proposal that life imprisonment
should be a ground for divorce, I may say
that men who have been sentenced to prison
for life have sometimes been released after
a few years. The real wife will be living
in hopes that her husband may be restored
to her and her children.

Up to now in this Dominion we have confined ourselves to but one ground for divorce.
Arguments can be found to support others.
I can call to mind almost innumerable instances-sadly, more to-day than in other
times-in which most fearful misfortunes and
most brutal injustices seemed to fall upon
people because of our law being restricted as
it is. In a word, any number of reasons can
he found for supporting the relief of the
individual. Yet when that reasoning is carried
to its conclusion one sees that the ultimate
direction in which it leads is towards the
disintegration of the home, and, one's heart
shudders at the result of one's own logic. The
home is the whole basis of civilization. Without it we cannot survive. One country has
made a trial, and has been compelled to retrace its steps. Therefore all who feel that
they are at a very sacred point when dealing
with legislation whici invades the home are
going to be very careful of the exact steps
they take. In a word, you cannot get a law
which is fair to the individual and is not going
to result in the disintegration of the home.
If we make our laws broad enough to cover
all cases-to provide fair and just treatment
for the poor woman who is deserted, for the
poor woman whose husband is a drunkard,
for the poor man whose wife has run away,
for the poor man whose wife has become
insane-we get to a point where the fortifications of the home are gone.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Hear, hear.

I do not think it is impossible to determine
reliably. Lunacy is not something which
depends upon volition of the individual, but
desertion is. I realize there is a limit to the
extent to which this argument can be carried,
for the great breach which we in this Dominion
have always acknowledged as a sufficient ground
for divorce does depend upon volition of the
individual. But in any event I draw some
distinction between desertion and incurable
lunacy, and I believe there can be justification
for divorce when one party to the marriage
contract is afflicted with hopeless insanity, a
condition not self-imposed. A man who deserts his wife may do so to evade his obligations, or by collusion, and in any case lie may
later return. Believing that opportunities for
collusion would be much more numerous if
desertion were a ground for divorce, I could
not support final passage of a bill which made
it a ground.
My words have perhaps not been very clear.
Realizing that no matter what I do I can be
charged with being illogical, 1 am going to
vote for second reading, trusting that some
illumination may be thrown upon the
measure when iii committee, and that when
it comes finally before us it will be in a
form which will meet with approval of a
majority of the House.

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, it is not my habit to rise to discuss
divorce questions. I stated on a previous
occasion that at the time I entered this
Chamber I asked some senior members of my
faith what their practice was when petitions
for divorce were presented. They were men
of high standing, who had played an important role in my province, and I had the
greatest respect for them. They were unanimous in telling me that they abstained from
voting one way or the other on divorce petitions. This practice has always been followed
by me. Though I know that divorce is a
subject which properly comes before us, under
our Constitution, I have not read evidence
taken by the Divorce Committee, nor have
I expressed any opinion or registered any vote
on its reports and bills. I have always felt

But on this occasion I rise because my

of bringing about conditions which would honourable friend who moved second readbe still more terrible than those we are seeking ing of the Bill (Hon. Mr. McMeans) has made
an appeal to members of the Senate who for

I certainly do not feel like supporting the religious reasons would vote against divorce

right to amend and extend the present law. I
would draw his attention to the fact that in
this instance I arn forced to express an
opinion. Here we have a Bill which would
confirm and extend the principle of divorce
and thereby weaken the marriage tie, and I
cannot re-main silent when the motion for the
second reading is put to a vote. I intend to
vote against the motion.
Hon. L. COTE:
Honourable senators,
when I arrived in the House this evening,
unfortunately a few minutes late, the mover
of this Bill (Hon. Mr. MeMeans) was just
making an appeal f0 a number of members,
including mysoîf. To be perfecfly candid, I
was a bit surprised at the nature of the
appeal, for it is not known fo me that ail
persons not of my faith are in favour of the
principle of divorce. Because of my celigious
tenets I am opposed to divorce: I believe
that marriage cannof be dissolved. But, on
the other baud, I have yet to learn. that porsons of other faiths believe in divorce for
religious reasons. I do not think that is so
at aIl. It may be that thoso whose religion
does not teacb that divorce is an impossibility regard it with more tolerance than we
do, but there are hundreds of thousands-yes,
millions-of peuple in this country not bolongmng to the faith to which I belong who are
opposed to extending grounds for divorce, or
to making it easier, and are in favour of
restricting if as much as possible. If soems
to me that those peuple would flot give way
and agree f0 extension of the grounds so long
as they could reasonably cesist any domand
for such extension.
Surely we aIl realize that, as the righf honourable leader on this side of the House (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) said a few moments ago,
divorce is an element whioh disintegrates
the homne and the fa.mily. It is the enemy
of the home. It is obvious that even tihose
wbo have no conscientious objection f0 if
are afraid of it, and are mosf certainly
flot cager to see, the Canadian home, made
less stable by the weakening of our ýdivorce law. Referenc bas been made fo the
law of England. But it must ho cememberod
that there is a much older civilization in that
country. Here wo are jusf past the pioneering stage. Our peuple are pretty religious
and pretty stable, and tbroughout the land

event we do not have to fo]low suit. In this
country we do not adopf ail the laws that
are passed in Engiand. Surely the fact that
England bas amended its divorce law is not
an argument thaf sbould sway bonourahie
members and induce them to, vote for this
Bill.
I am opposed to the Bill on two grounds.
In the first place I arn agai.nst it for personal
religious reasons.
If those were the only
cessons I bad, I sbould be wiliing to step
aside and lot other honourable membors
decide wb'etbor the Bill sbould hecome law
or not. But at the same timo 1 arn convinced thaf if is against public interest and
welfare.
Hon. Mc. MURDOCK:
Would my honourable friend answoc the question that was
asked by the bonourable senator from Aima
(Hon. Mr. Ballantyne)? Holding-and very
proporly-the views that he and others do,
cao be explain how it came about thaf a girl
who was married at the age of fwenty years
and ten monfhs and lived with a man for a
number of years could ho divorced, in fact,
by having ber marriage annulled?
I think
my honourable friend is aware thaf from time
f0 time fhe newspapers carry stories of macniages being an.nulled in the province ci
Quebec for somo reason or other.
Why?
How cao thaf ho done if marriage is for life?
My honourable friend, who is a lawvyer, cao
answer these questions and help me and probably some others t0 understand bis viewpoinf.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Unfortunately I was not
present when the honourable senaf or from
Aima asked bis question.
I fake if from
whaf my honourablo friend now says that it
concerned the case of a young woman, of
twenty years and ton months of ago, and I
assume that she was married witbout consent
of ber parents or guardian. I did flot know
tbat in Quebec n woman was a miner until
twentv-one; I thougbt the age wvas eigbfeen,
but At may he twenty-one. Now, probably
the Quebec law is thaf a woman younger than
twenty-one cannot be married without the
consent of ber parents.
Rigbft Hon. Mc. MEIGIIEN: But does
thaf ouf bave f0 do with the law as f0 marniage rather than with the law as f0 ceremony of marriage?
Hon. Mr. COTE: Yes.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
is federal.

Therefore, it

Hon. Mr. COTE: No. It is the provincial
law wbicb specifies the age of the contracfing
parties. Naturally Inarriage is surrounded by

MARCH 15, 1938
certain legal formalities. Laws have been
passed in Ontario, as well as in Quebec and
in all the other provinces, regulating the
capacity of parties to a marriage and the
conditions under which marriage can be performed. If in the province of Quebec a
marriage was set aside bécause a woman was
not twenty-one when the ceremony was performed, I can only come to the conclusion
that under the provincial law she was incapable
of entering into a marriage contract without
leave of her parents or guardian.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: What about the
children, if any?
Hon. Mr. COTE: The result is that there
was no contract. So the annulment to which
the honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon.
Mr. Murdock) refers is not a divorce at all;
it is simply a declaration by the court that
no marriage took place.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Will the honourable senator pardon me? We cannot discuss judges in this House, and I am not going
to do so. I simply want to state a fact. In
the case in question the petitioner was told
that the annulment left her just as free as
if she had never been married at all.
Hon. Mr. COTE: I assume the honourable
gentleman is right. That would be the natural
consequence of a judgment of annulment.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: What about the
children, if any?
Hon. Mr. COTE: I do not know the
Quebec law. It is a matter for the provincial
legislature to decide what the civil rights of
children would be in certain cases. If there
was no marriage, there might not be any
civil consequences at all. I should not like
to guess at what the Quebec law is, but I
would point out to the honourable senator
from Parkdale the necessity of realizing that
an annulment, under the circumstances in the
case referred to, is not a divorce at al]. It is
simply a declaration that no marriage ever
existed, whereas a divorce is the breaking of
a bond, a dissolution of a contract which once
existed.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask my
honourable friend another question? We are
all grown up here, and good friends, and we
may as well get a little further information
while we are discussing this matter. Let us
suppose that a young man of my persuasion
and a young woman of your persuasion, both
resident in the province of Quebec, are married there by a preacher of my persuasion.
Some time later-it may be months or it
may be years-someone comes along and says
there was no marriage. Will you explain that?

93

That is a kind of thing I have been reading
about for a number of years and could never
really understand. Nobody is better able to
give me an explanation than my honourable
friend who is touching on this point just now.
Hon. Mr. COTE: The honourable member
flatters me, but for that reason I am going
to endeavour to give him an answer. In such
a case it is again a matter of civil law.
In the province of Quebec, as well as in
the other provinces, the rule of the Catholic
church is that those belonging to it can
become validly married only before a minister of their faith. That is purely a religious
rule, and it cannot have any civil effect
unless the legislature intervenes and gives it
civil effect. As long as there has been a Civil
Code in the province of Quebec that Code has
recognized the religious impediment to the
marriage of a Roman Catholic before a minister of another faith, and has given it the
effect of a civil impediment. That explains
how an annulment is brought about in the
kind of case referred to by the honourable
senator.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Is the British North
America Act involved at all?
Hon. Mr. COTE: No, it is not involved.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I wish my honourable friend would tell me as a layman why it
is not involved.
Hon. H. H. HORSEY: Honourable members,
I do not wish to give a silent vote on this Bill.
I do not consider that adding three further
grounds of divorce can be regarded as weakening the present law in any way. These
further grounds should strengthen rather than
weaken the Act. This may lead to an increase
in the number of divorces, but if those divorces
are justified there can be no valid objection
to them. Which is the greater evil, violation
of the marriage contract without or with legal
redress to the innocent party? To my mind
the withholding of justice to the injured party
will tend to wreck the home rather than hold
it together. Suppose a man deserts his wife
and children, goes to the United States or
some other country and contracts a bigamous
marriage. Should not the innocent wife be
protected in such a case? After all, should we
not listen to the inner voice-should we not
obey the dictates of our conscience? What,
in the circumstances, would be the fair thing
to do for the innocent wife in particular and
for society in general? Should we shut our
eyes to something that shocks our sense of
justice? The home, as an honourable gentleman bas said, is the foundation of civilization.
In my view, if we do not take action along

94

SENATE

the lines of this Bill we shall not prevent, but
on the contrary we shall hasten, the breaking
up of homes where unhappy marital conditions
prevail. Why should not a poor deserte.d wife
or husband be permitted to have another
home? Under the law to-day they have no
grounds whatever for divorce.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: They have certain
grounds for divorce.
Hon. Mr. HORSEY: I am speaking of
desertion. That is the only point to which I
wish to draw attention.
True, the Bill
establishes additional grounds for divorce,
but they are justifiable grounds, and personally I believe the Bill will enure to the
general welfare of society and to the protection of the home by doing justice to innocent
individuals. For these reasons I cannot for
the life of me see how we can take any other
course than support the Bill.
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourable senators,
it is quite apparent that we shall not this
evening reach a vote on the motion for second
reading. I know some honourable members
wish to speak on the Bill, and it is now
getting late.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I presume honourable
members will not expect me to present legal
arguments in support of my opposition to
this proposed logislation. My opposition rests
upon other grounds, and I would ask you not
to think it is due to any thought of superior
virtue on my part, or to a desire to parade
any knowledge of Christian doctrine that I
may possess. My motives are, I hope, the
result of far better principles. I will at once
admit that in respect to some things I have
strong convictions, that I recognize my
responsibilities as a member of this honourable
law-making body and, rather than shirk what
I believe to be my duty, I would run the risk
of being misunderstood. I shall now proceed,
as best I can, to lay down the premise or
foundation on which to build a souna
conclusion.
I presume it will be agreed that the fundamental principle of Christianity, as its name
implies, is that Jesus Christ was and is God
as well as man; that, as God, He had the
power and the righti to make laws binding on
all men, under all circumstances, and for all
time. Did He legislate on the subject of
marriage, and did He make a validly contracted, consummated marriage indissoluble?
If the Bible is not a book of fables, He did
both these things, and for Christians worthy
of the name this settles the question. I shall
lon. Mr. HORSEY.

now quote the passages of the Bible that bear
directly on the subject, using the King James
version. I cite the gospel of St. Matthew,
19th Chapter:
3. The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for
a man to put away his wife for every cause?
4. Andi he answered and said unto them,
Have ye not read, that he whieh made them
at the beginning made them male and female,
5. And said, For this cause shall a man leave
father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife:
and they twain shall be one flesh?
6. Wherefore they are no more twain, but
one flesh.
What therefore God bath joined

together, let no man put asuier.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Will the honourable gentleman tell me, then, how it happens
that in my city annulments are being granted
by the dozen, and marriages thus rendered
void?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Those who are
acquainted with the provincial laws of that
part of Canada will be better qualified to
answer the question than I an.
Hon. Mr. HORSEY: But they cannot supersede the law you are quoting.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I am presenting my
argument, and when I am through my honourable friend can tell me what he thinks of
it. Some honourable member to-night said
marriage was more than a contract.
The
Author of Christianity laid down that principle: He said it was more than a civil contract.
I continue my quotation from St.
Matthew:
7. They say unto him, Whv did Moses then
command to give a writing of divorcement, and
to put ber away?
8. He saith unto them, Moses because of the
hardness of your hearts suffered you to put
away your wives: but from the beginning it
was not so.
9. And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put
away his wife, except it be for fornication, and
shall marry another, committeth adultery: and
whoso marrietih ber which is put away doth
commit adultery.
Then let me quote these verses from St.
Mark, Chapter 10:
2. And the Pharisees came to him, and asked

him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his
vife? tempting him.
3. And lie answered and said unto them, What

And Jesus answered and said unto them,

But from the beginning of the creation

For this cause shall a man leave his

11. And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall

12. And if a woman shall put away ber
busband, and be married to another,, she committetb adultery.
St. Luke is very brief. This is the lSth verse
of Chapter 16:
Whosoever puttetb away bis wif e, and marrieth anotber, committetb adultery: and whosoever marrietb ber tbat is put away f rom bier
busband committetb adultery.
St. Paul, in First Corinthians, Chapter 7,
wrote on this question tihus:
10. And unto the married I command, yet
flot I, but tbe Lord, Let flot the wife depart
from ber husband:
11. But and if sbe depart, let ber remain
unmarried, or be reconciled to ber busband:
and let flot the busband put away bis wife.
Again in Epbesians, Chapter 5, the said:
31. For this cause shall a man leave his
fatber and motber, and shall be joined unto
bis wif e, and they two sball be one flesb.'
32. Tbis is a great mystery: but 1 speak
concerning Christ and tbe churcb.
I would here eall attention to the fact
that St. Paul expressly declares hie is not
presenting his own views, but is laying down
the law of Christ and the Church.
This
oug-ht to be enough for Christians. I arn
cuuviuced in iuy uwn mind that no man can
ancept the parts of Cbyistianity that suit himi
and re.ject the parts that do not suit him,
and stili he a Christian in the proper acceptation of the terni. But I would flot be
rnisunderstood. There are xnon-Christians who
are better living men and more wortby citizens
than many Christians. But this is not an
argument against Christianity; rather is it
proof of the parable of the Cockle and tbe
Wbeat. Or perhaps.a better illustration would
be the penitent thief, and the disciples who
went back and walked no more with Jesus.
The thief was a Christian, and bis faith and
penitence were his salvation. The disciples
probably were better living men than the
thief; at ail events, they were more respectable; but they duubted or denied the divinity
of Jesus and therefore is omnipotence. They
were critics who had a high opinion of themselves and they sat in judgment on the teaching of the Master; therefore, Jesus, Who was
love and goodness itself, let themn go, and
lie would have allowed the Apostles to go,
too, if they had not, through the mouth of
their spokesman, made a profound declaration
of their falth. To the thoughtful mnan there
is no other philosophy of life at ail comn-

parable with -Christianity, even for this world.
But we must take it as a whole, or rejeet
it as a whole.
Most people will, *I think, say that there
are degrees of disobedience to the laws of
God and man, and therefore'degrees of malice
in sucb disobedience. There is a difference
between the sins of impulse and the ains of
premeditation; and I amn shocked wben I
find a deliberative law-making body in a
prof essedly Christian nation telling God to
His face that it kno^ws more about tbe making
of laws for the world and for humanity than
Hie ever knew, and that it will make laws to
supersede lis commands. And my sorrow is
alI the greater when I realize that the Englisbspeaking nations appear to be leading in some
of these had directions. We are told that a
few months ago the Parliament of Great
Britain passcd a bill similar to the one we
are now considcering. Unfortunately that statement is truc. But when and fromn whosn
did the Parliament of Great Britain get the
power to pass such a law, and by whom was
it prompted? It did not get the power fromn
God, and was not prompted by Hum, because
God does not and cannot contradict llimself.
A few days ago I read an editorial in the
Ottawa Citizen under tbe heading "The
Divorce Bill," from which I take the following paragraph:
These provisions follow the lines of tbe
Britisb Act whicb amended tbe divorce law
of the United Kiiigdum. The British Bill was
supported by a large majority in Parliament,
by the public generally, by the press, and in
many instances, by tbe pulpit.
Ail oi which is truc, and pity 'tis 'tis true.
And then we wonder that the world is
afflicted and in trouble! My wonder is that
our afflictions are not far greater tban they
are. I marvel that we are not swallowed
up by another deluge.
Again I would ask that I be not misunderstood. I do not want to make out the British
people and tbe English-speaking nations to
be worse than tbey are. By comparison, I
think, we have some virtues, perbaps many,
that others do not possess; and if this is
correct a just God will give us credit for
them. But this does nût justify us in trampling upon some of God's laws and making a
scrap of paper of the Bible.
I hope the Bihl will not receive second
reading.
Honourable
Hon. FELIX P. QUINN:
members, as I arn opposed to the principle of,
divorce, I arn opposed to the present Bill,
hecause it extends the grounds upon which
divorce may be secured and makes divorce
casier to obtain. When I consider the alarmn-

96

SENATE

ing increase in the number of divorces
in Canada, in recent years, and the tremendous number of those applied for and
granted in the country to the south of us, ini
relation to the number of marriages, I hesitate
even to give this Bill consideration.
I amn not going to trouble yeu with any
extended remarks, but I wish to place certain
considerations before you. Will the passing
of this Bill fot have a tendency to make
less careful those who are considering the
possibi]ity of entering into the holy bonds of
matrimony?
As bas been said by one or two of the previous speakers, the Catholic Church regards
marriage as a sacrament. It is sometbing
greater than a civil contract. Therefore we
who are members of ýthat Church take this
matter more seriously tihan those wbo do not
agree witýh us from a religions point of view.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Smith, the debate
was adjourned.

Hon. L. McMEANS moved the second reading of Bill C, an Act respecting the Canadian
Pacific Railway Company.
He said: Honourable members, this is simply
a Bill to enable the Canadian Pacifie Railway Company to lease a small line of railway, some ten miles in lengtb, runnîng from
Lac dii Bonnet to Great Falls. It is owned by
the Winnipeg Railway Company, and unless
theCanadian Pacifie Railway can lease it and
take it over, it will be abandoned.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill was

SECOND READING

Hon. L. McMEANS moved the second reading of Bill D, an Act respecting Révillon
Frères Trading Company, Limited, and to
change it.s name to Rupert's Land Trading
Company.
H1e said: Honourable members, this is a
Bill concerning Révîllon Frères Trading Company, Limited, one of the old-time trading
companies with stores throughout the West.
It is asking for permission to change its
name and reduce the capital stock. The
company has an authorized capital of $2,000,000, issued as follows: 18,000 shares of
$100, each fully paid, and 1,020 shares on
whicb $5 a share bas been called and paid.
Because of trading losses suffered in the l-ast
two years, the company's balance sheet as
at the end of 1937 shows a deficit of more

than $900,000. As part of the capital bas
heen lost, the amount of the capital should
be reduced.
Hon. Mr. QUINN.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Will the
honourable member explain why a company
with the name of Révillon Frères--a name
that carnies with it prestige throughout northcmn Canada, and dates back for decades-wants to change its name?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I confess that
I was very much surprised when I saw the
purport of this Bill. I should like to have
some clear evidence that ail the parties interested in the company are behind the Bill.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: The reasan given
is that the Révillon family no longer have
any connection wîth the company, and that
the name of the company should be changed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I know that
is the reason given, but it is na reason at all.
It dues not mîatter whether the Révillons are
still alive or not. I am surprised that anyone sbould try to get rid of a name that
means so ranch, and take one that means
s0 little.
Hon. Mr, DAN DURAND:
I know that
more than one member of the Révillon family
are stili living.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Most campanies would pay to get that name.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: The Bill wilI go
to the Private Bills Committee.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill
was read the second time.
SECOND READING

Hon. C. W. ROBINSON moved the second
reading of Bill E. an Act respecting the Restigouche Log Driving and Boom Company.
11e said: Honourable members, this is an
unimportant Bill, the purpose of which is
to extend the power of choosing directors.
The company bas been in existence since
1910. AIl operators on the river having
100,000 feet of lumber or upwards passing
through the boom in any given year are
members of the company. Apparently al
the members are now corporations, and it is
not always practicable for a director or the
manager of certain of the corporations to
act as director of the company, and the company is desirous of extending the qualifications to any person authorized by a resolution of a corporation which is a inenber of
the company.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill
was read the second time.

THIRD READING

On motion of Right Hon. Mr. Meighen,
Bill A, an Act respecting the Dominion Association of Chartered Accountants, was read
the third time, and passed.
DIVORCE AND MATRIMONIAL
CAUSES BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
debate on the motion for the second reading
of Bill B, an Act respecting Divorce and
Matrimonial Causes.
Hon. E. D. SMITH: Honourable senators,
as I intend to vote for the second reading
of this Bill, I wish to give briefly my reasons
for so doing.
I do not conceive that voting for the principle necessarily implies acceptance of all the
provisions of a bill. The purpose of this Bill
is to loosen somewhat our very rigid laws in
regard to divorce, which, I understand, are
more rigid than those of any other of the
Overseas Dominions.
I strongly deprecate enlarging the grounds
for divorce to the extent which obtains in
the United States; but that, in my opinion,
is not the purpose of this Bill. And I think
that we ought not to hesitate te consider
these amendments for fear of what may
follow their adoption. This is a body of
mature and experienced members, and I am
confident they will never countenance any
measure which might bring about in this
country such a condition as that which prevails in the United States, where, as is well
known, divorce is granted even on the ground
of incompatibility of temperament. On the
contrary. I feel sure that honourable members will, as is our practice, consider this Bill
on its merits, and will not fail to reject any
provision which would tend to loosen the
marriage tie to the deplorable degree which
we sec to the south of us.
I shall vote for the second reading so
that the Bill may be referred to a committee.
There it can be discussed and, if necessary,

amended so that it may be reported to this
House in a forrn which will commend itself
to our approval.
Honourable
Hon. J. J. DONNELLY:
members of the Senate, the honourable member froin Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. MeMeans),
when speaking in support of this Bill, suggested that members of the Senate who on
account of religious convictions are opposed
to divorce should refrain from opposing the
Bill. I wish to make my position perfectly
clear in this regard.
For many years private bills have been
brought into this House for the purpose of
giving relief by way of divorce to certain
persons mentioned. Those bills did not in
In
themselves enact divorce legislation.
the past the practice bas grown up of initiating such measures only in the Senate, and
the Senate has thereby come to be looked
upon to some extent as a divorce court; but
there is no valid reason why such bills should
not originate in the House of Commons, be
considered there and then come to the
Senate. As I have said, bills of that nature
were private bills. and during the twenty or
more years that I have been a member of
this House, though not disposed to vote for
them, I have never voted against them.
But the fact that this is a public Bill
places it in an entirely different class. This
is a measure which affects the welfare of
the people of this country. I think, therefore, it is the duty of every member to take
a stand on the Bill and to support it or oppose
it, as he sees fit.
The object of this Bill is to enlarge the
grounds for divorce, with the result, as I believe, that divorces will become very much
more numerous than in the past. The promoters of the Bill have said this will not be
the case, but we have the example of the
country to the south of us, where the reasons
for which divorce could be granted were gradually enlarged, and where one of the principal grounds-and one that is included in this
Bill-is cruelty. We sometimes read about
the movie colony out in California. It is just
possible that conditions there are the same as
in other parts of the United States. Judging by
the publicity given to the movie colony, I
have come to the conclusion that many of
the so-called movie stars, though, fortunately,
not al], give about as much consideration to
getting a divorce and being remarried as they
would give to turning in their old car for a
new model. We do not wish to encourage that
kind of thing here.
If you pass this Bill a person can go to the
courts and get a divorce on the ground of
Hon. Mr. E. D. SMITH.

cruelty. This would give a certain respectability to divorce. There would be no scandal
about it. Under the existing law there is some
scandal attaching to it. If a mild construction
is put upon the word "cruelty" by the courts
on the other side, the same may happen here
and divorce may become a very simple and
respectable way of swapping partners.
I do not think it is in the best interest
of this country that we should loosen up
divorce and make it casier. As long as human
nature remains what it is, husbands and wives
will at times have differences of opinion,
and if you make divorce easy you will create
a situation wherein they will make no effort
to become reconciled to each other, because
it will be much easier to get a divorce.
Much stress bas been laid upon the plight
of the unfortunates who are suffering on
account of our present law. There is no doubt
about it that it does result in suffering to
some people, but unfortunately it is impossible
to frame laws and regulations under which
innocents will not suffer. We have only to
look at our courts of justice. I am disposed
to think that in many cases where a criminal
is convicted of some serious offence and sent
to a penitentiary, his next of kin endure a
great deal more mental anguish and other
forms of trouble than the criminal himself
does. Yet our judges, knowing this to be so.
are not thereby retarded from passing such
sentences as they believe will be in the best
interest of society.
There
is
a class who would suffer
if the number of divorces were increased: I
refer to the children of divorced parents.
Those who make up this class are perhaps
more numerous and more important than the
persons who are suffering now for want
of relief. If the law is made easy there will
he a great inerease in the number of children
of divorced parents: more boys will be growing up without the companionship and guidance of a father, which they so much require.
and more homes will be deprived of the love
and devotion of a mother, which are so essential to the bringing up of children.
The mover of the motion (Hon. Mr.
MeMeans) emphasized the point that in introducing the measure he was simply following
the example which was set in England last
year, when the law was amended there. That
is quite correct. Later he remarked that reforms are made slowly, and achieved only
after a long period of time. He told us that
the divorce law of England had remained
virtually unamended for eighty years. Well,
if he wishes us to follow the English pre-

MARCH 16, 1938
cedent in that respect it will be many years
before he need bring in an amendment applicable to my province of Ontario. The
present divorce law of that province has
been in force only since 1930, and it does
appear to me that it has not yet had a sufficiently long trial to warrant any amendment.
I have a recollection of having read in one
of the papers a statement by the present
Attorney-General of Ontario-I looked for it
this morning, but was unable to find itwherein he was quoted as having expressed
the opinion, in an interview in Toronto, that
it would be well to give the present law a
longer trial before changing it.
For the reasons which I have endeavoured
to give, as well as on the ground of arguments presented by other honourable senators, and in particular those so eloquently
advanced by the right honourable gentleman
from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham), I
intend to vote against second reading of this
measure.
Hon. CHARLES BOURGEOIS: Honourable members of the Senate, although the
wording of section 3 of this Bill has, in my
opinion, the effect of excluding the province
of Quebec from the application of the measure, I deem it my duty to oppose its adoption. because I consider it is against the moral
welfare of Canada as a whole. I presume
that other honourable members, like our
colleague from King's (Hon. Mr. Hughes),
will state the reasons why they consider this
proposed legislation is contrary to the law of
nature and to the positive Divine law. I
will restrict myself to a discussion principally
on sociological grounds. I do this not because
I undervalue the importance of argument based
upon the Holy Scriptures, but because I believe
that the social aspect of the divorce problem
may have to some minds a greater importance
than the religious one.
It cannot be denied that the family is the
most permanent foundation of civil society
or the State; it is really its corner-stone.
Nor can any impartial man fail to admit that
the most powerful and perhaps the bestfaring nations of the world have always been
those wherein family ties were the strongest.
This is the thesis sustained by a great French
writer, Paul Bourget, in one of his novels,
"Le Tribun." The reason is evident. Society
cannot be founded on the individual, for the
individual is ephemeral; he passes and disappears without trace.
The only element
which bas stability and permanency is the
family. 'It is through the family that the
present is connected with the past and continued into the future.
5195S--7

The child is not only born in the family,

he is educated in it. It is the source of not
only his

physical

life, but his intellectual

and moral development as well. The country
or nation of which he becomes a citizen is
only an enlarged family. So true is this that
in some languages country is designated as
motherland or fatherland-vaterland in German. The word "patriot" is evidently derived
from the Latin "pater," meaning father. And
the beautiful Latin saying, "Dulce et decorum

est pro patriâ mori"-it is sweet and glorious
ta die for one's own country-expresses deepest patriotic feelings by referring to the
land of one's fathers. For most men the
destruction of the family has the consequence
of depriving the word "country" of meaning. It thereby becomes a word without
sense, a pure abstraction. We may say in a
general way that a person who does not

recognize the existence of ties between his
family and himself will most probably refuse
to admit that he has any duty towards his
country.

The passing of a law having the effect of
proclaiming the principle that the matrimonial

tic is not indissoluble would be conducive
to the certain destruction of the family, and
that in the near future. Basis for this statement can easily be found by reference to
statistics in governmental reports.

I ask the

House to listen to some figures as to the
number of divorces granted in Canada during
the period from 1901 to 1936. In the period
from 1901 to 1917 the number of divorce
decrees did not reach 100 annually, but from
1917 to 1924 it jumped to 543, and during
the next twelve years it increased from 551
to 1,526. In fact, in those last twelve years
the divorces granted in this country reached
the enormous number of 11,001. I want to
draw attention particularly to the fact that
this destruction of Canadian families has
been terribly progressive. That is shown by
a comparison of the period last mentioned
with a period of equal length, from 1901 to
1912, when the divorces totalled only 395.

Canada is not the only country in which

such a disastrous progression has occurred.

The growth of divorce in the United States,
for instance, is indicated by the following
figures. The number granted per 100,000 of
population in 1890 was 53; in 1900 it was
73; in 1906 it had grown to 84, and by 1916
to 112.

We have no reason to expect that what has

occurred in other countries would not happen

in Canada.

We may be sure that if the

grounds for obtaining divorce are increased,
as is proposed by this Bill, there will be no
way of stopping the nefarious consequences.

that percentage the number of Anglicans who
are opposed ta divorceHan. Mr. BALLA NTYNE: Sorne of thern.
An Hon. SENATOR: No.
Haýn. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I certainly arn not
as well versod in this respect as rny Anglican
colloagues rnay be, but I have always understand fromn the newspapers that the Church of
Enigland is absolutely against divorce. Frorn
what has been said in this debate it is evident
that a considerable number of persans, rnembers of other denorninations, are also against
div orce. If you take thern ail into account,
rnust you not corne ta the conclusion that the
rnajority of the people in this country are,
for roasons of conscience, opposod ta divorce
and bolieve that this Bill would do violence
ta their conscientiaus convictions?
I do not need ta supplernent the argurnents
aiready advanced in opposition ta thie Bill.
In deference ta the appeal of my honourable
friend the senior rnorber frorn Winnipeg
(Hoýn. Mr. McMeans) I should like tao stand
aside in this rnattcr, as I and others ta rny
knowiedgc thave always done for rnany years
in regard ta divorce, but on this occasion it
is a rnattor of principle and it is irnpossible
for rne ta abstain from xoting.
Hon. C. E. TANNER: Honourable rnernbers, as the miover of the Bill lias painted
out, an.d as is shown on the Bill itself, Nova
SGotia hýas had a divorce law since 1758. We
are not a very large cornrunity,
Hon. Mr. CALDER: But a very irnpartant
carnruni ty.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: -but we have a casrnopol.itan population representative of rnany
races. The law of No-va Scotia provides for
divorce on grounds of adultery, irnpotence,
cruelty and cansanguinity. Were you ta ask
rne how rnany divorces are grantied oach year
in Nova Scotia, 1 could nat tell you, for
divorce, being an aId business, is not news.
I read the No0va Scotia papers every day of
rny life, but I neyer see anything in them
about divorce.
Although the grounds of divorce are as
wide as I have stated, 1 have neyer seen as
a rosult any dornoralivation whatever arnong
aur poople. I think that generally speaking
thoy cornpare favourably with thoir fellawcitizens in the othor provinces as regards
public and private conduct. Therefore I feel
it doos not necessarily follow that widening
t'he grounds of divorce w-ill plunge the country into irnrorality.
Our div orce law in Nova Scotia provides
also for alimony and for custody of the
rhjldren. The court looks after the children.

101

In rny judgrnent it bas been during a long
period of tirne a very satisfactory law. 0f
course we differ frorn Hollywood; we are not
the sarne kind of people. I should not like
ta see Hollywood set up as a rnodel of conduct for the people of this country.
As 1 pointed out. thero is no advertisîng
of div orce in Nova Scatia. But this Parliarnent is the greatest advertiser of divorce
cases in the world. First of ail notice rnust
be publishied in the newspapers that there is
gaing ta be an application for divorce; then
the applicant and the defendant, if there is
ana. must corne and appear bofore aur cornrnîttee. Every word of the avidence is put
down in print and published in parnphlet forrn.
and that is placed in the hands of every
rnernber of the Hbuse of Cornrnns and every
member of the Senate. I should be surprised
ta learn that every rnerner of either Hause
puts that evidenca into the waste-paper
basket. I think it triekies all over the country. Elderly rnen in hospitals in Nova Scotia
haveo written ta me asking for copies of the
evidenceSorne Hon. SENATORS:

Oh. oh.

Hon. Mr. TANNER:
-wanting sarne interesting and light reading. Hawever, 1 have
gat into the practîce of puttîng rny copy
into the waste-paper basket.
Han. Mr. CALDER:

That is not safe.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: I sat on the Divorce
Carnrittee for five or six years, until I saw
that the whole thing was standardized. Then
I thaught sornebady cIsc rnîght take a turn
at it. Whenever I look through the reports,
as I sometirnes do, I observe as I did when
I sat on the comrnittee that in ninety-nine
cases out of one hundred the parties are not
living together.
Either the rnan is away
with another wornan, or the wornan is
away with anather rnan.
What are you
going ta do in a case of that kind?
The horne is already broken, up. Are you
gaing ta refuse the aggrieved persan sorne
justice ?
Mareaver. in the cases that corne before
the Sonate, wlien it is a wornan who is applying for the divoarce, no consideration whatever is gi%-an ta the question of support
for that warnan. We nover doal witb ahirnony, nor do we rnake any provision whatever far the children, if thora are any. The
iurisdiction of Parliarnent ta deal with that
matter is questioned; cansequently nothing
15 considered but the question of adultory;
the chilrlren are allowed ta go adrift, and
the wornan, if she is the cornplaining party,
is given no cansideration et ahl. I think that

SENATE
is entirely wrong.
If this Parliament has
not the power to look after the aggrieved
woman and to make some provision for her
and the children, then I say it should cease
to deal with divorces altogether and turn
the whole business over to the courts of the
country, which can deal with these matters.
I quite appreciate any religious objections
to divorce in general. My honourable friend
in front of me (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) said he
understood the Church of England was .opposed to divorce. I think it is in theory. I
happen to belong to that communion, but I
do not feel myself bound by that, and never
will; and I do net think that when I go up
to the Golden Gate. Peter will ask me whether
I voted for a divorce or not.
What I say is this. Under the Constitution of this country, the British North
America Act, the responsibility for divorce is
placed upon this Parliament, and I think it
is the dutv of every member of this Parliament, whether we have religious scruples or
not, te deal with the subject in the interest
of the whole publie. I think that every province in this country should have courts to try
these divorce cases, and that this Parliament
should be entirely rid of the matter.
I am going to vote for this Bill because,
as I say, I do not find my province demoralized at all. I think that insanity, as provided for in the Bill, is a good ground for
I think also that desertion is a
divorce.
good ground, and I am pleased to sec that the
Bill provides for the family and for the
aggrieved woman. If we are going to deal
with divorce at all, let us deal with it conpletely and satisfactorily.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
I think it is the wish of every honourable
member of this House to guard the sanctity
of the marriage vow. In my view marriage is
more than a contract. It has been quite
properly said that family life is the basis of
our civilization, and I think we will all agree
that the woman is the keystone of the family.
Woman's status bas undergone a great
change in the last generation. Privileges and
rights that wcre denied to ber in the past
are now available to ber. As we all know,
she, more frequently than the man, is the
aggrieved member of the family. That is
evidenced, I think, by the fact that at least
three-quarters of the applications for divorce
which come before us are made by women.
If we will but read the evidence given before
our Divorce Committee, I think we will all
agree also tiat as far as the particular family
in question is concerned, the sanctity of
muarriage is pretty much a thing of the past.
I believe that in this matter, to a certain
Hon. Mr. TANNER.

extent, we have to take things as we find
them, and not as we should like them to be.
There are some features of this Bill that
appeal to me. One is the ground of insanity.
I cannot conceive of anything worse than
incurable insanity; to me it means a living
death; and when one of the partners in a
marriage is incurably insane, it does seem to
me that the other partner should be granted
some relief instead of having to live out his
or her life alone because of the misfortune
that has overtaken the partner who had been
selected for life.
I would have this Bill include life imprisonment among the causes for divorce. I know
the right honourable gentleman from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham) said yesterday that a man might get a reprieve. But
can you conceive of a woman whose husband,
through no fault of bers, is sentenced to the
penitentiary for life for committing amurder,
retaining the slightest semblance of the sentiment which induced ber to throw in lier fortunes with his? Can you conceive of her
going back to live with hirm again? Would
she be safe in doing so? To my mind such
a thing is impossible. Is the fact that she
had married a mao who went so far astray as
to commit a murder any reason wiy she
should not have a chance to live? That is
one provision which I think might well be
added to the Bill.
I am not in favour of the promiscuous
divorces referred to by the honourable senator from South Bruce (Hon. Mr. Donnelly).
I would oppose, as I am sure all honourable
members would, anything like that in this
None of us look upon divorce
country.
favourably, but I agree with the bonourable
senator who preceedd me (Hon. Mr. Tanner)
that we must take the situation as we find
it and must deal with it as conservatively as
we can. I think that is our responsibility, and
I believe this Bill should be sent to a committee to be considered. and. if possible,
amended.
For these reasons it is my intention to vote
for the second reading of the Bill.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable members, I wish to say just a word before the
I am not opposed to the
vote is taken.
principle of the Bill. I do not like divorce,
but, as lias been said many times, we have
to reccenize conditions as they are and make
provision to meet them. I understand that
the additional grounds for divorce set forth
in the Bill are similar to those adopted in the
British House of Commons.
Absolutely.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Word for word.
Yes.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:

MARCH 16, 1938
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I must say frankly
that I do not like one or two of those provisions, and unless we can find some means
of modifying or clarifying them I may be
forced to vote against the third reading of
the Bill.
Let me explain. One of the additional
grounds for divorce contained in the Bill is
desertion without cause for a period of at
least three years. I am inclined to think that
period is far too short. Husbands and wives
have difficulties, adultery is committed, and
in many cases the applications for divorce
do not reach us for four, five, six or seven
years. What I mean to say is that in many
cases there is no haste about the matter. I
conceive that there may be collusion in connection with desertion.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: People who want a
divorce may say that the easiest way to get
it is for one of them to desert the other for
a period of three years. I think the time
fixed in the Bill is too short.
A further ground provided in the Bill is
that the respondent has since the celebration
of the marriage treated the petitioner with
cruelty. What is cruelty? How is it brought
about? We all know what is happening on
the other side of the line: there, cruelty is
the main ground for divorce. I think I am
safe in saying that in the United States more
divorces are granted on the ground of cruelty
than for any other cause. There is no attempt made in the Bill to define the meaning
of cruelty. There are all kinds of cruelty. In
the United States many divorces are granted
on the ground of mental cruelty. Are we going
to create a condition whereby our courts
may eventually accept that kind of cruelty
as a reason for granting divorce? I doubt
the advisability of that, and when the Bill
reaches committee-if it does- I should like
to see some real effort made to restrict the
meaning of the word "cruelty" in such a way
that it may be properly dealt with by the
courts. Otherwise we may have in this country
a situation similar to the one which prevails
on the other side of the line.
I agree with much that has been said regarding the granting of a divorce for insanity.
When a person has been incurably insane
for a period of, say, five years, it seems
reasonable that a divorce should be granted.
But we have to look at that clause very carefully. The court has to decide whether or not
the insanity is incurable, and it is quite conceivable that unless we place restrictions
around that provision divorces may be granted

103

which should not be granted. I am quite
sure that in the great majority of cases the
courts would demand full proof, but, as we
all know, a person may be sent to an insane
asylum, be adjudged incurably insane by
those in charge, and yet be cured. That has
happened time and again. I think that the
question of the incurability of an insane
person should be hedged around in such a way
that there may be no mistake. I propose to
vote for the second reading in the hope that
certain amendments may be made to the Bill
in committee.
Hon. ANTOINE J. LEGER: Honourable
members, I wish to associate myself with those
who have spoken against the second reading
of the Bill now under consideration. Section
3 of the Bill would affect New Brunswick,
as in that province we have a court of divorce.
In New Brunswick divorce a vinculo matrimonii is granted on the grounds of frigidity, impotence, adultery, and consanguinity
within a prohibited degree. Our Act provides
that the issue of the marriage shall not in
any case be bastardized or be in any way
prejudicially affected. There is also provision
that the wife shall not be barred of her dower,
nor the husband deprived of any tenancy by
the courtesy of England, if the court so
determines.
I may add further that in New Brunswick
adultery is a misdemeanour, a crime punishable by indictment. In that respect we stand
in a little different position from the other
provinces. Demands have often been made
upon the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick to remove adultery from the list
of crimes. The Legislature has always refused
to do this, because it was felt that by so
doing it would widen, as it were, the opportunities for divorce. So I conclude that our
province is not divorce-minded. On the contrary, down there we deplore the constant increase in the number of cases. So I am opposed to any means of facilitating the granting
of divorce.
Many arguments against divorce have been
advanced by honourable senators who have
preceded me. I do not wish to repeat their
points. But this further thought occurs to me,
that persons who marry associate themselves,
as it were, for life, and the very object of
that act is the procreation of children. It
therefore follows that before divorce is granted
the children concerned, if any, should be
consulted. Otherwise a great injustice is done
to those innocent parties who are, if I may
put it this way, a natural consequence of the
partnership established at the time of the
marriage.

SENATE
In my consideration of this Bill certain
questions have come to my mind. Would its
passage have the effect of strengthening and
uniting the family? Would it improve the
outlook of our people? Would it direct us to
a higher conception of life? Would it tend
to improve society, to create better understanding between the different races and creeds
that make up our Dominion? Would it
strengthen the bonds of friendship that exist
or should exist betwecn the church and the
civil power? I believe that not only would
the measure fail to accomplish these things,
but its effect would in every instance be to
make them more difficult of accomplishment.
Thetrefore I cannot support the motion for
second reading. I know that some people
hold marriage to be only a civil contract, but,
as was so well stated yesterday by the bonourable senator from Ottawa East (Hon. Mr.
Côté). many others-and they make up a respectable minority, if not indeed a majority,
in this country, comprising all creeds and
races-regard it as being far more than that.
I am one of those, and therefore I urge that
this House should be careful not to open
wider the gate te undesiraible forces that would
assail and endanger our family life and our
Canadian society.
Hon. E. S. LITTLE: Honourable senators,
it is not often that I burden this House with
my views, but I feel that I should state, very
briefly, my reasons for supporting the motion
for second reading of this Bill. I have been
a member of the Divorce Committee almost
ever since I was appointed to the Senate,
and I cannot but have strong views on the
subject now before us.
Since 1930 nearly all the work of this committee bas come from the province of Quebec,
which has not seen fit to have its courts accept
the responsibility that is imposed upon courts
in the other provinces. I believe that this
year there are more than 76 cases on the list
for our consideration. and the time for receiving petitions bas not yet expired.
One cannot associate oneself with the work
of the Divorce Committee of this House, or
the courts of the provinces, without realizing
that our recognition of only one ground for
divorce creates an intolcrable position. Many
honourable senators who have preeeded me
have expressed fear that this proposed legislatien would tend further to break up home and
family life. On the contrary, I believe that
nothing leads so surely to an impossible
domestic situation as the holding together of
two persons who have not, and never again
can have, anything whatever in common,
because one of them, through bis or ber own

fault, or possibly on account of uncontrollable
circumstances, bas utterly failed to live up to
the original idea behind the union.
Only on Sunday last I read in Winston
Churchill's "Great Contemporaries" a quotation from a speech made by Lord Birkenhead
on the Matrimonial Causes Bill in March, 1920
-which, by -the way, is considered to be the
finest speech of his life. May I read to the
Senate an extract from that speech, which
I quote from the Life of Frederick Edwin,
Earl of Birkenhead, by his son? The quotatien is to be found on pages 131 and 132

which I accept, that dozens of annulments of
marriages are being granted in the city of
Montreal. The thing is not right, and I say
again, let us corne clean, and let the courts
decide when marriages should be annulled.
Of course, I shall vote for the second reading of this Bill.
Hon. J. H. RAINVILLE: I am not greatly
interested in this Bill, but I am interested in
the speech made by the honourable senator
who bas just taken bis seat (Hon. Mr. Murdock). He bas dealt with what is a matter
of provincial jurisdiction. I do not know
from whom he has received bis information,
but if he would go to Montreal and discuss
with one of the judges there who had granted
several of the annulments to which he referred, he would find that all those cases were
dealt with under the Civil Code.
Let me cite this case for the honourable gentleman's consideration. Not long ago a certain
husband and bis wife were not on very
happy terms, and he said to her: "Why
don't you go off for a four-month holiday?
I will pay your expenses. When you come
back maybe we shall be able to get along
better." The wife went away. During her
absence the husband obtained from Toronto
what purported to be a certificate of ber death.
This certificate was produced to the proper
authorities and on the strength of it the man
was rnarried to another woman. Later it
developed that the certificate was obtained by
fraudulent representations and that in fact the
wife was still alive. The case is pending
before the Montreal courts. I suppose this
will be reported as another broken marriage.
I repeat to my honourable friend that I
should like to have him meet one of our
judges in Montreal to discuss the matrimonial
cases which the judge bas dealt with according to the laws of Qu.ebec. Under our law in

107

Quebec judicial separations are granted, but
the parties so separated cannot marry again.
We in Quebec regard marriage as a sacrament, not as merely a civil contract. We
respect the views of those who do not agree
with us, and all we ask in return is that our
convictions shall also be respected.
This Bill specifies cruelty as an additional
ground for divorce.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Will my honourable
friend tell us about the dozens of annulments
which, the honourable senator from Alma
mentioned? My honourable friend bas dealt
with only one annulment.
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: That is a point of
law. In our province a minor cannot marry
without the consent of his parents or
guardians. Should he go through a form of
marriage without such consent the ceremony
is not valid; in other words, according to our
law, he is not married at all.
I was about to discuss the addition of
cruelty as a ground for divorce. This HouseRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Before the
honourable gentleman discusses that point,
will he kindly clear up something which has
been in my mind for some time? I must say
at once that I have not given it special study
from the lawyer's standpoint. If Quebec or
any other province can legislate as to the
right of an individual to marry-for instance,
that so-and-so, under twenty-one years of age,
cannot marry without the consent of parents
or guardian-will the honourable gentleman
tell me of any legislation which the Parliament
of Canada could pass with respect to marriage?
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: None.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But the
Constitution says the Parliament of Canada
has jurisdiction over marriage and divorce.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But not over
the solemnization of marriage, which covers
procedure.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But the competency to marry is not a matter of solemnization. I will put this to my honourable
friend opposite: If the provinces have the
right to say who can and who cannot marry,
will he tell me anything the Parliament of
Canada can do with respect to marriage at
all? I have exhausted my brain and have
not been able to think of a single Act we
could pass, with any meaning in the world,
on any phase of marriage. Still the British
North America Act says the Parliament of
Canada has jurisdiction over marriage. I
should like the point cleared up.

108

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think I can
answer my right bonourable friend's question.
It is true that section 91, paragraph 26, gives
the Federal Parliament jurisdiction over
marriage and divorce; but it is equally true
that paragraph 12 of section 92 gives jurisdiction to the provinces over "The solemnization
of marriage in the province.'
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I confess that
I have always looked upon this division as
an extraordinary one, and the query in my
right honourable friend's mind bas also been
in mine. and as iveli in the minds of many
people throughout the country. As to why
that division was made I am net ready to
answer my right honourable friend.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I arn stuck.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

So am I.

Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Mayv I ask the
honourable senator a question following that
put by the right bonourable leader on the
other side? It has alwvs been a puzzle to
me just why the mixed marriages we hear so
much about are being annulled. Suppose a
young woman. a Catholic, and a young man,
a Protestant, both in every way qualified for
marriage, marry and live together for a time,
and then the wife gocs before a court of
justice in Quebec, can she get an annulment
of her marriage because she was married, we
will say, by a Protestant minister?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
allowed to say a word-

I might be

Some Hon. SENATORS: Order!
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I thought my
honourable friend from Repentigny (Hon.
Mr. Rainville) had finished.
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: I may tell my
honourable friend that, not having practised
law for the last thirty years, I an not in a
position to answer his question as to annulment of a marriage between a Protestant
woman and a Catholic man, or vice versa.
I know that in some
cases such marriages
have been annulled in the courts of Montreal.
I repeat, I am not ready to answer his question
now. But that, again. is a provincial affair.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is the
question. Is it?
lon. Mr. MURDOCK: Does my honourable friend say the fact tîat the British North
America Act gives the Federal Government
jurisdiction over marriage and divorce is a
provincial affair?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE:
The honourable
gentleman had better read the Act. We may
have a chance to discuss it before long.
Cruelly is to be added as a ground for
divorce. That word is capable of a very
wide interpretation. I do not know whether
its interpretation would become as wide in
this country as it bas become in the United
States, but I should like to refer to a case
that is known to a great many honourable
members of this louse. Very recently a man
by the name of Culbertson, who is known as
a bridge authority, had some dispute with his
wifeHon. Mr. MlRAE:

Over bridge?
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: Over bridge. She
made an application for divorce on the ground
of cruelty, and the court granted the decree.
About four weeks later the woman came back,
and now these people are together again.
That shows how far we may go in interpreting
crruelty. If that can be cited as an example
of what is going to happen in this country, I
say that marriage, which we regard as a serious
matter, would be nothing but a joke. For
this reason I am going to vote against the Bill.
lion. C. C. BALLANTYNE:
Honourable
muembers. I arn not a lawyer, and as this is
a somexwhat delicate question, especially in
my own province, I do not care to say very
mucli about the annulments that have taken
place in the city where I live. My Catholic
friends will agree with me, I think. in what
I an about to say, but if they consider that
I an not stating the case correctly. I hope they
will tell me se. A mixed mariage in my province-that is, a marriage between a Catholic
and a Protestant-performed by a Catholic
priest is legal and binding; but a mixed
marriage perforied by a Protestant minister,
is according to Ihe canon law and in the eyes
of the Catholic Church not a marriage ut all.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR:

Thiat is the idea.

[Ion. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Legally, Prolestant ministers have the same right to performi a marriage ceremony as the priests of the
Catholi' Church.
But a great many marringes have been nullified. For instance, there
was the Despalie annulment case, which was
carried to the Judiciail Committee of the Privy
Council in England, where it was held that
the annulment was invalid because it had no
basis in fact or in iaw. We can agree to disagree on this question, but we cannot overlook
the great hardship and the injustice that
follow in the wake of these annulments.
Before a couple can marry they must obtain
a marriage licence. The responsibility is upon
those who issue the licence to sec that the

MARCH 16, 1938
young man and the young woman are of a
proper age. I will just cite the case of a
marriage performed by Canon Gower-Rees, of
which I read in the Montreal press. A couple
appeared before him, one a Catholic and the
other a Protestant, with the proper licence
and the necessary witnesses. He married them,
and the registration was made in the usual
way and witnessed. After a lapse of time-I
cannot state just what it amounted to-the
wife, who was the Catholic in this case, appeared before one of the Montreal courts and
said: "I was married by this Protestant minister. I was not of age. I did not have the
consent of my parents," and so on. Canon
Gower-Rees was summoned to court and put
through a rather stiff cross-examination. He
said: "It is not my responsibility to know
the ages of the parties. If the licence shows
that they are of marriageable age, the responsibility is upon those who issued the licence."
In the city where I live there is undoubtedly
a considerable feeling that no court in the
province has a right under the canon law to
annul any marriage performed by a Catholic
priest or by a Protestant minister if it is in
.accordance with the civil law of the province.
I (o not hold any narrow views myself,
there being in my own small family Catholics,
Anglicans and Presbyterians. We are very
much mixed.
I should like to hear from the leader of the
IIouse (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) or from some
other lawyer who understands federal and
provincial jurisdiction better than I do, just
how it is that when a marriage is performed
legally, and in accordance with the law of
the province, a judge of the Superior Court
in Montreal can annul the marriage because
the man or the woman does not happen to be
of a certain faith.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question? In what way
would this Bill have the effect of amending
the situation mentioned by him?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: It affects the
situation in this way. During this discussion
many speakers have laid stress upon the disabilities that would fall upon the children if
this Bill were to go through. They have said
it would result in a loosening of the rule, and
would increase the possibility of divorce. My
honourable friend would say that in our province an annulment is not a divorce at all-that
they are totally different things. He would
tell me that divorce dissolves marriage, but
that in the case of an annulment no marriage
ever existed. I think that when we are discussing this Bill and its effects I am quite
within the rules of the House in discussing
also the question of marriage.

Some Hon. SENATORS:

Question!

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I do not intend to
inflict myself on the HouseSome Hon. SENATORS:

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: -but my honourable colleague from Montreal (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne) has put a question. Do you want
it answered?
Some Hon. SENATORS: No.

I should like to

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: If you do not want
an answer to the question the honourable
gentleman has put frorn his own point of
view, I am not going to insist, but I understood that he wanted both sides of the case
put before you.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

No.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I think we should
hear it. I do not understand yet.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
marriage is a sacrament.

In my province

Hon. Mr. DUFF: It is in other provinces.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I am speaking of
the province of Quebec.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: In my church it is a
sacrament.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Is it not a sacrament in every province?
An Hon. SENATOR: In every church.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I am not denying
that. I am saying that in the province of
Quebec marriage is a sacrament. I do not contest the statement that it may be also in other
provinces. However, marriage being a sacrament, the Civil Code of the province of
Quebec says that a marriage can be valid
only if made according to the laws of religion;
not only the Catholic religion, but any religion.
That is the first answer.
My honourable friend has cited the case
of a minor who was married without the consent of her parents or guardians. He has said
that several years afterwards she laid a complaint and obtained an annulment of her
marriage. I contest that statement absolutely.
The article of the Code says that if after six
months there has been no complaint there
can be no dissolution of the marriage.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Thirdly, my honourable friend comes here and says: "How
extraordinary it is that you people should be-

that statement?

Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: Each church has its
own rules. The Catholie Church in certain
cases recognizes the annulment of marriage.
It does not go further. The law says that
marriage is subject to the rules of every
church.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Not one annulment. And now, if you are not satisfied, I

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I rise to a point
of order. The honourable gentleman has addressed this House on the main question. Can
he get up again?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: My honourable
friend is right. But I was asked to answer
a question, and I think I was entitled to
do so.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Now that I have
answered, I sit down.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Are there dozens
of annulments in Montreal?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: "Dozens of annulments" is a figure of speech. If you want to
know the number I shall endeavour to obtain
the information for you. You will find that
there is not one annulment to a hundred
divorces.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Is there one law in
your province for a Protestant and another
law for a Catholic?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: No.
Hon. P. E. BLONDIN: This discussion having gone so far, I think I should make my
position clear. If we refer to the Civil Code
it will be apparent, I think, that since Confederation there bas never been any doubt
of the right of the Provincial Legislature to
deal with this matter. The article of the
Code dealing with marriage says that the
validity of the marriage is subject to the rules
of the church to which the parties belong.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:

All churches.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But if the
parties belong to two different churches and
the rules of those churches differ, what is
the effect of the law?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That is the point.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN:
I do net know
whether I can make my point clear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Who can?
Hon. M\r. BEAUBIEN.

Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: I know. It comes
back to the point the right honourable
gentleman has raised, and so long as the situation is not cl.arified, so long as the law remains
as it is, I think it is useless for the Senate
to discuss the question. Catholic and Protestant churches have nothing to do with it
so long as the law remains as it is. The
judge is following the law.
Hon. Mr. HARMER: No.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: A person who is
married contrary to the rules of his own
church admits the nullity of the marriage
because of the rules of that church net having been followed.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The same would apply
if the Protestant churches had a similar rule.
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN:

Exactly.

Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR:
not.

Hon. Mr. McMEANS moved that the Bill

of honourable senators Aseltine, Ballantyne,

all right with that committee.
I should like my

That all the words after "That," in the first
line, be stricken out and that there be substituted therefor: "a committee of the Senate be
appointed to inquire into and report upon the
best means of relieving the country from this
extremely serions railway condition and financial burden consequent thereto, with power to
call for persons, papers and records, and that
the said committee consist of fourteen senators,
to be named by the leaders of both sides of this
House, after consultation."
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I did not see
the final wording, but it strikes me that the
portion which states the committee will be
selected by the leaders in consultation is not
quite regular. If it passes in that form the
names do not need to come before the House
at all. I think they should. In my opinion
the latter part of the motion should be
omitted.

The Senate resumed from Wednesday,
March 9, the adjourned debate on the motion
by Hon. Mr. Beaubien:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the
Government should be urged to settle the railway problem of Canada at an early date in

Railways, and which already amounts to several
billion dollars.
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators,
on Wednesday last I made some remarks
relative to the amendment which I propose
to move. After all the eloquence and lack
of eloquence to which we have listened this
afternoon, I will not burden the House with
further remarks. But I must not forget to
senators opposite who
thank honourable
volunteered to second my amendment. However, none of these offers could be accepted,
as I had already mentioned the name of the
honourable senator from Wentworth (Hon. E.
'D. Smith) as seconder. The amendment I
wish to move is as follows:

CANADA'S RAILWAY PROBLEM
MOTION-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion by Hon. Mr.
Beaubien:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the Government should be urged to settle the railway
problem of Canada at an early date in order
to stop the ruinous loss made each year by
the Dominion through the Canadian National
Railways, and which already amounts to several
billion dollars.
And the amendment proposed by Hon. Mr.
Black:
That all words after "that" in the first line
be stricken out and that there be substituted
therefor: " a committee of the Senate be
appointed to inquire into and report upon the
best means of relieving the country from its
extremely serions railway condition, and financial burden consequent thereto, with power to
send for persons, papers and records, and that
said committee consist of fourteen senators."
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, this afternoon we are supposed to
consider further the motion that was moved
and spoken to by the honourable senator
from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) on
March 2. During every part of my discussion
of this matter I shall try to remember the
thought which the honourable gentleman said
was in his mind when he commenced his
speech. He said he would attempt to support
this motion "by a brief for the forgotten
taxpayer of this country." And he added:
"The taxpayer clamours for relief. He is
I
entitled to sympathetic consideration."
whole-heartedly subscribe to that view, and
shall undertake to analyse what there is in
the honourable senator's proposal, as I see it,
for the relief of the forgotten taxpayers of
Canada. I shall endeavour to show, and I
think I shall be able to show, that the ultimate
result of the proposal would be not relief,
but rather distress for our taxpayers and the
requirement of further money contributions
from them.
It is a rather peculiar circumstance, and I
am quite sure it was an oversight, that
although the honourable gentleman argued
very earnestly and consistently for the presentday application of the Senate resolution of
1925, he failed to give at this late date, some
thirteen years later, a concrete demonstration
of what the resolution really meant. I shall
try to do that right now. The Senate
adopted the resolution on the 25th day of
June, 1925--one day before prorogation. In
his discussion of the matter two weeks ago
my honourable friend read part of this resolution, but, as it appears to me, not its funda-

mental part. He did not read that part which
I think would have shown conclusively that
it had as its purpose not relief for the forgotten taxpayers, but something entirely
different. However, let me place on Hansard
the terms of the resolution. It will be found
at page 695 of Senate Hansard for June 25,
1925. It reads as follows:
(e) The merging of the two railway systeins
for purposes of administration and operation.
That both the Canadian Pacifie Railway and
the Canadian National Railway should be
placed under the management of a Board of
fifteen directors, five to be named by the
Canadian Pacific Railway, five to be named
by the Government, and these ten to choose
five proven, capable business men to complete
the Board: these last five directors to hold
office for ten years and to be removed only
for cause.
That a recapitalization be made of the Canadian National Railways from the point of
view of earning capacity.
That the Canadian Pacifie Railway be guaranteed an agreed dividend on its stock.
That in the event of the joint management
producing a surplus, a div-idend at the same
rate as is paid to the Canadian Pacifie Railway
be paid to the Government on the capitalization
placed on the Government Railways. After
the payment of these dividends any surplus
earnings available for distribution be divided
between the Canadian Pacifie Railway and the
Canadian National Railways, in proportion to
the valuation of the two systems.
That is a portion of the resolution adopted
by the Senate in 1925.

managership? That is my first question. My
second question is this: Is it not a fact that
for years Sir Edward Beatty has stated-

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Will my honourable friend allow me to put a question to
him?

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: All right. In any
case I am speaking for the forgotten taxpayers, and am going to try to find out as
soon as i can how this proposal of my honourable friend will serve the interests of the
forgotten taxpayers; for, believe it or not,
I am just as much concerned in trying to do
something for the forgotten taxpayers as my
honourable friend can possibly be.
It is a peculiar and somewhat fortunate
circumstance, perhaps, that the Sunday before
my honourable friend spoke on tihis question
I read editorials in two or three papers. I
do not intend to quote as many as my honourable friend did, but in the course of my
rermarks I shall refer to at least two or three
very important publications in the Dominion.
I quote from an editorial in the Montreal
Standard. It is captioned, "The Boundaries
of a Dream," and, in part, is as follows:
In the past there bas been no ceiling to the
cloud-capped palace of drearms which we built
for our Prairie West. We held to the theory
that the Twentieth Century belonged to Canada and that the illimitable Prairie, whose
rich black loam we took as an augury of
fortune, was the appointed treasure house
where we could cash in on it. We followed the
gleam. The golden gleam of the wheat.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: He said a moment
ago that when I quoted the 1925 resolution
of the Senate I omitted the part which he has
just read. Is that net so?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I cannot find in my
honourable friend's address that part of the
resolution which states that the Canadian
Pacifie Railway is to be guaranteed an agreed
dividend on its stock. If he will tell me
where I can find it in his speech, I will
abjectly apologize.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: No. I say that
portion was carefully eliminated from the
resolution which I read. Is that net true?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
friend did not quote it.

My

honourable

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: No. Therefore is
it not a fact that the portion of the resolution
which I read was simply that which recommends as a principle, and nothing else, joint
lon. Mr. MURDOCK.

Hon.
that.

Mr. MURDOCK:

I shall come to

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Just a second. Is
it net a fact that for years Sir Edward Beatty
has stated that of course he never envisaged
anything like that at all, but was perfectly
satisfied that each road should get the revenue
from its own lines, and that whatever saving
was made should be equitably divided between
the two lines?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Who is making this
speech?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I want to know if
my friend is acquainted with that fact.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I am net going to
enter into a discussion with my honourable
friend now. He may desire to change the
language in which he originalily placed this
resolution before us. As I understood, all
the way througb the proposal was to implementHon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: No.
implement
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: -to
the resolution of the Senate passed in 1925.
My honourable friend now says no.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The principle, yes.

MARCH 17, 1938
We were to become the granary of the
Empire. Brilliant economists, more brilliant
than cautions, saw the West feeding a hungry
world with a billion bushels of wheat a year
and more if necessary.
Actually at its peak year Canada produced
566 million bushels of wheat; but it was conceded that this was only a fraction of what
could be expected in the future.
And now please note:
And so we encouraged captains of industry
to build railways that the West would not
need for 50 years to come, railways to provide
long hauls for the wheat, railways to make
short cuts for the wheat, railways to drag
the wheat via tbe Arctic Circle at a time
when the ice was frozen to a Europe which
had no money to buy it, railways here, there
and everywhere for this, that and everything
-oodles of railways.
Our captains of industry did this with a
rigit good will, being confident that the people
of Canada would not sec them stuck, but
would take the baby over when it began to
mewl in its nurse's arms. The people of Canada did. The result is that the West has
railways to burn or-tear up.
May I now go back a few years farther
to find out wbether my honourable friend
from Montarville is one of those public men
to whom the Standard editorial refers? I
-think lie is. I turn back to 1916-long before
I ever dreamed of being under this roofand I find in the closing days of that session
my honourable friend undertaking, with his
usual eloquence, to induce this House to agree
to the purchase by the Canadian Government
of two or three railways that, in my judgment, have never since paid for the axle
grease necessary to run trains over their rails.
My honourable friend spoke at considerable
length, but I shall quote only his elosing
appeal to this House. It will be found at
page 563 of Senate Hansard of May 17,
1916, and is as follows:
What is going to be the revenue from these
roads, roughly speaking? The two roads that
are now paying a revenue, the Quebec and
Montmorency and the Lotbinière and Megantie,
bring in $83,000.
The Government is now
spending, because there is no railway on the
north shore, $80,000 that can be saved. It is
paying for the transportation of mail to other
railways about $5,400; for the operation of
the Intercolonial
railway, Rivière Ouelle
brancb, $22,000, and $52,000 for the ferry from
Rivière Ouelle to Murray Bay, or in round
figures $80,000. Add this saving of $80,000 to
the $83,000 produced by the Quebec and Montmorency and the Lotbinière and Megantie and
Now, honouryou obtain a total of $163,000.
able gentlemen, is it not fair to think that
the Quebec and Saguenay will earn something?
On the same ratio of earning per mile as the
Quebec and Montmorency, the Quebec and
Therefore
Saguenay ought to earn $120,000.
in savings, in actual and most probable earnings, we have in sight practically 5 per cent
on the amount invested. Under these circumstances I will certainly vote for the Bill.
51958-84

The vote was to acquire those particular
railways in the province of Quebec.
What bas happened since 1925 in regard
to the building of railways-.with all of which
I feel quite sure my honourable friend had
something to do, though I have not checked
up on it? I find that since 1925 forty-eight
branch lines of railway have been built at a
cost of $57,744,105.13, their total length being
1,572.46 miles. This mileage is distributed
as follows:

Ontario.. ..
172-62
Manitoba.. ..............
888-69
Saskatchewan.. ............

151-29
British Columbia.. ..........
These figures, I may say, are contained in a
return made in another place a few days ago.
Now I come to this so-called question of
Some years ago the word
amalgamation.
"amalgamation" was generally used in connection with the proposal to consolidate these
two railways.
In recent years, for some
reason or other, a different term 'bas been
used-a term which I have heard people say
did not mean amalgamation. I was so interested in finding out the difference between
amalgamation and unification that I checked
up in the dictionary. This is what I find.
Amalgamation is a union or junction into
one body or whole: unification is the act of
uniting into one. Therefore we can agree, I
hope, that amalgamation and unification mean
one and the same thing. I may be unduly
suspicions, but I have an idea that the word
"unification" bas been used, ever since the
word "amalgamation" was passed into the
discard in the city of Winnipeg in 1930.
Here may I pause for a moment to mention
the reference made the other day by the
right honourable leader on the other side
of the House (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen).
He dumbfounded me, and others, I think, by
certain references to the importance, as I
understood him, of amalgamating the railroads, when be said:
I have for my part given up hope that you
can do anything so long as you are going to
bave these alternate Governments, each smashing everything donc by its predecessor-so long
as you are going to have a return of government interference after each election-so long
as you are going to have sectional appeals to
the employees of the railways against a political
party because it would dare even to consider
anything in the nature of unified management.
One honourable gentleman asked me: "What
did hie mean? Is he against democracy?" Of
course I did not assume any such thing. "Is
he suggesting that only a dictatorship can

116

SENATE

solve the railway problems of Canada?" I
said, "Oh, no; that is not what is meant."
But the point I got from my right honourable
friend's remark was that in political campaigns
there had been sectional appeals on this
question of railroads. Am I unfair in suggesting that never in the history of Canada
was a greater sectional appeal made than
when the policy of "co-operation ever, amalgamation never" was enunciated in Winnipeg?
Many people in this Canada of ours continue to believe that what is said by distinguished men on the platform during a
campaign is Simon-pure good sense, honest conviction and truth. But are we not justified in
assuming that the statement I have referred
to was the one that settled the word "amalgamation" in the minds of certain honourable
gentlemen for a number of years to come?
Why do those who want to bring about
amalgamation not use that word? "It is non
grata," I heard someone say, "and therefore
they use the word 'unification,' which means
the samne thing, though some people may not
know it."
Then my right honourable friend on the
other side (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) did
something that I, although I am pretty rough,
do not know that I would do: he undertook to criticize and to place much of the
blame upon a dead man. I am agreeing that
he is right. I am agreeing that there was a
squandermania running riot at a certain time.
But what was the result, may I ask? Do I
know, or am I entirely mistaken? We find
that that squandermania was stopped, as perhaps it should have been; that there was a
greater check upon it than in former times.
But what was the next step? It was the
appointment of a distinguished Canadian at
$30,000 a year. To do what? To bring about
co-operation between the Canadian Pacific
Railway and the Canadian National Railways
so as to provide an up-to-date railroad service throughout the Dominion of Canada at
a minimum of cost. "Co-operation ever,
amalgamation never!"
Then what did we find as to the operations
of that $30,000-a-year gentleman? We found,
as the records will show, that that gentleman
appeared before a committee of this House
and when asked who were the officials
appointed by the Canadian National Railways to co-operate with a like committee of
the Canadian Pacifie Railway he intimated
that he knew the chairman, but did not know
the other two members. This was after he
had for many months been drawing at the
rate of $30,000 a year for a prime and specific
purpose. Perhaps it is not necessary to reRon. Mr.

MURDOCK.

hash some of this, but, considering where
we have gone along this line of discussion, I
do not think it will do any harm to bring
out some of these points.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Mr. Fullerton
is net here, and in rising I have no interest
but to see that he gets justitce. Has the
honourable gentleman the quotation from the
evidence to show that he did not know who
were on the committee which was to perform
this co-operative work?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: My right honourable friend and I both sat in front of him
and heard him say that. We both know, as
other members of our committee know, that
he could not give the names.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do net
recall it at all.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Oh, well, it was
well known by all.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I do not remember
it, and I was a member of the committee.
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: There has
been some fermentation in the honourable
member's mind since.
Hon. .Mr. MURDOCK: Not at all. I and
several other members of the committec were
discouraged and appalled at the ignorance of
a man who was paid $30,000 a year for doing
certain t'hings, and who yet did net know the
names of those to whom he had entrusted
that work.
Then we can pass along, possibly, to a
further reference in this matter. My honourable friend from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien), as I said a little while ago, made many
references to newspaper recommendations and
statements. I think, therefore, that what I
say will be accepted with greater appreciation
by the Senate if I quote from at least one
or two newspapers that stand pretty high in
the newspaper world of Canada. I notice
that the Ottawa Journal is cited as the most
quoted paper in Canada. On the 21st of
December, 1937, the Ottawa Journal had an
editorial worth considering. I sent a copy
of it and a copy of the reply that was made
to it to mjy honourable friend from Montarville, before ho spoke in this House. I think
it is just as well to put that editorial into
the record, and also the answer which came
froim a distinguished Canadian who ought to
know what he is talking about.
The editorial reads:
How Would $75,000,000

Be Saved?

There's a fresh drive on for the unification
of Canada's two railways.
Day after day
public men and newspapers are saying that
unification would result in an animal saving

MARCH 17, 1938
of from $60,000,000 to $75,000,000. This claim
has been made-and broadcast all over Canada
-twice
in recent days.
The trouble is that the people and newspapers
which claim such a possible saving don't tell
how, or where, such a vast sum could be saved.
It is a serious omission. Certainly if this
country can save $75,000,000 a year on its
transportation bill-which would wipe out the
Canadian National Railways deficit and give
us $35,000,000 to boot-then it's up to those
who make such a claim to tell us more about it.
There's Sir Edward Beatty. No one would
charge Sir Edward Beatty with wrong motives,
with lack of sincerity. He is a great Canadian.
Yet The Journal, certainly in no captious mood,
would like to ask Sir Edward a question or
several questions. In one of his more recent
speeches, delivered at Windsor, Ontario (we
have the printed text of the speech before us),
Sir Edward said:
"Estimates of the possible economies of
unified management
of the
railways of
$60,000,000 and $75,000,000 per annum were
submitted in evidence to the Duff Commission
by the executives of the Canadian railways."
What we should like to ask Sir Edward

to himself and to the public, if Le would tell,
roughly at least, where and how unification of
railways would save Canada from $60,000,000
to $75,000,000 annually.
Fortunately, I have bere the reply of Sir
Edward Beatty under date of January 7, 1938.
The inference as to newspaper opinion which
was drawn by my honourable friend opposite
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) is inconceivable to me.
Perhaps I have a brain storm, for I cannot
understand what Sir Edward Beatty means
by his answers. Other honourable senators
may be able to understand them when they
are placed after the questions which I have
just read. The Ottawa Journal of January
7, 1938, published the questions and answers,
together with a letter from Sir Edward, under
the heading, "Sir Edward Beatty and The
Journal," as follows:
To the Editor of The Journal:

Parliament Buildings, with snterest compounded
for seventy years, would stand in the books
to-day at much more than a hundred millions.
For instance, the first cost of our national
canals bas been $260,000,000. If interest had
been added in the Government books, the cost
would be represented as far more than that.
For instance, the first cost of our river and
harbour improvements bas been $300,000,000.
Some of the great harbours pay interest on
Government loans, but a considerable part of
this improvement of navigation facilities has
been paid by the Government, and no account
taken in the books of interest on the expenditure.
For instance, large sums for erecting post
offices throughout Canada have been paid by
the Government. These sums are paid and
forgotten.
For instance, large sums are paid for customs
bouses, for armouries, for Government vessels,
for penitentiaries, for experimental farmsand in no case is any item entered in the Government books for interest on the expenditure.
For instance, vast sums have been advanced
by the Dominion Government in recent years

followed of entering an interest charge on all
such expenditure, and adding that to our statement of national debt, our national debt to-day
would be presented to the world as, perhaps,
a thousand million dollars more than it is.
Then why apply such a principle to the
Canadian National Railways?
Part of the debt of the Canadian National
Railways is owed to private bondholders. That
interest must be paid; and it is a proper charge
to be made against the National Railways
annually; and figured as deficit when the Government bas to pay it. But should the part of
the railway debt that is due to the Government
have interest added to it annually-and not
only interest on the principal, but interest upon
the interest-and alleged to be deficit, when
no such principle in any other case of the
public works of Canada exists?
We submit that the present system of setting forth the finance of the Canadian National
Railways is a gross wrong to the National
Railways, and a grave public danger.
It is a gross wrong because it hurts the
National Railways in the public mind, and
hurts the morale of the service. It is a grave
danger; because as is possible, if there should
corne to be a question of amalgamation of the
C.N.R. and C.P.R., the negotiations may follow
a completely unjust course to the C.N.R. because of the fictitious deficit which the Government books solemnly produce.
Now I come to my honourable friend's
suggestion, which I think he urged more than
once, that the Senate's resolution of 1925
should be recognized and, as I understood
him, made effective. I realize that the subjectmatter under discussion has been considerably

119

changed by the amendment proposed by the
honourable senator from Westmorland (Hon.
Mr. Black), but in any case we have been
insistently told that it would be a good thing
for Canada to put the 1925 resolution into
effect now. I am going to read part of a
speech made by the President of the Canadian
Pacific Railway on March 16, 1926. That was
the year after the passing of the Senate resolution, which ,proposed to amalgamate the
two railroads and to make a first charge on
the operations of the amalgamated lines an
agreed dividend to the Canadian Pacifie. Well,
it bas been said that wise men change their
minds, while men of the other kind do not.
Let us see what E. W. Beatty, as he was
then, thought of that proposaI. He said:
Nothing is more important to the successful
operation of Canada's railways than fair rate

Pressure is periodically brought

to bear looking to the granting of rate concessions on grounds of national or local interest, and I fear that many Canadians feel
that difference in the character of ownership
of these railways involves a difference in
attitude towards the matter of adequate
revenues. The only existing problem respecting
rates is their reasonableness and freedom from
unjust discrimination.
And a little later on he said!:
I hope I shall not live to sec the day when
Canadian railways are nationalized, because I
would regard the nationalization of these huge
properties, without competition and politically
influenced in their administration, as would
inevitably be the case, to constitute the greatest political and commercial menace this country
could possibly experience. As conditions are,
.there is no sounder nor safer principle than
that laid down in the letter and spirit of the
Railway Act.
But just a few months ago, on November
27, 1937, I was at a meeting of the Canadian
Club of Ottawa, in the Chateau Laurier,
and heard Sir Edward Beatty make a splendid
speech, from which it appears that he bas
materially changed some of his views. He
was dealing with the average citizen, and in
the course of his remarks said:
Or take my own pet subject, the railway
question. For some years I actively advocated
the unified operation of our two great systems.
I do not any longer.
I merely point out
that unification is inevitable, and while others
produce endless reasons for delay, no one any
longer denies this.
We have too much railway transportation in
Canada, and as a result we have a great
publicly-owned system operated at a tremendous
loss and a great privately-owned one operated
under serious handicaps.
I have pointed out that unified operation,
handled wisely and carefully, could lessen the
loss to the taxpayers, give a fair deal to
private investors, and actually improve and
cheapen railway service. I have pointed out
that this could all be accomplished without

120

SENATE

real hardship for anyone, and that railway
workers would, in the end, benefit by this
rationalization of their occupation.
The average citizen meets the suggestion with
excessive optimism and excessive pessimism.
He takes refuge behind the "half truths and
distorted statements" of those who assure him,
in face of overwhelming evidence, that three
billion dollars of public railway debt do not
matter and that the railway which did not pay
its way in 1928 will do so in 1938-or 1948, or
1958. The next moment he plunges into gloom,
and asserts that although he realizes that
something can and must be done, no Government
dare face the issue.
A moment ago I quoted, in part, what the
president of the Canad.ian Pacific Railway
said on this questi.on in 1926. May I state
what I conceive to be the cause of his recent
change from that position? I think it will be
found in the fact that for five years. froum
1926 to 1930. inclusive, the Canadian Pacific
Railway paid in dividends $167,106.388 and
its net earnings for the sane period amounted
to $217.548.352.
Let us sec what this great priv'ately-owned
railway did for its shareiolders dutring that
period. In 1926 it paid 830.005.944 in dividends. That was commendable and greatlY
to the advantage of Canada. In 1927 it
distributed a similar amount of divid.ends.

assume that one reason for the rumblings of

Great Britain since 1930 is that Canadian
Pacifie shareholders there were not getting
their dividends in anything like the emeasure

I have read would lead one to wonder whether
there is really a "Canada-first"
and "forgotten-taxpayer" view behind the proposal
to amalgamate or unify the two great railway systems of Canada, contemplating, as I
understand, discontinuance from their jobs of
from 15,000 to 17,000 employees, and abandonment of some 5,000 miles of Canadian
National lines. It is only fair te state, with
great regret, that after 1930 the Canadian
Pacifie Railway Company largely discontinued these substantial dividends. Again I
wonder if this discontinuance caused the

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The statement implies that the Canadian people are the most

and he says now "per head."
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I said so at the
time I made that statement.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: All right. Is this
statement correct? The net debt of Canadian federal and provincial governments and
municipalities in 1935 is shown by the 1937
Canada Year Book as $6,786,869,473. This
includes principal and interest guaranteed on
railway and other securities.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: With a population

will have to thresh it out with somebody who
knows more about statistics than I do. The
public debt alone of Great Britain for 1935
is shown in the 1937 World Almanac as

mately $38.000,000,000.
Great Britain being 46,000,000, the public debt
alone would be $830 per capita.
With regard to taxes, Current History for
May, 1936, contains a comprehensive analysis
of taxes in the United Kingdom, France
and the United States, based on unimpeachable authority, which shows that for the year
1934 the total annual taxes per capita in
these countries were: Great Britain $93.45,
The
United States $78.14, France $75.80.
Canada Year Book for 1937 shows our federal,

provincial and municipal taxes for the year
1934 totalling $662,000,000.
With a population of 10,824,000, the total taxes per capita
work out at $61.16.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:

In 1934?

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Yes. The figures
for Canada from the Canada Year Book,
1937, are the latest available. The figures for
the other countries have been taken for the
same year.
My honourable friend also stated that the
nation's weariness is growing, and, unhappily,
its credit on the money markets of the world
is weakening. Canada's credit in the money
markets of the world is exemplified by the
value placed upon its securities. Dominion
Government long-term bonds sell in the
money markets of the world at prices yielding
a return to the investor which is the lowest
in many years. There is no sign here of any
weakening of Canada's credit.
Just how a country can suffer in the money
markets of the world when it is a net exporter of capital is not clear. For several
payments
of
balance
past
the
years
between Canada and the rest of the world
has shown Canada to be on the credit side
of the ledger. In 1936 Canada exported
$253,000,000 more capital than she imported.
The fact is she has been reducing ber capital
debt to other countries, instead of increasing
it by further borrowing.
Now I quote from the report of the Dominion Bureau of Statistics on international
balances for 1937:
It is almost correct to say that Canada is
amortizing her foreign debt at a rate of
between 31 and 4 per cent per year .
Capital goods which were created in former
years are paying returns and the surplus production as compared with consumption is permitting a gratifying reduction in foreign indebtedness. The results suggest that, on the
whole, former investment in Canada has been
sound.
A goodly portion of the foreign debt formerly incurred was for railway construction. It
is interesting to note that when the whole
national economy is taken into account the
result has been successful. The incidence of
railway costs must not bc confused with the
true value of railway services. Much of the
cost shows up in the Canadian National
deficits and in the interest charges on Government issues. The benefits accrue to the
producers and merchants, and it is only by
striking a national balance sheet that the
effect can be ascertained. There is a wide
variance between the actual facts and the
statements of my honourable friend (Hon. Mr
Beaubien).

122

SENATE

Third, my honourable friend said that the
Canadian National Railways continue to
mulet the public treasury to the tune of
$40,000,000 for defreits, and at least $75,000,000
for lost interest on more than $3,000,000,000
so far invested by Canada in its railways.
The true deficit of the Canadian National
Railways arises purely from interest on capital.
There is no operating deficit. Instead, there
is an operating surplus. The items used to
build up large annual losses present only one
side of a balance sheet. The other side of it,
which is never mentioned, consists of the aid
extended by the railway in developing the
country. As has been demonstrated, such
investments have on the whole been profitable. By the same method of bookkeeping,
that is, by looking at only one side of the
matter, the advances made to the Canadian
Pacific Railway by governments, in the form
of cash, land grants and railways already
constructed (totalling $250,000,000), would, if
interest were charged thereon, amount to
approximately one and one-half billion dollars,
which represents a loss to the people of
Canada. Anyone who would take such a view
would be regarded as a poor Canadian,
because the Canadian Pacifie Railway, in
benefits to Canada and Canadian institutions,
bas more than trebled the advances made to
it by way of loans or for any purpose.
Now let us turn ta the report of the Bank
of Canada presented at its third annual meeting of shareholders, on February 22, 1938,
which contains a statement about the Canadian dollar in 1937. It says:
Turning to the foreign exchange situation,
it should be noted that fluctuations of the
Canadian dollar against both the United States
dollar and sterling, were narrower even than
lu 1936.
The report states that whereas the Canadian
dollar, as against the pound sterling, maintained practically a 4 per cent adverse
variation in 1936, this was reduced to slightly
better than 3 per cent in 1937.
The report continues:
Preliminary estimates of Canada's balance
of international payments for 1937 show a
reduction in our favourable balance on current account from $324,000000 in 1936, to
$217.000,000. The drop of about $100,000,000
occurs in the merchandise item, and is almost
entirely attributable to a fall in the export of
grain. This is partly due to the fact that the
wheat crop last year was the smallest since
1914, and partly to the fact that in 1936 we
were liquidating heavy wheat stocks.
Item No. 4. My honourable friend says
that ta let the Canadian people bleed ta the
extent of $100.000,000 a year, to do nothing
to save its life-blood, would be gross, callous,
heartless indifference.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

No doubt the intention is to set against
the $100,000,000
the $75,000,000 economy.
But bas Sir Edward ever said what portion
of the $75,000,000, if it were realized, would
go towards the support of the Canadian
National? Remember that most of this $75,
000,000 is ta be obtained by reduction in
service, the abandonment of lines and a general dislocation, all of which would have a
profound bearing upon industry and development in the communities affected. It
would be a sad state of affairs if all this grief
were laid upon the citizens of the country and
the only financial relief they got, to apply
against the $100,000,000, were but a fraction of
the financial result, iwhereas the Canadian
Pacific Railway Company had secured a virtual
guaranteed return on their securities and stood
a good chance of obtaining the lion's share
of whatever was left over. Relief fromà the
finanoial birden, if obtained in this manner,
would be very expensive.
Now we couie ta item No. 5. In his speech
of March 2 umy honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien) implied, I think, not once, but
iepeated]y, hIat the solution of this great
trouble lies in the Senate resolution of 1925.
Both the solution suggested by the Senate
in 1925 and Sir Edward Beatty's plan for
amalgamation or unification received a very
thorough study by the Royal Commission on
Railways and Transportation in 1931-32. It
was the unanimous opinion of this commission, which numbered amongst its members
leading judicial, railway and financial experts
of Canada, Great Britain and the United
States, that neither of these plans was a
solution. But some people will still be ready
to try anything once.
Item No. 6. It was stated that economie
experts of the two systems had estimated
the saving from this plan at sums ranging
from $56,000,000 to $75,000,000 per year.
I think my honourable friend referred to
$75,000,000 plus $40,000,000 on one or two
occasions. The proponents of amalgamation
or unification always stress the savings in railway costs. Theso may well prove illusory, as
bas been demonstrated by the experience in
Great Britain, where the railways were consolidated into four railway systems, but the
anticipated large-scale economies did not result. Little or nothing bas been said of the
damage to the national economy through the
widespread abandonment of railway lines and
services in Canada.
Economies obtained by reduction in essential or desirable services are not true economies, but are backward steps in the development of the country.
Why the railways
should be singled out for such treatment is

MARCH 17, 1938
not clear when apparent duplication is to be
seen everywhere-in banks, paper mills, highways, canals, steamships, educational institutions, hospitals, etc. Theoretically, tremendous economies could be achieved by the
elimination of such duplications, but no sane
person would expect the estimated savings to
Consolidations and planned
be realized.
economies have ever been held out as offering
great opportunities for reduction in expenses,
but when tried, whether in the field of private
.enterprise or on a national scale, the results
have been far from satisfactory. Expected
economies are elusive, and the student begins
to perceive that there is something fundamentally wrong with the premise that mere
siz and centralized control are capable of
effecting large-scale economies.
Then we come to item No. 7. My honourable friend says of Sir Edwqrd Beatty's advocacy of the plan:
Everyone must admit, I think, that in his
several utterances Sir Edward Beatty has
been as fair and frank as he has been forcible
and convincing.
Sir Edward as an advocate has had a pretty
clear field. Constant repetition may sound
convincing. So far he has spoken in broad
generalities, but has given little in the way
of information as to how his plan would affect
the national economy. In this connection I
would refer my honourable friends to the
letter dated January 7, 1938, written by Sir
Edward Beatty to the Ottawa Journal, to sec
whether in it they can find anything concrete,
definite or conclusive. It would be asking
too much of Sir Edward to expect him to do
otherwise than plead for his employers, namely,
the board of directors and shareholders of the
Canadian Pacifie Railway and for the employees of that line.
I come now to item No. 8 of my honourable
friend's speech of March 2. He said:
The bogey of a huge and oppressive monopoly
has been dispelled by the policy adopted in
Great Britain of consolidating its railways,
and the measures about to bc carried out by
the United States for a similar purpose.
Apparently my honourable friend is not
conversant with railway conditions in Great
Britain and the United States. In Great
Britain there was a consolidation into four
large systems, each of which is operated independently. In the United States various
plans have been advanced for the consolidation of railways, but any plan seriouslystudied
involved the maintenance of competition. In
the case of neither country is there any question of railway monopoly, except that in the
United States there has been some talk of
Federal Government ownership of all railways.

12J

Item No. 9. My honourable friend says:
Nobody now believes that under unification
sections of the community would be left without railway service. Sir Edward Beatty, time
and again, has affirmed that this was unthinkable.
This is a good example of the insidious
propaganda in favour of unification. I do not
say that to my honourable friend in an unkindly way, but it is a fair example of what
we are hearing all over the country. To say
that we can abandon 5,000 miles of railway
without depriving any community of railway
service is ridiculous. There are a few cases
where the Canadian Pacifie closely parallels
the Canadian National, but the extent of these
is small and the duplication can be eliminated
by co-operation between the two companies
without sacrifice of the communities served.
Incidentally a large part of this duplication
occurs in Ontario, where the Canadian Pacifie
duplicated lines already constructed by the
Grand Trunk Railway.
May I cite from the Iola, Kansas, Register,
an article entitled, "When a Railroad Quits,"
to show the results that follow abandonment?
It says:
In 1933 the Milwaukee railroad abandoned
its branch line between Sioux City, Iowa, and
Wynot, Nebraska, a distance of about 50 miles.
The abandonment was made necessary by truck,
competition, which had caused the railroad to
carry on operations on the branch line at a
substantial loss for some time. The trucking
concerns serving the area assured interested
townspeople and farmers that they could
This
entirely fill any transportation need.
claim was taken into consideration by the
Interstate Commerce Commission in permitting
the abandonment. Here, according to the Minnesota Grain and Feed Review, are some of
the results:
"First grain shipped from the affected area
to Sioux City, thence to be sent east, was
carried by railroads at 3 cents a bushel. Today the rate is 10 cents a bushel. In the days
of the railroad, coal was laid down in the
farthest town on the branch line for 20 cents
a ton. To-day the truck rate to close-in points
is $2 a ton. Real estate values in the railroadless area are at new lows. Town homes that
cost $4,000 cannot find buyers at $500. Farm
values have dropped from 50 to 75 per cent.
The branch line railroad paid $28,000 each
year in taxes to local nuits of government.
That sum has now been shifted to the remaining taxpayers.
This is no argument against trucks, in their
proper field. It simply illustrates the fact
that those who think an area can get along
without the railroad don't know what they're
talking about."
Then we come to item No. 10. My honourable friend says:
Our $3,000,000,000 railway investment is not
only totally unproductive of interest; it increases by an average of more than $100,000,000
a year.

SENATE
The investment in the Canadian National
Railways may be "unproductive" from the
standpoint of cash dividends to financial
interests, but to say that it is "totally unproductive" is to display ignorance of what
the Canadian National has donc and is doing
for the country as a whole. Nearly onequarter of the entire population of Canada
are dependent solely upon the Canadian National for rail transportation. Only about 10
per cent of the people of Canada are not
served by the Canadian National. Mining
development during the last ten years has
been very largely in territory which was
developed, and is now served, by the Canadian
National, and includes such well-known producers as Noranda and Flin Flon.
The
Canadian National originates more newsprint
and pulp than any other railway on the
continent. It is net, as some of the critics
claim, a "dead horse." It is a vital and
essential factor in the development of the
natural resources of Canada. Its dividends are
not directly distributed in earnings from the
railway, but are in the form of income te the
people of Canada through wealth production
of the country.
Item No. Il. My honourable friend, at
page 39 of Hansard of March 2, quoted at
considerable length Professor Leslie T. Fournier
of Princeton University. He informed us that
tle Professor lectures at Princeton on transportation, public utilities, government and
business. The honourable gentleman read
from what he described as a series of remarkable articles in the Financial Post of January,
1935, written by Professor Fournier, which
were said to be a complete and exhaustive
study of the subject-matter of railways. Here
again we bave a remarkable illustration of
the truth of the old adage, "Wise men change
their minds; other men never."
Professer
Fournier would appear to have undergone a
remarkable change of mind on the railway
situation since January, 1931.
As evidence
of tbis fact I quote the following extracts
from the Journal of Political Economy of
June, 1931. First, from pages 369 to 370:
. lu this paper it is proposed to analyse

c f . Similarly, the present administration
of the Canadian National bas gained the confidence of the Canadian people and tieir national
government.
Under very diffieu]t conditions

in Canada presents the interesting spectacle
of two systems, representing widely different

which has proved to be both fair and stimulating to each railroad, with attendant simplification of the problems of railroad regulation.
. . . Since its organization in January, 1923

its

destinies have been guided

by Sir Henry'

Thornton, under whose able leadership the
difficult task of unification and co-ordination
has proceeded with remarkably good results.
Then, from pages 381 and 382:
Although the foregoing analysis indicates continued and progressive achievement by the
Canadian National, it is probable that this is
little realized outside of Canada, except by
close students of railway affairs. The chief
reason for this lies in the fact that the income
statements of the system continue to show
large net deficits. Yet in the main, these
deficits are the heritage of the period antedating government ownership of this system

of railways. A financial history of the Canadian
National gives ample demonstration of this fact.
And from page 389:
The foregoing analysis of the operating and
financial results of Canada's railways shows
that, given proper conditions, a state-owned
railroad can be operated as economically and
efficiently as a privately owned system. Yet
the factors which have contributed to the success
of Canada's venture into the field of business
are present in a combination not often found

to create.

In the first

This essential

facilitated by the wise policy of incorporating

them under the administration of a board of

railroad. Finally, the Government system bas

un the railway world. Tiat the resultant rivalry

and to the publie is well recognized by the
Canadian people.
That is a good deal different from what my
honourable friend placed on the record on
March 2 when he was quoting Professor
Fournier. Of course, we cannot deny the
Professor the right to change his mind and to

hold views to-day entirely different from those
lie held in 1931.
Here is item No. 12 of my criticism of my
honourable friend's remarks of March 2. With
respect
to the annual saving by joint
managership of the two systems, he thought
.$8,000,000 would be saved by the doing away
with 4,000 to 5,000 miles of railway. He also
believed that joint managership would permit
of dispensing with 26,000 railway employees,
at an average wage of $1,700 a year, which
would mean an annual retrenchment of
$44,000,000.
Nothing was mentioned by my honourable
friend about the disturbance to industry.
whether it be manufacturing, lumbering,

MARCH 17, 1938
farming, mining or anything else, which
would result from the abandonment of from
4,000 to 5,000 miles of railway. Sir Edward
Beatty said this was a minor factor. Such
uncorroborated evidence, particularly when it
is made by one who, I think it is fair to say,
is for obvious reasons an advocate of a policy,
can hardly be accepted as proof.
the average
The statement regarding
annual earnings of railroad employees is
typical of the errors made by many persons
who favour unification. The average wage is
not $1,700 a year, a fact to which I drew
my honourable friend's attention when he
made the statement. On March 5 I received
the following letter from the Dominion
Bureau of Statistics, under the signature of
Mr. Coats, Dominion Statistician:
I am enclosing our Preliminary Report on
the Statisties of Steam Railways for 1936, and
would refer you to pages 8 and 9 for a statement of railway employees and their earnings.
From this you will see that there were 132,781
employees, whose total earnngs were $182,638,365, or an average of $1,375 for the year.
Marked copies of reports on the Canadian
National Railways and the Canadian Pacifie
Railway are also enclosed.
My honourable friend will please not forget that among the figures which went to
make up the total that averaged $1,375 for
all employees, were some salaries very much

132,781 employees are 585 executives whose

course, many other classes whose average is
greater than $1,375 a year. My source of
information is the Dominion Bureau of
Statistics, and I judge that it is accurate.
I am sure that many honourable members
are tired by this time, as I am. But I want
to go on, because-I do not know whether I
am mistaken in this-I rather think that I
am stating some things that should be stated
in this honourable House in connection with
our whole railway situation. It has been
suggested that only too often honourable
senators may be somewhat diffident about
telling the plain, unvarnished truth as to
some of the things which are under discussion here. If that is so, it is time that
concrete facts were given in connection with
the other side of the railway question, which
my honourable friend and others who favour
his views will not give us. So I crave the
patient indulgence of honourable members
for a little longer, while I make what appear
to me to be some points against railway
amalgamation in Canada.

12b

1. The subject of amalgamation was fully
discussed before a royal commission composed of outstanding men-the best men that
Canada, the United States and England could
furnish. All the arguments pro and con
were studied. Mr. Beatty's plan and many
others were considered, but rejected for good
and sufficient reasons. The Government having had the good sense to submit the case to
an expert commission by whom the subject
could be and was studied critically, dispassionately and exhaustively, it seems foolish
to rehash the arguments at this time, after
the commission's report has been made. The
commission's findings were arrived at more
than five years after 1925, yet my honourable friend urges us to endorse the proposal
which the Senate in that year thought would
be a cure-all.
2. The arguments of those in favour of
amalgamation are, to say the least, tinged
with self-interest. The watchwords of the
are "Save
of amalgamation
proponents
Canada," and "The forgotten taxpayer." The
fact that, if their proposal were carried out,
one result would be to line the pockets of
Canadian Pacific shareholders is not mentioned. May I point out here that 58-11 per
cent of those shareholders live in the United
Kingdom and 22.81 per cent in the United
States? Yet "Save Canada" is the argument.
3. Properly speaking, there is no railway
problem in Canada. There is a financial
problem. The history of railways in all
countries shows that in the development stage
railways cannot be made to pay: either they
must receive assistance or they go bankrupt.
The Canadian Pacifie itself is no exception;
it obtained enormous free aid from the Government, and then, as is well known, barely
squeezed through by means of further aid in
the form of government loans. A study of
railroads in the United States, west of the
Mississippi river, shows that in their development period three billion dollars of capital was
wiped out by receivership.
In the case of the Canadian National
system, aids from the Government were largely
in the form of guarantees, which were no
solution of the financial problem. The Canadian National, therefore, stands alone in not
having obtained financial improvement either
by free gifts or by capital reduction through
receivership. I agree that the big, square and
manly thing was done in not repudiating debts
and useless appendages. If the United States
or England or any other country in the world
had been faced with the situation that faced
us in 1921 or thereabouts, receiverships would
have resulted. By that means we could have
avoided paying interest on bonds and other

126

SENATE

securities, but, as I say, we did instead the
square and honest thing. The whole burden
of the Canadian National, therefore, shows
up. If the Canadian Pacifie had ýbeen aided
in the same way in its early days, and the
same method of keeping accounts had been
followed, that railway would inevitably have
gone bankrupt. Similarly, if the roads west
of the Mississippi river had been denied the
relief of receiverships, they never would have
been solvent. Canada has a magnificent set
of railways and enjoys the cheapest transportation of any country in the world, but this
fact is obscured by the distorted financial
set-up of the Canadian National systern.
4. Advocates of amalgamation do not say
anything about fixed charges, but fixed charges
are the only things wrong with the Canadian
National system. During the last decade the
Canadian National has paid all its operating
expenses and, in normal times, reasonable
fixed charges. Mr. Beatty himself admitted
before the royal commission that "no private
corporation could
assume the
enormous
obligations which the Government railways
are under. If it did, the project could never
be made to yield a profit and the company
would find itself unable to finance the undertaking." These charges must remain a burden
inherited from the past. They are a charge
against the development of Canada, and will
be justified by that development.
5. A fundamental fallacy underlies estimates
of economies from amalgamation, the same
fallacy that underlies any planned economy
which ends up in a monopoly. It is assumed
that the efficiency of administration which was
created by competitive conditions would be
continued under the new nionopolistie conditions. The lessons of history are all against
this. Without the competitive spirit, organizations become lax in their administration and
in the performance of their duties; nepotism
creeps in; employees become perfunctory in
doing their work. All this results in increased
expenses which quickly negative the theoretical economies. A drop in efficiency of only
10 per cent per man wipes out the economies.
6. The public is misinformed as to the extent of economies possible from amalgamation.
The estimates which are being bandied about
just now were made when the present reductions in wages and prices of materials
and in traffic had not taken place to any considerable extent. Even the most dramatic
programme of elimination of duplicate facilities, lines and services at the existing level
of traffic, wages and materials, could not
produce a saving of more than $15,000,000
a year.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

7. The estimates of theoretical economies
from amalgamation prepared three or four
years ago would have to be discounted if
applied to-day, because during the depression
the railways have learned many lessons in
economy. Each economy reduces the operating
expenses and makes it much more difficult
to get further juice out of the orange. The
Canadian National, for instance, has reduced
its operating expenses from the 1928 level
by some $110,000,000 a year. I want my honourable friend to get that, and I will repeat
it. The Canadian National bas reduced its
operating expenses from the 1928 level by
some $110,000,000 a year. Part of this reduction is owing to reduced traffic, wages and
prices, but much of it is on account of increased efficiency.
8. There is a lack of perspective in dealing
with amalgamation. Suppose you owned a factory and somebody came and said, "I am soand-so, and if you will give me complote
charge of your factory, let me tear these
machines out of here and put them there,
let me do all sorts of drastie things just as
I sec fit, I can save you ton per cent of your
yearly turnover," you would chase him out of
your office, for no man would take such desperate risks for such a small percentage of
gain. Well, that is just about the case with
respect to railway amalgamation. The hypothetical figures of estimated economies are
large because we are dealing with huge enterprises, but when the figures are stacked up
against gross railway turnover they become
relatively so small that one wonders whether
the theoretical gain is worth all the risk.
9. It would require some five to ten years
to effect a physical amalgamation of the two
properties. Therefore, little financial relief
could be expected during the depression. Before the depression Canada had shown herself capable of supporting both railway systems and had enjoyed excellent and cheap
transportation-the cheapest in the world, in
fact. The Canadian Pacifie paid $167,000,000
in dividends between 1925 and 1930, and the
Canadian National was going along pretty
well, making $52,000,000 over and above operating expenses. When the depression is over
and rail revenues increase, the railway financial problem will disappear and both roads
will be even more prosperous than before,
by reason of the lessons in economy learned
during the depression.
10. So long as the depression continues the
country would obtain a very disproportionate
share in the net economies from amalgamation. Approximately half of tlIe net economies

MARCH 17, 1938
would go to benefit Canadian Pacifie shareholders. The other half would not represent
a net gain to the country, because those displaced from employment in the railways
would simply add to the unemployed ranks
and either eat up their savings or go on
relief at subsistence level. Subsistence level
costs represent, on the average, one-third of
normal production, and since all the economy
in the last analysis is labour, the country's
share of the net economy would be approximately 4 3=,'; so that if an apparent financial economy of $5,000,000 resulted, the Canadian Pacifie shareholders-mostly foreigners
-would obtain $2,500,000 approximately, and
the country would net about $800,000.
11. Economies on the scale contemplated can
be obtained only by the most drastic treatment. Railways in toto make up the very
warp and woof of the productive economy

and of lines and the dislocation of railway
terminais and of shops, etc., would throw
hundreds of millions of private capital into
jeopardy. That which appeared as an economy in the railway figures, even if it were
realizable, would show up as a loss to the
lumberman, the miner, the merchant and the
financial houses holding mortgages and industrial loans. The railway financial problem
would not be solved; only the incidence of
the burden would be changed.
12. From the national standpoint it is unsafe to abandon railway lines. The economy
is small, because the investment cannot be
recouped, and all that can be saved is minimum maintenance and operating 'expenses.
which do not amount on the average to more
than $1,500 a mile. We have many illustrations of how unwise a line-abandonment might
be. Take for instance the National Transcontinental: it has been justified by the
mining development in Northern Quebec,
to say nothing of agriculture and lumbering
interests; yet this line had been properly
damned. The recent discovery of minerals
along the Canadian National line between
Nipigon and Long Lac is another case in
Canada is a young country and its
point.
potentialities are largely unknown. Railways
are essential to our devolepment, and, once
they are built, we should be very chary of
tearing them up.
13. The economic disturbance in the country due to labour displacement bas to be
considered. Those who advocate amalgamation sweeten the pill by saying that pensioning and deaths will take care of the situation. Nothing is said of the vast army of
skilled railway workers who are on furlough

measures when business was picking up would
mean that these men would have to remain
unemployed. The betterment in the financial picture would be only apparent, for the
financial burden would reappear in the army
of unemployed railway employees, and this
would act as a brake on business improvement.
14. Amalgamation would invite the dangers
"The public be
inherent in monopolies.
damned" attitude would be revived. Transportation service would be supplied, not in the
form desired by the traveller or shipper, but
when and how the railway saw fit to supply it.
The experience of a Canadian Pacific Railway
monopoly in Western Canada in the early
days would be repeated on a nation-wide scale.
15. An attempt to avoid the dangers of
monopoly by strengthening the hands of the
Board of Railway Commissioners would produce a bureaucracy. Authority would be divorced from responsibility. This would weaken
the hands of the management, tend to transfer
administrative details to the bureaucracy, and
hasten deterioration of the efficiency of the
enterpise.
16. It is a fallacy to look to motor-truck
competition to keep a consolidated railway
enterprise "sweet." Transportation economists
agree that the railways must remain the
backbone of land transportation. Because of
excessive distances and climatie conditions,
not more than from ten to twelve per cent
of the total transportation in a country such
as Canada can ever be performed by motor
vehicles.
17. Amalgamation might well lead to labour
difficulties. Attempts by the management to
enforce economies would cause the men to
band together for the common purpose of
protecting their employment. The development of the "go slow" principle would be
inevitable, and since much of the work of
railway employees is of necessity carried on
unsupervised in detail, it would be extremely
difficult, if not impossible, to check rising
expenses brought about by deliberate slowing up.
18. Labour troubles would in ail probability result in the establishment of a permanent railway labour board which would fix
the rates of wages and the terms and conditions of employment. This would be another
bureaucracy hampering the management, for
the board would be ineffective unless it interfered in the details of administration.
19. Amalgamation would result in so large
an industrial organization, with ail its ramifi-

cations, that its buge size would make efficient
administration difficult.
The present depression hias exploded the idea, of supermen.
20. Another manifestation
of monopoly
would be failure to keep abreast of the times.
A railway, to be efficient, lias tu bc continually
modernized; otherwise stagnation resuits.
21. For the Canadian National to go ino
partnership witb the Canadian Pacifie Railway means two things: (a) To ail intents and
purposes, a guarantee on the part of the
Governomeot of Canadian Pacific flxed charges.
That is wbat the honourable senator's motion
means.
Hon. Mr'. BEAUBIEN:

No.

1 deny that.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: (b) A sharing of
aIl future earnings with the Canadian Pacific.
Witb regard ta (a), Canada bas surely had
cnougb experienco in guaranteeing railway
sccuritics, cither directly or indiroctly. Witb
regard to (b), the Canadian National Railway systenm is potcntially a much more valuable property thian the Canadian Pacific. It
is better located, lias botter grades, and bias
înuch greater chance of expansion in earnings. The proposition is, "Hcads I win, tails
you lose." with Canada on the short end. If
amalgamation were tried and found waotiog,
the Canadian Goveroimeot would be burdened
with the Canadian Pacific fixed charges,
because the properties could nt be unscrambled, and the w'bole mess would be lef t
on the Govcrnment's doorstep. If amalgamation were tried and proved successful, then
the Canadian Pacifie would enjoy, sent-froc,
the profits from the development of the
greater
poteotialities
of
the
Canadian
National Railways, for wbich the people of
Canada have already .paid.
22. Its net earnings of the last ten years
do not provide a fair criterion of the earning
capacity of the Canadian National Railway
system, and amalgamation witb the Canadian
Pacifie on the basis of suclh results would be
disadvantagcous ta Canada and advantagcous
to the Canadian Pacific, whose shareholders
would divide a nice melon. This would result
frnm two factors: (a) Greater potentialities of
the Canadian National Railways as already
mentioned.
(b) During the last ten years
the expenses of the Canadian National have
been burdened witih large amounts representiog the renovation of a prnporty bled white
by previnus owners in an attempt ta avoid
bankruptcy. The truc earning power of the
Canadian National bas, as yet, been untried.

anyone bias faitb in the future growth of
Canada ho may have a certain expetation

24. Amalgamation, instead of removing the
railways fromn polities, wvould ho the most
certain way of making them a permanent
political issue, on two scores: (a) The publie
would be forced ta organize politically against
monopolistie tendencies. (b) The employees,
having an undivided interest, would form a
railway political bloc of formidable proportions.
25. A period of depression is rio time ta
try rash experiments whieb may end disastrously. There is an aId proverb about the
danger of chianging borses in mid-stream.
26. A serinus objection ta amalgamation is
that it is an irrex ocable experiment.

It is the universal practice of those countries

sufficient to defray the interest charges, thereby
relieving the Government exchequer and the
taxation of the people.

clamour against the Canadian National Railway system, which for years bas been giving

Western Prairies and to the lumberman and
the miner of Northern and Western Ontario?
All those who have anything to ship are
getting service below cost. That bas been
eonclusively proven. Why come along now
and run the risk of stopping the whole business by bringing about an amalgamation,
the fundamental and prime purpose of which
is to pay dividends to citizens of the United
Kingdom, the United States, and other places,
and to make the Canadian people in all walks
of life carry the load?
In conclusion may I say this? In connection with the review of the railway question in Canada, and the charges now in
.evidence against the Canadian people, we
are surely not doing complete justice unless
we undertake to assess that which Canada
owes to the railroada. It is probably not farfetched to remind ourselves that many of the
influential business and industrial captains of
Canada would doubtless have been in a much
less favourable financial position than they
now occupy had they not had the benefit of
railroad service, and other help brought to
them by the railways. It is true that the
transportation problems of Canada have
changed and are changing. It is true that the
bus, the truck and the aeroplane are encroaching, to a greater or less extent, upon
the services formerly rendered by the railways of Canada. But is it not fair to hold
that many towns and cities in the Dominion
,of Canada would possibly not be in existence

to-day, or would be much smaller units, were
it not for the railroads and railroad service?
Let us ask, in relation to the Canadian Pacific Railway, where the following towns and
cities might have been had it not been for
services, impossible to evaluate, given to the
business men and others: Victoria, Vancouver, Kamloops, Cranbrook, Lethbridge,
Calgary, Medicine Hat, Moose Jaw, Regina,
Winnipeg, Fort William, Port Arthur, Saint
John, and North Bay, to say nothing of
Ottawa, Montreal, Toronto and many other
important towns and cities in Canada. Also,
in relation to the Canadian National Railways, we might ask where such places as
Jasper, Edmonton, Saskatoon, Biggar, Melville, Rainy River, Winnipeg, Fort William
and Port Arthur in part, Sioux Lookout,
Sarnia, Windsor, Hamilton, London, Brantford, Belleville, Brockville, Richmond, Moneton, Amherst, Truro, Halifax, Sydney, New
Glasgow, Stellarton, as well as many other
communities, would have been had it not
been for the service rendered by the Canadýian National Railways, which are now, in
the opinion of many, hanging like a millstone around the neck of the Canadian
taxpayer.
Hon. Mr. MULLINS: Will the honourable
member permit me to speak to him? They
would have been wonderful cities if it had
not been for the freight rates we had to pay
when we were pioneering them. I admit that
we have had service from the Canadian
National, but we have had no cheap rates.
To-day we are paying 20 per cent more in
freight rates than we ever paid. That is what
is the matter with the Western country.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: In other words,
these freight rates, which are the lowest in the
world, are altogether too high. I am coming
to that point.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: They are 25 per
cent lower than in the United States.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I am coming to that
as one of my most insistent arguments, to
show why we should undertake to conserve
what we have.
One other thought in closing. I think it is
correct to say that Canadian freight and
passenger railroad rates have been, and are,
lower than similar rates for similar services
in any other country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: If that statement
is reasonably correct, Canada's railroad service
bas been, and is, paying a bonus to every
man, woman and child in Canada who utilizes

51958--9
E!ISED EDITION

SENATE
the railroads for any purpose. In addition to
this general flat bonus, which is Canada-wide,
we find special bonuses to certain sections
under the Crowsnest Pass agreement, the
Maritime freight rates, etc. It would seem
to me, therefore, that when we undertake to
assess the benefits accruing to us on account
of the Canadian National Railways, or on
account of both the railways, we ought in
fairness to compute the bonus payments, in
the form of lower freight and passenger rates,
which the Canadian people as a whole have
been receiving these many years. Perhaps
Canada bas received value in large measure
for all its outlay in railways.
Many honourable members who have been
using the railways will argue, no doubt, that
rates are too high, but the fact remains that
the people are now, and have been in the past,
getting service at much less than cost. This
was evidenced by the statement in the press
the other day about $270,000,000 being handed
to the railroads of the United States by way
of an increase in freight rates, which already
were higher than our own.
Again I express regret at having taken up
so much time. It seemed to me, however,
that there were some thoughts in connection
with this matter that should be voiced by
someone. I have tried to put them on record
from the standpoint of the other fellow.
I think all honourable senators will have
noted that the honourable gentleman from
Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) did not lay
enough stress upon the question of displaced
railroad men. To my mind their situation has
been and is one of the most tragic features of
recent years. Right here in this capital city
of Canada there are railroad men with twentysix years or more of service, and of seniority,
who are not able to get a day's work. Yet
some people talk callously about putting
another 15,000 or 17,000 men out of jobe.
For what reason? For the purpose of continuing, as we should like to continue, to send
dividends to shareholders in the United
Kingdom and in the United States.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have no
desire to speak on the amendment, although
I have the right, of course, but I wish to refer
for a moment to the somewhat reluctant
interruption which I felt compelled to make.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I be excused

That all the words after the word "upon"

out, and that the following be substituted
therefor:

" the

railways to the people of Canada, and to
recommend to this Senate some plan whereby
the taxpayers of Canada may be relieved, and
be assured of a first charge guaranteed return
of not less than $75,000,000 per year upon the
debt and interest charges of the Canadian
National Railways while, at the same time,
following the highly-spoken-of British plan of
conserving to railway employees their positions
without undue hardship."
Having heard so much of the $75,000,000
that Canada is going to get for the relief of
the forgotten taxpayer, I think we had better
undertake to find out how much there is
behind the proposal.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is not
the mistake to which I referred. The honourable gentleman said that Judge Fullerton
admitted before a committee of this House
two years ago that he was not able to give the
names of members of the committee on cooperation that was functioning with respect
to economies which were to be made by the
two systems. I interrupted the honourable
member to say I had no recollection of such
an admission on Judge Fullerton's part. I
now have the evidence, and I shall read just
a page and a half, from which it will appear
that all the names were given. The Senate
committee did not have to wait a second.
Judge Fullerton answered every question on
the subject.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: At a later date.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: No.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable member is so impetuous that he thinks
nothing of making a statement that has no
basis whatever in fact; though he may not
know it is not founded on fact. I do not know
anyone who so consistently persistsHon. Mr. MURDOCK: Will the right honourable gentleman pardon me? I persist because a couple of years ago, when I said this
gentleman got $30,000 a year, the right honourable gentleman contradicted me.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No, I did not.
The honourable member is adding another
to his offences. There was no such contradiction at any time, and I defy the honourable gentleman to show it in the records of

MARCH 17, 1938
this House. My memory has not quite collapsed. The honourable gentleman never
had any memory, or rather, never had recourse to it on anything. He has just got
into the habit of saying whatever comes into
his bead.
I have had the Clerk of the Committee read
through the evidence to find out if at any
time Judge Fullerton made any such admission as bas been alleged. The Clerk reports
that be never did, and he bas marked the
place where the names were given.
I read from the report:
Hon. Mr. Dandurand: We have not, I think,

had the names of the Canadian National representatives on the expert committee. We were
told only the names of the Canadian Pacifie
representatives.
Right Hon. Mr. Meighen:
There are two
committees. Let us get this clear. There is,
first of all, a joint co-operative committee?
Hon. Mr. Fullerton: A joint co-operative
committee.
Right Hon. Mr. Meighen:
On whieh the
Canadian Pacifie bas three representatives and
the Canadian National three.
Hon. Mr. Fullerton: Yes.
Right Hon. Mr. Meighen: Your three representatives are who?
Hon. Mr. Fullerton: Mr. Fairweather is
Chairman. The other two members are Mr.
Gzowski and Mr. Wardlaw.

Right Hon. Mr. Meighen:

What are their

regular duties in the company?

Hon. Mr. Fullerton: Mr. Gzowski is one
of our construction engineers, and Mr. Wardlaw, I think, is a traffic man.
Right Hon. Mr. Meighen. A traffic man
under Mr. Hungerford?
Hon. Mr. Fullerton:

I think so.

Right Hon. Mr. Meighen:

And Mr. Fair-

weather is what?
Hon. Mr. Fullerton: Head of the Bureau
of Economies.
Right Hon. Mr. Meighen: And the Canadian
Pacific members are headed by Mr. Armstrong,
who was here to-day?

Hon. Mr. Fullerton: Yes.
Right Hon. Mr. Meighen:' The other names

were given.

That is exactly what was said. I go on
from there:
Now, above this committee, and as a sort of
tribunal before whom their specific recommendations come, is another joint board, composed
of the three trustees, representing the Canadian National, and Sir Edward Beatty, Mr.
Tilley and Mr. Black, representing the Canadian Pacifie?

Hon. Mr. Fullerton:

Yes.

Right Hon. Mr. Meighen: Would you say
that any of those three on the Canadian Pacifie
are practical railway men?
Hon. Mr. Fullerton: Absolutely not.

Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Honourable senators, before this motion is put, may I say
that the honourable senator from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Black) did not complete
the wording of his proposed amendment yesterday, in that be did not name the committee.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I draw my
honourable friend's attention to the fact
that an amendment to the amendment has

Hon. Mr. BARNARD: I was wondering
whether it would not be proper to complete

by the honourable senator from Westmorland. He is away to-day and asked me to
complete it for him.
The Hon the SPEAKER:
It is moved
by the Hon. Mr. Murdock, seconded by Hon.

MOTION FOR THIRD READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
Bill be read a third time?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Now.
Hon. Mr. COTE: No.
The lon. the SPEAKER: Next sitting of
the House?
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: Honourable senators, I would suggest that the third reading
of this Bill be put over to Wednesday next.
Hon. Mr. MeMEA.NS: I move that the Bill
be placed on the Order Paper to be read a
third time to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Do I understand
that the report is to be considered to-morrow?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: The Bill has been
reported without amendment, and a day must
elapse, I suppose, before it is read the third
time.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I could not hear
my honourable friend, and so did not know
what he was moving.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I moved that the
Bill be placed on the Order Paper for third
reading to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: Honourable senators, I do not want to oppose this motion,
but I would ask the mover (Hon. Mr.
MeMeans) to postpone the motion for third
reading until Wednesday next. My reason is
this. During the discussion of the subject of
divorce, in which I admit I have no interest,
questions were raised, and quite propàrly so, by the right honourable the leader
in this side of the House (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen), by the honourable senator from
Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock), and by the
honourable senator from Prince (Hon. Mr.
MacArthur). It may be that instead of leaving
the Bill without a final word we could clear
fip misunderstanding by giving some explanation as to the source of and reasons for the law
of Quebec. The explanation would not call
for discussion of religious differences, a subject that I for one, as well as other honourable senators, wish to avoid, inasmuch as dis-

certain

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

eussions of that sort do no good to the country
and do not help to make us the united people
we should be. Would the mover and the seconder of the motion agree to the third reading
of this Bill being postponed until next Wednesday?
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Honourable members, as one who is mentioned as having asked
a question, I would request the honourable
gentleman (Hon. Mr. Rainville) to withdraw
bis opposition to our taking the third reading
The information I required I

have obtained by reading the Civil Code of
the province of Quebec, and other honourable
members can do likewise. In my opinion it
is inadvisable to continue this discussion any
longer than absolutely necessary; I think the
least said, the better. I should like the passing
of the measure in the Senate to be expedited
so that we may get the Bill over to the
other House and see what will be done with
it there.
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: I was merely
asking whether the honourable mover of the
motion (Hon. Mr. McMeans) was agreeable
to the postponement of the third reading until
next Wednesday. If he does not consent, I
shall withdraw my suggestion.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I do not see what
the state of the law in Quebec bas to do with
the present Bill. I should very much regret
it if the honourable gentleman were to
introduce any such question as he bas
suggested.
In my opinion it would be
inadvisable for this House to enter into any
discussion of the Quebec law on marriages.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask what
information the honourable gentleman from
Repentigny (Hon. Mr. Rainville) thinks we
might get next Wednesday that would not be
available to-morrow or before then?
Hon. Mr. RAINVILLE: My desire was
simply that a few of us might be given time
to prepare a brief which would deal with our
laws without entering into discussion on any
other subject. The question of the principle
would not be takcn up.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: As one member of
the special committee that had the Bill under
consideration this morning, I may be permitted
a few remarks. There were many things that
I did not understand about this subject of
divorce when the measure was introduced the
other day, and that was the only reason why
I asked some questions. I wanted information.
Since then I have sat at the feet of the Law
Clerk of the Senate on a couple of occasions,
for about an hour and a half, and have been

MARCH 23, 1938
given complete information.
I find, for
example, that in the Old Land, about a
hundred years ago, a clergyman belonging to
my faith would not have had the right to
perform any marriage at all. I am speaking
approximately as to the date.
I have
discovered that as regards this question in the
province of Quebec everything is perfectly
regular and proper, in accordance with
agreements entered into in 1865 and 1866.
I am entirely satisfied with the information
that has come to me. I think it is really
unfortunate that we cannot have before us
the Law Clerk or someone else capable of
giving a complete review of the history of
this subject for a couple of hundred years
back, so that all honourable members may be
brought up to date on it, as I think I have
been.
In the circumstances, if there were any
reasonable hope of securing useful information
thereby, I would agree whole-heartedly with
the suggestion of my honourable friend from
Repentigny (Hon. Mr. Rainville) that third
reading be postponed until Wednesday next.
Otherwise, I do not see any good in delaying
the measure.
I would remind honourable
members-I am speaking subject to correction,
though I feel I am right on this-that the
Bill now before us follows very closely the
language of the Act passed in the Motherland
last year.
It was suggested that some
additions be made, but this was not done.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Honourable senators,
the remarks of the honourable senator from
Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) convince me
that it is not wise to rush the third reading of
this Bill. I do not know whether or not
that is the intention. The honourable senator
was very much in favour of second reading
and sending the measure ýto committee. He
tells us now that the information he obtained
frorn the Law Clerk, who appeared before the
committee, cleared up a great many things
in his mind. He and other honourable members of the committee have had opportunities
that were not available to the rest of us. I
very much wish that an arrangement could
be made for the Law Clerk to come here and
give to the House the same information that
the committee received. Some of us want it,
and it would do none of us any harm. I
should be very much obliged if that arrangement could be made, and it would be satisfactory to me to take up the matter tomorrow. Would that be agreeable?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
The motion -is to
h"ve the Bill put down for third reading
to-morrow. There will be full opportunity
for any discussion then.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: The Law Clerk cannot come and sit here?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I may say to my
honourable friend that the Law Clerk has
fully explained the Bill. In addition, the explanatory notes printed with the measure
itself state what are the laws in the different
provinces. I do not ýthink we could obtain
any further useful information.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: As one member of
the House, I should very much like to hear
the explanations given by the Law Clerk,
which appear to have cleared up so many
points in the minds of members of the special
committee.
The motion to place the Bill on the Order
Paper for third reading to-morrow was agreed
to.

INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN inquired of the

Must a province obtain a fiat to sue the
Dominion Government?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: To this inquiry
I have an answer, received from the Minister
of Justice. It reads:
Section 31 of the Exchequer Court Act,
Chapter 34, Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927,
is as follows:
"31. When the legislature of any province
of Canada has passed an Act agreeing that the
Exchequer Court shall have jurisdiction in
cases of controversies,
(a) between the Dominion of Canada and
such province;
(b) between such province and any other
province or provinces which have passed
a like Act;
the Exchequer Court shall have jurisdiction to
determine such controversies.
2. An appeal shall lie in such cases from the
Exchequer Court to the Supreme Court.

SENATE
WINNIPEG AND ST. BONIFACE
HARBOUR COMMISSIONERS BILL
FURTHER CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

The Senate again went into Committee on
Bill 32, an Act to amend The Winnipeg and
St. Boniface Harbour Commissioners Act.Hon. Mr. Dandurand.
Hon. Mr. Duff in the Chair.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
senators, perhaps at this stage I may be
allowed to answer some inquiries that were
made when we were formerly in Committee
on this Bill. The questions had to do with
the port, its value, administration and cost to
date. I have here a copy of a letter written
by the City Solicitor of Winnipeg to the
Minister of Transport. It reads as follows:
Re the Winnipeg and St. Boniface
Harbour Commissioners.
I enclose herewith a draft Bill which the
commissionersThat is, the harbour commissioners of
Winnipeg and St. Boniface.
-are anxious to have passed at the fortbcoming
session of Parliament. It is expected that as
a result of the new Greater Winnipeg sewage
disposal plant the Red river will be more
extensively used for pleasure craft an
it
appeared desirable to the commissioners that
their control of the river be extended by taking
in some of the suburban municipalities through
which the river flows.
The municipality of East Kildonan las given
its consent to have its portion of the Red river
included in the harbour and it is hoped that
West Kildonan will follow suit. Both these
municipalities lie north of the cities of Winnipeg and St. Boniface and their joining would
extend the harbour about a mile and a half
in that direction. An effort is also being made
to have the municipalities of Fort Garry and
St. Vital, lying south of the present harbour,
agree to have the harbour extended by taking
in those municipalities.
You may be aware that a provincial body
called the Winnipeg and St. Boniface River
Control Board was created by Chapter 72 of
the Statutes of Manitoba, 1934, having the
same personnel as those appointed from time
to time as commissioners under the Winnipeg
and St. Boniface Harbour Commissioners Act,
and any increase in the limits of the harbour
will be accompanied by an increase in the
portions of the Red and Assiniboine rivers
within the jurisdiction of that board. The
object of creating the River Control Board was
to create a body having control over the rivers
from the point of view of flood prevention and
the beautifying of the banks. Since the completion of the sewage disposal plant above
referred to, greater interest is being taken in
the appearance of the river banks as well as
in the use of the river for pleasure craft.

non. Mr. DANDURAND.

There is a peculiarity with respect to the
boundaries of the municipalities in the Greater
Winnipeg area as regards the Red river. In
the case of Winnipeg and St. Boniface the
municipality boundaries of each city take in
one-half of the river and are contiguous along
the centre line of the stream.
In the case, however, of the two suburban
municipalities to the north and the two to
the south, none of these includes any part of
the Red river, although they are situated on
its banks.
In drafting the enclosed Bill it seemed simpler
for the purposes of the amendments in sections 2, 3 and 4 to insert the interpretive clause
in section 1 providing that the portions of the
river contiguous to the respective municipalities
should be regarded as being within their
boundaries.
If the enclosed Bill is satisfactory to your
Department I should be much obliged if you
would have it introduced.
I have obtained from the Department of
Transport the following information:
Bill 32 was introduced by the Minister at
the request of the City of Winnipeg through
J. Preudhomme, City Solicitor, a copy of
whose letter to the Minister, dated January
19, 1938, is appended.
The Bill as originally submitted was examined by the Assistant Counsel of this Department and our marine officials, and some minor
changes suggested which were acceptable to
Mr. Preudhomme.
The personnel of the Winnipeg and St. Boniface Harbour Commission at present is as follows:
Col. G. C. MacLean, Chairman, Mayor of
St. Boniface, term expires June 23, 1939.
J. G. VanBelleghem, alderman, St. Boniface,
term expires June 23, 1939.
W. P. Brereton, Vice-Chairman, city engineer,
Winnipeg, term expires August 13, 1940.
John Blumberg, alderman, Winnipeg, term
expires August 20, 1940.
W. M. Scott. engineer, Winnipeg, term expires May J, 1940.

Under their Act, the Winnipeg and St. Boniface Harbour Commissioners have power to
impose certain tolls, cargo rates and wharfage
rates, and to establish an annual licence or
registration fee for craft frequenting the harbour. In addition, the Harbour Commission
receives a grant of $1,000 a year from the
City of Winnipeg and $150 a year from the

Yes; by the

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable members,
on the motion for second reading I made
inquiry regarding some of these matters. I
think we have now all the information
necessary for the purpose of dealing with the
Bill. I do not object to the expenditure, nor
to any of the departments exercising control
through a local board. What bothered me
was why in the world there should in this
case be a board of harbour commissioners.
Conditions similar to those existing at
Winnipeg will be found all over the country.
There may be an expenditure of, say, $75,000
on a breakwater to protect a little cove or
something of that nature down in New
Brunswick or Nova Scotia, but no board of
harbour commissioners is appointed to look
after the work. "Harbour commission" has
come to mean something. We have a board
of harbour commissioners at ports like
Montreal, Saint John, Quebec and Vancouver.
But why a local board of this kind to look
after very little shipping beyond a few pleasure
craft should be called a harbour commission is
something that I cannot understand. I do
not intend to oppose the Bill in the slightest
degree, but I think the sooner we discontinue
the use of such a title where it is not
necessary the better it will be

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: To what extent is
the river used for commercial purposes?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There is no
information to indicate that it has been used
very much.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: My honourable friend
from Winnipeg South-Centre (Hon. Mr. Haig)
is cognizant of the local situation, and I should
like him to give the House a brief statement
as to what the harbour is used for.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Some years ago the
St. Andrew's locks were constructed to enable
sand and gravel and lumber to be transported
by water from Lake Winnipeg to the city of
Winnipeg. Brown & Rutherford, Limited, a
large lumber firm, bring up a good deal of
lumber every year. The lumber is eut during
the winter, sawn in the summer, and then
sent up the river. With St. Boniface on the
one side and Winnipeg on the other, difficulties
have arisen with respect to the exercise of
control over the banks of the river. The city
of Winnipeg, the provincial Government and
the Dominion Government have recently
spent more than $3,000,000 on the construction
of a sewage disposal plant. The two cities,
having contributed towards this expense, desire
that the banks of the river should be beautified.
The members of the commission give their
services for nothing. They exercise control
over both banks of the river. Winnipeg, St.
Boniface and the surrounding municipalities
are ambitious to have proper drives constructed
along the river banks, and this work will be
unified under the harbour commission. Ia

Iàs

SENATE

recent years the traffic from Lake Winnipeg
to the city of Winnipeg has decreased on
account of the lowering of the water level in
both the Red and the Assiniboine rivers, but
up to eight years ago a great deal of material
was brought by river to Winnipeg for
construction and building purposes. While it
may sound too impressive to call this
controlling body a harbour commission, still
the commission serves a useful purpose, and
has the whole-hearted support not only of
Winnipeg and St. Boniface, but also of the
contiguous municipalities. I understand that
these municipalities desire to come under the
jurisdiction of the harbour commission in
order that there may be a unified plan of
river improvement.
Sections 1 to 6, inclusive, were agreed to.
On the title:
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Before the Bill is
reported I should like to obtain some information. In 1936 all harbour commissions in
Canada were brought under control of a

And the sub-amendment proposed by Hon.
Mr. Murdock:
"That all the words after the word 'upon'
be struek out and the following substituted
therefor: 'the enormous cost of Canadian railvays to the people of Canada, and to recommend

Hon. ARTHUR SAUVE: Honourable senators, I desire to add a few remarks to the
discussion opened by the motion of my bonourable friend the senator from Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien). The subject of the
motion is indeed a broad and most interesting
one, and the proposer expounded it in such a
way as to contribute largely to the zest and
fruitfulness of the long preliminary period of
our session. He deserves our congratulations
and thanks for 'this example of initiative.
I do net intend to use great phrases or sonorous words, nor to assume the proud look of
the self-styled great man. I prefer to touch the
small sores which bave produced desperate
diseases and fatal results. As the Senate
must avoid taking too drastie action on the
executive and financial affairs of government,
the subject before us is particularly difficult
and delicate.
The railway question is national rather than
political. As Canadians we all share a cornmon obligation. If the Canadian railroads
constitute a grievous problem, demanding
immediate attention, I believe we are right in
facing it. At the same time we must recognize

MARCH 23, 1938

the importance which new methods of transport have acquired, and which is bound to
increase in the -future.
After listening to the interesting addresses
of the previous speakers I could not help
wondering why, when we are spending so
many millions to cover a deficit, we should
spend untold millions more to increase and
strengthen -the competition which already has
so largely contributed to our disastrous railway situation. In this connection I might
mention air transport, which, though the
youngest competitor of -the railways, is extremely vigorous.
Lack of planning and foresight was the
primary error in the establishment of our transportation system. The country spent billions
of dollars for transportation and communication, large sums of money being expended
even at a time when the marvels of science
were giving birth to advances and changes
which were disturbing our economic and social
life, and which created new needs and new
obligations. But while the railroads were
seeking financial assistance from the governments, their neglect and refusal to meet demands and requirements were prejudicial to
the public. Freight and express services were
far from satisfactory. Express rates were
enormous and beyond all reason, and transportation by freight was at times so slow as
to be almost worthless. The public, feeling
that it was being imposed upon, became discontented and impatient. For too long the
companies persisted in giving poor service,
preferring to devote their earnings to the
payment of large dividends and big salaries.
The Minister of Transport has rightly said that
before the establishment of the Railway Commission the railways exercised a virtual monopoly in the field of transport. I might add
that this condition continued until the time
when highway transport became highly conpetitive.
Is it not truc that our railway managements have imposed various rates for the
same distance? Why should a rate from
Montreal to Toronto differ from a rate from
Toronto to Montreal? The ridiculous line of
the Canadian Pacific Railway between St.
Eustache and Ste. Thérèse is kept in existence
because of the persistent and outrageous refusal of the Canadian National Railways to
build a station in the village of St. Eustache,
as desired by the municipal authorities of that
locality.
With the coming of motorized transport
every government in Canada spent hundreds
of millions of dollars on the building of roads

là

designed to facilitate the transportation of
goods by motor vehicles. We viewed with
alarm, and rightly so, the threatening conpetition between two railroads whose lines
paralleled each other for several hundred miles;
but even after complaining about this condition we continued to spend hundreds of
millions on the King's highway to make it
more convenient for the operation of large
trucks, thus establishing as against our railroads
a new competitor, which, because it goes everywhere in response to the demand of an ever
more exacting public, is progressing by leaps
and bounds.
While this new and more satisfactory
method of transportation shortens the distances between urban and rural centres, it
affects local merchants. Local trade in villages
is nearly destroyed. Yet, the public, even
public bodies and governments, are persistent
in demanding road improvements which will
benefit motor transportation. It is too late
to stop; especially in these days, when young
people like to ascend the steepest hills as
fast as they can descend them.
As if there were not already too many
obstacles in the way of the solution of our
railroad problem, millions have already been
spent, and millions more will be spent, to aid
the progress of yet another competitor, air
transport. Could we stop this development if
we would? I do not think so. Here are the
words of the Minister of Mines, Hon. Mr.
Crerar, as uttered in his twelfth address on
the Mining Industry:
The aeroplane is a very important factor
in the development of our northern areas, and
ever since it was first intensively applied, in
1926, to the transportation of mining equipment into Red Lake area, it has gained in
recognition as an essential to the speedier
development of mineral resources remote from
our highways.
The opening of new mining areas, therefore,
means an increased demand for many years
to come. More air freight is being shipped
at present into Opemiska and Chibougamau
in Quebec ýthan to any other point in North
America. The leading air transport company
engaged in the handling of freight to our
mining camps recently reported that it carried
over 5,250,000 pounds in 1935, exclusive of mail,
compared with less than 750,000 in 1931. The
freight carried by all commercial aviation
companies in 1935 weighed 26,500,000 pounds,
compared with less than 14,500,000 pounds in
1934. The handling of heavy, bulky machinery,
boilers, engines, ore buckets, and mechanical
parts of all kinds is an everyday occurrence.
There appears to be no limit to the variety
of freight that can be carried. I read not so
long ago that a team of oxen was transported
by plane to a mining camp in Northern Quebec.
I am pleased to note also the increasing use
of the aeroplane for marketing the excellent
fish obtained from the cold waters of cur
northerly lakes.

.. $10,669,240

That is the amount that has been spent on

Confederation, $1,889,692,824. For the details
of this expenditure I would refer honourable
members to the answers to an inquiry of
mine which appear in the Senate Hansard of
March 17. These figures are an illustration of
the present condition, and are a warning for
the future.
In 1927, speaking in the Quebec Legislature
on the new mode of transportation, the humble
leader of the Opposition of the time expressed himself as follows:
I am not against progress, but in this
as in all others J am for orderly progress.case
I
realize it is difficult to maintain our old
customs wlien we are neiglbours of the United
States, in which country scientific progress
overthrows the past and exceeds, unchecked,
the reasonable needs of the nation. I wonder
what will result from our allowing motor
vehicles and trucks of twenty or thirty-ton
capacity on our highways. This heavy transport will necessitate a widening of the roads
as well as most expensive construction and
maintenance. And what will this new development je traffic mean to our railroads? Is it
not high time to think of it? To-morrow will
be too late.
If this new method of transportation cannot be regulated so as to check
the competition whirh is ruinons to our railroads, it is useless te talk of solving our railroad problems; and useless to spend more
millions of the people's money to keep up the
two systems, if ve contribute te the intricacy
of tlat problem by encouraging new modes of
transportation which will be most expensive
to the country. Would it not be better to
liit
competition and force the railroad comparies to give the publie better service?
Thousands and millions of dollars are spent to
prevent accidents on our roads but, in the
meantime, we multiply engines of death on the
same roads. Where are we going? Are we
going to spend more and more money as a
support of economie disturbance and social
discord?
That is what was said by the unworthy
leader of the Conservative party of that time.
His words were neither heard nor heeded:
he was too far from governmental power, too
remote from the seats of the mighty. For
even then he did net consort with the gods of
finance. He was too small for big business
men! He had no sense of the greatness of the
future! The chairman of the Canadian Pacifie
Railway had other interests to look after and
to nurse. I say it without bitterness. In my
Hon. Mr. SAUVÉ.

thirty years of publie life I have always, with
a few exceptions, travelled by Canadian
Pacifie; it is a tradition with me. The Canadian Pacifie was closely connected with the
development of the country. But, I must
add, that company has lost a great deal of its
prestige in the province of Quebec, as elsewhere; it has also lest the confidence that the
province formerly had in it. It bas lest both
because of its poor service to our people.
Quebec resents injustice. We have suffered
because our railroads refused to give us better
service, fair express rates, more rapid shipment of freight, more convenient train hours.
Our good settlers in beautiful Timiskaming
have not forgotten that the Canadian Pacifie,
between 1916 and 1930, refused to build them
a branch line which was so necessary. They
remember what they suffered and the losses
they endured at the time.
I do not deny that Sir Edward Beatty is a
valuable man. But to my mind he played
politics in the underground darkness to such
an extent that his vision was obscured. I am
among those who saw him attempt too many
schemes or political combines, and interfere
in too many others. We believe those combines lacked straightforwardness and were unjust towards certain eminent statesmen. I
cannot forget the self-interested denials he
gave to the utterances of politicians who from
1928 to 1930 foresaw the depression and had
the courage to say so.
Furthermore, the Place Viger station incident is not a thing of which the Canadian
Pacifie Railway chairman should be proud.
That matter was not dealt with frankly.
Facts were misrepresented and truth was
hidden, always to the detriment of that part
of Montreal which Sir Georges Etienne
Cartier tried to protect. Sir Edward Beatty
knows it well. The cause of his aversion is
known and deprecated sufficiently to provoke
a show of resentment which may, before loiig,
harm the Canadian Pacifie Railway as well
as the south-eastern part of Montreal. It is
through defiance of public opinion and
denials of justice that the mighty become
weak; and these things lead to economic
troubles as well as social uprisings.
I should also denounce the Canadian National systea on account of the manner in
which it has treated the public of the eastern
part of Montreal. The poor old Moreau
station is a gloomy image of the poor service.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: A complaint could
be made with respect to Windsor, too.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: The traffic on our highways and the new modes of transportation

MARCH 23, 1938

can constitute a powerful, a decisive argument for unification or co-operation on a
reasonable basis, with the interests of the
Canadian public considered above everything
else. Let there be no question of gifts to a
favourite, but let us address ourselves to finding a sensible solution of a hard problem,
and to practising economy, if we would not
be ruined. Unification or co-operation should
be to the advantage of the country and of
the body charged with the responsibility of
directing our railroads, whether that bu the
Canadian Pacific Railway or the Board of
Railway Commissioners. But, above all, we
must consider the present and future needs
and the country's means.
I am opposed to the amendment of the
honourable senator from Westmorland (Hon.
Mr. Black), because I think it is unnecessary.
The railway question has often been discussed
in the last twenty-five years. It was the subject of an extensive inquiry by a special conmittee of the Senate in 1925, at which time all
interested persons had the opportunity to be
heard, and many took advantage of it. The
conclusions of that inquiry were formulated
in eleven or twelve distinct and clear paragraphs, to be found at pages 411 and 412
of the Journals of the Senate for 1925. Why
:should there be another similar inquiry now?
This question is to be discussed in Parliament in the light of information obtained in
1925. Why duplicate what has already been
-done?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Perhaps the
honourable member is not aware that the
information obtained in 1925 was never
-printed.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: I saw a report, signed
by the chairman of the committee, the late
Senator Ross.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is a
.report only.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: Giving conclusions.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is all.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE: They were the conrnittee's conclusions, and they are very interesting. There is also much interesting information in the Duff Commission's report, which
goes into all matters concerning our railway
problem.
I am likewise opposed to the sub-amendment proposed by the honourable senator from
Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock), which, in
my humble judgment, is not only too complicated and involved, but is based on a weak
.calculation.

The addresses given in the Senate by both
leaders, and in another place on Monday last
by Hon. Mr. Howe, Minister of Transport,
and the eminent leader of the Opposition,
Right Hon. Mr. Bennett, are most interesting
and illuminating contributions to a better
understanding of our transport problem. Do
these addresses not furnish further reasons
for opposition to the amendment and the subamendment?
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourable senators, I rise to give what support I can to the
amendment moved by the honourable senator frorn Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Black).
There is no doubt that considerable changes
have taken place in the railway world within
the last few years. It is said, and probably
with truth, that the changes in Great Britain
have been phenomenal. Unified management
has brought about wonderful results there.
It might not produce similar results here,
for conditions are different. The newspapers
tell us that unification of management is being
seriously considered in the United States.
In that country also conditions may be largely
different from those in Canada. But can
there be any harm in getting all the up-todate information that is available? And is
there any public body in Canada better
qualified to get that information than a
committee of this House? In my humble
opinion, there is not. I am not very fa.miliar
with these things, but I can reason a little.
Suppose we
Then consider this point.
appoint a committee, and, after getting all
the information that is easily obtainable, it
comes to the conclusion that unified management would not be practicable or desirable
in Canada. Would it not be well to have
obtained that information? If the committee
should come to such a conclusion, the agitation
in favour of unification might be terminated.
As I look at the matter, there is nothing
to be lost by our adopting the suggestion
of the honourable senator from Westmorland.
If we refuse to proceed with such an inquiry,
a good deal may be lost: the information
that the committee could get might not be
available to this House.
I need not say any more; I do not know
that I am qualified to do so. But, if the
amendment of the honourable senator from
Westmorland is put to a vote, I certainly shall
vote for it. I thought it my duty to say this.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Marcotte, the debate
was adjourned.

On motion of Hon. Mr. McMeans, Bill C,
an Act respecting the Canadian Pacifie Railway, was read the third time, and passed.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will hand my
right honourable friend the answer.

DIVORCE BILLS

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This answer
is like many others: it does not answer. I
suggest that the question in its entirety be
referred to the Department of Justice. The
answer is to the effect that if a province
has by statute agreed to adhere to section
31 of our Exchequer Court Act, then the
Exchequer Court has jurisdiction in cases of
dispute mentioned in the section; and there
is an appeal from the Exchequer Court. But
the point is this: the answer is silent as to
whether or not a fiat is necessary in the absence of provincial adherence. I think this
comment might also be made: even in case
there is such adherence, the answer does not
show a fiat to be unnecessary.

On motion of Hon. Mr. MeMeans, Chairman of the Committee on Divorce, the following Bills were read the third time, and
passed:
Bill B1, an Act for the relief of Annie Elizabeth Climie Adams.
Bill C1, an Act for the relief of Margaret
Alice Mizener.

reading of Bill B, an Act respecting Divorce
and Matrimonial Causes.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That may be.
I question it. But certainly there is no conclusion at all unless there is provincial adherence by statute to that section of the
Exchequer Court Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I shall await
any supplementary question that my honourable friend to my left (Hon. Mr. Casgrain)
may put, if he is not satisfied with the present
answer.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is quite
satisfactory, except that I should like the
honourable gentleman, without waiting at all,
to procure an answer to the phase which I
have just put.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will draw the
attention of the Department of Justice to the
query of my right honourable friend.

THIRD READINGS

DIVORCE AND MATRIMONIAL
CAUSES BILL
MOTION FOR THIRD READING

Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourable senators,
when this Bill was before the House for second
reading I tried to make my position clear.
Apparently I failed to do so. Therefore I
shall have to try again at this time, on the
motion for third reading.
In coming to a decision on any question it
is very desirable, if not necessary, to have a
standard authority which all or most of the
disputants will accept. Accordingly, I took
the King James version of the Bible, thinking
that in a Christian assembly, such as this, I
should be on solid ground.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: May I ask the
honourable member if the Douay Bible does
not differ in some respects from the King
James version?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I am sorry my deskmate is not better acquainted with both versions.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR:

I have read both..

MARCH 24, 1938
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: However, if he will
listen to my feeble remarks perhaps his
information will become a little broader.
Judge, then, of my surprise when I found
that not even one of those who followed me
in the debate noticed either my arguments or
my authority so far as the spoken word went,
though twenty-nine out of the sixty-nine
members in the House at the time declared
by their votes that they believed in the indissolubility of the marriage tie.
But notwithstanding the adverse vote on
the second read-ing I have not lost hope. I
am still of the opinion that the majority of
the members of this House will not, upon
second thought, throw the Bible overboard.
I am strengthened in this opinion by an article
in the Ottawa Citizen of the 19th instant
and another in the Ottawa Journal of the saine
date. The article in the Citizen is headed:
"Dean Inge says Bible is 'losing ground' in
Britain. No possibility of going back to
'old uncritical bibliolatry,' but Gospel is needed
in Europe given over to 'ruthless cruelty.'"
The dispatch, dated March 12, is from London,
and reads:
The first of a series of White lectures on
"The English Bible," which had been prepared
by Dr. W. R. Inge, was read, in his absence
abroad, recently in St. Paul's Cathedral by
the dean, Dr. Matthews.
Dr. Inge took as his subject "What England
Owes to the Bible." He pointed out that at
a time when scholarship had thrown a flood
of light on all parts of the Scriptures, so that
if we took the trouble to study recent commentaries and introductions we might be in
a far better position to understand and appreciate it than earlier generations, the Bible
had been steadily and rapidly losing ground as
the centre of the religions life of the English
people. The time might come when the Bible
would cease to have its place in the seanty
library of the poor man's cottage and when it
would drop out as a subject of instruction in
our schools. Among the educated the Bible
was not much read, and even candidates for
ordination, as he found when he was a bishop's
chaplain, had only a very superficial knowledge
of it.
The change was inevitable and we could not
go back to the old uncritical bibliolatry, but
an effort was to be made this year to revive
study of the Bible and reverence for it,
because there was a great danger that the
wheat might be thrown away with the chaff.
This would be a terrible misfortune both to the
church and nation.
Gospel in the Modern Age.
Christianity, be said toward the close of the
lecture, was not a religion of a book as Judaism
became and as Islam had always been. Our
Lord wrote His message, not on paper or
parchment, but on the hearts of men. Nevertheless ours was a historical religion, which
came into the world at a certain time. The
New Testament anchored us to the first chapter
in our long history. We must not suppose
that the 2,000 years which had elapsed since
the birth of Christ had been years of steady

143

spiritual progress and enlightenment. There
had been progress in knowledge, but in spiritual
and moral truth we had much to learn from
the first century. Our progress must be in
more fully understanding and making our own
what for 2,000 years had been the guide and
inspiration of the saints.
" Now especially," he added, "when something like a reign of Antichrist has been let
loose upon Europe; when ruthless cruelty, on
a scale never seen before, has been not only
practised but justified by contemptible fanaties;
when the liberty with which Christ bas måde
us free is crushed and persecuted; and when
the State, that monstrous idol, is deified and
worshipped, where if not to the Gospel are
we to look for a power whieh may bring back
the nations to mercy and justice, to decency
and humanity?"
On the same day, the 19th of this month,
I read an article in the Journal under the
heading, "Lord Tweedsmuir thinks statesmen
should use Bible as textbook." The dispatch
is from Toronto and reads:
The habit of regular Bible reading has been
of "incalculable value" in strengthening the
national character of the people of the British
Dominions and of the United States, Lord
Tweedsmuir said to-night in an address here
to the British and Foreign Bible Society.
"I am inclined to think that if the Bible
were the habitual textbook of statesmen to-day,
there would be more wisdom and charity in
the world."
In paying tribute to the work of the Bible
Society, the Governor General said it was doing
a work compared to which the labours of
governments and parliaments were "small and
ineffectual."
The meeting marked the 400th anniversary
since a copy of the Bible was ordered set up
in every church. Lord Tweedsmuir confessed
to a preference for the authorized version of
1611 over the revised version. The 47 English
scholars who compiled it had accomplished a
"miracle."
These articles do not enable me to say
what the views of the gentlemen mentioned
are upon the legislation we are now considering, but for the life of me I cannot understand how men holding similar views with
respect to the Bible can reject its plain teaching on questions of such tremendous importance as those of marriage and divorce.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: May I ask my
I recollect
honourable friend a question?
from my reading of the Scriptures that in
discussing the qualifications of a bishop the
Bible says that a bishop should be the husband
of one wife. How does the honourable gentleman stand on that question?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: If my honourable
friend will make an appointment with me in
my room, I will do my very best to enlighten
him on the subject on which lie desires
information.
I will now comment briefly on the speeches
of some of the honourable members who

144

SENATE

spoke on and voted for the second reading
of the Bill. First I shall quote the honourable gentleman who seconded the motion
(Hon. M. Aseltime). At page 89 of Senate
Hansard he is reported as follows:
I may say, honourable senators, that I have
read the debates that took place on the English
Bill in the British Parliament, but have been
unable to discover in them any valid reason
why such a Bill should not be passed. The
Bill was supported by clergymen, lords and
commoners, and received a large majority on
each reading. In this connection I should like
to read what was said by the Lord Bishop of
Birmingham in the House of Lords on the
second reading of the Bill. He prefaced his
remarks with these words:
Then the honourable gentleman read an
extract from the Bishop's speech in favour
of the Bill.
Now, I admit at once that the views of
the Bishop of Birmingham and the other
English bishops who supported the British
Bill are entitled te respectful consideration.
But we have a higher authority than even
those men. We have St. Paul, who was also
a bishop, and a good one, and there is no
doubt about where he stands on this question.
In my speech on the motion for second reading of this Bill I quoted his words, and they
will bear repetition. They are from First
Corinthians, Chapter 7:
10. And unto the married I command, yet
not J, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart
from ber husband.

11. But, and if she depart, let her remain

unmarried, or be reconciled te her husband:
and let not the husband put away his wife.

Again in Ephesians, Chapter 5, he said:
31. For this cause shall a man leave his
father

and mother,

and shall be joined

unto

his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.
32. This is a great mystery: but I speak
concerning Christ and the church.
These quotations are from the King James
version. In the Douay version St. Paul calls
marriage a great sacrament. I have looked
up the derivation of both words, and I find
that in the Greek language they have the
same root and the same meaning. Perhaps
that will satisfy the inquiry which my honourable friend to my left (Hon. Mr. MacArthur)
made in the early part of my remarks.
But I notice that the honourable senator
from West Central Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) clashed with St. Paul, for he said
that marriage was neither a sacrament nor a
mystery. I must leave my honourable friend
to reconcile his statement with that of the
Bible.
Perhaps, however, some honourable members will say-in fact I know some do saythat our modern bishops know more about
present-day conditions than St. Paul could posHon. Mr. HUGHES.

sibly know. I will net argue the point, though
I have my own opinion on it, but we who
oppose divorce are not confined to St. Paul.
We have the teachings, clear and unmistakable in the Gospels, of the Lord Jesus Christ,
and if Christianity is not a myth, and the
Bible is not book of fables, that settles the
question. It might be said that St. Paul
could net look into the future and sec the
consequences of changed conditions. But if
Christ was and is God, that cannot be said
of Him. With God there is no such thing
as past or future time; everything is in the
present. He net only knows what will happen
in what we mean by "the future," but He
knows what, by any possible combination of
circumstances, could happen. In other words,
He is omniscient. Therefore He has the
power and the right to legislate for all men,
under all circumstances, and for all time.
The honourable mover of the second reading of the Bill (Hon. Mr. MeMeans) aso
tells us that for more than three hundred
years desertion has been a ground for divorce
in Scotland, and that Scottish homes have
net been broken up because of that.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
who said that.

No; it was net I

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: My reply is that the
Scottish homes have been kept together, not
because of the divorce law, but in spite of it.
They have been kept together because, generally speaking, the people of Scotland paid
more attention to the law of God on this
subject than they did to the licence given
them under the civil law.
When I was speaking on the second reading
of this Bill the honourable senator from Alma
(Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) asked me te tell him
why annulments were granted in the province
of Quebec, and, while I had some ideas on the
subject, I very properly referred him to the
senators, particularly the legal gentlemen,
from that province. In the middle of my
reply to the honourable senator from Alma
the honourable senator from Prince Edward
(Hon. Mr. Horsey) interjected a remark
which I did not hear, and to which I made
no answer; but anybody reading Hansard would
think that part of the reply which I intended
for the senator from Alma was given to the
senator from Prince Edward.
The interjection of the senator from Prince Edward
was as follows:
"But they," meaning the
laws of Quebec, "cannot supersede the law
you are quoting." If I had heard him, my
answer would have been: "No, nor bas any
power on earth the right to supersede the law
I am quoting, namely, the law of Christ."

MARCH 24, 1938
Several of the senators who spoke in favour
of the second reading of the Bill depicted in
strong terms the hardships suffered by people
who are unhappily married. But the allwise Creator saw all that, and the only remedy
He provided was separation from bed and
board. I think I could make out a strong
case regarding the harm that is done to
innocent children and to society by the adoption of the man-made remedy of divorce.
But, instead of doing so myself, I shall quote
some of the remarks of the right honourable the leader on the other side of the
house (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen). He has
the ability to see both sides of almost any
case. and to make them clear to others, in
language that I could not hope to equal.
Before quoting his words, however, I want
to correct him in one particular. He said,
as reported at page 91 of Hansard.
I know there are those who do not conceive
of the marriage contract having any of the
attributes of a mere civil obligation, but
regard it wholly in the light of a religious
ceremony.
If the right honourable gentleman referred
to the Catholic Church, he is wrong. That
Church holds that marriage, primarily, is a
religions ceremony with religious obligations,
but it also holds it to be a civil contract with
civil consequences and obligations.
Now, in regard to some of the consequences
of divorce, the right honourable the leader
on the other side spoke as follows, as reported
in Hansard at page 91:
In a word, any number of reasons can be
found for. supporting the relief of the individual.
Yet when that reasoning is carried to its conclusion one sees that the ultimate direction in
which it leads is toward the disintegration of the home, and bis heart shudders at
the result of his own logic. The home is the
whole basis of civilization. Without it we
cannot survive.
One country has made a
trialI suppose lie meant Russia.
-and has been compelled to retrace its steps.
Therefore all who feel that they are at a very
sacred point when dealing with legislation which
invades the home are going to be very careful
of the exact steps they take. In a word, you
cannot get a law which is fair to the individual
and is not going to result in the disintegration
of the home. If we make our laws broad
enough to cover all cases-to provide fair and
just treatment for the poor woman who is
deserted, for the poor woman whose husband
is a drunkard, for the poor man whose wife
has run away, for the poor man whose wife
bas become insane-we get to a point where the
fortifications of the home are gone.
The honourable senator from Parkdale
(Hon. Mr. Murdock) spoke on the second
reading, and, as usual, spoke strongly and,
I think, sincerely. He was perturbed over

what appeared to him to be the unfair laws
of the province of Quebec on this question,
and particularly the prejudiced way in which
these laws were administered as respects the
Protestant people of that province. And the
honourable senator from Alma (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne) seemed to share in the perturbation. The honourable senator from Parkdale
told us yesterday that the explanations he
heard from the Law Clerk in the special
committee, of which the honourable gentleman is a member, convinced him that the
views he had held regarding the laws of
Quebec and their administration were wrong,
and that he now believes the law and the
administration thereof to be all right. As soon
as that statement was made I suggested that
the Law Clerk of the Senate be brought before
the House and be asked to give to all of us
the information which had worked so great a
change in the honourable member from
Parkdale, and perhaps in other members of
the special committee as well. I was informed
that the rules of the House did not permit
the Law Clerk to perform such a duty. In
these circumstances I am obliged to ask the
honourable senator from Parkdale, or some
other member of the special committee, to
give us the information the Law Clerk gave
to the committee, and which worked such a
salutary change.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I correct the
honourable gentleman? The Law Clerk of
the Senate was not before the special
committee at all. The information which I
secured, and which to some extent changed
my views or confirmed my understanding, was
received from the Law Clerk personally in bis
office. He did not come before the committee.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I inferred that lie
did, from what the honourable senator said
yesterday; but it really makes no difference.
It makes all the stronger, as I see it, the
reason why the honourable member from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) should be good
enough to give the information which worked
such a change in him to the whole House. I
should like to hear it, and I am sure others
also would like to hear it. In my opinion
the honourable member from Parkdale owes
it to this House, to the people of Quebecyes, to the people of Canada and to himself
-to place upon the records the information
which he now possesses and which lie did not
have a few days ago.
And now a final word with regard to the
principle behind this whole business. It is
the whole question of Christianity that is
ýinvolved. If Jesus Christ did not teach the
indissolubility of marriage, He taught nothing

51958-10

SENATE

at all; and if we can throw the Bible and His
teaching overboard in one important particular, we can discard them in everything. The
British Parliament and the Parliament of
Canada may pass laws contrary to His laws,
but sooner or later the price of such legislation will have to be paid. If history teaches
anything it shows that it is easier for peoples
and nations to start on the toboggan slide
than to stop. There is hardly any stoppingplace.
I shall certainly vote against the third reading of the Bill.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, the last thought in my mind
would be to contribute towards delaying decision on this measure, but I am not satisfied
with the impression that probably would go
out as to the vote which I shall have to
give, if the division is taken now, unless I
made some statement by way of explanation.
First, I hope the honourable member
opposite who has just taken his seat (Hon.
Mr. Hughes) will not conclude, from the
mere fact that concrete reference has not
been made to his authorities, that the House
is quite indifferent to scriptural teachings in
this or any other matter. I should not be
speaking my own mind if I did not say that
no one could attribute more than I would,
in the way of beneficial results to humanity,
to the greatest of all books. But I want to
submit this thought. It is indeed dangerous
to search through either of the Testaments,
take from any of their books an isolated
sentence, and then lay that sentence before
a parliament and instruct it to legislate in
the exact terms thereof. No single sentence
and no single verse in the Bible of Christians
will relieve any legislature of the necessity,
the bounden, imperious duty, of determining
the direction of legislation by reference only
to the clear, practical results of such legislation upon the people for whom its laws are
passed. No legislature can shield itself behind
any section of scriptural writings and be
relieved of its own obligation to legislate as
in its free and informed judgment it deems
best for its country.
The honourable member quotes a sentence
which says that once the marriage ceremony
is performed the twain are one flesh. He
quotes another sentence which says that after
the marriage ceremony is performed it is
perfectly proper for that flesh to be divided,
as long as it is merely a separation of bed
and board. Still the one flesh is divided.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Net divorced.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But it is
divided. It is twain after that, as a conception
of the flesh. I shall net pursue the inquiry
Hon. Mr. HUGHES.

further. I have cited that as illustrating how
it is impossible to act save in the sunlight
of the whole writings, the sunlight of the
teachings which these writings are intended to
give, and as showing that we should not seek
to follow the specific, isolated wording of a
single sentence or paragraph.
I now come to the Bill.
I do not intend
to discuss the validity of decisions in the
province of Quebec. I should not be at all
averse to doing so if that subject bad any
relevancy to this measure. It has none. But
I want to state where I stand now and where
I shall have to stand when the division comes.
We have had no report from the committee
showing the necessity for adopting this new
divorce law. When speaking some few days
ago I gave expression to the reluctance which
I should feel about opening the door to
divorce petitions by including desertion for,
say, three years and cruelty as grounds for
divorce. I then admitted that if any one
who has been a victim of injustice on the part
of husband or wife, arising out of these very
grounds, approached me and demonstrated
that injustice, as she or he might easily do,
I never could answer, "I am going to vote
for a law that is fair for you." I could not.
I should have to admit that I am standing
for a law which permits that injustice to continue, a cruel and brutal injustice though it
may be. Suppose a wife cornes to me and
says: "My husband deserted me ten years ago,
and I can prove ho had no cause whatever
for doing so. I have been compelled to take
care of myself and to raise my children and
his, and I have slaved to do it. Your vote
compels me so to continue for the rest of my
life." I shall have to admit the charge. But
what am I te do?
I was impressed by the argument of the
honourable senator from South Bruce (Hon.
Mr. Donnelly).
He compared the effect of
our divorce law, as it is at present, with that
of our Criminal Code as respects persons
who suffer because of what others have done.
The comparison is most apt. A man is convicted of a heinous offence. He is the sole
support of bis wife and family; perhaps a delicate, crippled wife and a helpless family.
The law sentences him to the penitentiary.
There is no injustice to that man, but there
is the deepest and most callous injustice to
his abandoned wife and helpless children.
That injustice cries in the ears of Parliament
day after day, month after month. We do
not meet it. because we cannot meet it. If
we frame a law which provides in a tolerable
way for taking care of dependents of those
who commit crimes, we frame a law which
encourages commission of crimes and will

MARCH 24, 1938
multiply the roll of criminals. Before the
plight of the convicted criminal's wife and her
demand for justice we stand utterly impotent.
In the same sense we stand impotent before
the demand of the deserted wife, of the
drunkard's wife, of the wife who has been
the victim of cruelty throughout her marriage.
Our only answer can be that the utmost
we are able to do through legislation is to
seek to reduce to the minimum the perils of
society and injustices to members of society.
It is beyond our power to wipe these things
out. We have to weigh the consequences of
ill resulting from our moving in one direction
with those resulting from our standing still.
It may be that some day it will be possible
to persuade me to see these things differenty,
for one's opinions do evol.ve. If I could be
persuaded that the harm done by denying
freedom to the wife who is abandoned or
treated with -cruelty is greater than the peril
to the sacred institution of the home resulting
from thus opening wider the door to divorce,
I should be prepared to support this measure.
I cannet bring myself to do so without some
evidence or some high authorities to which I
can conscientiously submit my own convictions. Nothing of that kind bas been adduced
so far.
I should be prepared to support the Bill in
respect of all its provisions but two, namely
those contained in paragraphs (b) and (c)
of section 6, which add, as new grounds for
divorce, desertion for at least three years
and cruelty, not otherwise defined. I state to
the House in all humility that I am afraid
to vote for a measure which would open the
doors so wide. As at present advised, I intend
to vote against third reading.
Hon. G. PARENT:
Honourable senators,
it is not my intention to repeat all the arguments that have been stated in regard to
this measure, pro and con. The discussion
has been very interesting, and I have perhaps received from it some information that
I did not possess before. A number of honourable senators have given examples of what
may happen or bas happened occasionally to
persons who are married-in some instances
unhappily married. Perhaps I may be allowed
to refer to a case of which I know personally. The husband in question is a man of
honour, a man with a heart-and I believe
that a husband without a heart is not worthy
to be called a man. In this case, after a
few years of happiness, the wife suddenly
became mentally affected. Her husband had
enough money to take care of her and he is
doing so, spending all he can on her, in the
expectation that some day she will be cured.
Every day for the last fifteen years, I should
51958-101

147

say, he bas visited her at the hospital, hoping
that she would recognize him and call him
by name. Day after day be bas been disappointed, but be never fails to make his
visit, trusting that some time she will get
well and come back to resume with him the
happy life they had known before.
Now, I do not believe that it would be
wise to amend our law so as to permit a
divorce being granted if one of the parties
to a marriage becomes mentally ill, even
so ill as to be considered incurably insane.
As several honourable senators have pointed
out, there is always, especially in these days
of advanced medical science, a possibility
that a person in that condition may be
cured.
I do not need to say more along this line.
It would bo impossible to convince me that
any reasons are strong enough to warrant enlarging the grounds for divorce, because I do
not know of anything at all that would
justify divorce in any case whatever. When
a man and a woman take the vows before the
altar they ought to know their own minds.
They must take the risks that exist in life.
If they meet with any little difficulties they
must learn to put up with them, in my view,
for I believe that once you are married you
are rarried for ever.
For these reasons and because I am a
Catholic I am entirely opposed to divorce.
I should not like the motion to pass, and I
feel it my duty to move, in amendment,
seconded by the honourable senator from
Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duff), that this Bill
be not now read the third time, but this day
six months.
HonHon. IVA CAMPBELL FALLIS:
ourable members, I was unavoidably absent
from the House when the debate upon second
reading of the Bill took place. Had I been
here I should have joined forces with those
who approved of the principle of the Bill,
but asked that some amendments be made in
committee.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: I must say that after
having given a great deal of thought to the
matter I am entirely in agreement with the
principle of the Bill. But, as it now stands,
I cannot bring myself to vote for third
reading, for the reasons that were stated, so
much better than I could state them, by the
right honourable leader on this side of the
House (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen). I am in
perfect accord with what the right honourable
gentleman said, and it is not necessary for
me to go over the ground that he covered.
I felt that as one of the two representatives

148

SENATE

of my sex in this House I should explain
why I intend to vote against the measure
in its present form.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable senators,
I voted for the second reading of the Bill.
It will be remembered that I raised points
that have ibeen mentioned this afternoon in
the closing remarks of the right honourable
leader on this side (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen).
I felt that desertion for three years was far
too short to be recognized as a ground for
divorce, and also that the failure to define
cruelty might result in all sorts of decisions
with respect to it. I had hoped that the
committee would take these points into consideration. I was speaking to the honourable
senator in charge of this Bill (Hon. Mr. McMeans) and te told me that cruelty had been
well defined in a great many decisions handed
down by the courts over a long period of
years. Nevertheless, my view is that if
cruelty is to be a ground for divorce it should
be so clearly defined that no error could be
made about it. We know that judges are
independent, and if there is no definition they
may hold widely varying opinions as to what
constitutes cruelty, despite the decisions that
have been given. As the committee did not
see fit to-shall I say?-attempt to amend the
Bill with respect to the two points I have
mentioned, I must vote against third reading.
Hon. A. B. COPP: Honouratle senators, I
feel that I should say a word or two in cxplanation of the vote that I shall be forced
to give on this motion. I voted for second
reading the other day on the understanding
that the Bill would be sent to a special committee to be studied. A special committee
was appointed, of which I was a member, and
the Bill was considered, as honourable members know from the report. I felt veyy doubtful about the two paragraphs of section 6
referred to by the right honourable leader on
the other side (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
the other day and again this afternoon, and
I was especially doubtful as to the wisdom
of one of them, namely, that one which would
make desertion for three years a ground for
divorce.
These paragraphs were considered
in committee. What took place there, with
regard to them cannot be stated, but I think
I am not going too far in saying that the majority of the committee felt they should not
be changed.
As this Bill is not a very urgent one, I
think the suggestion made yesterday for postponement of the motion for third reading until
next Wednesday might have been accepted
by the sponsor of the measure (Hon. Mr. McHon. Mrs. FALLIS.

Means). Had that been done, a little more
thought and study could have been given
to it.
I intend to vote against the motion for
third reading of the Bill as it now stands.
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN:
Honourable
members, I rise only for the puýrpose of saying
substantially what tas been said by the right
honourable leader on the other side (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) and the honourable gentleman who has just spoken (bon. Mr. Copp).
I voted in favour of the second reading of the
measure, hoping, as they hoped, that the committee might restrict to some extent the
grounds for divorce set out in section 6.
It seemed to me that those grounds were in
some degree too broad and would perhaps open
the door rather more widely than is advisable
at the present time. Having voted for the
second reading of the measure, I felt it was
necessary for me to explain that I shall have
to vote against third reading of the Bill as it
is now worded.
Hon. H. H. HORSEY: Honorable members
of the Senate, I feel that there are perhaps
a few misunderstandings that we might be
able to clear up with regard to the proposed
additional grounds for divorce.
In the first place, it seems to me, we ought
to consider what the purpose of marriage is.
I think we all agree that it is to establish a
home for the two parties, where love and
affection should exist and where the children,
if any are born to them, may be brought up
in a proper atmosphere. Now, if with respect
to any marriage there comes into existence
any of the grounds mentioned in this Billand we think that the Bill specifies the
minimum number of grounds-the marriage
has broken down, the reasons which brought
the parties together have disappeared.
If
one party has wilfully deserted the other for
a continuous period of three years, te or she
has probably taken up with someone else.
The honourable the senior senator from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. McMeans) has already
mentioned cruelty, which, under the Bill,
would become a ground for divorce. Cruelty
is strictly defined by English case law. We
are all opposed to opening the door to flimsy
and frivolous grounds for divorce such as
obtain in another country. I am confident
that every member of this House is determined to maintain, the marriage tie as it
should be maintained. But when everything
that makes marriage worth while is gone but
the name, are we to refuse to do what is
right by the innocent parties? Our purpose
is to build up homes that have been destroyed
because marriages have been wrecked and the

MARCH 24, 1938
parties refuse to be reconciled. We want to
give the children in such cases a fresh chance
under regular home conditions.
With regard to the Scriptures, we know
that passages can be quoted from the Bible
in support of both sides of this question. But,
as the right honourable gentleman (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) has said, it is in the light
of the whole Book itself that we must consider
this matter. Common sense must prevail.
As the Master himself said that the Sabbath
was made for man, not man for the Sabbath,
so may we say that marriage was made for
man, not man for marriage. To meet cases
where the institution of marriage has been
wrecked and all that it stands for has
disappeared, we feel that, as Canadians, we
are only doing what is right and reasonable
in supporting this measure in its entirety.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, I was not present when this Bill was
given second reading, but, having had a few
years of parliamentary experience, and having
scrutinized the division and listened to the
speeches delivered this afternoon, I am
confident that unless the sponsors of the Bill
are prepared to amend it the motion for a
six months' hoist will carry.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: No.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is the honourable
gentleman's opinion.
I have given mine.
He has had more experience in this House
than I can claim, but I doubt whether his
parliamentary experience is any greater than
mine. All honour to the gentlemen who are
sponsoring this measure. Undoubtedly they
have a greater experience of divorce than any
other members of this Chamber. I gather from
reading the debate on the motion for second
reading that the members of the Divorce
Committee are unanimously, or very nearly
so, behind the Bill. Yet, notwithstanding their
views, many of us feel that paragraphs (b)
and (c) of section 6 should be deleted.
Anyone who has practised law knows that
desertion is capable of a very flexible
interpretation, and that three years is a very
short period of time to constitute desertion.
A court of law would, peradventure, accept
absence for three years as proof of desertion,
but many reasonable explanations could be
given for such absence, especially under the
conditions that we have been passing through
in the last few years.
As to the ground of cruelty, I agree with
the honourable the senior member from Winnipeg with respect to its legal definition, but
I think it is not yet a ground for divorce
in England where, I understand, the new

divorce law is not yet operative. Consequently there are as yet no precedents to
guide our courts, and they will have to define
what degree of cruelty constitutes a valid
ground for divorce. Let me illustrate my
point. Recently the Legislature of Manitoba
passed legislation providing that in case of
accident only gross carelessness on his part
sho.uld render the owner of a car liable to
indemnify the person riding with him, a
gratuitous passenger. We had a good deal of
trouble in getting our judges to define "gross
carelessness." and the law was not clarified
until a case went to the court of appeal.
I submit that similar difficulty would arise
with respect to a legal definition of "cruelty."
Again I suggest to the sponsors of the
Bill that they agree to the deletion of paragraphs (b) and (c) of section 6. The judicial
system of Great Britain is the standard of
the world, and when the British courts have
defined what constitutes desertion and cruelty
we shall be in a better position to adopt
these grounds for divorce. If the sponsors
of the Bill will agree to amend the Bill as I
have suggested, I shall vote against the motion
for the six months' hoist; otherwise I shall
vote for that motion.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: The honourable
gentleman who has just sat down is entirely
mistaken as to the definition of cruelty.
Hon. Mr. KING: Are you closing the
debate?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Cruelty has always
been a ground for judicial separation in
England and has been dealt with in many
English cases; so that to-day there is a very
clear definition of what constitutes cruelty.
But you cannot by statute define cruelty;
you cannot say that such and such an act
amounts to cruelty. Even if an attempt were
made to provide a statutory definition, no
judge would accept it. The judge would be
guided by the English decisions, which are
binding. The question of allowing desertion
as a ground for divorce was discussed in
the British Parliament on various occasions
over a period of three years, and ultimately
the Bill, which originated in the House of
Commons, was accepted by the House of
Lords. I do not know what better authority
than the British Parliament could be desired
on this point.
When introducing this Bill I stated that we
could not hope to draft a law to suit everybody. If we give the Bill third reading it
will go to the House of Commons, where it
may be amended in certain particulars. I
have introduced the Bill as a remedy for
what in my opinion is a great evil. I have

150

SENATE

had many letters-I 'hesitate to mention thisthanking God there was a Senate in this
country that would pass a law to relieve the
sufferings of the writers of those letters.
Are we willing to allow conditions to continue throughout Canada which force people
into immorality?
Husband and wife separate; the husband goes and lives with another
woman, and the wife associates with another
man.
That is desertion and immorality.
Under the present law the only ground for
divorce is adultery. To-day many of our
judges hold the view that desertion should
constitute a ground for divorce so that immorality may be prevented from spreading
throughout the land. I could cite, of my own
knowledge, cases in which the husband has
deserted bis wife and child and left them
penniless. Consider the wife's position. She
cannot have a male friend, for the neighbours
would talk about it. In desperation she goes
off and lives with another man. I feel very
strongly that desertion for a period of at
least three years is a proper ground for divorce.
Surely if a husband or a wife stays away for
three years there can be no doubt that it
constitutes desertion. We had before the
Divorce Committee recently a case in which
a wife told her husband, a farmer, that she
was going home to see ber mother, but as a
matter of fact she went over to Detroit to
live with another man. Is there any reason
why that husband should suffer indefinitely?
In such cases a question sometimes arises
as to the legitimacy of the children and as
to property rights. As we know, divorces
obtained by Canadian citizens in the United
States courts are not recognized in our
courts. If the husband or wife divorced in
the United States should marry again and
have cbildren, who is to inherit bis or her
property? The question of title to real estate
is also involved. All disabilities arising in
cases of this kind should be guarded against.
I should like to sec the Bill go to the
House of Commons for consideration and. if
necessary, amendment. There is no doubt
that there it will be just as fully discussed as
it bas been here. I think that for this reason
the Bill should be given third reading now;
but I am net insisting upon it.
Hon. G. GORDON: Honourable senators,
in my opinion the greatest joker in the Bill
is the paragraph providing that desertion
shall be a ground for divorce. It seems to
me that this in itself would encourage divorce.
What a respectable way it would be for
husband and wife to get rid of eacl othergoing away for three years and then coming
here for a divorce!
Hon. Mr. McMEANS.

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
Will my honourable friend admit what such persons do today? The honourable gentleman from King's
(Hon. Mr. Hughes) complains that in 80
per cent of the divorces granted by this Parliament the parties were guilty of collusion.
If husband and wife want to get rid of
each other, they resort to collusion.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: If that is already
covered by the law, why add desertion as
a ground for divorce?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
want collusion.

Because we do not

Hon. Mr. GORDON: As I have already
said, paragraph (b), making desertion a
ground for divorce, is the greatest joker in
the Bill. It simply means that yen provide
the most respectable means for a couple to
become separated. There is no scandal whatever; they retain their respectability after
their divorce. I have no apology to offer for
saying I am going to vote against the third
reading of the Bill. If, as the right honourable leader on this side (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) bas suggested, paragraphs (b) and
(c) bad been stricken out-and I thought
they would have been when the Bill was
being considered in committee-my main
objection would have been removed.
Hon. JAMES H. KING: Honourable senators. it seems to me, taking into account
present-day conditions, net only in Canada
and the United States, but throughout the
world, that adoption of the suggestion of the
honourable chairman of the Divorce Committee would be in the interest of the Canadian
home. I have been a member of the Divorce
Committee for the last three or four years.
It is well within the knowledge of the members of that committee and of the other
members of this assembly that under the
present law the courts of Canada cannot
function fully with respect to divorce. As
a result many of our people seek divorce in
other countries, and although such divorces
are not accepted by our courts, the principals
consider themselves free to remarry.
The recently enacted divorce law in Great
Britain bas been referred to. We know the
position of the Established Church, the
Catholie Church and the dissenting churches
there, and we know that not one of them is
in favour of divorce. But to-day there are
conditions in England, and indeed throughout
the world, that render it necesasry to regard
divorce from the standpoint of common
sense. My attitude on this question bas been
guided largely by the attitude of the British

MARCH 24, 1938
Parliament. Both in the House of Commons
and in the House of Lords the Divorce Bill
was thoroughly discussed, and in view of conditions in regard to collusion and desertionconditions that we know exist also in this
I would
country-that Bill was enacted.
remind honourable members that the sponsor
of the present measure has incorporated in it
the additional grounds for divorce which will
be law in Great Britain once the British
Act comes into force.
Hon. Mr. HORSEY: It is in force now.
Hon. Mr. KING: Then we are by this
measure simply adopting what is now law in
Great Britain. Great Britain is a much older
country than Canada, the people there are
more conservative than we are, and I am
prepared to accept their judgment in this
matter. I firmly believe that this Bill would
help to preserve the sacredness of marriage in
this country, and would tend to prevent a
still wider extension of the grounds for divorce
by some of our provincial legislatures. I am
confident that in this as in other matters we
shall do well to follow the practice of the
British Parliament. For the reasons stated
I shall support the motion for third reading.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Do I understand that
the simple act of desertion is a sufficient
ground for obtaining a divorce?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. GORDON: That is an encouragement to people to get divorces. Suppose a
young man and a young woman get married
and, as very often happens within a short
time, they have some disagreement. Under
this Bill they could arrange between themselves for one of them to go away for three
years, and that would provide the ground for
a divorce.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Is that not better
than the present law, with all the collusion
that takes place? Under the present law a
man has to commit adultery in order that
there may be a divorce.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Order!

Hon. Mr. GORDON: What I am saying is
thisSome Hon. SENATORS:

Order!

Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable members, may T, with some diffidence,
make a suggestion? As one who has followed
the entire debate on this question with a
great deal of interest, I may say that I am
heartily in favour of the principle of the Bill
as expressed on the motion for second reading,
and had intended to vote for the third read-

ing. It seems to me that this House should
not sacrifice its vote on the prineiple of the
Bill to two details which should be capable
of adjustment in order that what is contemplated by the Bill may be carried out. I
feel very strongly that the opinion of the
country is favourable to a more generous
attitude toward.s divorce, and without giving
further reasons for my position, I should
like to move, if it is in order to do so, that
the Bill be referred back to the committee
for a reconsideration of the two subsections
that have been referred to.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, in this House, as I think we
all understand, a Bill can be amended on
the motion for third reading. Therefore I
am going to vote against the amendment of
the honourable member from Kennebec (Hon.
Mr. Parent), which proposes the six months'
hoist. If any honourable member so desires,
he can then move that the Bill be amended
by striking out subelauses (b) and (c) of
section 6, and I shall support that motion.
If such an amendment is proposed and defeated, the Bill will then be before the House
for third reading in its present form. My
only purpose in suggesting this is to expedite
matters. I am sure the honourable leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) will agree
with me that this is the most expeditious
way in which the real feeling of the House
as respects the Bill can be ascertained and
recorded.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Is it proposed to
strike out desertion altogether?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If the amendment of the honourable senator from Kennebec is defeated, the motion for third reading
will be before us, and then any honourable
member can move as he may desire.
Hon. Mr. HORSEY:
The Bill could be
sent back to committee.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That could
be done, or a motion could be made to eliminate any portion of it whatsoever. If a
motion to eliminate these two clauses is
adopted, the Bill will be amended accordingly,
and will be before the House as amended.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
The special committee met; everybody knew about it; but
nobody appeared except the members of
the committee. If the Bill is referred back,
honourable gentlemen who have views to
express will have an opportunity of placing
them before the committee. I think that
would be the best way.

Some Hon. SENATORS:

Question!

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
Honourable members. I have been appealed to by
my right honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) with respect to the proper procedure
in this matter. I agree with him that we
must first dispose of the amendment proposed
by the honourable gentleman from Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Parent).
My situation is a somewhat difficult one.
I voted against the motion for the second
reading of the Bill, for reasons which I gave,
and which are obvious to all honourable
members of this Chamber. Having thus established my opposition to the Bill, I must
vote against it at every stage. I am therefore
obliged to vote for the six months' hoist.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: If the amendment
of the honourable gentleman from Kennebec
is carried, what is the position then?
An Hon. SENATOR:

The Bill is gone.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: If the amendment
is not carried, will the honourable gentleman
have an opportunity to move the six months'
hoist at a later stage?
Hon. Mr. PARENT:

The amendment of Hon. Mr. Parent was
negatived on the following division:

No.

Hon. Mr. CALDER:
It seems to me
that if the honourable gentleman withdrew
his amendment now, and the Bill were sent
back to the committee again, he would, be
in a position to move the six months' hoist
later.

REFERRED BACK TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Honourable senators,
I am prepared to move, in amendment,
seconded by the honourable the junior member from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig), that the
Bill be not now read a third time, but that
it be referred back to the special committee
for reconsideration.

not in this House, is to give instructions to

of whom voted for second reading. Judging
by the discussion which we have heard this
afternoon, only two of those proposed any
amendment in committee, the honourable
senator from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Copp)
and the honourable senator from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen). If the Bill is referred
back to the same committee for further
consideration, without any instructions, there
will be just a repetition of what has already
been done: the committee will report the Bill
without any amendment.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: How does the honourable gentleman know that?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Does the honourable gentleman not think we all have absorbed
some of the views that have been expressed
this afternoon? If any relief is to be given
under a divorce measure, perhaps we had
better not be too harsh at the start.

honourable member is showing some good
disposition.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Question!
The amendment was agreed to.
CIVIL SERVICE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. G. LACASSE moved the second
reading of Bill 3, an Act to amend the Civil
Service Act.
He said: Honourable senators, I have been
asked by the sponsor of this measure in
another place to move second reading, and I
do so with much pleasure. I do not think
much explanation is necessary. The Bill adds
a proviso to section 20 of the Act, and I think
this proviso is well inspired. It is intended to
give fairer treatment to certain members of
the Civil Service. The object of the measure
is to provide that all employees of the Federal
Government appointed to positions within a
province, or transferred from one province to
another, shall be qualified to use the language
of the majority of the persons with whom they
come into contact. So far as I can sec, it will
affect very few employees except in one
province. I would point out for the information of honourable members that this new
proviso was unanimously approved in another
place. I think the proper course to follow
would be to move, after second reading, that
the Bill be referred to the Standing Committee
on Civil Service Administration.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I should like to
ask my honourable friend a question or two.
I assume the Bill is intended to remedy some
existing wrong.

153

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Yes.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: And did I understand my honourable friend to say that wrong
is confined to the province of Quebec?
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Mostly so.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Let me draw my
honourable friend's attention to another aspect
of the matter. In the city of Edmonton we
have a post office employing between two
and three hundred persons. Among them are
a number of •French-speaking men whom I
have known and grown up with since boyhood. The French population of Edmonton
is somewhat less than five per cent. According
to this Bill, which requires federal employees
to speak the language of the majority of the
persons with whon they have to deal, all the
workers in that post office would have
to speak English. Any person who wanted
a job there would have to bo examined
in the English language, and if unable to pass
in that language he could not be appointed.
That is an aspect to which I think the promoters of the Bill should have given some
thought, because it would mean closing a source
of employment to French-speaking persons.
I draw the attention of the promoters to
another aspect, which is not strictly confined
to the wording of the measure. If this
amendment is passed and enforced, Frenchspeaking civil servants will be unable to get
employment outside those parts of Canada
where French is the language of the majority.
I am not quite sure of my figures, but I think
the French-speaking population of Canada is
about one-third of the whole. The terms of
this Bill would prohibit civil servants who
speak French from receiving appointment in,
or promotion or transfer to, any place where
the language of the majority is English. In
other words, the Bill would destroy two-thirds
of their opportunities for appointment and
advancement. That is something to think
about.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I see something
in the point made by my honourable friend,
and it occurred to me when I read the Bill.
The object is to remedy a wrong against some
people, but the result may be the committing
of another wrong against them. In northern
Ontario there is a large French-speaking population; in some parts up there the majority
speak French. If this Bill passed, Frenchspeaking civil servants would be able to secure
appointment there, but, as my honourabie
friend points out, they would not be eligible
for promotion which necessitated their transfer to any place where English was the
language of the majority. Now, there are

154

SENATE

persons whose native tongue is French, but
who speak English just as fluently, and there
are others whose native tongue is English,
but who are equally at home in French. Such
persons are now eligible for promotion in any
part of Canada, but if this measure were
enforced in its identical terms they might
suffer an injury.
I understand the intention is to refer the
Bill to a committee. It can be discussed
there by departmental officials, and, if necessary, some representatives of. provincial departments of education might be heard. It
is hoped the committee will make it clear
that no man or woman in Canada is to be
deprived of the right to promotion on account
of his or her native language.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Hon ourable
senators, I think the point raised by my
honourable friend from Edmonton (Hon. Mr.
Griesbach) bas not very great merit, for the
principle of this Bill is sound. An employee
of the Dominion Government should speak
the language of the majorityHon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The majority of
what?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The maljority
of the persons with whom he is required to
do business. But that does not make him
ineligible for transfer or promotion to a place
wherc the other language is spoken by the
majority of persons with whom he would be
required to deal, if he is able to speak that
language also.
An employee who speaks
either French or English and is sent into a
region where his language is that of the
majority, would not be handicapped under
this Bill. If le desires promotion to a place
where the language of the majority is different,
he will see that he qualifies in that language.
An employee who can speak only French, for
example, would surely not be expected to
receive promotion to a place where the people
he would be required to serve speak nothing
but English. And vice versa. That is the
kernel of the principle of this measure-that
the employee must speak the language of the
people whom Le serves.
I have known some departments to send to
a place persons incapable of speaking the
language of the people there. I will give an
instance or two. For the purpose of testing
cows in the county of my honourable friend
from Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Sauvé), someone in
the Department of Agriculture sent an employee who could not speak a word of
French. As 'Le went from village to village
Le was obliged to call upon some person to
act as interpreter. Imagine a similar thing
being done in an English county!
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
That is just
stupidity.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, I cal that
stupidity.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: You cannot cure
stupidity by legislation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The minister or
the deputy minister is perhaps not to be
blamed in such cases. Some time ago I was
telephoned by a firm to whose office two
men had been sent to make a check for purposes of sales tax or income tax.
They
spoke nothing but English, while all the
firm's book-keeping was in French. The firm
did not object to having its books examined,
but thought the examination should be done
by someone who could understand the language in which the entries were made. I was
told that those departmental representatives
were making themselves a nuisance by constantly requiring translations. I telephoned to
Ottawa and within half an hour they were
withdrawn. Here again there was stupidity
on the part of someone.
The principle recognized by this Bill is
that a civil servant must be qualified to serve
the people with whom Le comes into contact.
As I have said, I believe the Bill cannot
do any harm to anyone who is qualified to
use the language of the majority of the persons where Le is employed. He may naturally
qualify to serve in any centre. Te meet
the conditions, as I have explained, this Bill
was unanimously passed by the House of
Commons.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
Honourable senators, there is another feature, and I doubt
whether it las been taken care of. I will
read the proposed amendment of section 20:
Provided that no appointment, whether permanent or temporary, shall be made to a local
position within a province, and no employee
shall be transferred from a position in a province to a local position in the saine or in
another province, whether permanent or temporary, until and unless the candidate or
employee bas qualified, by examination, in the
knowledge and use of the language of the
majority of the persons with whom lie is
required to do business: provided that such
language shall be the French or the English
language.
My point is this. What are you going to
do in the case of a community that is 60 per
cent English and 40 per cent French? This
amendment does not take care of such a situation. Forty per cent of all the people in a
community with whom the employee is
doing business are not taken care of, for Le
is required to have only a knowledge of the
language of the majority, and the minority
can go to the deuce. That, surely, is not

155

MARCH 24, 1938
right. It seems to me that in the case of a
xnixed community, at least where the minority
is a substantial minority, it should be provided that the person appointed shall be able
to serve all the people, not a majority only.
I trust that feature of the proposed amendment will be considered if this Bill is referred
to a committee.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: If a person wants
to become a civil servant he must, as we
interpret the Act in our part of the country,
take his examination in French or English.
Under this Bill the examiners will have ta
take cognizance of the fact that the proportion
,of French people is very small, and the only
person they can appoint is the one who takes
the examination in English. As a result, all
those candidates who want to be examined in
French are automatically out of the running.
Throughout all the West that will be the
case: no more candidates can be examined
in French; all must be examined in English.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Unless the candidate asks to be examined in the two languages.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Not under this
Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Then, if that
is the case, the object of the Bill could be
defeated right in Quebec. The Bill seeks to
confine appointments to those who take the
examination and show proficiency in the
language of the majority. I shall not oppose
the Bill. I am in whole-hearted sympathy
with its purpose; and, especially as it has
been passed unanimously by the House of
Commons, I should never think of declining
to have it referred to committee. But what
the honourable member (Hon. Mr. Griesbach)
says is right. There are several other things
which ought to be taken into account by the
promoters of the Bill. It is just too bad that
what is sought to be effected cannot bc taken
care of by regulations and left to the common sense of the Civil Service Commission
and the departments. With all deference to
my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand),
I think pretty good common sense has been
used right along, both by the Commission
You never can
and by the departments.
legislate to prevent stupid errors. Persons will

continue to be stupid and make mistakes.
The city of Edmonton has a considerable
French population in the northeast. Suppose
some young fellows want to get into the
Government service. They may know a little
English, but they cannot take the examination in English and qualify. But even if they
could, they might never have to speak English
for a year and a half or two years after they
got into the service. In the Customs or the

Post Office they would not deal with the public
particularly. As they advanced in their positions they would, but at first they would not
need to be proficient in English at all. I can
remember instances in Portage la Prairie
where, if this proposed law had been in effect,
a young fellow could not have entered the
Civil Service at all. I know communities
where, if this Bill goes into effect, the candidates will have to be proficient in French,
but will not be required to know a bit of
English, and yet, though the great bulk of
the population is French, the officers will
to a great extent be dealing with Englishspeaking persons.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: With all due respect
to my right honourable friend, I should like
to quote from the official report of the Civil
Service Commission issued in 1934, where I
find this principle enunciated, which to my
mind should be the guiding principle in a
case such as the one just mentioned:
The Commission appreciates the fact that
where there is a mixed population of French
and English, both sections of the community
are entitled to facilities for transacting their
business in their own tongue.
I think that principle should be followed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: The adoption of this
Bill would give greater authority to whoever is appointed to administer the Act to
follow that principle and so avoid such stupid
errors as were mentioned by my honourable
leader.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE:

They have

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

They have

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: But for some reason
it has not been exercised.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. The
limitation stated so clearly by my honourable friend from Edmonton (Hon. Mr.
Griesbach) is perfectly plain. This Bill is
going to prevent those young fellows from
getting positions in the Civil Service. I am
nót going to oppose the Bill, but I put that
fact before my honourable friend. I do not
believe you would get better results by this
amendment. I think what is desired might
better be effected by regulations of the Commission than by any statutory enactment.
Every statute hammers both ways; it must
do so. If after consideration my honourable
friend wants the House to accept this Bill
I shall certainly not stand in his way. I
should like to contribute something to the
development of both languages in this coun-

try. I have tried to contribute a little to
this end-though it may have been very
little. Do not think I am against qualification in both languages. I am far from
opposing it.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I hope my right
honourable friend does not for one moment
think I question bis sincerity. I happen to
live in a district where there is a mixed
population and the situation could fairly be
compared with that which exists in Edmonton. Knowing my people as I do, I cannot
think this Bill will jeopardize their chances
of promotion, or limit their qualifications as
candidates for the Civil Service. Judging
from my own district, I feel satisfied that
nearly everybody there is sufficiently conversant with the English language and will
have just as good a show as anybody else
when taking examinations.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
pretty good in English there.

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: We find they are
too good, to the detriment of the other
language. Anyway I do not think this Bill
will jeopardize their chances at all. I fancy
similar .conditions exist elsewhere. I accept
the views of my honourable friend with an
open mind.
I think the points are well
taken and I have no doubt they will be discussed when the Bill is in committee.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The postman who
bas been delivering my mail in Edmonton for
the last eight years is a French Canadian. He
could not have passed an examination in
English at the time be was appointed, nor
could he to-day. On his route in the west
end of Edmonton there are not more than
half a dozen French-speaking persons, but
everybody is satisfied with him.

He is a good

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Yes, he is a good
man. He gets the mail out. Under this Bill
he could never have entered the Postal Service.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Does my bonourable friend suggest that we give the Bill
second reading and refer it to a standing
committee?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I do not like the
principle of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Lacasse, the Bill
was referred to the Standing Committee on
Civil Service Administration.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN.

SOLDIER SETTLEMENT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 33, an Act to amend
the Soldier Settlement Aict.
He said: Honourable senators, the Soldier
Settlement Act bas been frequently amended.
This Bill contains two further amendments.
The purpose of the first is to reduce the rate
of interest from 7 per cent to 5 per cent.
Subsection 2 of section 66 of the Act reads:
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Act, if the settler fails or neglects to
pay any lawful rates, taxes or assessments, or
to keep such property insured as aforesaid, then
it shall be lawful for the Board to pay such
rates, taxes or assessments, or to insure such
property as aforesaid, and ail moneys expended
by the Board with interest at the rate of seven
per centum per annum computed from the
time of advancing the same shall be repaid
by the settler. . . .
By this amendment we reduce to 5 per cent
the rate of interest he would have to pay.
The second amendment bears on clause 73,
which says:
Any settiler or person indebted in respect of
any contract or agreement made prior to the
first day of January, 1933, under the provisions
of this Act, who after the thirty-first day of
March, 1933, and up to and including the
thirty-first day of March, 1938, makes payment in respect of any arrears or of any instalment due and payable within the said period
shal:, subject to the provisions of this section,
receive credit toward payment of arrears or
on the balance of such instalment or on any
other such instalment for a further sum equal
to the payment made.
The period is extended to the 31st day of
March, 1941.
That is all there is in the Bill. I move the
second reading.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, I have read the provisions of
this Bill as carefully as I could. I believe
it was the intention of the original Act that
the rate on taxes and insurance charges paid
by the Soldier Settlement Board should be
5 per cent, but there was a clause which justifled a rate of 7 per cent.
The second section of the Bill merely extends the time within which any soldier settler
paying arrears accrued before a certain date
four or five years ago is given a dollar bonus
for every dollar he pays on the arrears. This
is a practice such as bas been adopted by
many companies, and other sufferers, because
of the difficult times, particularly in the West.
I think it is too bad that it is to be applied
generally, because there are districts where it
is not justified, where it is just a straight
gift and encourages not only indifference, but

157

MARCH 24, 1938
actual dishonesty on the part of the settler.
Under government operation I do not suppose
this can be helped. You cannot very well put
through a Bill enabling the board to use its
judgment, for it might exercise that judgment
with other considerations than fairness to
the settler. But if a private company or
person could carry on this operation it would
be done infinitely better than any government board can do it.
Why should all settlers get a low rate like
5 per cent because they will not pay their
taxes? The result of such a system is that
they finance at the expense of the Government. A fellow who is only half good is net
going to pay his taxes when all he has to
pay is 5 per cent; he will not even pay the
arrears. He knows that under this Bill he is
all right until 1941. He will get the money
and pay later onRight Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Maybe.
he has
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: -if
any thought of paying at all.
This illustrates the fact that there is no
more ludicrous proposition than that Government can handle these things as well as
private enterprise. If some of these people
who are always preaching that the Government should get into social service could see
the handicaps under which a Government operates, and if they had any brains at ail, they
would abandon the awful delusion. Here is
a board struggling with this problem, but,
being a government board, it is bound by
rules backward and forward, left and right,
even if supposed to be actuated by the best
intent and to possess the very best brains
and capacity. Under government operation
the work just cannot be done well.
On a number

WAR VETERANS' ALLOWANCE BILL
OR SECOND READINGMOTION
DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading
of Bill 35, an Act to amend the War Veterans'
Allowance Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the question of war veterans' allowances has been
before this Eouse on two occasions; first in
1930, and then in 1936. When the pension
legislation was first brought before Parliament it was generally considered, I think,
among those who had been dealing with soldier problems, that under our Pension Act
the soldier who was to secure, benefits must
have sustainedl his disability, either a wound
or a deterioration in health, as a result of
war. We did not have in this country a great
body of men who had been engaged in warfare, and we set up our Pension Act to cover
veterans who had seen service,. But as time
went on we found from year to year that there
was a large group of men whose medical records did not show that they had been under
treatment, but who had sustained disabilities
through illness. It was a question how that
group should be taken care of-whether the
Pension Act should be extended in such a way
as to make it generally applicable to the Canadian army.
The Canadian War Veterans' Association,
which views with great interest all legislation
relating to war veterans, has never suggested
that there should be a general pension for
men who served in the Great War.
Between 1926 and 1930 I had occasion, as
Minister of the department, to make a study
of this problem. I called into conference

158

SENATE

the members of the Pension Board and suggested to them that it was opportune and
necessary to take care of men who had served
in a theatre of war, but who could not seicure
pensions under the existing pension legislation, and that some provision should be made
for them after they had reached the age
of 60. There had been legislation in Canada
providing pensions for the civilian population
at the age of 70, but this large group of
veterans could not wait until they had attained
that age, and some provision had'to be made
for them. A very careful inquiry was made
by the departmental officials, and it was estimated that these men could be taken care of
by means of allowances to veterans who had
served in a theatre of war. They were pressing not only the Pension Commission but
the Government generally for a recognition
of their right to pension.
In 1930 we brought down what was known
as the War Veterans' Allowance Act. That
Act has taken care of a large group of men
and has been of great benefit to them,
and,
probably, to the people of Canada. A very
careful survey was made for the purpose of
ascertaining the ultimate cost of allowances
of this character. I am pleased to say that
we bave kept within the estimates then made.
We are now undertaking to enlarge the
activities of the board. This will involve
additional cost. The first amendment will
bring in men who served in the South African
War. They will be entitled to the benefits
available under the Veterans' Allowance' Act.
It is estimated that 7,366 men left Canada
to go to South Africa, but that only 5,325
of them saw service on land during the campaign, the remainder having arrived subsequently to the cessation of hostilities or never
having landed at all. It is estimated that
those now living number about 3,500. At least
half of that number served in the Great War
and would come under our pension laws or
the present Veterans' Allowance Act.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I think the honourable gentleman made a mistake in saying they
would come under the pension laws. Did he
not mean to say they would come under the
War Veterans' Allowance Act?
Hon. Mr. KING: My honourable friend is
quite right. It is considered that the exoe)nditure involved would be some $30,000 to $50,000 in this regard.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: May I ask the hnourable gentleman a question? The number of
South African veterans who he says come
under the present Act includes even those who
did not land in South Africa?
Hon. Mr. KING.

Hon. Mr. KING:
those who served.

No; it

includes

only

Hon. Mr. BLACK: I thought it included
all.
Hon. Mr. KING:

No.

Hon. Mr. BLACK:
It does not include
those who sailed from Canada, but did not
land?
Hon. Mr. KING: No. This enactment
follows the British practice with regard to
South African veterans: it applies only to
those who landed and served in South Africa.
The second amendment-in dealing with it
I shall be brief. for it is nearly six o'clockprovides for enlargement of the board. There
have been three members, but the work of
the board will be so increased because of
these present amendments that it is felt two
additional members should be appointed.
I pass on to the fourth amendment.
Under the Act of 1930 a veteran of sixty
might make application for an allowance
if he was incapacitated and not able to
perform work that would give him an
ordinary living.
The Act provided for a
married veteran, who had served in a theatre
of war, a maximum payment of $40 a month
if he had reached the age of sixty or was so
disabled as to be permanently unemployable.
The maximum rate payable to a single veteran in the same circumstances was $20. In
addition, the married man could receive $20
and the single man $10 per month from other
sources. It is now proposed to broaden the
Act so as to give the board greater liberty
to deal wih men between the ages of, say,
fifty and sixty. Take the case of a man
who served well overseas, had a good record
as a soldier, and has not been able to get
employment. His physical condition is such
that no medical man will give a certificate
that he is permanently incapacitated for
work. B.ut if the board, which knows his record, feels that he should be granted an
allowance, it will have powe.r to grant him
one, under this amendement.
The Veterans' Assistance Commission, which
was appointed in 1933 or 1934, I think, reported recently that there were unemployed
throughout the Dominion approximately 15,000 veterans who had served in a theatre
of actual war and were unprovided for by
pension. They classified these veterans into
three groups: fit, partially fit, and unfit. More
than 10,000 of them were classified by the
Commission as being fit, and 5,171 as partially
fit and as unfit. It is for this group of just
over five thousand veterans that the amendment contemplates making provision, subject, of course, to investigation and approval

159

MARCH 24, 1938
by the board. The anticipated annual cost
is about $2,000,000.
I am told by the Minister and also by
officials that under this proposed legislation
there will be an increase in payments as these
veterans approach the age of sixty, but that
from now on there will be a decrease in
pension payments for war disabilities, and
that one class will pretty well balance the
other.
It is my intention, after the Bill bas been
given second reading, to move that it be
referred to the Committee on Banking and
Commerce, where the whole matter can be
thoroughly discussed.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Griesbach, the debate was adjourned.

reading on Thursday next.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, it is not customary to speak at this
stage, but on reading this Bill it occurred to
me there was no reason why the weights and
measures legislation of this Parliament should
not all be in one statute. This Bill refers,
not to the Weights and Measures Act, but to
some special Act relating to binder twine,
repeals some of its provisions, re-enacts others,
and adds some new provisions on the whole
subject dealt with as weights and measures.
It seems to me very clumsy work. Why not
accomplish the purpose by amending the
Weights and Measures Act and then repealing
the special Act that is dealt with by this
Bill? I make this suggestion so that it may
be considered by the Minister before the Bill
comes up for second reading.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I thank my right
honourable friend for drawing my attention
to this feature of the Bill. As to the details
of the measure I know nothing at the moment:
that was my reason for asking that second
reading be taken on Thursday. Meantime I
shall examine into the suggestion of my right
honourable friend and shall consult with the
department from which the Bill emanates.

SENATE

TRIBUTES TO THE LATE SENATOR
FRIPP
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
members of the Senate, it is my painful duty
to bring to your attention the sudden decease
of the Honourable Mr. Fripp, who passed
away on Saturday last.
Before his entry into this Chamber I had
not come into contact with our departed
friend, but had heard of him as a brilliant
member of the Bar and a very popular and
esteemed citizen of Ottawa. I have read the
encomiums which appeared in the press of
this city and elsewhere, and am not surprised
at what was said in them about our late
friend.
He not only sat in the Ontario
Legislature as the elected representative of
the people of Ottawa, but later came to the
House of Commons and represented them
there for two parliaments. After his appointment to the Senate I saw enough of him to
realize that be had all those qualities which
place a man high in the esteem of his fellowcitizens. He possessed kindliness to a high
degree, and in bis personality there was a
special charm such as is more often given to
members of the other sex. He had a kindly
smile, a quiet dignity and a pleasant look
which made all who met him feel that they
were facing a gentleman of refinement and
understanding.
When hie came here he was already suffering
from the disease which brought his life to a
close. This made him, so to speak, a looker-on
in this House rather than a participant in our
debates. Not having had any contact with
him either at the Bar or in the House of
Commons, I feel that my right honourable
friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), who sat
with bim in the House of Commons, will be
better able than I am to give expression to the
thoughts which I have tried to voice, and
that he will join with me in extending our
sympathy to the family of our deceased
colleague in the loss they have sustained.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, friends of the late Senator
Fripp will be grateful, I know, to the leader
of the House for his kindly and generous
references.
My acquaintance with A. E. Fripp goes
back to 1908, the year in which be entered the
Legislature of Ontario and I entered the
House of Commons. Any man who reaches
three bouses of parliament in our country bas
qualities which command attention. I do net
know that the outstanding features of Senator
Fripp's personality could be more accurately
located or better defned than they have been
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

by the honourable leader of this House. The
late senator had personal attractiveness and
charm.
He had a kindly feeling for his
fellows. In his professional career he developed
a marked capacity for ascertaining the feelings
of juries and the whims of judges, and he
well knew how to handle the interests of bis
clients when in the presence of either a jury
or a judge. He achieved a position of very
considerable credit at the Bar of Ontario.
Mr. Fripp was distinctly an Ottawa man.
It would be difficult indeed for anyone
representing the city of Ottawa in Parliament
to be otherwise. The onus that falls on such
a member is an exceedingly heavy one. I
doubt whether anything in the cares of a
member of Parliament brings more anguish
than the particular kind of burden which Mr.
Fripp bad to sustain. He bore himself well.
For three years he sat in the Ontario House,
for ten years in the House of Commons, and
for four years in the Senate of Canada.
We all witnessed with distress the gradual
failing of his health, so evident in his appearance for the last two or three years, and yet
it was with a shock we heard a few days ago,
that he, by no means an old man, had passed
away.
Time, like an ever rolling stream,
Bears ail ber sons away.
As the years pass they steal from us one by
one, and I fear we must admit that life
becomes increasingly lcn.oscme.
With the honourable gentleman who leads
this House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) I join in
expressing to Mr. Fripp's invalid widow, who
bas suffered much of physical pain, and to his
heroic daughter, our sincerest sympathy.
Hon. L. COTE: Honourable members, it
would be pure futility on my part to endeavour to add anything to the expression of
our common feelings which bas just been
so eloquently given by the honourable leaders
of this House on this mournful occasion. On
the other hand, I hope that honourable members will forgive me if I do not remain
silent, but attempt to voice-inadequately,
I know, but most sincerely-the sadness which
at this moment flows from my heart to my
lips.
I bad net known Senator Fripp for as long
a time as bad the right honourable the leader
on this side of the House (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen), but I had the honour of making
bis acquaintance twenty-eight years ago. From
that acquaintance there developed a friendship which became stronger and greater as
I passed from adolescence to man's estate,
and which has endured ever since. I was a
law student when the late Senator Fripp was

MARCH 29, 1938
a member of the Legislature of the province
of Ontario, as well as a leader of the Bar of
this city, where his convincing eloquence,
particularly in jury trials, served so well his
love of justice. From that early period of
my life, now so remote that the mists of
time already dim the clearness of rententbrance, no recollection is clearer than that
of our departed colleague as lie then was.
He was life exuberant and loyalty incarnate. Of
that life and loyalty lie has since given in
bountiful measure to public service.
Senator Fripp entered this House in 1933,
at the same time as I did. Unfortunately,
within a short period after his appointment
he began to feel the symptoms of lassitude and
fatigue which were to develop gradually into
the ailment that brought about his death.
Thus we in this House were deprived of the
brilliant and useful collaboration which he
otherwise would have given to our deliberations.
Now he has traversed that momentous
though brief space of time required for the
passage of human life into eternity. I have
risen as a colleague from the city of Ottawa
to deposit on his grave a tribute to an old
and cherished friendship, and to express a
deep sense of loss because he will no longer
be with us. May I also express my deepest
condolence to the bereaved but very brave
members of his family who survive him, his
wife and his daughter.
CANADA'S

RAILWAY

PROBLEM

DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Wednesday,
March 23, the adjourned debate on the
motion by Hon. Mr. Beaubien:
"That, in the opinion of the Senate, the
Government should be urged to settle the
railway problem of Canada at an early date
in order to stop the ruinous loss made each
year by the Dominion through the Canadian
National Railways, and which already amounts
to several billion dollars."
And the amendment proposed by Hon.
Mr. Black:
"That all words after 'that' in the first line
be stricken out and that there be substituted
therefor: "a committee of the Senate be
appointed to inquire into and report upon the
best means of relieving the country from its
extremely serions railway condition, and financial burden consequent thereto, with power to
send for persons, papers and records and that
said committee consist of fourteen senators."
And the sub-amendment proposed by Hon.
Mr. Murdock:
"That all the words after the word 'upon'
be struck out and the following substituted
therefor: "the enormous cost of Canadian railways to the people of Canada, and to recon-

161

mend to this Senate some plan whereby the
taxpayers of Canada may be relieved, and be
assured of a first charge guaranteed return of
not less than $75,000,000 per year upon the debt
and interest charges of the Canadian National
Railways while, at the same time, following the
highly-spoken-of British plan of conserving to
railway employees their positions without undue
hardship.'"
Hon. A. MARCOTTE: Honourable members of the Senate, my remarks in the present
discussion will be confined mostly to the
expression of a wish. In his powerful address
the other day the right honourable leader on
this side (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) conplained that the public was not educated to
the point where unification of our railway
systen would be possible if unification were
the only salvation. The right honourable
gentleman also stated that lie was sorely
disappointed in the result of State management
of our National Railways. May I say that if
I am sorry because of this state of affairs I
am not disappointed, for I never believed
and do not believe yet that State operation
would te successful, especially in a democratie
country such as ours.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: There are three
cardinal reasons for the lack of success of
State operations: (1) money is easy to secure
for any purpose of construction or development, whether needed or not; (2) extravagance and waste predominate in operations;
(3) there is an absolute disregard of the
necessity and means of repayment of borrowed
moneys.
I do not believe in the unification of our
railways, for many reasons, which I do not
need to state in these remarks. However, it
may be interesting to quote several questions
placed before the public by the Hon. Dr.
Manion in a speech delivered by him before
the Canadian Club of Toronto two or three
years ago. He said:
I am going to put a series of questions which

I want somebody to answer. Tell me what
are the answers. Every one of these twelve
questions should be answered before you business men decide amalgamation is a good thing.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: What was the
date of that speech?
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: Unfortunately I
do not know the date, but I think it was delivered in the last year Dr. Manion was
Minister of Railways.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: In 1935.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: I will get the
information if .my honourable friend desires
it. Dr. Manion went on:

REVISED

SENATE

These are the questions:
(1) Are the amalgamated railways to be
under private or under Government control?
(2) How much saving can be made by amalgamation under present traffic conditions?
(3) If, by amalgamation, savings are made,
in what proportions are these savings to be
divided between the Canadian National and
the Canadian Pacifie?
(4) How much capital expenditure will be
necessary to effect the physical union of the
two railways, such as the uniting of terminals,
and how will the money be raised?
(5) If the Canadian National is to be absorbed by the Canadian Pacifie, how much
of the present deficit of $50,000,000 is the Canadian Pacifie ready to absorb? Certainly not
the whole of it-probably not half of it-but
surely we should have some estimate. Will
the Canadian Pacifie guarantee to absorb any
stated portion of the deficit? If the Canadian
Pacifie states it will, and then fails, what could
we do about it?
(6) If, on the other hand, the Canadian
Pacifie is brought under Government ownership, are the bondholders of the Canadian
Pacifie to be guaranteed their interest, and
would the holders of common stock expect to
Or are all the
bc guaranteed dividends?
security holders willing to throw in their lot
and take chances on the result?
(7) In case of amalgamation will the Canadian Pacifie put in all its assets (such as
steamships, express, hotels and land) or only
part of them?
(8) What is to be done about the settlers
and industries, and towns and terminals, on
lines to be abandoned? Are they to be conpensated? If so, how much will it cost? Are
they to be moved? If so, where?
(9) Where railway terminals or shops or
towns are closed up through union, are those
affected, who located there in good faith, to
be compensated? Or do they become wards
of the State-on relief, in other words, like
many of our industrial workers to-day?
(10) As the estimated savings necessarily
must be made out of railway operating and
maintenance expenses, and as from 60 to 65
per cent of such expenses are made up of labour,
what provision is proposed to provide for
these displaced wage-earners until they can be
absorbed into other industries?
(11) Should not these questions te answered,
or are we to decide on amalgamation, or unification, first and get the answers, good or bad,
afterwards?

Or are we to be stampeded into

doing something-anything-going somewhereanywhere? Has not that been our trouble in
the past?
(12) Finally, is this the time-at the
bottom (or near it) of the financial crisisfor a final decision on this very important
question?
The Duff Commission, which won the praise
Df every citizen of this country, pronounced
itself against the unification of railways, but
recommended co-operation. I believe in coaperation and fair competition, and both are
possible at the same time. In England this
has been proved, te the utmost satisfaction
of the public at large, in rec.ent years.
Hon.

Mr. MARCOTTE.

I said that I wanted to express a wish, and
I do se. I do not sec any reason for the
appointment of a special committee to study
this question. We have a Railway Committee,
ably presided over by a well-informed former
Every senator who
Minister of Railways.
is not a member of this committee tas a right
to attend its meetings and take part in
deliberations, though not to vote. But the
most important point is net whether we have
an inquiry made by our Railway Committee
or a special committee. What is most important is to have an inquiry and have it
made publicly. The widest and fullest publicity should be given to the proceedings of
whatever committee conducts the inquiry, and
te the representations made by interested
public bodies as well as by the managers
and operators of our railways and the experts
called to enlighten members of the Senate,
so that the public may have a chance to learn
of the truc situation of our railways, including the causes of deficits in operations, and
the facts with respect to unnecessary construction, ships and certain railway branches,
things which have helped to create the
immense debt now existing. The people have
to be educated. Give them a chance to learn
and te know, so that we may have the support
of publie opinion on this matter.
In 1925 a special committee of the Senate
was appointed to study this same problem.
But it sat behind closed doors. The committe,e is said to have secured a lot of valuable information. Did the public get it? Never.
Resolutions were passed.
But what good
could they be when the public did net know
what they were based upon?
We should net repeat that mistake. The
present situation is a serious one, with very
grave consequences. This Chamber is considered as the safeguard of the rights of
Canada and of lier citizens, also of her credit
abroad. The Senate must help in finding
facts which will enable us to solve the
problem of getting our railways to meet their
obligations toward the country, the bondholders, the employees and the public; the
country because it is footing the bills; the
bondholders because they have invested their
savings with confidence in the future of
Canada; the employees because they need
their work and their wages if they are to be
happy and contented; the public because it
is entitled to good service at a fair price.
We do net need to go back farther than
1931. The Duif Commission compiled all the
necessary information up to that date. Let
us find out what tas really been done since
then to better conditions.

MARCH 29, 1938
Let the public know why co-operative
arrangements have not been entered into,
although the honourable leader of the Government reported a statement by Sir Edward

Beatty that thereby $6,340,000 could be saved
annually.
Let the publie know why Sir Edward
Beatty, in his address before the Board of
Trade at Vancouver, on the 4th of September,
1934, could make the following statement:
May I point out to you that the Royal
Commission on Transportation reported that
during the nine years 1923-1931 the Canadian
National Railways failed by no less than
$456,063,195 to earn the interest which the
Government of Canada was bound to pay to
private capitalists who owned the securities
of that system. Whence came this sum of
You paid as
almost half a billion dollars?
much for the service of that railway system
as you would if it had been privately owned,
and you paid in taxes almost half a billion
dollars in those nine years to private capitalists
for the privilege of saying that you owned the
Canadian National Railways.
In those nine years the private capitalists
who owned the Canadian Pacifie Railway received in interest and dividends $401,080,152.
In this case, however, I wish to point out
to you that this amount did not come from
taxation in addition to your payment for
service. It was saved by the owners of the
private railway company from the money which
they received from you for the transportation
of persons and commodities.
If this is exploitation by private capital as
contrasted with protection for the public by
public ownership, then I do not understand
the meaning of the English language.
Let the public know why the Duff Commission reported that construction under Canadian National management was costing from
fifteen to forty per cent more per mile than
under Canadian Pacifie management, and why
the ratio of Canadian National operating
costs was increasing while that of the Canadian Pacifie was decreasing.
Let the public know why, in the operation
of hotels, the Canadian National lost millions
of dollars while the Canadian Pacifie was
making millions in profits.
Let the public know why, in 1924, to earn
a gross revenue of 239 millions the Canadian
National expended 221 millions; in 1925,
to earn ten millions more it spent five millions
less; and in 1930, to earn one million more
it spent 12 millions more.
Let the public know why co-operation,
which is so successful in England, would not
be possible here; why improvements in the
service to the public, such as the English
railways find it profitable to make, are not
possible in Canada.
Let us open the doors and educate the
public so that it will learn the facts, think
about them, judge them and support wise
51958-11j

168

and sound proposals. At the present time,
what reports of our deliberations are made
outside Parliament, in the press and elsewhere?
If the right honourable leader on this side
of the House (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
presents facts it will be reported that he
made a political speech. But let the honourable leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) likewise state well-known facts,
and he is reported as making a defence of
the present system. The honourable senator
for Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien), in a
forceful and well delivered address, presents
the existing problem and asks for a solution:
he is portrayed at once as the advocate and
champion of the Canadian Pacific Railway.
Let us look at an example of the way in
which some people would wish to educate
the public. I quote from an editorial in the
Ottawa Journal of March 24, 1938. Under the
heading, "A Professor Abusing Public Men,"
it says:
President Franklin Roosevelt once told
historian Emil Ludwig that one of the perils
of our time was the propensity of certain
people to belittle and vilify public institutions
and public men. "These," said the President,
"are the instruments of democracy, and those
who abuse and defame them play the game of
forces which want democracy destroyed."
We are reminded of this by a speech made
in Montreal this week by Professor W. T.
Jackman, of the University of Toronto. Professor Jackman, engaged in what appears to
be his full-time job of advocating railway
unification, touched upon the proposal to have
an investigation of the railway problem by a
committee of the Senate, sneered:
"Discussion of the issue in the Senate might
be very desirable for the education of many
members of that House who have been thinking
too long in terms of the archaie. But we would
like to say . . . that a committee composed of

members whose minds are saturated with
politics, even though two or three of them have
risen above that thraldom, is not likely to
produce results which will merit public confidence."
The editorial continues:
Academie superciliousness is detestable at
any time. It is particularly detestable when
it is allied with the ignorance displayed by
Professor Jackman.
If Professor Jackman
knew anything about the Senate he would
know that its members are perhaps less
"saturated with polities" than any public body
in this country.
And Professor Jackman's logic seems to be
on a par with his sense of fairness and
responsibility. He said: "The natural course
would be for the Minister of Transport to
appoint a committee of the Cabinet, representing the public interest, to meet a similar group
representing the business interests of the
country

.

.

. with the object of examining

comprehensively

and judiciously

of unified operation

. .

."

the problem

Thus we have the proposition that a committee of the Senate, whose members are not
responsible to either parties or constituencies,

SENATE
would be "saturated with politics," but that
a committee appointed by the Cabinet, and
partly composed of members of the Cabinet,
who are necessarily the creatures of parties,
and responsible to constituencies and parties,
wouldn't be "saturated with polities." It is
marvellous reasoning.
Often The Journal wonders how it comes
that so many university professors can secure
so much time from their class-rooms to tell the
rest of us how to behave ourselves. Dr. Jackman, in particular, judging by the campaign
he is carrying on for railway unification, seems
to be especially fortunate in this respect. It
may be, of course, that a "Professor of Transportation," which is what Professor Jackman
describes himself to be, is not burdened with
overly onerous duties. Indeed, we have been
unable to discover just what it is that makes
a man a "Professor of Transportation," and
our bewilderment is not lessened by the fact
that, looking up Professor Jackman's record,
we have been unable to find that he bas ever
been connected with any sort of transportation
system or agency in any character or capacity
whatsoever, that he is not even an engineer.
The Journal is in favour of froe speech,
would be the last to want to curtail it. But
The Journal wonders what service Canadian
Clubs and like organizations think they are
performing when permitting a gentleman like
Professor Jackman to abuse and belittle public
men while professing to discuss a question of
which ho seemingly knows little.
You have there the malignity of the pedantic
professor and castigation by the well-informed
newspaper man.
Propaganda is going on for unification of
our railways, for the saving of millions, but
nobody will tell us how this economy is to
be effected. Let us find out. It seems to
me it is our duty to ascertain the facts, and
then publish them, so that the public may
be able to come to a conclusion on those
facts and call upon the Government to formulate a sound and feasible policy.
In
order that that may be done, we must let the
public know the facts.
Hon. J. A. McDONALD: Honourable senators, what I am about to say may not be
very palatable in some quarters. At the outset I wish to state that I am not taking a
stand either for or against unification, amalgamation or public ownership of the two great
railway systens; but I contend that something
must be donc to relieve the situation, the
terrible uncertainty of which is seriously affecting the morale of our railway men.
If it is true, as some honourable members
have stated, that we are facing national
bankruptcy, I think that every step we take
with respect to this matter should be very
carefully considered.
Let me say at once that I do not question
the motives or sincerity of the honourable
senator from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Black)
in moving his amendment for appointment
Hon. Mr. MAROTTE.

of a special committee.
He is known in
New Brunswick as being always in the forefront of measures for the benefit of his
province. But I very definitely question his
jud.gment in advocating a special committee
at this time, and in a few words I intend to
give my reasons for this view.
I go back to 1925, when, as the honourable
member who has just resumed his seat (Hon.
Mr. Marcotte) has said, a special committee
of the Senate sat behind closed doors; and
this, naturally, damned its proceedings from
the very beginning.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: May I explain?
That committee did not sit behind closed
doors in the sense which the words usually
imply. We invited certain expert railway
men from the United States to appear before
the committee. They said, "We will come
over and give you our views, but, as we are
actively connected with our own railways,
we must insist that no notes be taken of our
evidence and no reference be made to us
whatever." We accepted their condition, and
they attended and gave us the information
privately. They would not give it publicly
for fear it might prejudice their positions in
the United States.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD:
That simply
buttresses
my statement.
I thank the
honourable gentleman very much for explaining that for certain reasons it was a closeddoor committee with no reporters present.
There would not, it seems to me, be very
much difference between that committee and
the special committee suggested by the
honourable member from Westmorland. Any
honourable senator could of course attend the
meetings and ask questions, but actual control
of the proceedings would be in the hands of
the committee.
No Government can expect to improve the
condition of our railways by drastic methods
unless it has the confidence of the publie;
and if the 'situation is as serious as has been
represented by honourable members who have
taken part in this debate, then the public
must be educated. This is a troubled old
world. In every capital and every political
party in Europe suspicion is rampant. Any
unusual move or statement is seized upon and
exaggerated to the limit. Why arouse suspicion
here? It may be said that the proceedings of
the proposed special committee would be wide
open, beeause, as I have already indicated,
any senator could attend the deliberations and
ask questions; but the similarity between this
special committee and the closed-door committee of 1925 is that only the members of
the committee could vote. The forming and

MARCH 29, 1938
crystallization of its findings and their submission to this House would be entirely in the
hands of the members of that committee.
At the beginning of this present movement
in the House the honourable senator from
Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) made a
powerful and well-reasoned speech in favour
of unification. ,He reached the height of
eloquence, but made a very anomic and weak
ending in suggesting that this House express
its opinion to the Government that something
must be done. In a word, he came in like a
lion, but went out like a lamb. By bis
proposal he would place on the Government
the onus of making a decision. But the
honourable gentleman from Westmorland
(Hon. Mr. Black) came to the rescue of the
Government and moved for the appointment
of a special committee to find a solution, thus
shifting the onus to the Senate. The only
good point that I can see in bis gesture is
that he calls on the leader of this House, a
member of the Government, to select a large
number of the proposed committee. The
honourable leader represents the Government
in this Chamber, and he would be responsible
for the personnel, the conduct and the findings
of that committee.
Let us see how this proposed committee of
fourteen would be appointed. The Maritime
Provinces are very much interested in this
question: they would have two or three
members. The splendid province of Quebec
would presumably have three or four members,
as would also the grand old province of
Ontario. Then the great West, including the
Prairie Provinces and British Columbia, would
have similar representation. Such would be
the personnel of the proposed committee to
handle this tremendous problem, a problem
affecting every man, woman and child in
Canada.
We have in the Committee on Railways,
Telegraphs and Harbours of this House a
solid, trusted body of fifty members-almost
a committee of the whole. But under this
proposal our Railway Committee would be
side-tracked. The leader of this House would
be detouring around our Railway Committee,
headed by a chairman who is known for bis
impartiality and is probably one of the bestinformed men in Canada on railway matters.
I refer to the right honourable gentleman
from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham).
He would be side-stepped by the leader of
the Government. Why this detouring?
What will the public say of this special committee appointed for the purpose of educating
public opinion?
What will our business
men from coast to coast say? Will they be
satisfied?
Our chartered banks, whose

165

splendid management saved this country during the depression and won the admiration of
the world-how will they receive this proposal? The small manufacturer who, in bis
bedroom in the evenings, walks the distance
to Chicago and back while trying to see how
be can satisfy his bank, pay bis taxes and
keep bis men employed-how will lie view
this departure? The railway men of Canada,
our best citizens, who are wondering now
whether besides paying their taxes they will
have to pay almost with their lives-what will
they say?
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: What will Aberhart say?
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: I think, borrowing a term from a committee of the other
bouse, that this would be funny if it were
not tragic. I do not like my honourable
friend's interruption at this particular point,
anyhow. I am asking how this proposal to
appoint a special committee will be received
by big business, by our banks, by our small
manufacturers, and by our railway men.
How are our railway men helping to pay
the railway bill? In 1930 there were 184,000
men employed on our railways; in 1937 there
were only 118,000. The operating expenses
of the roads dropped in that period from
$380,000,000 to $300,000,000.
Who is paying
for this saving? The railway men. I am
going to do my utmost to protect them from
paying the whole bill.
At this point I want to pay a compliment
to a great Canadian. I may surprise some
honourable members when I say that I consider Sir Edward Beatty a great Canadian.
I understand lie bas stated that he will consider no proposition for a solution of this
gigantic problem that does not fully and
amply protect the railway men on both systems. That is a very important and very
generous statement on his part.
The men engaged on the railways in the
Maritime Provinces are among our finest
citizens. There are few openings for young
men to make a living in the Maritime Provinces, and therefore our best blood is, in a
way, forced to enter the railway profession
in its different phases. As I say, there are
not such openings for our young men in the
Maritime Provinces as are avaliable to young
Canadians in Quebec and Ontario. Confederation settled that.
Hon. Mr. CANTLEY: Who told you so?
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: Therefore, as I
say, some of our best young men enter the
railway service. I realize that I am as a
voice crying in the wilderness. I expect I
shall be told that the advantage of having
a special committee would be that, as there

166

SENATE

are two shades of public opinion with respect
to the railway problem, it will be well to
have a fifty-fifty representation on the committee. I shall be told that about half our
members are in favour of unification and
amalgamation and about half against it, and
the committee should reflect that division of
opinion fifty-fifty. In other words, a jury is
to be appointed on the principle that it
would be wise to have as nany for as against.
If that be se, in my opinion it would be a
fine setting for a dog fight.
I consider the word "shadows" one of the
most expressive in the English language, but,
much as I admire the word, I do not want
shadows in any hole or corner of this problem.
I have not the capacity to grasp figures running into billions, or even hundreds of millions,
but I can watch step by step to see that our
railway men, our finest citizens, shall net
I cannot understand this
be
sacrificed.
shadow-boxing; I cannot fathom the reason
for the honourable senator from Montarville
making a magnificent address and then fading out of the picture, leaving it to the honourable member from Westmorland to propose
the appointment of a special committee, which
would take a tremendous responsibility away
from the Government and place it upon the
Senate. But the honourable gentleman from
Westmorland went further: he suggested that
the two leaders nominate the members of the
committee. One of those leaders represents
the Government in this House, and, as I said
before, te would guarantee the conduct and
the findings under this private arrangement.
I do not wish to repeat myself, but we
have a Railway Committee of this House,
a standing committee, composed of tried and
proved senators, specially selected for their
knowledge of railway matters, recognized
and trusted by the public as the proper
body to handle the business of railways,
Then why form
telegraphs and harbours.
If, for instance,
another railway committee?
an important question having to do with
banking came before us, is it likely that
anyone would propose to side-step our Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce
and appoint another banking committee? Why
therefore, I ask, when this tremendous railway
problem has to be dealt with, should we sidetrack our regular Standing Committee on
Railways? I repeat, I cannot understand why,
in these circumstances, we should seek to
appoint a special committee when we already
have a very efficient body to deal with tbe
subject-ii atter.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN moved the adjournment of the debate.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD.

Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable members,
I do net know whether I have the right
to make a few remarks or not, but if the
mover of the adjournment (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) will allow me, I should like to offer an
explanation. I appreciate the kind remarks
made about me by the honourable member
from Shediac (Hon. Mr. Mcponald), although
I regret that he does not seem to have much
faith in me.
I may say that there is no sinister intent
behind my suggestion for a committee; neither
is there any intent that the Senate or this
committee should decide on amalgamation,
unification, or anything along that line. In
proposing the committee I said that it should
be a fact-finding committee, and that in order
to have a committee that would find the
facts and would 'be able to report to this
House, two things were essential. The first
was that the committee should be non-partisan,
and the second that it should not be so large
as to be unwieldly and unworkable. I make
this explanation merely that the House may
understand what was in my mind.
As the honourable senator from Shediac has
pointed out, the Railway Committee is composed of fifty members. That is a large
committee to hold sittings on any question
over an extended period of time. As honourable senators who are members of committees
know, while many committee members attend
regularly, there are others who do net. This
committee, if it is to get sufficient facts to be
of use to the country, will have to work hard
in order to be able to lay them before the
House. Members who do net attend every
sitting will net be conversant with what has
taken place during their absence. They will
be likely therefore to ask questions regarding
those matters, and thus delay the committee's
work. That is one of the arguments against
a large membership.
It bas not been decided whether or net this
committee shall sit behind closed doors.
Every expression of opinion I have heard has
been to the effect that the sittings should be
wide open. Net only would every member
of the Senate be allowed te attend the meetings, but te would have just as much right
as any member of the committee te ask
questions. I think my honourable friend from
Shediac will find that meetings of the committee, if and when organized, will be wide
open, and I trust that its proceedings will be
published and be made available to every
member of this House and the public at large.
There is one other thing I desire to say.
Nobody has a higher regard for the Railway
Committee than I have. It is an excellent

167

MARCH 29, 1938
committee. It was not, however, appointed
to consider this question. Its business is to
consider railway matters or railway bills which
are referred to it. It has no more inherent
right to function as a special committee than
has any other committee of the House. Furthermore, there is this unfortunate feature
about that committee at the present timeand I am now expressing only my own opinion
-that a preponderance of its members come
from one side of the House. In order to be
of use to the public the committee must be
open to receive information, and, having once
received it, must be ready to give it to the
public in the interest, not of the Conservative
party, the Liberal party, or either one of
the railways, but of the ratepayers as a whole.
It is important, therefore, to have an independent committee. It was for these very
cogent reasons that I made my proposal.
When the proper time comes I intend to

suggest that the committee should consist
of twenty members instead of fourteen; and

I trust that if the committee is appointed
the honourable member from Shediac and
every other honourable member of the House
will make it their business to be present at

the meetings of the committee to give it the
benefit of their views, and see that proper
information is brought out and disseminated
throughout the country. If we ail approach
this question from the stand-point of getting
the facts we shall be doing a real service
to Canada; but we shall be doing a service to
nobody if we endeavour to approach it from
any partisan or narrow point of view.

Hon. Mr. McDONALD:

I am very proud

to say that I am an old railway man, having

been a telegraph operator and train despatcher,
and therefore know a little about railways.
As I read the amendment it is that a committee be appointed to inquire into and
report upon the best means of relieving the
country from

its extremely

serious

railway

condition, and it is not a fact-finding committee.
This means the Senate must find
a solution. There has to be a vote of the
House. .I believe everybody would be agreeable to a change in the number of members
on the committee from fourteen to twenty.
The honourable gentleman is gradually seeing
the light. But if the motion is changed to
make this only a fact-finding committee, what
can be accomplished by it?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I have no further
comment to make.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Beaubien, the
debate was adjourned.

CANADA GRAIN BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. E. SINCLAIR moved the second
reading of Bill 27, an Act to amend the
Canada Grain Act.
He said: Honourable members of the Senate,
in moving the second reading of this Bill I
may explain briefly that there is no very
great principle involved in it. It merely has
to do with details in the carrying out of
recommendations of the Board of Grain Commissioners with respect to the establishment
of further grades of Garnet wheat, the change
of No. 3 and No. 4 Manitoba Northern by
the exclusion of Garnet wheat from those
grades, and the, maintenance of the quality
of No. 1 and No. 2 C.W. Garnet by making
them non-mixing grades. Section 1 of the
Bill makes two grades of Garnet non-mixing
grades. Section 2 provides that overages
above one-quarter of one per cent in No. 1
and No. 2 C.W. Garnet shall revert to the
Crown.. Section 3 establishes, as may be seen
in the schedule to the Bill, a third grade for
Garnet wheat. This, in brief, is the effect
of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Is it intended to
refer it to committee?
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: That is a matter
for the House.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED

TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: If it is thought
desirable, we can go into Committee of the
Whole on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Would it not go
to the Committee on Banking and Commerce?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: The Committee on
Agriculture.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: There is so little
detail in the Bill that it is scarcely worth
while sending it to a select committee.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
I should
think the proper committee would be the
Committee on Banking and Commerce, because the Bill has to do with matters administered by the Department of Trade and
Commerce. Then, should there be any who
object to these changes in classification, or
to particular amendments, they could be
heard.
I do not know that there are any
such persons; I have had no communications at all; but we always endeavour to

SENATE
give anybody who wants to be heard an
opportunity to appear. It seems to me that
in this case that procedure should not be
omitted. If nobody appears before the committee the Bill can be reported at once.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Would you
send it to the Committee on Banking and
Commerce?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

I think so.

It really has to
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR:
do with commerce. The Bill is introduced at
this time so that those engaged in the raising
of wheat may know what the standards are.
I move that the Bill be referred to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Those are
public insurance bills, governing the trade.
This is a private Bill.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I have no objection.
It can go to the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills. I would so move.

BILL

SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from Thursday, March
24, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. King for the second reading of
Bill 35, an Act to amend the War Veterans'
Allowance Act.
Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH:
Honourable
senators, this is an important Bill, if for
no other reason than that it involves an
expenditure of a good deal of money, and
an explanation may well be made at this time
as to how we find ourselves in our present
position with respect to the people who are
covered by it.
In the first place, I think it proper to observe
that under our Pension Act we have created
the Canadian Pension Commission, a tribunal
which has been in operation for a number
of years, to make cash allowances by way of
pension according to the degree of disability,
to men who have contracted disability while
in military service. A great deal of le gislation has been passed on this subject, a body
of lav and precedent has been established,
and a general uniformity of administration has
been set up. The Commission deals with
those ex-members of the forces who suffer
from disabilities which they contracted while
in service, and with the widows and dependents
left by such ex-members after they die.
Some years ago, I think in 1930, it was
agreed after a committee of the House of
Commons had inquired into the subject that
there was another class of ex-service man
who was entitled to the consideration of the
country: he was the man suffering from a
disability, not necessarily contracted in the
service, but which rendered it impossible for
him to make a living. So this War Veterans'
Allowance Act was brought down. It had to
do with men of an entirely different type

MARCH 29, 1938
from that dealt with by the Canadian Pension
Commission. The law as it stands to-day
provides that a man who served in an actual
theatre of war, who has reached the age of
sixty, who is mentally and physically incapable of making a living and is in need,
shall receive a grant from the War Veterans'
Allowance Board, the amount being $20 a
month for a single man and $40 for a
married man. There is a further provision
for similar grants to incapacitated veterans
below the age of sixty years who are in need.
I emphasize again the distinction between the
two classes of men: those being dealt with by
the Canadian Pension Commission and those
being dealt with by the War Veterans' Allowance Board.
The Bill before us, providing amendments
to the War Veterans' Allowance Act, is somewhat difficult to understand if read alone,
because it states merely the proposed amendments to the existing statute. A number of
questions that might arise in connection with
the measure itself are answered by reference
to the Act. The first clause would bring within
the operation of the War Veterans' Allowance
Act a body of ex-service men who served in
the South African war. They were not formerly
contemplated by the Act. I draw attention
of honourable members to the fact that the
Canadians who served in that war were recruited in and by Canada, but while they were
upon the high seas, I think, or when they
arrived in South Africa, they were taken over
by the British Government. Their pay was
the same as that of the Imperial army, which
was, I think, a shilling and two pence for
an infantry man and a shilling and four pence
for a cavalry man. This country subsequently made a contribution to bring their
pay up to what was then the Canadian rate,
75 cents a day. The Imperial Government
looked after their pensions, and no South
African soldier was or is pensioned at the expense of the Government of Canada.
It was found by the Veterans' Assistance
Commission. which went about the country
last year under the chairmanship of Colonel
Rattray, that there are in Canada to-day a
number of veterans of the South African war,
not entitled to a Canadian pension, who are
suffering from disabilities which place them in
the same classes as disabled ex-soldiers of
the Great War. The number of men who left
Canada for South Africa was 7,366, of whom
5,325 served there and corne under this Bill.
Of these it is estimated that half saw service
with the Canadian army in the Great War and
are therefore eligible under the legislation as
it has stood uo to the present time. The

169

opinion of the Board is that of the remainder
not more than 175 or 200 will be entitled to
allowances under these proposed amendments.
Clause 2 of the Bill provides for an increase
in the number of members of the War
Veterans' Allowance Board. The present statute requires that the Board shall consist of
three members, but under the amendment the
number could be increased to five. I think
it will be found that this provision is a
reasonable one, in view of the increased
work which will fall upon the Board because
of these very amendments.
Section 4, on page 3 of the Bill, is important. By paragraph (a) ex-service men
who have served in a theatre of war and are
now suffering from disabilities which make
it impossible for them to earn a living come
virtually under a form of old age pension
upon attaining the age of sixty. There is no
change there from the present Act. Paragraph (b) makes a change by providing that
allowances may be granted to such men, even
though they have not attained the age of
sixty years. Paragraph (c) introduces a third
class, and with respect to this I desire to
make some remarks.
The Veterans' Assistance Commission, to
which I have already referred, found that
there were enrolled in different ex-soldier
bodies throughout the country some 30,000 unemployed veterans. Half of them were said
to be already receiving pensions or allowances, or else not eligible for such payments,
because their service had been confined to
England or Canada. Of the slightly more
than 15,000 who served in an actual theatre
of war, two-thirds, or 10,000, were classed as
physically fit. These do not come within the
terms of this proposed legislation, for the
only problem confronting them is lack of
employment. The remaining 5,000 were classified by the Commission as partially fit or
unfit, and it is this group who are contemThat paragraph
plated by paragraph (c).
proposes to bring under the War Veterans'
Act any veteran who
does not qualify by age or disability under
the two preceding paragraphs, but having
served in a theatre of actual war, is in the
opinion of the Board incapable and unlikely
to become capable of maintaining himself because of economic handicaps combined with
physical or mental disability or insufficiency.
I agree at once that it is very difficult to
describe this type of man accurately or
thoroughly in a bill. Our concern over the
inclusion of them within the provisions of the
Act may be somewhat assuaged by knowledge
of the fact that they all are now on relief in
some way or other. That is to say, they are
receiving relief provided by municipalities or

170

SENATE

provinces, or by the Pension Commission.
The amendment would simply bring ther all
under the Board. When the measure comes
before a committee, as I suppose it will, the
estimates made by officials as to the number
of men affected, and the probable cost of
providing for them, can be fully inquired into.
There is a provision in clause 5 for not
taking into account, when estimating the
income of veterans, any pension or grant
made to them by reason of their having been
awarded the Victoria Cross, the Military Cross
or the Distinguished Conduct Medal. Any
pension received because of any of these
distinctions is not considerable, and, regard
being had to the reasons for which the awards
were made, there can be no objection to this
clause.

measure of preparation, of training, to ensure
that our officers and men knew their work and
were properly equipped before they were called
upon to confront the enemy. Those casualties
are of course reflected in the pension bill which
we have to meet in these latter days.
Since I have been speaking to-night about
a class of men who are suffering from disabilities which did not arise during the War,
but whieh nevertheless impose upon us an
obligation, it is interesting to observe a few
facts. First of all, let us look at the way
in which our soldiers were recruited. I shall
argue presently that if we had faced the issue
of conscription before 1914, if we had legislated
so that everybody would have known what
to expect, we should have taken only the fit
men, and avoided entirely the desperate

prominent men, some who had soldiered and

accepted the invitation as a patriotie duty.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

MARCH 29, 1938
the Veterans' Allowance Act to the extent of
one-third of the money we are paying now.
I venture to think that the pensions and
allowances being paid to-day to such men are
as large as or larger than the pensions and
allowances being paid to men who actually
suffered injuries at the hands of the enemy.
But let me say at once that I have not the
slightest intention of casting any aspersion
upon officers who raised those battalions or
the men who came forward to join. They all
were motivated by the highest patriotic
reason. On another occasion I expressed the
opinion that as a result of lack of vision and
courage in facing the situation our pension
list was increased by thirty per cent. By this
particular item the list is increased by another
thirty per cent.
I venture to say that if in 1910 we had
calmly and deliberately prepared for the war
which we knew was coming, if our public men
had faced the issue of conscription, if we
had embarked upon a proper system of education and training for our officers and men,
and had from start to finish accepted only
fit men, we should be paying to-day only
about one-third of what is now required for
allowances of every kind.
The matter is important now that we are
apparently facing another great war. We are
engaged on a rearmament programme of sorts,
and are discussing what ought to be done
in certain circumstances-matters of policy
and the like; but no one seems to worry about
the fact that, whatever our contribution may
be, it involves trained man-power, and that
if we would avoid the mistakes of the past,
mistakes which are costing us so much money
to-day, we should be well advised to face
the issue of conscription, of getting the right
sort of men, of training our people in time
of peace in order that if we do go to war
again we shall have trained officers and men,
who, when they do meet the enemy, will know
how to conduct themselves. Then, at the
close of the next great war, when we sit
down to settle the cost, we shall at least have
the satisfaction of knowing that we profited
by our experience of the last one. I hope
that will be so, but I am bound to say I
see very little evidence around me of any
likelihood of it.
As I have said, I have taken this opportunity to bring before the House and those
outside who may read what I have said the
outstanding importance of grappling honestly,
courageously and understandingly with this
great question of preparation not only in
material, but also in man-power.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. King, the Bill was
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
PENITENTIARY BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 36, an Act to amend the
P-enitentiary Act.
He said: The purpose of this amendment is
to remove an inconsistency between the provisions of subsection 2 of section 1019 of the
Criminal Code and subsection 4 of section 44
of the Penitentiary Act. The latter subsection
provides, in effect, that the time spent in gaol
pending appeal shall not be computed as time
served in connection with the sentence unless
the appeal is one made by the Crown, whereas
subsection 2 of section 1019 of the Criminal
Code provides, in effect, that time during which
the convicted person is detained in gaol when
he is the appellant may count as part of the
sentence, according to the directions of the
Court of Appeal. The amendment makes the
provisions of the Penitentiary Act subject to
those of the Criminal Code.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Bill was read the third time, and passed.
CANADA

EVIDENCE BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 37, an Act to amend the
Canada Evidence Act.
le said: The purpose of the amendment
contained in the first clause of the Bill is to
make the husband or wife a competent and
compellable witness for the prosecution where
the charge is one of theft by husband or
wife of property of the other. The amendment was suggested by the Commissioner of
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, as
follows:
Section 4, subsection 2, should be amended
to provide that a husband or wife shall be a
competent witness for the prosecution lu
charges laid under section 354 of the Code
(Theft-Husband and Wife). As the Canada
Evidence Act now stands, the husband whose
property is stolen by his wife cannot give
evidence against her, and vice versa.
At present there are eight exceptions from
the general rule.
The purpose of the amendment contained
in clause 2 of the Bill is to permit proof to
be given by affidavit of the sending of any

SENATE
demand or notice by a department or branch
of the Public Service in order to avoid excessive costs in having witnesses go from
Ottawa to all parts of the country to prove
the sending of such demand or notice. The
necessity for the amendment arose particularly through difficulties encountered by the
Statistices Branch in endeavouring to carry
out duties in connection with obtaining
statistics.
The purpose of the amendment contained
in clause 3 of the Bill is to permit proof by
affidavit that there is no account, if such be
the case, where proceedings have been taken
against a person for issuing worthless cheques.
Under the present law a copy of an entry in
the books or records of the bank may be
proved by affidavit, but there is no provision
for proving the negative, and this amendment
will permit such proof. The suggestion for
this amendment came from J. W. McFadden,
K.C., Crown Attorney of Toronto, in connection with which he stated as follows:
Section 29 of The Evidence Act should be
re-drafted. Our courts are flooded with prosecutions of cases where bad cheques are given.
Some of these cheques are given on banks
ranging from Halifax to Vancouver. Most of
these cheques are for smail amounts. We cannot go to the cost of bringing a banker, but
by section 29 we are able to prove the statement of the man's accout by affidavit. The
section, however, is deficient in that it only
provides for cases wlere the man lias got some
account in the bark. Where, however, cheques
have been given and there is no account at all
there is no provision made, and the consequence is that we cannot think of launching
a prosecution.
I have taken thie matter up with Mr.
Secretary of the Bankers' Association, Rogers,
and he
is quite alive to the necessity of some amendment. Some time ago I drafted an affidavit
for use in the courts. This bas been a real
boon to bankers in that they are not wasting
three or four mornings in court, and incidentally
it has saved the city several hundreds of
dollars in money. Wherc, however, there is
no account we still have to subpoena these
bankers.
I think from their experience honourable
members will appreciate the necessity for these
amendments.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Would the honourable gentleman explain a little more fully the

The first and the last are the two important
ones. The last amendment should certainly
be a saver of both time and expense.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill

of the Senate, I would move the third reading of the Bill.

be better to refer it to Committee of the

CANADA'S

RAILWAY

PROBLEM

DEBATE CONTINUED-SPECIAL
APPOINTED

COMMITTEE

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion by Hon. Mr.
Beaubien:
"That, in the opinion of the Senate, the
Government should be urged to settle the
railway problem of Canada at an early date
in order to stop the ruinous loss made each
year by the Dominion through the Canadian
National Railways, and which already amounts
to several billion dollars."
And the amendment proposed by Hon.
Mr. Black:
"That all words after 'that' in the first line
be stricken out and that there be substituted
therefor: 'a committee of the Senate be
appointed to inquaire into and report upon the
best means of relieving the country from its
extremely serious railway condition, and financial burden consequent thereto, with power to
send for persons, papers and records and that
said committee consist of fourteen senators.'"
And the sub-amendment proposed by Hon.
Mr. Murdock:
"That all the words after the word 'upon'
be struck out and the following substituted
therefor:
'the enormous cost of Canadian railways to
the people of Canada, and to recommend to
this Senate some plan whereby the taxpayers
of Canada may be relieved, and be assured of
a first charge guaranteed return of not less
than $75,000,000 per year upon the debt and
interest charges of the Canadian National Railways while, at the same time, following the
highly-spoken-of British plan of conserving to
railway employees their positions without undue
hardship.'"
Honourable
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN:
colleagues, in closing the debate on the main
motion, I intend to address myself briefly to
principle levelled at
the objections of
my proposition. Controversies, either factual
or technical-

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Is my honourable
friend closing the debate now?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
was my intention.

I said that that

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I do not wish to
be unduly critical, but my understanding is
that my honourable friend cannot close the
debate on the entire question.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Honourable senators, I thought I had made myself quite clear.
I intend closing the debate on the main
motion.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Under the rules the
mover of an amendment has no right to close
the debate. Only the mover of the original
motion has that right.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The point is,
you cannot close debate on the original motion
until all amendments have been disposed of.
Then debate is resumed on the original
motion, and the mover, if he speaks, closes the
debate. But, under the rules, no one can
close the debate now.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: As I said, all factual
and technical controversies I shall leave to
experts, who no doubt will attend before the
proposed committee. That course, I readily
admit, will be more satisfactory to this honourable House.
The honourable leader of the House (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) has given us the genesis of
our railway problem almost from the cradle,
nay, from the very birth pains. With what
result? The disheartening conclusion that the
Government is helpless.
The country is
stricken with some form of recurring hemorrhages, such as plagued the Tsarevitch, and
Rasputin pretended to heal with incantations.
The Government, like Rasputin, recommends of faith cure. It says, in effect, "Trust
future times and forget present troubles."
Why, the Government even rebukes us for
lamenting our yearly loss on the Canadian
National Railways. It is argued that we
should forget the interest paid on railway
investment as we do the interest charges of
other national services, such, for instance, as
our publie buildings.
This extraordinary
argument, to my astonishment, has been presented at different times by an important
Canadian daily.
It seems almost too elementary to state that
certain services were created with the knowledge that they never could be self-sustaining.
Public buildings are clearly in that class. These
services were necessary and were organized as
unproductive assets, and, for that reason,
limited in their cost and built up in the
course of time. Other services, like the Post

174

SENATE

Office Department, were conceived as revenuebearing services, and they have been funetioning as such. Last year the postal services
entailed a total expenditure of some $32,000,000 and produced a revenue of $34,000,000.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Those self-sustaining services should repay the loans made to
them from public funds, as well as interest on
those loans. Otherwise they would become
unproductive, as they never were intended
to be.
As to our railway venture, is there a sane
man who could ever conceive of it as a dead
asset? Of course net. We, no doubt, assuned
the load of our railways unwillingly, but we did
se in the belief that they would pay their way.
And why not? Half of our transportation is
provided by the Canadian Pacifie Railway
without a red farthing of cost to the public
purse. Why should the other half mulet the
nation to the extent of $100,000,000 every
year? Why should the Canadian National
Railway System for every dollar collected
from its customers claim and get fifty cents
from public funds?
But even that is beside the mark. It is
my contention that year in and year out the
State is spending on the Canadian National
Railways $75,000,000 which can be saved. This
constitutes a colossal waste, and if continued
it will be fatal. By all means it must be
stopped. If such a squandering occurs in any
other service it should likewise be suppressed
forthwith.
The Government seems to forget that every
dollar wasted is a dollar taxed out of the
public. It seems to ignore the fact that
every year every family in Canada has te
scrape together $35 to be wasted by the
Government on the Canadian National Railways. In order that we may resolve to bear
our transportation affliction with fortitude and
to put all our hopes in faith, the Government
strives to prove that against this affliction
there are no human remedies. So my honourable friend the leader of the House (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) has spent himself in demonstrating that amalgamation of our two railways is impossible and that Lt has at different
times been rejected in this country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
itself.

By the Senate

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: But I have never
advocated amalgamation. The Senate resolution of 1925 cuts clean away frem amalgamation and goes te a far different and far
distant recommendation: that of joint managership, leaving the properties of both railways
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

undisturbed and therefore in no way amalgamated.
Here I wish te emphasize that I have submitted in my motion the principle of joint
managership and nothing else. I have carefully left out of it the sharing of profits
between the two companies, as that can be
settled only by agreement, and, of course,
according to present conditions. Sir Edward
Beatty for years has stated, and quite recently
has repeated, that his proposal was for each
company to get the profits of its own lines
and then an equitable share of the savings derived from the new system. This would
materially
relieve
the owners of both
systems: the Canadian people and the Canadian Pacifie Railway shareholders.
My honourable friend from Parkdale (Hon.
Mr. Murdock), who praises so highly the services of the Canadian Pacifie Railway to
Canada, seems to resent any effort which
m.ight alleviate the lot of the shareholders of
that company. He disdainfully declares that
most of these shareholders are British or
American. This, in my opinion, is a most
objectionable appeal to a selfish -and dangerous
sentimentHon. Mr. MURDOCK: Will my honourable
friend pardon me?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: -a sentiment such
as prevails, unhappily, in some small and shady
countries. If the day ever comes when foreign
capital, so useful in the past and so necessary
in the future, is treated with disparagement
in Canada, it will be for us a day of shame and
folly.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Will my honourable
friend pardon a moment's interruption? What
I was trying te do was to put the lot of the
unfortunate Canadian taxpayer ahead of other
claims, and I got the eue from my honourable
friend who is now speaking.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Well, if there is
any consolation for my honourable friend in
this, I can only say that according to what
I have heard his intentions are pure, but I
wish his language were as correct.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Would the
honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) say that the interests of the Canadian taxpayers should b placed ahead of those
of the Canadian creditors? I would not. I
think he is wrong in that.
Hon. Mr. iHUGESSEN: A shareholder is
not a creditor.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I do net want to
delay the House. I realize that I inflicted
myself upon honourable members for a long

MARCH 30, 1938
time when I opened this debate, and therefore
I am hurrying through my argument now.
Joint managership itself was considered but
once. The Duff Commission hesitated over it
in 1931, and finally laid it aside for the cooperative competitive system that we have
to-day. The Commission chose what it thought
politically possible at the time. Public opinion
would permit no more.
But my contention is that public opinion
has totally changed since then. The disastrous
results of past years have brought -about that
change of heart, right down the line from
Sir Edward Beatty to the Canadian Confederation of Labour. Public opinion now
clamours for joint managership to eliminate
senseless duplication and unbearable losses.
I have cited scores of newspapers from every
section of the country to prove that fact.
My ,opponents have cited but one publication
holding adverse views. There are, I know,
a few others who support the present regime,
but the immense weight of public opinion
stands for the elimination of ruinous duplication, by unified management, or otherwise
if a better method is found.
It is not astonishing that every independent
and balanced mind bas altered its views.
With the Duff Commission in 1931, the great
majority of the people hoped that co-operation
between the railways would largely wipe out

duplication.
Mr. Dandurand) has taken the trouble to
show how dismally that hope bas been dashed.
The Duff Commission, which my honourable
friend praises to the skies as the finest ever
known to Canada, stated that there were in
the Dominion 4,000 to 5,000 miles of redundant
The Canadian Pacificlines of railway.
Canadian National legislation of 1933 was
passed for the very purpose of permitting the
suppression of duplication and, in particular,
of these 4,000 to 5,000 miles of useless lines.
The Commission expressed the opinion that
through co-operation the railways would save

4,000 to 5,000 miles of useless, redundant
lines have the railways so far suppressed?
How much of the $30,000,000 yearly savings
have been realized?
My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
bas answered these two vitally important
questions. On the competing duplicate lines,
during the last five years, how many miles
have been finally dealt with? How many have
been abandoned? Incredible as it may seem,
the answer given is that projects totalling 407
miles were rejected for lack of sufficient
economy, and only 39 miles were abandoned;

everyone with a free and receptive mind has
changed his views?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I would not
be too sure of that.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Is it surprising that
public opinion clamours for another system
that will enforce economies so badly needed,
and relieve the people of a huge amount of
taxes?
The press has educated the public. The
nation now comprehends that co-operation
Whatever
is repugnant to competition.
incentive the railways may have to co-operate
is brushed aside by the necessity to compete
in order to live. Co-operation is possible only
if the railways, working for a common fund,
under joint management or managership or
other like system, are constantly aware that
the sacrifices made by them for the sake of
economy will redound to their benefit in a
just and fair proportion. That fundamental
truth has been seized by the press and passed
on to the public, and the community now
clamours for a new and, this time, effective
method of treating our railway problem. The
people insist that duplication has not been
attacked, that it is still untouched in freight,
passenger, accounting, railway stations, ticket
offices, equipment, personnel-in a word, in
all services except one, which has just
blossomed with the first breath of spring:
the hotel in Vancouver, which is being
operated jointly by the two railways.
Of course, I am aware that unification of
management for two huge railway systems
cannot be effected without effort and some
risk. But neither should be excessive, if the
and
new system is imposed gradually
prudently. My honourable friend has suggested
a few technical objections, such as the refunding of bond issues and the consent of bond-.
holders for the lifting of useless lines. But,
surely, the properties of both railways can be
kept separate. Surely the lifting of tracks can
be retarded until at least the new system bas
proven its efficacy. If these precautions are
taken-and they must be-my honourable
friend will find the solution of many of the
difficulties which be now foresees.
But, admitting that unified management
might entail some problems, I would ask what
has the Government to offer.
There is one ground upon which virtually
the whole nation stands resolute to-day: the
urgent necessity of putting an end to the
annual loss of $100,000,000 of public funds and

176

SENATE

to the useless contribution of $35 which it
imposes on every hard-pressed Canadian
family.
And let there be no doubt as to the amount
of our yearly loss on the Canadian National
Railways. From the railway's annual reports
we learn that the total net loss for 1932-36
was $4 96 2 4 2 ,111-an average annual loss of
more than $99,000,000. This loss was incurred
after the absorption of the tiny surplus on
operations, so much vaunted by my honourable friend. On a colossal venture of $3,000,000,000 the net operating revenue of only
$15,000,000 announced by the Government
will make the whole business community of
Canada laugh heartily.
But unfortunately conditions are getting
worse from day to day. The Montreal Star
of the 3rd instant states that the gross revenue
of the Can-adian National Railways for January and February last has declined by $1,733,855 as ,compared with the same period lastyear.
The Ottawa Citizen of the 17th instant gives
$434,237 as the fall in gross revenue in the
first two weeks of March as compared with
the corresponding weeks in 1937.
How is the Government going to meet this
challenge of the taxpayer-the forgotten taxpayer-who cries for relief? The Government
evidently intends to play the part of Rasputin
and to treat the blood sweats of the people
by its faith cure; by faith in the return of
prosperity, faith in the recurrence of traffic.
But my honourable friend has not contested
the evidence of a return of prosperity since
1936, in some respects to an unprecedented
degree. And what of trafic? Is he still unaware that the railways have lost up to the
present one-third of their freight traffic and
no less than two-thirds of their passenger
business? Where has that traffic gone? Evidently to their competitors, in greatest part
to the motor-car, the truck and the bus.
Can any sane person conceive that this
competition will relax. Is it not, on the contrary, quite evident that it will continue to
grow for many years? Motor-cars are increasing in number every year, and truck and
bus lines are multiplying at a tremendous rate.
The aeroplane has just entered the field. Is
it not on the cards that it must soon become
more and more inimical to the railway business? The old-time traffic of the railways is
gone, never to return. What is left to them
may increase slowly and very gradually, but
their traffic heyday is passed. Is this not overwhelmingly proved by the distressed condition
of railways throughout the world?
What, then, is the Government's faith cure
worth? Certainly it will not cure the bloodHon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

sweating of the people. Certainly it will not
protect the financial integrity of the country,
so seriously menaced; nor will it fortify the
credit of Canada, gravely affected on foreign
markets.
Is it not more reasonable for the railways
to banish competition from within, and to
face it more effectively from without? Is it
not common sense for them to suppress duplication and reduce their huge plants, equipment and personnel-now largely unoccupied
-to the size of their actual business, which is
practically one-half of what it used to be?
Is the example of Great Britain not illuminating? Why has my honourable friend refused to discuss this practical and markedly
successful experiment? Out of one hundred
and twenty separate railway companies, owning ten times as many subsidiary undertakings,
charging 112 per cent above normal rates and
losing yearly $100,000,000, Great Britain has
built up four railway companies, with pooled
receipts, charging much lower rates, and gaining yearly $165,000,000. The public gets far
better and cheaper service, the employees
have steadlier employment, with full protection
against loss of position or standing, and the
shareholders secure a fair return on their
investment, the State and taxpayer being
totally free from any contribution. All this
has been accomplished by wiping out double
and treble services and concentrating plants,
equipment and personnel to the size of the
traffic available. Canada, with 42,000 miles
of railway and a population of 11,000,000, or
262 people per mile of railway, has ten times
more need of concentration and the elimination of duplication than Great Britain, with
20,000 miles of railway and a population of
42,000,000, -or 2,000 persons per mile of railway.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

That is right.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Why has my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) refrained from alluding to a similar policy of
concentration and the elimination of wastefuIl competiton now being studied to save
hundreds of railways in the United States?
Does my honourable friend not know that
a few months ago France was forced, mainly
by the competition of the motor-car, to reorganize her railways? She has done so on
the lines of unified management recommended by the Senate. Under the new system,
the seven French railways have pooled their
earnings and while their separate identity
in property and management is preserved,
they are controlled by an overriding board in
which both the State and the railways are

MARCH 30, 1938
represented. The dominant purpose of this
new arrangement is the co-ordination of the
lines of the different companies to resist
competition from without, especially from
motor-cars. For that purpose 3,600 miles of
secondary lines of railways have been abandoned and replaced by truck or motor-bus
services. The better to curb the deadly competition of motor-cars, the law now restricts
long-distance truck or bus lines, and subjects them to railway rates.
May I ask
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
a question in order to clear up one point?
Are the highways in Great Britain, of which
my honourable friend speaks, owned by any
outside authority? Is it not true that in this
country we have provincial ownership of highways, and that any arrangement made with
respect to trucking and that sort of thing
would have to be made through the provinces and not through the central authority?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I am afraid that
my answer will not be very satisfactory to
the right honourable gentleman. I know
nothing at all of that particular question in
Great Britain. What I have said refers to
France.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
My honourable friend spoke of Great Britain.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I did, but if my
right honourable friend will read my remarks he will find that I have not spoken of
roads or motor-cars in Great Britain.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
I thought
my honourable friend mentioned the word
"trucking" at least half a dozen times.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Yes, as respects
France; and it needs to be mentioned several
times as respects Canada as well.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
I think the
whole subject would be made clearer to the
people of this country if they were given to
understand that in Canada the Federal Government bas nothing to do with the highways,
and that any arrangements to do away with
truck competition would at least have to be
made with the consent of the provinces.
I know that. If
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
I had not known it before last year, I should
have learned it then.

three countries are up and doing. Why is
our Government lying down before its task

and responsibility?
one answer: the present Administration is
held by the fear of political consequences.
But as no government dares to exhibit such
human frailty, the present Administration now
boldly champions the railway policies of 1930.
Lord Salisbury stated that the commonest fault
of political parties was to cling to the carcasses of dead policies. The co-operative conpetitive system, which was hailed with buoyant hopes, sickened from the first, and under
the present Administration soon passed away.
It is now but a corpse, offensive and obstructive; so I say let us remove it, bury it, and
forget it.
Mr. Bennett's prophecy that, unless settied,
the railway problem would destroy the
financial integrity of Canada is infinitely truer
to-day than it was in the past.
Mr. Howe's declaration in 1936, that it was
inadmissible that Canada should continue to
pay enormous deficits for the Canadian
National Railways, is truer to-day, by several
hundred million dollars, than it was then.
But Mr. Howe's clear-cut statement that it
was the Government's duty to remove the
burden of the Canadian National Railways
from the back of the taxpayers was made long
after the elections of 1930 and 1935. Was
that declaration warranted in 1936? Is it not
far more justified to-day? Did the Minister
not speak for the Government then? Was
he deliberate and sincere then? If so, why
does he now permit the Government to adopt
a totally different attitude?
In 1936 it was the duty of the Government to take the load off the back of the taxpayers. In 1938 it is the Government's policy
to refrain from all effort to relieve the taxpayers. Nay, the Government's advice to
the sorely pressed public is to forget all about
its troubles. In 1938 the Government is content to preach its faith cure, its false and
forlorn hope that the blessings of prosperity
will bring a return of bountiful traffic. Mr.
Howe, the neophyte, full of zeal for public
welfare in 1936, has been swept away by the
current of opportunism that sways the course
of his Government.
Indeed it is depressing and unwholesome for
the people of Canada to see Ministers of
the Crown, some of whom stand high in
public esteem, absorbed in their own political
security and forgetful of the people, forgetfuzl

that policy and proclaim it to the whole country. Then the people will at all events know
that some attention is being given to their

may gather patience and courage. But my
entreaties are useless. The Administration
will not in the slightest degree expose its
political fortunes. During the French Revolution noblemen had to learn not only how to

Canadians will wish for a Government that

I will therefore accept the amendment of my

In closing, I make bold to suggest to the
Government as a subject of meditation the
prayer of the Greek sailor, which has been
preserved for us by Seneca:
O God, You may save me if You will; You
may sink me if You will; but, whatever happens, I will always keep my rudder true.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, I was somewhat surprised at the
vehemence of my honourable friend when,
in speaking for the Government in this
Chamber, I suggested that I was ready to
agree to a committee examining into and
testing the value of bis formula, which means
unified management and in my view is tantamount to the organization of a monopoly,
as compared with co-operation between the
two railways, which was the policy of the
late Government and is the law to-day. If,
in that committee, my honourable friend fails
utterly to establish that the country can save
$75,000,000, or $40,000,00, or even $20,000,000,
and if he discovers that all the saving that
can be effected under unified management
can be effected under co-operation, will he
not change his tone? However, it is only
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

when we shall have made that inquiry that the
country will have to decide as between
co-operation and unified management. I am
not prejudging the question.
Of course, I intend to place before the
Senate certain facts for consideration by the
committee. Nobody is bound by the statements of Sir Edward Beatty. We know that
he bas been carrying on a campaign, primarily,
if net wholly, in the interest of the Canadian
Pacifie Railway. But there is something far
more important in the minds of our people
than Sir Edward Beatty and the Canadian
Pacifie, and that is the general interest of
Canada.
Before this special committee is
appointed it may be opportune to indicate
the duty which, te my mind, it will have
primarily to perform. It will have, I suggest,
to obtain details of the general statements,
constantly repeated, of large savings to be
effected through unified management.
The
sum of $75,000,000 bas been, so to speak, the
leitmotiv of that thesis.
I had net known that Sir Edward Beatty
had been queried as to the basis for bis
estimate of savings. I should like to dilate
on the answers bu made to a number of
questions put to bim by the Ottawa Journal
in January last, since these will be a subjectmatter of our investigation. His statements
still deal in generalities. As Sir Edward bas
had the whole field to himself, the Canadian
National officials having felt that they could
net with propriety lay their views before
the public, I deem it my duty to present
those views before the Senate. They should
carry as much weight as those of Canadian
Pacific officials. In many instances the views
of Canadian National officials are opposed to
allegations of the Canadian Pacifie.
They
can be tested before our special committee.
I come now to the answers made by Sir
Edward Beatty to the. Ottawa Journal's questions. The first question put to him was:
Upon what did the executives of Canadian
railways, in their evidence before the Duff
Commission, base their estimates of such a
saving?
That refers to the estimate of a saving of
$75,000,000. The answer by Sir Edward
Beatty was:
The estimates furnished the executives of
the Canadian railways were arrived at after
careful

analyses

of the traffic, service,

equip-

ment and facilities of the two railways.
This is hardly a, correct statement, because
Sir Edward Beatty could not have had access
te the details -of Canadian National traffic
and services nor to the detailed information
regarding Canadian National lines of railway.
There could net, therefore, have been "care-

MARCH 30, 1938
ful analyses." Ail that could have been made
was a generalized estimate, arrived at without
full information as to the facts or as to all
the ramifications of the measures proposed te
be taken in specific instances. The difference
between an estimate based on generalized
figures and an estimate based on detailed
knowledge hardly needs to be emphasized.
It almost invariably turns out that when
detailed information is examined the economies
anticipated on general grounds are found to ibe
impossible of attainment, or seriously curtailed. A classic example is the grouping of
English railways.
Mention was made by my honourable friend
from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien), in
his opening speech as well as in the one-to
which we have just listened, of the position
of the railways in England, where 20,000 miles
of line were divided into four groups for more
effective operation and management. The
case is not analogous to the Canadian situation. In England the element of competitien was not affected; in Canada the element
of competition as between the two railway
systems would completely disappear.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In Britain there
is no monopoly involved; in Canada a huge
monopoly in railway transport is proposed.
In Britain the railways are also engaged in
highway transport; in Canada jurisdiction
over the highways is vested in the provinces.
In Canada there is involved the conflicting
question of public versus private ownership;
in Britain all the railways concerned are
privately owned. In Canada scores of railways
are now consolidated into either the pu'bliclyowned or the privately-owned system, and we
have two competing systems covering 40,000
miles of line, as against four competing systems
covering 20,000 miles of line in Britain. We
are thus further advanced already in matters
of consolidation than they are in Britain.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Will my honourable friend permit a comment? What he
fails to point out is that, though there are
four systems in Britain, they are net competing systems. They operate in separate areas of
the country, and in their respective areas each
is what the honourable gentleman refers to as
a monopoly. Of course, my contention is that
there is no monopoly at all.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think if my
honourable friend will listen to me a little
longer he will find that he is in error in the
statement he has just made.

There was much generalization as te the
savings that would be effected under the
British plan. I have here a memorandum on
grouping of railways in Great Britain, from
official statisties supplied at my request by
the Bureau of Economics of the Canadian
National Railways. There have been attempts
to establish a similarity between Sir Edward
Beatty's plan for the unification or amalgamation of the Canadian National and Canadian Pacifie Railways -and the grouping of railways in Great Britain, which took place in
1923 as a result of enabling legislation passed
in 1921. There is, however, little similarity
between the two plans except that each was
preceded by confident prophecies of largescale economies, based on generalized and
theoretical grounds. In the case of the grouping of English railways these large-scale
economies have not bee realized, although it
is fifteen years since the grouping plan was
put into effect. It is a significant fact that
the English railways face current difficulties,
net with a proposal te consolidate into one
large system, but, on the contrary, by applying principles of co-operation similar to the
principles set forth in the Canadian NationalCanadian Pacifie Act.
What really happened in England was the
consolidation of 120 companies of varying
size into four companies, se arranged as te
preserve competition in most of the important centres. In Canada similar consolidations
have taken place over a period of years into
two systems serving competitively the principal centres of the country. There is no
difference in principle between the Canadian
and the British situation except that the
consolidation of small companies into large
ones without destroying competition has been
given fuller scope in Canada than in England,
and in this country has resulted in two main
systems, whereas in England it has resulted
in four.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Eighty per cent of the population of Great
Britain living in centres of 100,000 or more
are served by two or more of the English
groups, and it is evident that competition was
left as a very live factor in the English situation after grouping had been accomplished.
While Sir Edward's plan for unification
differs widely in principle from the British
group plan, it may be informative to those
who expect large economies from a further
consolidation of Canadian railways to examine
the promises which were made as regards
the English railways and the results which
were obtained. The British publie were told

Sir Eric
Geddes, then Minister of Transport, made
the boldest claims of any. He asserted in
the House of Commons in 1921 that within
six or seven y'cars amalgamation would possibly result in a saving of £25.000,000 a year.
Some estiniates, be said, reached the figure
of £45.000,000.
The Atîorney-General told
the House a few days later that "it was never
suggested that the figure of £25,000,000 represents the whole of the economies which might
be expected from the Bill." Sir Eric Geddes
later said:

For instance, in 1927 Colonel Ashley said, in
reply to a question:
As my honourable friend is no doubt aware,
the Railways Act of 1921 provided for an
extensive reorganization of the railways. Important changes of this kind cannot yield their
full results at once.
Sir Josiah Stamp in 1926 stated:
The question is asked, "Have we realized the
savings predicted?" I answer "' No." Economies
of amalgamations take time to beceme effective.
We hope that the amalgamations and economies
will be effective later. But it takes a long
time to work them out.

figure of possible econoiies, on 1913 prices, in

Right, Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: From a representative of which clas th honourable gentleman got the memorandum he is now reading.

It is highly significant that when prodiction of the details upon which these estinates
were based was asked for, the Parliamentary
Secretary of the Minister of Transport stated
that the display of the documents relating
to tlese estinates woiuld bu "prejudicial to
the interests of the public service."
The
Railway Gazette was frankly skeptical that
such economies could be realized, and stated
in 1922, "there would bu possibly no resultant
economy in the long run"; and again that
the wbole schieme "rests on a very flimsy
foundation, a strange belief in the great
economies to be derived from grouping." As
time went on and the economies did not
naterialize, apologies began to be offered.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: They know one
another well.
The enabling legislation covering the grouping of English railways contained protective
provisions as regards displaced labour. Any
person who had been a permanent employee
for five ycars before August 21, 1921, was
assured (a) a sontinuance of employment in
the grouped companies, (b) a position no
lower than bis former one. or (c) compensation. It bas been customary to ascribe the
lack of economies to these provisions, but
the time bas long since passed when these
provisions could be said te exercise a serions
restraint on putting economies into effect.

because it is Dow fifteen years since the
grouping was made effective and the presentday employees of British railways who had five
yeai-s' service prior to 1921 can h-ardly exceed

present employees are flot affected by the

These two reparts further point out how
extremely difficuit it is to analyse the results
of operations over a period of years and
ascribe the changes in financial resuits to
specific causes. The only definite resuit which
emerges from an attempt sa to analyse the
operations of English railways is that largescale economies ascribable to grouping cannot
be found.
The changes in financial results from year
to year cao be related with much greater
certainty to other factors, such as the general
business conditions of England, the levels of
raiiway rates, material prices and wages,
capital expend-itures for improvements, and
the natural tendency towards increased efficiency, which should be present in any event.

Finally reference may be made ta the fact
that the British railways are effecting worthwhile, but not spectacular, economies by appiying the principles of co-operation. This
bas taken the form of an exchange of services
and the pooling of traffic between competitive
points where economies can be clearly dem onstrated. At the present time it is probably
safe ta say that more than one-haîf of the
railway traffic of Great Britain is involved
in saine pooling arrangement.
The econamies attributable ta this pooiing have been
estimated at £350,000.
This is the second question which the Ottawa
Journal put ta Sir Edward Beatty:

Henry Thoroton estimated possible economy of

amies from co-operation must be non-existent
or procured grudgingly. If there were less
talk of the salvation of Canada, and a more
earnest effort to co-operate for the production
of sensible economies wherever they could
be found, there would be less controversy and
a good deal more effective results.
This is the Ottawa Journal's fifth question:
In the event of the necessity of tearing up
tracks, where, in what parts of Canada, would
the tracks be torn up, and where would a
beginning be made?
To which Sir Edward Beatty replied:
As bas been indicated, the tearing up of
tracks would neither constitute the major nor
initial step in securing unification economies.
In carrying out the physical unification of the
two systems, the first step would be to re-route
the traffic in order to utilize the most economical facilities and secure the most efficient
handling. The re-routing of traffic offers a
wide scope for economies throughout the whole
of Canada.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: That is the important
point.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is what
I should like Sir Edward Beatty to appreciate.
He continued:
After conditions had become stabilized on
the route selected for permanent operation,
the sections of track which should be abandoned
would be clearly indicated and their elimination
should be accomplished without serious friction.
My comments on question 4 apply with
equal force to question 5, but it is interesting
to note that Sir Edward plainly implies a
long period of adjustment during which, he
says,
The first step would be to re-route the traffic
in order to utilize the most economical facilities
and secure the most efficient handling. . . .
After conditions had become stabilized on the
route selected for permanent operation, the
sections of track which should be abandoned
would be clearly indicated.
Plainly, this implies a long period of study
and trial of one route against the other, and
the inference is plain that if the people of
Canada expect any substantial economy to
be quickly apparent they will be disappointed.
Sir Edward speaks of the elimination of
duplicate lines as being capable of accomplishment without serious friction. In answer to
this and other questions he seems to intimate
a modification of his 5,000-mile programme of
line abandonments, and until it is known
specifically what lines he intends to abandon
it is impossible to say whether or not serious
friction would result.
Sir Edward implies that the lines of railway he proposes to eliminate are mainly
valuable as through competitive routes, and
that service to the communities through which
they pass is of minor importance. The true

183

situation with regard to most lines which are
duplicate as through routes is that in addition
to furnishing competitive through routes they

is a comparatively small mileage of duplicate

The major portion of the mileage marked
down in Sir Edward Beatty's 5,000-mile programme, however, was for lines with regard
to which the colonization and development

underestimated the friction which would
result.
In question 6 the Journal asked Sir Edward:
Would such a saving necessitate the dismissal
of railway employees, and, if so, of how many
railway employees-this in view of the fact
that so large a proportion of railway costs are
labour costs?
He answered:
Unified management of the two railway systeins would ultimately result in a reduction of
from 15 to 17 per cent in the numbers of those
employed in a year of normal traffic. The
number of railway employees affected at any
stated time depends upon several considerations,
such as whether traffic volume was increasing
or decreasing, the rate at which the unification
plans were progressed and the policy to be
followed in regard to the employee situation.
After all, the actual adjustment in labour
employment will be solely dependent upon the
rate at which it is decided to eliminate the
present uneconomie cost of duplicate railway
services. It should be possible to progress the
plan of unification at a reasonable pace so as
to keep the number of present employees unfavourably affected, and thus entitled to compensation, at a minimum.
This is a typical generalization d.esigned
to minimize the distasteful aspects of unification. It may be demonstrated that during a period of depression the discharge of
employees effects no real national economy; it
only affects the incidence and distribution of
purchasing power and taxation. Under these
conditions, if railway workers lose their wages,
they go on the relief rolls and are supported
by public taxation. Therefore the nation in
seeking to reduce its railway burden would
be adding to its burden of unemployed.
Accordingly it is not surprising that Sir Edward
minimizes the rate at which labour would be

184

SENATE

displaced. But the laws of logic are inexorable, and if he does not discharge employees
he cannot get bis theoretical economies. So
in the answer to question 6 he plainly intimates that if this country expects to get any
relief in the near future from railway costs
it will be disappointed.
Regarding Sir Edward's statement as to the
possibility of effecting economies by the
gradual reduction of staffs, ene may turn again
with profit to the experience of English railways with grouping. In that case, just as
by Sir Edward, large economies were promised
by proponents of grouping. In that case also
the disturbance to labour was to be taken
care of gradually by normal labour turnover,
due to pensionings, deaths, dismissals for
cause, and so forth, it being specifically provided in the Act that labour should not
suffer pecuniary disadvantage. Sir Edward
estimates these factors to be 5 per cent per
year. Therefore in the fifteen years since the
English roads were grouped there has been,
according to Sir Edward's estimate, an opportunity to reduce staffs by 75 per cent. So
the failure to obtain large-scale economies
in England as a result of grouping can no
longer be attributed to the limitation of
economies due to labour disturbance. Employment furnished by British railways, fifteen
years after grouping, is very similar to the
previous employment, regard being had to
diifferences in traffic volume. Large-scale reductions of expenses and staffs are still lacking.
Plainly something more than the mere
avoidance of labour disturbance has rendered
it impossible to translate the anticipated
theoretical savings from grouping into actual
results. The plain fact is that the theoretical
generalized estimate of economies could net
stand up to the acid test of practicability
when detailed and accurate information was
available.
Now, I think it will be worth while to
examine the relative savings claimed for ceoperation and for unification.
Sir Edward
Beatty, before the Duff Commission, claimed
a saving of $6,348.000 as possible by co-operation of Canadian National and Canadian
Pacifie railways in establishing joint trackage,
stations and terminals; but on the basis of
the 1933 Act a saving of only about a million
and a quarter annually has been effected in
the five years that have elapsed, and this
principally from pooling of passenger services,
which was not included in the Canadian
Pacifie estimate of six millions odd. The net
result is disappointing, and a question arises
as to what might have been accomplished had
there been a greater willingness to co-operate
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

and a little less intensity displayed in the
drive for unification.
As I have already pointed out, what is
really needed to test the ability of cooperation to produce sane economies is a will
to co-operate. Lacking that, economies from
co-operation must be non-existant or procured
grudgingly.
The saving claimed from unification is
$75,000,000.
The claim was based upon
operating results that no longer obtain: both
railways have already reduced to a minimum
their operating costs and charges. Just what
savings might reasonably be expected from
unification would be a matter for railway
experts to determine on the basis of present
conditions, not those of eight years ago.
That certain economies are possible from
unification cannot be doubted, but it is for
the people of Canada to consider whether
they would be worth while in view of the
disturbance which unification would cause in
business and industry and in our economic
and social life.
Our railways have been
projected on a scale designed to take care of
the future and to admit of reasonable progress
in the opening up and development of the
country. If we surrender now to the fears
engendered by the unification campaign and
" put up the shutters,' as it were, shall we
not be stultifying Canada's future and
discounting the possibility of expansion and
progress to which Canada looks forward, even
under the present disturbed conditions?
However, it is not necessary to pay undue
attention to such a "counsel of despair" in
respect of the railways. Before the Duff
Commission, representatives of the Canadian
National Railways expressed the view that
an annual saving of $30,000,000 was possible
from complete co-operation between the two
railways, about 60 per cent of which saving
would accrue to the Canadian National. This
involved proposals with respect to elimination
of trackage and consolidations of telegraph
and express business, hotels, local facilities,
etc., against which objection would be urged
from some quarters, just as objection bas
been urged to abandonments and consolidations under unification. The point of interest
is that the Canadian National officials feel
that very substantial savings are possible
without resort to unification. Discussing this
$30,000,000 estimated saving from co-operation
before the Duff Commission, Mr. S. J.
Hungerford, now President of the Canadian
National Board of Directors, said:

In looking around in the restricted area

any better way to effect a saving than the
way which I have already referred to, namely,
the adoption of a policy of hauling the freight

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I have no thought at all of
entering into the general debate again, but
I want to make one or two comments on
matters with respect to which I was rude
enough to interrupt my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend is always welcome to do so.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am afraid
my honourable friend is going to enter the
jury room of the Senate committee a somewhat prejudiced juryman. It is clear that if
he were challenged by counsel for unification
he would have to stand aside.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not intend
to be the cross-examiner myself.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But the
honourable gentleman is to be on the jury
which is to decide this matter. I did not
think it was very encouraging to the House
that he should show such pronounced views
in advance.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien)
will be there.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, that is
true. Because he is the proposer of the
whole plan, he will have to be there to defend
it; but I would rather the head of the Government were not going in pledged to any side.
I am not. I have been proclaimed as advocating unification. Possibly I shall succeed in
making my position clear before I sit down.
Hon. Mr. GORDON.

I wish to comment now on the practice of
officials of the Canadian National Railways
making themselves champions of the continued separate existence of that system. I
do not know who prepared the memorandum
from which, in the main, my honourable
friend quoted, but I have a very good idea.
My idea is that it was an official of that
system. I do not appreciate the practice on
the part of high salaried officials of the Canadian National Railways of making themselves
protagonists through this country on this
subject.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will my right
honourable friend allow me? They have sfood
aside for years, listening to Sir Edward Beatty's
assault on the Act of 1933, and seeing him
carry on a unification campaign which has
had the effect of belittling the Canadian
National Railways and imperilling the morale
of the thousands of men along that line. All
I have done is to apply for, and to obtain,
information to which I was entitled. These
men have remained silent during years when
they felt the whole system was being traduced
by Sir Edward Beatty.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not think
my honourable friend is right. In so far as
getting information
from the Canadian
National Railway officials is concerned, that
is quite a proper thing to do, and it is quite
proper for those officials to provide information. But there was much more than information in the memorandum read by my honourable friend. It contained material which was
of a distinctly controversial character; controversial as respects not only Sir Edward
Beatty, but also Sir Eric Ceddes and those
who were the fathers of the present railway
policy in Great Britain.
I have read nothing which convinces me
that Sir Edward Beatty has been making any
attack on the Canadian National management.
Wisely or unwisely, he has been championing a proposition for unification of managership of the two systems; but that is not
attacking officials of the Canadian National
Railways in such a way as to justify them
in becoming protagonists before the public
of Canada for the railway policy of this
Dominion. If there never was a union in our
country of two competing, or of three or four
or five redundant business enterprises, until
the salaried officials of each found themselves in favour of that union, all would continue under their own steam for ever. You
will never get economies of unification in any
field if you wait for the approval of those
economies by persons who are enjoying good
salaries under the system as it is.

Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

MARCH 30, 1938

throughout the whole world of business. Salaried officials try to have it proclaimedand they succeed in having it proclaimed in
this House, anyway-that not very much can
be saved by unification which could not be
saved by co-operation. They want us to
think that we can be just as economical and
efficient on behalf of the people of Canada
under things as they are as we could under
a system which would follow a course such
as business in every corner of the world
takes when seeking efficiency. In magazines
and through mouthpieces on the floor of
Parliament they present arguments to the
people of Canada. Surely, from the standpoint of efficiency alone, all we need is a little
common sense and business experience. With
the railway map before us, surely nobody
whose eyes are open will tell us that tremendous economies cannot be made.
The memorandum stated that England did
not get the economies she expected. Sir
Eric Geddes said so-and-so back in 1921, and
in 1927 someone else had to admit that all
the expected economies had not been reached.
Naturally that would have to be admitted.
If we take some similar step it is probable
that ten years from now we shall have to
admit that we have not reached our full
objective and that maybe we never shall.
But did this memorandum show what goal
had been attained in England already? If
we ever get as far towards the solution of
our problem as England has got towards
the solution of hers, I shall be happy and
consider the problem something belonging to
the past. We know where England is. Ask
any one from that country. Ask any English
business man if the British railway situation
is not infinitely better from the standpoints
of service and transportation than it was
fifteen years ago, and at least as good from
the standpoint of labour. What will his
answer be? You will not get a divided
opinion. I have never heard a variation of
opinion when that question was put. But
if any Canadian visiting in England is asked
whether our railway situation is getting any
better, whether it is satisfactory to Canada,
or whether there is any present hope of its
becoming satisfactory, will he answer "Yes"?
He will have to throw his hands in the air
and say "No."
I find myself in full agreement with the
honourable leader of the Government (Hon.

187

Mr. Dandurand) when he says that we have
not had from the Canadian National-Canadian
Pacifie Act the results we should, have had.
Probably the results were not as great as
they should have been even before the Act
was altered. I doubt not that criticism could
be levelled at both railways, the Canadian
Pacifie as well as the Canadian National, on
the ground that neither of them wholeheartedly attempted to effect economies. I
fully expeet that when a committee is appointed and railway officials appear, the committee will be convinced that the railways
have not tried as they should have, and I
am satisfied that indictment will lie just
as heavy against Canadian National officials
as against those of the Canadian Pacifie. It
is going to lie still heavier under the present
system, as enacted by the legislation of 1936,
than it could when the former system was in
effect. Why? Because since 1936 the head
officials, the management, the executive of the
Canadian National have been directly under
the Government. What co-operation could be
effected under these conditions? The Government will not agree to any co-operation
which would be unpopular, which would deny
votes to the Minister of Transport in Fort
William.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We shall find
out about that at the inquiry.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We may. The
point I am arguing is this, that the legislation
of 1936 destroyed the conditions under which
co-operation on the part of the Canadian
National Railways would be encouraged.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am not so
sure of that.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Those conditions were destroyed when Canadian National
officials were made directly answerable to the
Government once more. They being so answerable, their conduct with regard to co-operation and everything else must be such as
will not injure the political fortunes of the
Administration.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We shall test
that point.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We do not
need to test it, because it has already been
proclaimed. In any event, it is true to
human nature, to the very depths of our
beings. You cannot get away from it. If it
had not been proclaimed by the Minister of
Transport we should have known it was
correct anyway. There has been no more
effort towards co-operation on the part of one
railway than on the part of the other, and we

1V8

SENATE

shall likely find that out. We have gone a
very short distance along the road of cooperation and I do not believe we are ever
going to get very far.
I am asked: "Would you, then, unify the
railways?" If the railways are to be unified
under Government ownership, Government
operation and Government management, I
would just as soon leave things as they are.
That is what I think to-day of the prospects
of Government operation of railways. And I
am not very hopeful that our railways will
ever be amalgamated in any other way. I
have some knowledge, at this late day in my
life, of public opinion in this country, of the
clash of classes-not so much the clash of
interests-and of the arguments and appeals
that are addressed to public opinion, appeals
of the grossest kind which not only are made,
but prevail, and will prevail in the future as
in the past. A stage is being approached in
this country, and still more closely in the
republic to the south, which is an inevitable
and logical consequence of a curse-at-profitsand-iaugh-at-debt attitude on the part of the
public.
We are drifting, drifting, drifting,
and we can see black days ahead, just as
surely as we have eyes in our heads. If
there is an appeal in this country for unification we shall hear all the cries against that
great monster, monopoly, or lack of competition. I throw the taunt aside as largely
humbug. It is not entirely humbug, but
pretty much so.
The honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) says that in England four railway
systems are competing. I have stated that I
should like to see in effect in this country something like what exists over there, and so I
will set about to define, very briefly, the English situation. They have four systems, it is
true, and we have two. The honourable gentleman argues therefrom that we are farther
on in the way of consolidation than they are.
That is not truc. In England there are four
systems, but they are geographically distinct,
and there is not competition of that kind
which destroys capital and earnings. Some
cities and big towns are served by two or more
railways. No doubt all four lines run into
the city of London, for instance, and probably
two into Liverpool, but they are not competing
with one another between the two cities.
And what competition exists is overridden by
the pooling of earnings. That makes all the
difference in the world.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We can do likewise here.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There is a
pooling of earnings and an allocation of earnings over the various securities.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Can we not do
that here?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I should like
to see that done here. I will raise my hands
and my voice in support of the honourable
gentleman if he will get something like that
done in Canada. That is what we want.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: That is unification.
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: If we in this
country could just get together and subdivide
the securities of our two systems, place in
class A of Canadian Pacifie securities those
which on earnings of the last five or ten years
are considered perfectly secure. and in class
A of Canadian National securities those
selected on the same basis, then proceed to
select class B securities for the Canadian
Pacifie and corresponding ones for the Canadian National, and finally class C securities
for each road, and if we could get a management and bind it by law to apply the earnings
first, pro rata, to class A, then pro rata to class
B, and lastly, pro rata to class C, we should
have the management in such shape that it
could not possibly sacrifice the interests of the
Canadian National without sacrificing its own.
It would be in such shape that every day it
worked for itself and for its shareholders
and bondholders it would be working also
for holders of Canadian National securities
and the people of Canada. That is something
like what exists in England.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: No.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Of course it
is. My honourable friend says "No." I should
like to have him speak now and tell us what the
difference is. I know it is not exactly the
same, but it is along that principle. There
is a pooling of earnings, which is a principle
we should have here.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
A pooling of
earnings on certain lines, just as we have
for Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal and Quebec.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: They have a
division of competitive receipts, but not pooling. It is completely different from pooling.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Just go so far
in Canada and I shall be satisfied.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: We have it now
between Montreal and Toronto, for instance.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. If we
could get a pooling of competitive receipts we
should go a long way towards solving our
problem.

MARCH 30, 1938
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is on competitive lines, just as we have now for
Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal and Quebec.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Very well.
But I want further protection for the Canadian National. I want the allocation of earnings provided for right in the body of the
agreement, so that the public's property could
not possibly be prejudiced. I want that under
ail conditions. If honourable members opposite
join in a completely non-partisan effort to
achieve an agreement on that basis, I will
join with them, because in that I have some
hope. In amalgamation under Government
operation I have no hope at ail, but I am
afraid we shall corne to that in Canada. I
fear that economie conditions are going to
force it, and that after it has come about we
shall be not a whit better than before.
Hon. Mr. CANTLEY: Worse.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We may possibly be worse.
I hope I have not been ambiguous. I want
to emphasize with ail the clearness of which
my language is capable that I speak for myself
and no one else, and after consultation with
no one else. I know I am not speaking in
terms which I used years ago. I hope the
years have taught me something. I know
that in railway matters they have taught me
a great deal. My education has evolved not
in the direction in which I should have liked,
but in quite the contrary direction. However,
facing facts, fearful facts, facts which our
people are determined not to face, I say
something definite must be done, and I point
the direction in which I think it could be
done to the best advantage of the people of
this country.
Hon. C. W. ROBINSON: Honourable senators, may I be permitted to say a few words?
I agree with the proposai to appoint a coinmittee for investigation of our railway problem, but if we are going into that committee
with the idea just expressed by the right
honourable leader on the other side (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen), that officiais of the
Canadian National should not be allowed to
come freely before us and give their views on
the situation, we shall be wasting our time.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Of course
they will be free to express themselves.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: It will be very
difficult for officials of the Canadian National
to come and tell us freely what they think if
they feel they are threatened with dismissal
in case of a change of government. That is
practically what has been threatened by the
right honourable gentleman.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, no, no.

18

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I cannot avoid that
feeling. The threatening attitude which he
has adopted to-day towards officiais of the
Canadian National will almost ruin any chance
of a thorough investigation of our railway
problem.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I cannot sit
still and allow that to go uncontradicted. I
object to their becoming protagonists throughout the country, in the press or elsewhere. I
do not think it is good practice. That is the
only exception I have taken. I did not say
I wanted to have them dismissed.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: If we are going to
get a proper investigation the officiais must
be allowed to come here freely and must feel
that they can say what they think, without
putting themselves in danger.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Of course.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Are we to have
to listen to propaganda by the Canadian Pacific
Railway while officiais of the Canadian
National are not allowed to say a word? They
have said very little. One or two of them
did make a speech, but they were so strongly
attacked that they have never uttered a word
since. Now the right honourable gentleman
says he objects to their saying anything. What
is the use of an investigation under these
conditions?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have never
known the honourable gentleman to be unfair before. I did not say that. I said it was
quite proper for the honourable leader (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) to go to them for information, but that it is not proper for them to
become protagonists of any policy throughout
the country. That is the only criticism I
have made.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Are we to listen to
only one side of the question, that presented
by the Canadian Pacifie?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No; to both.
We shall get the facts from both sides. Canadian National officiais are as free to state facts
as are officiais of the other railway.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I hope they are.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Of course
they are.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would suggest
to my honourable friend from Parkdale (Hon.
Mr. Murdock) that he withdraw his subamendment. Then, if no one else desires to
speak, we can deal with the amendment of my
honourable friend from Westmorland (Hon.
Mr. Black). I do not desire to close the
debate, but presumably it is ended if honourable members remain silent.

SEED GRAIN LOANS GUARANTEE BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 78, an Act to assist the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan in financing the cost of seed and seeding operations for
the crop year 1938.
He said: Honourable senators this Bill is
of considerable import to the provinces of
Alberta and Saskatchewan. Section 2 provides:
The Governor in Council, subject to the
provisions of this Act, may authorize the
guarantee of the principal and interest of any
loans by any chartered bank guaranteed by
the province of Alberta under the authority
of The Agricultural Relief Advances Act of
Alberta and any amendments thereto, or any
Act passed in substitution therefor, for purchasing seed grain and providing other assistance to farmers in connection with seeding
operations during the spring of 1938; provided
however that the liability of the Government
of Canada under all guarantees given under
this section shal be limited to one million nine
hundred thousand dollars.
The third section deals with Dominion
guarantees of bank loans in respect of Saskatchewan, and is in these terms:
The Governor in Council, subject to the
provisions of this Act, may authorize the
guarantee of the principal and interest of any
loans by any chartered bank guaranteed by the
province of Saskatchewan under the authority
of The Municipalities Seed Grain and Supply
Act, 1938, of Saskatchewan, The Local ImproveHon. Mr. DANDTTRAND-

ment Districts Act, 1936, of Saskatchewan, or
of The Local Improvement Districts Relief Act
of Saskatchewan, and any amendments thereto,
or any Acts passed in substitution therefor,
for purchasing seed grain and providing other
assistance to farmers in connection with seeding operations during the spring of 1938;
provided however that the liability of the
Government of Canada under all guarantees
given under this section shall be limited to
fourteen million five hundred thousand dollars.
Under section 4 the Governor in Council
may approve the form and terms of guarantees.
The Bill is in the same general ternis as
the Seed Grain Loans Guarantee Act passed
last year.
This year, however, only two
provinces, Alberta and Saskatchewan, have
asked for the Dominion's guarantee for seed
grain loans. Of course the amounts representing the limits of our guarantee in each
case are different. Last year the limit of our

guarantee to Alberta was $1,600,000; this year
it is to be $1,900,000. In respect of Saskatchewan the corresponding figures are $6,600,000
and 814,500,000.
There are several reasons
for the increase in the amounts, particularly
in the case of Saskatchewan. These reasons
are: (1) the greater intensity of the drought,
another year being added to a long series of
drought years; (2) the much wider area affected by the drought in the province of
Saskatchewan; and (3) the higher prices that
have to be paid for seed grain, feed grain,
and fodder.
Alberta is asking us to guarantee loans up
to $1,900,000, and states that in the recognized drought area the number of farmers
applying for assistance will be around 15,000,
and the amount required about $1,800,000,
while a further sum of $100,000 will be required to provide assistance in marginal
districts.
Last year $1,600,000 was authorized in the
case of Alberta, but actual loans made totalled
only 81,339,328.70.
At December 31, 1937,
as a result of repayments made out of last
year's crop, this amount had been reduced to
$919,049.53.

In Saskatchewan the number of farmer applicants has greatly increased because of the
factors already mentioned. Indeed, the Provincial Government estimates that the number
of farmers needing some kind of seeding
assistance will exceed 81,000, as compared with
approximately 25,000 farmers last year. The
amounts required for various forms of assistance-seed grain, feed grain, fodder, petroleum products, and so forth-has been considered very carefully with representatives of
the Provincial Government, and as a result
of discussions the limit of the Dominion's

MARCH 30, 1938
guarantee has been fixed at $14,500,000. The
total amount of loans that will be made by
the banks, however, will substantially exceed
this figure. In addition, the mortgage lending
institutions will make loans to farmers, on
whose farms they already have mortgages,
to the extent of from $1,000,000 to $1,250,000.
As I have already stated, provision was
made last year for the guarantee of loans
in Saskatchewan up to a total amount of
$6,600,000. The amount actually advanced was
approximately $6,524,000, of which there was
outstanding at December 31, 1937, about
$6,498,000.
Neither in respect of Alberta nor of Saskatchewan has the Dominion as yet given an
actual guarantee under last year's legislation,
but it is expected that information required
fromn the provinces will be received shortly,
and the guarantees will then be given in
approximately the amounts mentioned.
In 1936 the Dominion was authorized to
guarantee seed grain loans in the case of
Saskatchewan up to a maximum amount of
$4,000.000. The actual amount advanced was
only $3,514.541, and the amount outstanding
at December 31, 1936, for which we gave our
guarantee, was $2,555,112.76.
It is already a matter of knowledge in the
House that the Canadian Wheat Board has
been assisting the provinces of Saskatchewan
and Alberta to obtain seed grain for this
spring's seeding operations. Last summer when
the extent of the drought in Saskatchewan
was realized it became apparent that unless
immediate steps were taken there would
not be sufficient wheat and other grains of
good seeding quality available in the country
to enable the crop to be put in this spring.
Therefore, at the request of the province of
Saskatchewan, and with the approval of the
Wheat Committee of the Cabinet, the Wheat
Board, instead of disposing of the balance of
6,964,000 bushels of wheat futures which it
held at July 31 last, began the process of
converting these futures into cash grain and
holding them in interior and other elevators
throughout the West. This cash wheat will
be moved by the Board, on instructions from
the province, to points where the grain is
required for seeding purposes. At railway
sidings it will be loaded on to farmers' wagons.
The wheat is being sold to the province of
Saskatchewan on the basis of the average
of the closing market price of futures contracts since the Board has been conducting
this operation on account of the province,
plus all carrying charges to date of delivery.
The Board will be paid out of the proceeds
of seed grain loans made by the banks.

191

As agent for the province of Saskatchewan,
on the basis of funds advanced to the Board
by the province, the Board has also been
acquiring a certain quantity of coarse grains
for seeding purposes, the total cost to the
province, including all carrying charges, not
to exceed a maximum of $4,000,000. Under
a similar arrangement with the province of
Alberta, the Board has been acquiring wheat
and oats for the spring seeding prograimme of
that province. The amounts involved are
350,000 bushels of wheat and 100,000 bushels
of oats, up to a total maximum cost of
$700,000.
I do not think it necessary for me, at this
stage, at least, to say anything further in
regard to the details of the loans that will be
guaranteed. The general arrangements will
be the same as last year. Loans will be made
by the chartered banks to the municipalities
on the basis of the seed grain loans legislation
of the two provinces. The interest rate on
these loans will be 4 per cent. The province
guarantees the bank loans to the municipalities,
and the Dominion adds its guarantee, which
is effective only to the extent that the
province is unable to fulfil its guarantee at
the end of three years.
I suggest that these explanations will give
a fair understanding of the situation.
Perhaps I should read something about the
procedure that is followed. As I have just
said, the borrowers have three years in which
to repay the amount borrowed. Inasmuch
as there may be a failure in the first year,
they are given the benefit of delay.
In Saskatchewan the Seed Grain Loans
Guarantee Act, 1938, was put through in the
recent session. The procedure under that
Act is this.
First the municipality passes a by-law
which will enable it to borrow money for seed
grain purposes. A copy of the by-law is
submitted to the Minister of Municipal Affairs
for approval. After approval has been given,
the municipality approaches the bank and
arranges for a loan, giving as security for
repayment its demand promissory note bearing
interest at the rate of four per cent.
Second, the municipality takes from the
recipient his demand promissory note as well
as a written agreement for a lien upon all
crops to be grown during the year in which
the note is given and the succeeding year on
the land named in his application.
Third, the rate of interest to be charged
farmers by the municipalities is not stipulated
in the Saskatchewan Seed Grain and Supply
Act. My understanding is that if there is any
increase added it will be just sufficient to pay
the cost of administration. and that the final

192

SENATE

rate when payment is made will be four per
cent. They make no profit.
Fourth, the secretary-treasurer of each
municipality is obliged to register each lien
agreement, and on or before October 1 of each
year must prepare and forward to the Minister
of Municipal Affairs a return showing the
names of all persons to whom advances have
been made, and the amounts thereof.
Fifth, provision is made in Saskatchewan
legislation to give similar assistance to farmers
in the local improvement districts which are
administered by the Minister of Municipal
Affairs.
Sixth, (a) the committee of the Cabinet and
the inspector for the district determine the
amount of seed grain and supplies that a
municipality may advance; that is, the Cabinet
in Regina decides the amount that each
municipality may advance within the municipality. (b) Saskatchewan legislation provides
that the municipality shall not advance in
any year seed grain and supplies of a greater
value than $200 in respect of any one quarter
section. (c) On farms of 320 acres or less of
cultivated land not more than sixty per cent
of such acreage is to be sown. Then (d), on
farms of more than 320 acres of cultivated
land fifty per cent thereof may be sown up
to a maximum of 250 acres; that is, no one
can sow more than 250 acres as a result of
having obtained seed from the Government.
I give these details so that honourable
members
nay understand the procedure
followed in enabling the farmer to secure the
share of seed he requires. I may say that
this is a duty which has devolved upon the
Dominion of Canada in such provinces as are
unable, through lack of credit. to finance the
municipalities. I may add, for the information of my honourable friend to my left (Hon.
Mr. Casgrain), that it is a duty which we owe
to our citizens in the West who are affBicted.
I may assure him that the debt will be more
than repaid once there is a crop. and that if
there is a bimper crop the whole of the
castern provinces, including Quebec and
Ontario, will benefit. I know my honourable
friend is afraid there may be another drought.
Ie lacks confidence in Providence. I tbink
we are simply doing our duty towards the
people of Saskatchewan and Alberta, to
Canada as a whole. and to ourselves, regardless
of the returns which we hope to obtain from
the turning wheels of industry.
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

I move

the

Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN:

Honourable

members, there must be a general election in
the offing when we throw our money around
like this.
I do not understand why, in
the first place, the drought area was ever
populated. Anybody who cares to go to the
library and look at the maps made in 1740
by La Vérendrye will find that this area is
marked "The Great American Desert."
I think I may say that I know the Northwest better than any other honourable senator.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:' Hold on? I laid
out sixty townships in the Northwest myself,
and I had to report about the soil and so on
in every quarter-section. If honourable gentlemen care to go to the Department of the
Interior they can see the plans bearing my
signature. If any
honourable
gentleman
thinks he knows more about tihat country than
I do, I should like him to tell us of his experiences, and I will sit down at once. We
had to build a mound of earth every half
mile. Each mound contained two cubic yards
of earth. This meant that four times in every
mile we had to dig a hole three feet square
and eighteen inches ýdeep, in order to enable
anybody to ascertain the spot, regardless of
whether animals or rain had destroyed the
mounds. Every other surveyor working there
did the same thing.
Some people talk about irrigating that territory. I may say that it was no good in the
days I speak of, it is no good to-day, and
never will be of any use. Alexander Mackenzie knew this. I was a French translator
in the House of Commons during his régime.
Where the Canadian National Railways run
to-day there is no drought. Honourable
members know of the wonderful crops that
are grown near Edmonton.
When the Canadian Pacifie Railway was
built-I was there as a surveyor-it was
located as close as possible to the 49th
parallel, so that no railroad from the United
States would invade Canadian territory. In
1882, in the month of August, I was at Regina.
The Canadian Pacifie Railway was taking the
Press over the line to advertise the wonderful country through which it ran-and it is a
wonderful country. We arrived at Regina at
two o'clock in the afternoon on a special
train. I interviewed the oldest inhabitant.
He had arrived that morning. There were
no buildings at that time; nothing but tents;
but a great business was being done in the
sale of town lots.
There is no use trying to beat the Lord
Almighty. He made that area a desert, and

MARCH 30.,1938
it will remain a desert. Neither the Gevernment of my right bonourable friend
opposite (Rigbt Hon. Mr. Meighen) nor any
other Government can go against the Lord.
That is the Great American Desert, and it
neyer will be uf any use. Any money you
spend there is gone; you will neyer get back
one dollar of it.
Hon. IVA C. FALLIS: May I crave the
indulgence of the House to answer one remark of the bonourable senator who bas .iust
spoken? He said that in the area for which
assistance is being asked tlhere neyer were
crops and neyer wilI be. It was my good
fortune to live in that district for eight years,
and during those eight years we neyer bad a
crop failure. On the contrary, there were
marvellous crops, and money was made; and
hundreds and thousand of dollars of that
.money were sent to Ontario and Quebec to
buy manufactured goods and helped to keep
the industrial life of Eastern Canada going.
I left that district in 1920. I may say that
the people along the Soo line between Moose
Jaw and Weyburn have had one misfortune
after anot'her during the last seven years. It
bas not always been dreught. In 1935 there
was a marvellous crop, but wben the wheat
was filling there were a few warm, misty days,
and rust developed and destroyed the crop.
But it is a mistake to say that wealtb never
came eut of that country.
I arn in constant touch with people living
in that district. To-day they are encouraged
as they have not heen for five years, because
the whole country is saturated with moisture.
They have had snow and ramn and floods.
They tbink this is going to be the big year
for that country, and that they will be able
te recoup their losses, pay their debts, and
repay some of the advances which. have been
made to them.
My only regret is that, as I have learned
in listening to the statement cf the honeurable leader of the House, seed is to be given
for only 250 acres. I know land owners out
there who have 800 acres ready for wheat.
The land is in perfect condition, and I do
not think the money could *be better spent
than in helping people who for the last six
or seven years have shown fortitude and
courage by carrying on year after year. Now,
when there is a prospect of a crop, we should
flot grudge them a littie seed to enable them
te live, and to repay this country many
times over.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I understood the
honourable senator was asking me a question.

193

Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: No. I was making a
statement te the House, senator.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I thought I was
being asked a question.
This is wbat
happened. A layer of humus, about five or
six inches thick, accumulated on top of the
sand in that part of the country whieh in
1740 La Vérendrye described as a wildernessle grand désert américain. We have the same
situation in the Laurentian mountains, at a
place called Chapleau, where the Cbapleau
Club is. You get a good crop so long as you
use only the five or six inches of humus.
I do not know whether ail honourable
members know what that is. It is a vegetable
mould, the remains of grass or leaves, and it
makes excellent soul. But if you plougb it up
once or twice and bring the sand to the top,
you are bound to have sand-storms. Everyone
here bas heard about sand-storms, whicb have
occurred in the Western States and in our
own West because the good soul bad been
used up. If the land bad been farmed as it
sbould have been, if the people in the Northwest had net been mining wbeat, as tbey
wereHon. Mr. ASELTINE: No.
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: -if tbey had raised
cattli from wbich manure would have been
obtained for the fields, there would net have
been the trouble that exists te-day. But, as
I say, the people eut there were mining wheat.
They used to spend the winter in Florida or
California, and there would net be an animal
remaining on their farms after tbey had gene.
If one of tbem had a good herse hie would
go te a neighbour and arrange with bim te
keep it for the winter. I know alI about these
things; it is nething wonderful te knew about
tbem. The people mmced the wheat, took
everything eut cf the seil and put nothing back
in the way of manure or fertilizer. What can
they expect? The rigbt henourable leader on
the other side (Rigbt Hon. Mr. Meigben)
used te live in Portage la Prairie, wbich bas
a very wonderful soul, perhaps the most fertile
in the whole country.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I have been there
inany a time. The soil is net merely five or
six inches thick, but perhaps four or five
feet tbiek. Good crops can always be got
there. But other parts of the West were
enjoying good crops se long as the people
were using up a soul that bad been accumulating fer the last century or longer. Nothing
more can he got out of that soul now, and
any money spexnt on it will neyer be returDed.

SENATE

Hon. A. B. GILLIS: Henourable sena t ers,
I was greatly plcased with the closing remarks
made by the honourable leader cf the House
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) whien he was meving
second reading of this Bill. He showed a
proper patrietic spirit and a desire te help
the people cf the Wcst. But somne extraordinary statements have been made by the
honourable gentleman from De Lanaudière
(Hon. Mr. Casgrain). 0f course, we are quite
familiar with his survey stery; we have heard
that before. But he bas just referreci te parts
cf cuir Western country as a wilderness. I
agree that a certain section of Saskatchewan
and cf Alberta sheuld neyer have been settled.
Hec. Mr. CASCRAIN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: A huge miscake was
made, iunder an Administration cf which the
heneurable gentleman was an ardent supporter. We had eut there beautiful stretches
cf country which were, I suppose. the most
productive grazing lancd that ceulul be feuind
anywhere. There were a number cf ranches
fer herses and cattle, and they were prespereus.
But a craze develeped for more hemesteads,
and land that should iave heen left alone \vas
cpened Up for cultivation.
I wouild ask the' honourable leader cf the
Heuse if he can tell mc what this soed wheat
will cosi the farmers cf the West. I do net
know wlîether he has that information.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 sugg-est chat
mny henourable friroci proceed with his addres- xvhile I am lookingý fer the information.
I think 1 have it hiere semewhere.
Right Hion. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Is it $1.15 a
biushel?
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: From the discussion
in another place 1 gather that the farmers
will be charged $1.45 a bushel, which is a
very high price. When the fire sale of wheat
teck place a year or se age, seven million
hushiels were saîx aged. That wheat was held
under option by soiePne fer the <levernment,
and eventually the options were cenvcrted
inte cash wheat fer the purpose cf securinig
a supply cf seed grain. The options were
changed occasienally. As honourable members
know, if yeu hold May wheat, for example,
and have made or lest a littlc meney, yen
may think it wise te transfer it te, say, July;
later yeu may decide te transfer it te Octeber,
and se on. These seven million bushels of
wheat left over from the fire sale were transferred five times. The cost of transferring
option wheat fromn anc date ta another is vcry
small, probably less than one-cighth of a cent.
Fer this whcat that the Government eventuilly hought, the producer ivas paid 90 cents
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN.

a bushel. Then there would be some charge
for storage: for the period since those options
were converted ino cash wheat it is five cents
a bushel. The cost of transporting the wheat
to farmers in different parts of the West is
ten cents fiat per bushel. Then there is an
allowance for distribution, andi the estimate for
So the total cest of
this is three cents.
handling this option wheat is 18 cents a
bushel. Add that to the 90 cents which the
producer get and it will be seen that the
farmers should not have te pay more than
$1.08, or $1.10 at the outside. Yet, as I have
said, it appears from the discussion in another
place that the farmers will be charged S1.45.
The point I wish to emphasize in this
honourable Flouse is that the farmers of the
West are net being properly treated.
The honourable gentleman who prcceded me
(Hon. Mr. Casgrain) expressed the opinion
that again this year there will be ne crop in
the West. I may tell him that the autleok
is brighter than it has been for many years.
Last autimn we had heavy rains and the
moisture penctrated te a depth of at least
ln
two feet; then the ground freze up.
addition, we had a number of heavy snawfalîs during the wintcr. Yesterday I reccivcd
a letter frem my home in eastern Saskatchewvan saying that last Saturday a foot of sef t
snow feul aIl ever that part cf the province.
This cepieus precipitatien affords a goed
prospect cf bumper creps. When conditions
are normal in Saskatchewan, Manitoba and
Alberta, those provines produce more wealth
than any other part of Canada.
lon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Mines?

Hon. Mr. GILLIS: I am net talking of
mines, but there is a gaod deal of mining in
northern Saskatchewan.
The farmers were net allowed te participate
when the fire sale toek place. It will be
remembered that under the Act spensored
by the preceding Gevernment the farmers
ceuld get participation, certificates, and if the
wheat sold at an advanced price they profited
accerdingly. Had that Act been continucd
in force, the farmers in Western Canada
weuld have received from twcnty ta thirty
cents a bushel aver and above their initial
paymient for the millions of bushels of wheat
which they produccd.
I knew the farmers of Saskatchewan and
Alberta are cager ta have this Bill put into
effect.

CANADA'S

RAILWAY

PROBLEM

EXPLANATION

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. ARTHUR SAUVE: Honourable senators, my remarks on the motion of the honourable senator from Montarville (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien), especially those concerning Viger
and Moreau stations, and poor service, having
been the subject of comment and misinterpretation, I should like to be permitted to make
a short explanatory statement. I expressed
the opinion that the Canadian Pacific Railway
could, to a certain extent, make amends for
the injustice done to the eastern section of
Montreal by entering into an agreement with
the Canadian National Railways so that Viger
station could be used by the Canadian National trains between Montreal and Quebec.
As a result of such an arrangement the Place
Viger hotel might later'on be operated by the
Canadian National .Railways at a profit, especially if the Canadian Pacifie would agree to
discontinue its service between Lanoraie and
Joliette.
That is just one of the many instances
where classification, co-operation, or unification for certain sections could be effected.
Thus the short line between St. Eustache and
Ste. Thérèse, which is operated without profit
to anyone concerned, should be closed so as
to permit of better accommodation and service
by the Canadian National Railways. Many
exchanges and agreements would be possible
were the interested parties animated by goodwill and a real desire to serve the public.
I repeat that our railways lack plan and
classification, also adequate co-operation and
regulation, which are essential if they are to
be fairly and profitably operated. The companies should come to a reasonable agreement as to division of clientèle, net with
the object of controlling
and raising
transportation rates-trusts with such an
aim must for ever be destroyed-but
with a view to economical administration in
the common interest and in fairness ta the
public. The various governments of our country are vitally concerned in the classification
of our transportation system. Only in such
a way shall we find the solution of Canada's
railway problem. This should be the opinion,
51958-13î

the doctrine, of the Senate, which is not a
democratic Chamber, but a tribunal of order
and equal justice.
ORGANIZATION OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE

Hon. G. PARENT: Honourable senators, I
have read in the newspapers that I have been
appointed a member of the committee which
is to investigate the railway situation in Canada. I believe that this is an important committee and its members will have a very
difficult task to perform. As this committee
may not sit for some little time yet, I would
suggest, subject to the approval of both the
leaders of this House, that before the committee meets there should be placed in the
room a map showing the exact situation of
all the railways, and especially of the 4,000
miles of road which the honourable senator
from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) has
contended can be eliminated. Then, when we
start to work, it would be possible not only
for us, but for anybody who comes into the
room, to take in the situation at a glance and
ta judge whether or not those 4,000 miles
should be abandoned.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is likely that
the committee will meet next week for organization purposes. We can then decide upon
the desirability of having such a map as has
been suggested.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: May I suggest now
that the committee might meet on Wednesday morning next for organization purposes?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Say Tuesday morning?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Are we going ta sit
on Monday?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Then let us say Tuesday morning at 10.30.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Eleven o'clock.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There will
be meetings of other committees at 11. I
would suggest 10.30 for organization.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Perhaps we
may as well say Wednesday morning, to be
sure that we shall have the time clear for
the committee. -Ras the honourable senator
from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Blaak) any
objection to fixing the meeting for Wednesday
morning at 11 o'clock?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: No. Tuesday would
have been better, perhaps, if we had the time,
but Wednesday morning at eleven will ba
satisfactory for the organization meeting.

Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I shall not detain you very long in
discussing this subject. I am sorry that
the honourable gentleman from De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) is not in bis place
to hear me. When speaking yesterday he
expressed an opinion that is very prevalent,
especially in Ontario and Quebec.
I want first to commend the Government
for introducing this legislation. I think that
in the peculiar existing circumstances Canada
is very happy in having as Minister of Agriculture a Western man, and as Minister of
Finance a man wto formerly lived in the
West.
Honourable members who do net come
froin Western Canada will be able to get a
better idea of what seed means to that part
of our country if they will let me read for a
moment or two, from the Winnipeg Free
Hon. Mr. BLACK.

Press of March 28, a statement showing the
actual cash returns from four districts in
Manitoba, for which districts this House
guaranteed the money-$400.000-that was
uîsed for seed. Under the Seed Grain Loans
Guarantee Bill we passed last year the
following sums were spent for seed in
the three Prairie Provinces: Saskatchewan,
$6,600,000; Alberta, $1,600,000, and Manitoba,
$400,000. In District No. 1. the south-west
corner of Manitoba, the crop of 1936 was
worth $1,374.000, tiat of last year $5.039,000.
In District No. 2, which is pretty well in the
dried-out area, and in which until last year
they had had poor crops, the crop of 1936 was
In
worlth $4,910,000, last year's $13,384,000.
District No. 7, partly in the dried-out area
and partly in the area that had some crop
the previous year, the crop in 1936 was worth
In District
$3,972,000, last year $7,297,000.
No. 8. north of District No. 2, the crop in 1936
was worth $4,953,000, last year $7,202,000.
It will be scen that on the $400,000 guaranteed
seed grain loans for that part of Manitoba
there was a return last year of more than
$30,000,000.
Let me describe briefly the country in
south-west Manitoba, in order to give honourable niembers some idea of what the dried-out
areas of Saskatchewan and Alberta are like.
I have visited the No. 1 arca every year for
the last five years.
The first year there was a grasshopper
plague. I saw a half-section of summer fallow
secded to grain overrun by a swarm of grasshoppers a mile long and about an eighth of a
mile wide. They ate every vestige of vegetation. leaving nothing but the bare earth. For
two vears Manitoba and Saskatchewan have
suffered from that scourge.
Then in 1935 we had a rust epidemie. The
mulberry bush of the southern United States
serves as a host for the rust spores, which are
carried north by the warm, moisture-laden
winds from the Gulf. Under such favourable
conditions these spores are borne northward
for thousands and thousands of miles. Rust
does not trouble the western part of Alberta,
as the southern Rocky Mountains form an
effective barrier, but it is prevalent in the
eastern half of Alberta and in Saskatchewan
A rust-resisting wheat has
and Manitoba.
been evolved in Manitoba, but undoubtedly
as time goes on its resistant qualities will
become weakened, and a more vigorous strain
Last year in
will have to be produced.
Manitoba the wheat crop ran from thirty-five
to forty bushels to the acre where there was
only slight rust, but in badly infected districts
the yield dropped to only ten or fifteen
bushels. That will give honourable senators

MARCH 31, 1938
sorne idea of the serious losses resulting frorn
rust. In 1935 in Saskatchewan and Alberta
there were good crops, 'but they were entirely
wiped out by rust.
Last year there was virtually no0 crop in any
part of Sa.skatchewan. Last August when I
was in the northern part of the province,
1
around Humboldt and Saskatoon, 1 saw trees
the foliage of which had been eaten by cattle
and sheep up as far as they could reach.
There was no vegetation on the ground at ail.
The farmers had their first crop failure in that
district last year.
I do flot think the Governrnent is going
far enough in providing the farmers of Saskatchewan with seed. I rnay be told that
this is merely the talk of a Westerner. But
let me rernind honourable members that in
thaýt province especially the limritation of 250
acres is impracticable, for owing to the nature
of the rainfail only dry farming can be successfully carried on.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: The Saskatchewan
and Alberta Governments fixed that limitation, flot the Federal Government.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I grant that. My honourable friend misunlderstands me if he thinks I
arn criticizing tho Government. I arn trying
to point out that the limitation of 250 acres
is too low. In a dry-farming country a
farmer, to operate successfully. must every
year summer-fallow at least one-third or preferably one-half of his land. 1 have letters
in my desk from farmers in Saskatchewan
who have summer-fallowed 500 acres of their
1,000-acre farms. They can get seed for 250
acres, but they ask, "What about the other
250 acres?" With their machinery and equipment they must put more than 250 acres under
crop if they are to farm successfully.
We of the Prairies realize that we are asking
a good deal from Canada, but I would urge
the people of Ontario and Quebec to remember what a good crop in Western Canada
means to this coun'try. With the Western
wheat crop last year below the average, there
were no dividends on Canadian Pacifie Railway common stock. The revenue of the
Canadian National Railways from handling
the wheat of Western Canada is in ordinary
years $22,000,000; last year it was less than
S1O,0W,000. Not only that, but a good crop
in the West means more money to spend on
machinery, food, clothing, and furniture. During the last seven years there has been, no
money in the West for such expenditures.
Even had there been no world depression
at aIl, Eastern Canada would during the last
seven or eight years have felt the lack of
crop production, in the Prairie Provinces.

197

We in Manitoba have had very lîttle more
rainfaîl than Saskatchewan and Alberta, but
last year and the previous year we had magnificent crops, because at the right time we
had just enough rain. My honourable friend
from De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain)
bas said that the farmers of the West are
taking aIl the fertility out of the land,. In
District No. 1 last year, on land no better
than land in Alberta and which had grown
no0 crops for seven years, there. was a yield of
seventy bushels to the acre. Ail that is
necessary in that country is rainfali at the
right season of the year.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: Would irrigation solve
the problem?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No. We cannot pay
the cost of irrigation with wheat at 75 cents
a bushel. That is the difflculty. You can
grow wheat in Western Canada at 75 cents
a bushel or more and make a profit, but if
you put in irrigation, as in Alberta, the overhead is too high. Last year I saw near
Lethbridge land under irrigation yielding
sixty bushels to the acre, as against twentyfive bushels to the acre from non-irrigated
land. The current price was $1.08 per bushel,
.o.b. railway station. At that price the
farmer cotild afford to pay for irrigation;
but if the price went down to 75 cents a
bushel be would be farming at a loss. Irrigation in Al'berta bas been successful only
wbere sugar beet or similar crops can be
grown. Damming the streams, as the Government is doing now, will help somewhat in
Saskatchewan, Manïitoba and Alberta for
mixed farming. But I would ask honourable
members to bear in mind that parts of Saskatchewan and Alberta can neyer be adapted
for mixed farmoing except on a large scale.
Ontario and Quebec have year in and year
out, for the last half-century, sold a large
volume of goods ta Saskatchewan, Alberta
and Manitoba. While there has been objection
from those Western provinces to the measure
of protection enjoyed by industrial plants
in Central Canada, that objection bas
neyer been long continued. We of the Prairies
realize that a certain amount of protection
is necessary, as is evidenced by our large Conservative vote in the 1930 elections; but I
would remind Ontario and Quebec that if
they are to enjoy a continuance of protection
they must in tura recognize the disabilities
under which the West labours, and give it
some eonsideration. W-e must be conceded
the right to be placed ou an equality
with labour and industry in the two central
provinces, or Canada cannot hold together.

SENATE
It is all very well for the premiers of Quebec
and Ontario to say they are not going to
be taxed to support the Western Provinces,
but I would remind them that if they do net
support those provinces, then the people of
the West will look to other places for support-and will get it. I say to the people of
Ontario and Quebec: Be sure you examine
the whole account before you question what
the Government of Canada is doing for ManiWe can
toba, Saskatchewan and Alberta.
never have a great and united Dominion if
public men in Ontario and Quebec challenge
the right of Canada as a whole to render
proper help to the Prairie Provinces.
I congratulate the Government and its representative in this House on what is being
done for Western Canada this year. I appreciate its policy in this regard. At the
same time I want the people of Canada, particularly those of the central provinces, to
understand that we in the West do not look
upon this assistance as a hand-out. Given
good crops, the Western Provinces will repay
100 cents on every dollar advanced.
I want to assure honourable members that
we of the Prairie Provinces are loyal to Confederation. We put Canada before everything
else. Ontario and Quebec are rich and prosperces. The churches of the central provinces
bave expressed their sympathy by sending us
food and clothing. We thank them for doing
so. But we would as.k the business men of
Ontario and Quebec to realize our situation
and cease carping criticism of what our people
are doing. It is truc that a few of our people
have gone to Florida or to Califo-na, but
many from Toronto and Montreal have done
likewise. J would ask vou, honourable senators. when dealing with Western Canada,
to bear in mind that the people of Western
Canada. while at present down on their luck.
are just as loyal to this countrv as the people
of any other part of it, and that when conditions improve they will not forget what
bas been done for them by the rest of
Canada.
Hon. W. M. ASELTINE: IIonourable
senators, I wish to voice my approval of the
remarks which have just been made by the
honourable the junior member from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig).
I also come from that great country, and
have been farming and raising wheat out there
for the last twenty-five years. I think, therefore, I am better able ta judge of conditions
there than is the honourable senator from
De Lanaudière (bon. Mr. Casgrain). I am
in favour of the principle of this Bill, and want
to sec it -passed to-day if at all possible. Like
«on. Mr. HAIG.

the honourable the junior senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig), I should like to see the
Bill go a little further than it does: I think
the amount of money to b voted is all too
little. In the province of Saskatchewan we
have each year, on the average, 14,000,000
acres in wheat. In addition, there are in the
province of Manitoba about 3,000,000 acres
in wheat and in the province of Alberta
7,000,000 acres. You will realize from these
figures how important this matter is to us.
If any criticism is to be made of this proposal, it would be, I think, as ta the price
to be paid for the wheat, approximately $1.45
a bushel. We knew last year, not later than
the middle of July, that there was going ta be
a total crop failure in about two-thirds of the
province of Saskatchewan, and at that time
many of us urged upon the Government the
necessity of buying the wheat while the price
was at a comparatively low level. At one
time during the fall wheat could have been
bought at $1.02 a bushel. However, it takes
time to deal with matters of this kind, and
perhaps the Covernment is not to be criticized
unduly for not having purchased at that time.
I probably would not have spoken at all
had it non been that the honourable senator
from De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) pretended to know so much about our Western
country. It nust be many 3cars since he
made the survey of which he spoke. I am
sorry that he did not go through that country
last year with the members of the Canadian
Chamber of Commerce. The Agricultural
Committee of the Chamber of Commerce
held a special sitting in the city of Saskatoon
about the end of August or the first of
September, and seemed to be very much
exercised over the fact that the newspapers
in the East were publishing reports that the
West was donc; tiat it never again would be
a producer of wheat. I was one of those who
were called in to meet that committee. We
Lad a very fine meeting, lasting one entire
morning, and I think we were able to convince
the committee that the West was not finished
as a wheat-producing country.
Let me give you an example which I cited
to the committee. Last fall, in connection
with a case that was coming before the Board
of Review under the Farmers' Creditors
Arrangement Act, I had occasion to prepare
a brief on the production of wheat per acre
on summer-fallowed land in the section in
question, covering the period from 1911 ta
1926. I found that the average production on
suimmer fallow was 33 bushels per acre. No
one can say that a country is done as a
wheat-producing country simply because of

MARCH 31, 1938
the fact that since 1930 there have been
several bad seasons. The top soil on that land
is 50 feet deep, and it is almost impossible for
such land to be ruined by soil drifting or in
any other manner. It will take years for it
to be "mined" as suggested yesterday.
I recall that in 1914 we had what virtually
amounted to a total crop failure in our part
of the country. We had no rain, and there
was not enough seed for the next year. But
the Federal Government supplied seed to the
extent of some $4,000,000 worth, and in 1915
we had probably the greatest wheat crop in
our history. In our district summer fallow
produced in some cases as much as 72 bushels
to the acre. If the Government had not
provided seed at that time we should have
lost almost the whole of that crop; and I
contend that the money received for that crop
helped not only Western Canada, but Eastern
Canada as well. Most of the money then
advanced has been paid back.
Then we have the experience of the dust
bowl of the Southern States. For five or six
years crops there were very poor, but last
year it produced one of the largest crops in
its history. And the honourable the junior
senator from Winnipeg has just told us about
south-western Manitoba.
It is reported this year that there have been
unprecedented floods in the southern part of
Saskatchewan, and that flats which have not
produced crops, even of hay, for years, are
under water. With such conditions of moisture
prevailing, it would be a shame indeed not to
vote this money.
I have in my hand a precipitation record
for the Prairie Provinces covering the period
from 1885 to 1938. I shall be glad to show
it to any honourable senator who wishes to
sec it.
This report was prepared by the
researcli department of the Searle Grain
Company, and is very accurate. In preparing
it all the data available were examined.
I should like to read from this report the
following:
It also seems correct to say that there is no
evidence that any annual decrease in rainfall
has occurred over the period that has been
examined, that is, from 1885 to date. Hence
it would seem reasonably safe to conclude that
the dry years that have been experienced
recently will eventually in turn give way to
wetter years, just as occurred after the dry
cycles ending in 1890, 1898 and 1919. It is
interesting, too, to note that the annual average
rainfall in the last eleven years, from 1927 to
1937 inclusive, has been 11.72 inches, and for
the eleven years from 1885 to 1895 inclusive,
11.71 inches.
Similar charts showing the long-time rainfall
for each of the provinces separately, for crop
districts, and for individual points, and other
charts that will reveal long-time wheat yield
per acre, have been compiled, and will from
time to time be published.

The journals of early explorers on the
Prairies-Henry Kelsey, 1691; Anthony Henday, 1754; La Vérendrye, 1738; David Thompson, 1801; Captain Palliser, 1858; Hind, 1860;
Fleming and Grant, 1872; Macoun, 1879, and
others, have been examined and they all indicate
that dry years and wet years, since the earliest
days, seem to have occurred alternately over
the Prairie Provinces.
As I said at the beginning, I would not
have spoken had it not been for some remarks
made yesterday. I should like to press for
the passage of this Bill as quickly as possible,
because the weather in Western Canada has
been warm since the end of the first week
of February, the snow is all gone, and the
farmers are almost ready to start putting in
the crop.

member from Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis)
and the honourable the junior member from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) expressed regret
that the seed to be granted to each farmer
would not be sufficient for more than 250 acres.
I have obtained some information on that
point. I may inform honourable members
that there may be a certain leeway in deciding the amount to be granted. That matter
will be dealt with by the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta on the one hand, and
the federal Minister of Agriculture on the
other. I hope the complaints will diminish
by reason of a more liberal distribution.
The honourable senator from Whitewood
(Hon. Mr. Gillis) and the honourable senator
who bas just taken bis seat (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) have suggested that the farmer would
be charged a rather high price for the seed
which is to be distributed. I am informed
that it is not the intention of the Government to charge the farmer more than the
cost price plus interest and the charges for
transportation to the elevators-a movement
which already bas taken place-and from there
to the local elevators for distribution to the
farmers. The amount which the farmer will
be charged bas not been settled, but I am
quite sure that nobody will make any profit
out of the transaction.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not think
any complaint should be made about the
price. I understand the farmer will pay just
what is paid out west by the Wheat BoardMy

information is that it sold the old wheat just
before the market price went up, and bought
the new wheat just before the market price

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am not familiar
with all the details. Some of the wheat is
more than a year old. It may have been held
for two or three years. I do not know.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is the
trouble.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Interest on the
amount paid may have to be added, but as a
matter of fact it is not the intention of the
Government to make one cent of profit on
the operation.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable senators.
I have often been asked why the dry period
out west bas lasted so long. I have never
been able to answer that question. In fact
I have never been able to get any satisfactory
answer as to why it occurred at all. Nevertheless, a doubt bas been raised in the minds
of many people as to the advisability of lending all this assistance to Western Canada, and
I can quite understand why that doubt exists.
As I say, I have never been able to ascertain froum anvbody the cause of the drouglht.
and I do not know wheter the Gove rnment
has evcer made an m11(1m on this question.
îrv
It seemus to mue that if the Governmîeut has
not alrealv umade such an inquiry, it should
be undertaken by somebody, or by a conmission or a parliaientary committee with
the assistance of the best experts available,
for the purpose of ascertaining not only the
reason for the drought, but also whether it
is likely to last. I think that is sound sense.
Now let me give you a picture. I have
lived in Western Canada since 1882. I went
to Moose Jaw in 1891. In the ycar 1893 I
went south from Moose Jaw for a distance
60 or 70 miles. As we travelled
of soen
over the prairie in a buckboard to a marsh
wliere a friend of mine had a little ranch,
I saw cracks in the ground which were anywhere from six to twelve inches wide. and into
which you could put a pole to a depth of
fifteen feet.
lon. Mr. MULLINS: That is absolutely
correct.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That was in 1891.
In those days you did not hear anything
about such matters. A little relief was granted
by Parliament, through the Territorial Government, to the Qu'Appelle valley district,
where there was some sttlement; but in the
section of the country I was in there was
not a farmer anywhere for 200 miles; there
were only two or three ranchers.
The honourable senator from West Central
Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) has given
a description of the moisture conditions in
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Western Canada since 1885, as compiled by
the Searle Grain Company. I should like te
know where the Searle Company got their
information. There was nobody to give it
te them. Not only hundreds but thousands
of square miles of that country had net a
single settler. For example, in the whole country south of the Canadian Pacifie line from
Moose Jaw all the way to Calgary and to
the boundary line there were not one hundred
farmers.
Hon. Mr. MULLINS: Quite correct.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: On the other hand,
north of the Canadian Pacifie and west of
Moose Jaw to the Saskatchewan river, a distance of forty to eighty miles, there was
scarcely a farmer anywhere. And if you lcad
crossed the Saskatchewan river and gone on
towards Battleford, all the way to Edmonton
-an
empire in itself-you would net have
met more than perhaps ten farmers. I know
that, for I travelled over the country in
the early days.
So we have virtually no
authentic records of the rainfall of those
days in tlhat territory; we have nothing but
tlIe recollectios cf a few persons who knew
the counry. I say in all sincerity thcat I
think it is worth while to get together
meteorologists and others who understand the
causes of climate, in an effort to ascertain
whether conditions have so changed that that
country is finished as a grain producer. I
do not believe it is.
We all know where the rain in that country
used te coue from. One of the elements that
brought it there was the wind, blowing fron
the Pacifie ocean, Hudson bay, the Great
Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico. For some
reason or another, in the last seven years
the winds have net brought rain, and the
moisture in that territory bas been tumbling
back into the sca. As a result the soil has
become dried out. For example, last November at tlie time of the freeze-up I was in
the neighbouriood of Regina, and if you
dug down six inches into the ground you
would strike dry earth. I was talking to a
man who had travelled some five, six or
seven thousand miles in southern Saskatchewan, carrying a spade with him, and he told
me that the greatest depth of moisture he
found anywhere in the whole territory was
eighteen inehes. What was it ten years ago?
In the city of Regina you could dig down
for twenty feet and not lose moisture. Anywhere in that country you could go down
from ten to fifteen feet in the heavy soil and
it would net be dry. It is going to take

MARCH 31, 1938
some time ta get that reserve of moisture
back into the soil.
I amrn ft opposing this seed grain measure
at ail. My whoie point is that before we
go ahead with any sohemes invoiving large
expenditure-irrigation and that kind of thing
have been talked of-we should get the fullest
availabie, information as to. the possible future
climate of that country. We can do this
oniy by getting hold of the men who know
something about the subject. I must coniess
I do not know anything about it, and in my
ordinary travels I have neyer met any person
who did; consequeâtly, I cannot form any
opinion on the matter at ail.
Hon. HENRY A. MULLINS: Honourable
senators, what has just been said by the
honourable member frorn Saltcoats (Hon. Mr.
Calder) supports my own opinion. The territory from Moose Jaw to the mountains,
south of the main line, should neyer have
been taken away from the ranchers. We
were dýriven out of that land by the farmers,
who attempted to grow grain on land that
neyer should have been used for that purpose.
It was a prosperous grazing country. My
memory goes back to the yellowgrass district and an occasion when I was riding
with a gentleman who had a big herci of
cattie. The horse put his foot into a crack
in the ground that was over six inches wide.
It is a dry country, suitable only for the
raising ai live stock, and it neyer should
have been farmed. But the niesters came in
there in numbers, set up homesteads and
drove the cattie men out. They camped on
the water-holes. True, they leit us plenty
oi prairie. But the short bun.ch-grass was
destroyed, and 1 do not know how it can be
brought back. It was worth millions to
WVestern Canada. It was a terrible mistake
to plough that up and try to produýce wheat
instead oi cattie.
We have ail heard about the grasshoppers
of the West. Well, we had them in Manitoba,
I remember seeing thern piled up mountains high an the main streets ai Manitoba
towns in the pioncer days. However, I arn
nlot here ta taik about grasshoppers or aur
Western troubles in general. I know that
aur people in the dried-out areas are suifering, and my sympathy gaes out ta them. But
I want ta see men farming in Western Canada
in the right way. The Almighty neyer intended that men should farrn as same of

ished into beef. That is aitagether wrang.
We want markets, anywhere we can get them,
but we shouid nat seil aur grawing yearlings.
It is like sending ail yaur young men out ai
the country and leaving oniy the aider ones
ta carry on. I arn glad that the honourable
senatar irom High River (Hon. Mr. Riley)
is bere to bear me out in what I say. It is
pleasing alsa ta knaw that the honourable
the junior member irom Winnipeg (Han. Mr.
Haig) knows a good deal about live stock.
Our Western country has been depieted
ai live stock. That is why I retired front
business. I do nat want ta ship the rubbish
that is being praduced naw. Honourabie
members know about the poor quality. If
you look in the Bible you wiii sec where
the riagstraked and speckled cattle-the rubbish-came from. The outeome was due ta
Jacob's deai with Laban. I repeat that iarming in the West is not being carried on as
the Almighty intended it shouid be. There
has heen a great change irom the aid days.
I arn looking aeross the aisle at the honourable senator iramn Saskatchewan (Han. Mr.
Gillis), who remembers very weil the wonderfuI herds of cattle that used ta roam in the
mauntains south ai Whitewood. They are
flot there now. If you travelled iram Moose
Jaw ta the foot ai the mountains you couid
nat buy a train ioad ai cattie suitable for
the markets, as you could in aiden days. I
remember in the early days getting off at
Swift Current and at Crane Lake, and in
a short tirne closing a deai with Mr. Andrews,
a rancher there, for a thousand steers. That
country was rich in cattle then. Out there
ta-day they wiil tell you-and it is a sorrowfui tale-about grasshoppers and drought.
The land shauld have been leit ta produce
bunch-grass, as I have said. You cannot go
against nature, as the farmers did in the West,
without having ta pay a penalty.
One ai the greatest causes ai hardship ta
the West to-day is the high cast ai transportation. To get the produets irom the iarm.
ta the markets ai the worid you pay twenty
per cent more ta-day than when the Canadian
Pacifie Railway first came out into that country. I remember, when the uine was coupled
up at Jackfish, how giad we were ta see the
first locomotive, which is naw taken care ai
and on display at Winnipeg. In those days
I used ta ship train ioads ai cattle from the
West ta variaus parts of the East, and the rates
that were charged me were one-fiith lower
than they are to-day. What is the use ai
preaching about "competitian ever, amalgarnation neyer," when the Western farmers

202

SENATE

are being taxed with such excessive freight
rates? When the Canadian Pacifie first came
into that country the rate for shipping live
stock to markets in the East was 60j cents
per 100 pounds: the present rate is 87+ cents.
How can the farmers succeed in the face of
such rates? I recall that when I was a member of the Manitoba Legislature we had
control of rates in Western Canada, and we
could ship grain at a ten-cent rate. That is
a much cheaper rate than we have now, and
there was no competition then.
Whbat is the use of improving the railway
passenger service and doing nothing whatever
to make conditions better for shipping live
stock and grain?
We travel in luxurious
coaches and put up at luxurious hotels, but
are the box cars in which the farmer loads
his grain, or the stock cars in which be ships
his cattle. any better than they were fifty
years ago?
No. We do not provide any
bettor facilities for disposing of the produce
of the farmer who is struggling in the West.
Un less he can get lower freight rates he will
not be able to succeed.
I know that the truck bas made inroads on
the traffic that used to belong exclusively to
the railways. Onlv last week I was talking
to the manager of the stock-yards at Winnipeg
about the huge quantities of produce coming
in b' truck. I was surprised te sec the massive
vehicles driving up there. A change bas been
made in transportation methods-just as there
has been a change in the political atmosphere
of the other House, where you can hear so
nany varied ideas these days. At Toronto I
saw coming in by truck: 137,227 cattle, 90,657
calves, 180.276 hogs, 82,840 sheep and 194
horses. From these figures honourable members can realize how deeply the trucks have
cut into railway revenues.
I am going to make a statement that will
be cballenged. and I know I shall be criticized
for making it.
I say that the farmer in
Western Canada or in the East is all wrong
in the way be sells his live stock. That is a
broad statement, but I stand by it. The place
to sell his cattle is right on his farm. Let the
purchaser take them where be likes. The
farmer certainly should not ship his live stock
into a packer's yard, where an expert buyer
is employed to fix prices. The old cattleman,
the old-time trader, who used to buy direct
from the producer, is not in business to-day.
There is a new system, just as there are new
politics over in the other House.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That is bad.
Hon. Mr. MULLINS: I was in the South
a short time ago. I want the honourable the
junior senator froin Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Hon. Mr. MULLINS.

Haig) to know that I am one of those who
took a trip to Florida, but I went there for
my health. Well, I was present in the church
of a coloured congregation one Sunday, and
the clergyman was explaining, in the course
of his sermon, what an awful place Hell is.
He declared it was colder than he could
possibly describe; that more icebergs were
there than in the Arctic regions. After the
service was over I was talking to the preacher.
I said: "You preachers seem to have changed,
like the politicians. Yeu have a new doctrine.
When I was a boy I heard at church that
Hades was full of fire and brimstone, but you
pictured it as the very opposite, as being
colder than the North Pole.'
-He replied:
" There is a reason for that. If I preached to
these coloured people that it was warm there,
they would all want to go."
I have lived in Canada since the days of
Confederation, and I shudder when I listen
to sorne of the doctrines that are expounded
in another place.
I have a good many
Liberal friends, and I make no apology for
that. In 1930 many of them voted for me and
helped to send me to Ottawa. I find no
fault with a good Liberal, and I have a great
deal of respect for a good Conservative.
But, judged by the former standard, the
Liberals in power to-day are Conservatives
and the Conservatives are Liberals. This
talk of free trade that we hear so much about
on the Prairies is all a joke; there is nothing
to it. The Liberals have just as higb a tarif
as the Conservatives bad. However, I will
net go further into that. It would take too
long a time for me to deal with it in whole,
and anyway, I have passed beyond that kind
of debate.
We should do all we can te render assistance
to those who are farming in right parts of the
West and in the way it was intended that
farming should be done.
If things were
carried on as they should be, farmers would
be able to live in homes instead of boardinghouses. But again, how can a man build a
home on the Prairie when froigbt rates for
shipping lumber are so higb? Look at the
number of shacks out there. Excessive freight
rates are responsible. This is a serious matter,
and I believe something should be donc to
remedy it. We should have lower rates for
shipping in goods that the farmer needs, and
lower rates for shipping out his produce to
the markets. I want to see the right kind of
cattle raised in our West. God commanded
Moses to tell the children of Israel to bring
a red heifer, without spot or blemish. It
would be much better for our Western
farmers if they would make up their minds

MARCH 31, 1938
to produce only good stock and have nothing
more to do with rubbish.
I have to apologize to my legal friends
for referring to the live stock industry, but I
cannot help upholding it. Wbenever the subject comes before this House I cannot refrain
from speaking on behalf of that industry. As
I have been associated with it for more than
half a century, I should at least have some
experience and knowledge of it. I have gone
out and bought cattle and taken the ups and
downs of the market. I know what the production of live stock means in the building
of the home. I want to see homes and contented farmers on the Prairies. I do not care
to 'hear people talking about relief and
secession. Like my honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Haig), I do not want to see a line drawn
north and south of Port Arthur to separate
the East from the West. To Canada I would
apply those noble lines:
Wider still and wider shall thy
bounds be set.
God, who made thee mighty, make
thee mightier yet!
Hon. DUNCAN MARSHALL: Honourable
senators, it seems to me that the question
before us is whether or not it is worth while
for the Government of Canada to save the
farmers of Saskatchewan and Alberta by
guaranteeing the purchase of $16,400,000 worth
of seed grain.
I was interested in the remarks of the
honourable senator from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr.
Calder). He was one of the earliest settlers
in the West. I have driven with him over
the prairies a good many times. I saw the
opening up of that country to farming, though
I was not there until a considerable time
after my honourable friend. With regard to
his references to the drought in Western Canada. I may say that when going through
some of the early records of the Hudson's
Bay Company I noticed that the Indians in
making a treaty with that company insisted
on a proviso that they should not be compelled to take their land in what was then
called the Great Desert. That "Great Desert"
is to-day the Portage Plains, than which there
is no finer section of farm land in any country
that I know of.
As to the drought area, I do not think there
is a single agricultural college on either side
of the line, whether in the Dakotas or Minnesota or in our Prairie Provinces, that bas not
devoted a great deal of attention to a study
of drought conditions; but, like other mysteries
of the soil, it is a very difficult problem to
deal with.
Last year Saskatchewan had a very small
crop, averaging about two bushels to the
acre. After the weeds and other rubbish were

;C03

separated, the clean grain would not be much
more than sufficient for seed purposes in the
province. But before any of this grain could
be set aside for seed the farmer with such a
scanty yield was .probably obliged to sell his
grain to provide the means to purchase food
to keep his family through the winter. Consequently it will be necessary to ship seed grain
into Saskatchewan from Manitoba, which had
an excellent crop last year, and from Alberta,
half of which province also had an excellent
crop.
The right honourable leader of the opposition (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) referred to
wheat futures. I never had any spare money
with which to go into the market; so I have
neither bought nor sold wheat futures. It
appears that when Mr. Murray in December,
1935, succeeded Mr. McFarland as Chairman
of the Wheat Board, he found on hand 298,000,000 bushels of wheat, or wheat futures.
Could we have foreseen the drought of last
year, it would have been very fortunate for
us to have been able to find storage for some
of that wheat, which could be used to-day.
Mr. Murray, I understand, sold the wheat
gradually until he had only about six or seven
million bushels left. The wheat held by the
Wheat Board in 1935 was purchased with
money advanced by the Dominion Government, and Mr. Murray was anxious to dispose
of the wheat without loss to the federal
treasury. I think the transaction was closed
out at a slight profit. But that is something
entirely aside from the provision of seed grain
for the farmers of Saskatchewan and Alberta.
I had the misfortune-about my only misfortune in administering a department in a
new province-of distributing grain to Alberta
farmers for twelve consecutive years. In
those days the trouble was caused not by
drought, but by frost, and was very slight in
comparison with the present distress. The
seed grain was distributed then exactly as it
will be under this Bill. In many places the
same municipal officials will act as those with
whom I worked years ago. I may instance Mr.
Brusso, the secretary of the municipality in
which I then resided. He is still on the job,
and under direction from the Provincial Government, and probably also from the Dominion
Government, he will oversee the distribution
of the seed grain in his municipality. Nobody can do this work so well as the municipal
officials, for they know personally everyone
in their district.
The honourable the junior member from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) referred to the
hardships that the 250-acre limitation would
impose on a farmer with a large acreage under
cultivation. For the last three years the
Ontario Department of Agriculture has dis-

204

SENATE

tributed seed grain, but in small quantities.
Even in the county of Carleton, if you please,
we had to distribute seed grain to needy
farmers. These men are promptly repaying.
In the course of distribution in the West
it was my experience that the farmers who
desired to sow 1,000 or 1,200 acres were the
men who should not be supplied with the
quantity of seed they wanted, and that the
men to be encouraged were those farming on
a smaller scale and cultivating their land
thoroughly. I heard the honourable Minister
of Agriculture state in the other House that
the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta,
after consulting various municipal officials,
decided on the limitations of 250 acres and
300 acres respectively. The reason for the
larger acreage in Alberta is that it had a very
good crop last year, and the Government of
that province feels confident that the loans
adxvanced for seed grain will be repaid.
Under this Bill the Feceral Government
is guaranteeing repaymunt of the loans. It
is only a remote possibility that the Governimiiet will be called upon to make good its
guaraniee. Thie fiederal guarantee is necessarv because tbese pi-exinces of Saskatchewan
and Alberta aie not in a position to furnish
the necessary uash.
The Goxcrnnient of
Saskatcliewan. not the Federal Goxcrrnment,
is buying the seed grain. The Hon. Mr.
Taggart told me the other day that some of
tlie wlheai liait been purchased at 81.02 a
busliel. He did not know wvhat their total
pui-chases would be, but he was quite certain that the ultimate price per bushel would
not be more than 81.45 cleaned and delivered
at railhay station.
I wouli call the attention of honourable
members to a very satisfactory arrangement
that is being macle with respect te the railway rates on seed grain. The rates are
being pooled, so that a farmer living two
hundred miles fron Regina will bave to pay
no more than the farmer living only twenty
miles from the point of distribution. This
arrangement reliexes the farmer back in the
country, and he will net be penalized for
locating too far from the railway.
There cannot possibly be any politics in
this matter. Every federal government and
every provincial government in the Prairie
Provinces has lad to meet a similar situation
over a period of years. We know what Saskatchewan can do when she undertakes to
grow a crop. My honourable friend from
West Central Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) told us of his soil being fifty feet deep.
I saw a well bored on Harry Hunter's farm
at Pense, Saskatchewan, and sixty feet down
the soil was exactly the same as that on top.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL.

He could afford to have several feet blown
away without the fertility of his land being
affected. In fact a new farm of the same
kind of soi would be there for him.
Everyone who has farmed knows how land
is improved by being given a rest. No one
knows what happens, but if you leave land
fallow for a year or two and then plough it
you will get a good crop. I am not an
agricultural chemist, nor do I know nature's
processes in this case, but I do know that
such improvement does occur. Last summer
I drove over the country froin Regina te
Moose Jaw and north fron there to Saskatoon. That is one of the best wheat-producing sections in the province, and if we
have rain this year-I am sorry there is not
iore sub-soil moisture-they will not be
able to stook the wheat on the land that
grows it.
I have every sympathy for my honourable
friend from Marquette (Hon. Mr. Mullins)
in bis references to cattle. I ani as fond of
" strawberrv roans " as he is, and have been
all my life; but there are certain sections in
Saskathewaa wliere it is impossible just now
to handie cattle. I hope conditions wiill be
uchanged by water-holies, made to catch and
lold water from the hilLsides when it rains.
You can seoop out the land there and the hole
will hold water without doing mucli to the
pond, once rain has filled it. But what is the
use of asking a mac to milk cows in the dried
areas of Saskatchewan or Alberta now? On
one occasion I met a man north of Moose
Jaw drawing water tlree miles for his horses.
I asked him why he did not drill a well. He
replied, "It's the same distance." Wlhen a
prairie farmer bas a piece of land that is good
for growing whvcat be is bound to go on
growing it for a time. But I agree with the
theory of keeping live stock on the land.
The purpose of this is net so much to conserve
the fertility' of the soi, for its fertility is
simply beyond description, as to provide
iumus so that the top soil will net blow off
onto the neighbour's fields. Ploughing in a
cover crop of sone kind would improve such
conditions.
Tlhe question, hoxwever, before us now is:
Shall we save Saskatchewan? I am confident
there is net a member in this House who is
net in favour of doing that, for Saskatchewan
is the greatest wheat-growing province in the
Dominion. It is a marvellous tract of land.
I admit a large sum of money is involved,
but I am sure that wben we consider the large
expenditures we make in other directions we
shall come to the conclusion that we should

MARCH 31, 1938
give the farmers and wheat-growers of Saskatchewan and Alberta another chance.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
senators, if no one desires to have any clauses
of the Bill amended, I would suggest that we
dispense with reference to Committee of the
Whole and proceed with third reading now.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Carriedl
Hou. Mr. DANDURAND: Then I move
third reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill wa.s
read the third time, and passed.
INSPECTION AND SALE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 30, an Act to regulate the
inspection and sale of binder twine, and to
establish weight of bushel for certain coinmodities commonly sold by the bushel.
H1e said: The Inspection and Sale Act has
been on the Statute Book for many years.
Originally it was administered by the Department of Trade and Commerce, but since 1924
it bas been administered by the Department
of Agriculture, for the reason that the inspectors
of that department were in an advantageous
position to performi the inspection required.
The purpose of the Bill is stated in the
explanation, but it may be mentioned that
many sections of the Act have been re-enacted
by more recent legisiation without being
repealed. Such parts as have been re-enacted
will be completely repealed by this Bill.
Where it is necessary to continue sections,
these are included. Reference is made in the
sat page of the explanations to parts or sections of the Act now obsolete.
Section 7 of the Bill is important. This
section is new and is designed to. provide for
appropriate control measures for the sale of
binder twine salvaged or damaged by fire
or water.
The Bill also establishes legal weights for
commodities commonly sold hy the measure.
As this list may not appear to be complete,
mention may be made of the fact that legal
weights are not established for such coinmodities as apples, turnips, carrots, etc. These
commodities vary in size, owing to varictal
characteristics, and a legal weight for one
variety of small size would not be considered
fair for another of large sizte. They therefore cannot be included at the present time.

205

It bas long been the custom in many parts
of Canada to buy and selI articles such as
those specified in Part Il of the Bill on a
hushel basis, subject to, legal weights per
hushel. The weights are obviously necessary
t0 prevent dispute between buyers and sellers.
Legal weights per bushel have for years
been a part of the Inspection and Sale
Act as administered by the Department of
Trade and Commerce. This department has
recommended that they be included in this
Bill and th-at the Inspection and Sale Act
be repealed. A few more articles have been
added te the original list as follows: bluegrass seed, brome seed, crested wheat grass
seed, fescue seed, millet seed, oirchard grass
seed, potatoes, rye grass seed, soy beans,
vetch and shender wheat grass seed (Western
rye grass).
The weights are hased. on the average
weight per measured bushel of the articles
specified.
With this explanation I move the second
reading of the Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, as I said the other day, I find
it hard to understand why we should have
a special Bill dealing with two phases -of the
weights and measures juriadiction which this
Parliament enjeys. We have a Weights and
Measûres Act, and we have had up to now
another Act, which was referrcd to by my
honourable friend. I cannot recaîl its exact
naine.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: The Inspection and
Sale Act.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The measure
before us is, I presume, the Inspection and
Sale Act, 1938.
Yes. "This
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Act may be cited as the Inspection and Sale
Act, 1938."
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That makes
the mystery deeper. It in no way refers te
our present Inspection and Sale Act.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Would the right
honourable gentleman look at clause 16, at
the end?
Oh, yes.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
This is a sort of new Inspection and Sale
Act.
Now, the first part of this Bill simply deals
with matters affecting weights and measures of
binder twine. The purpese is to make certain
that binder twine, as to length and quality, is
in accordance with the representations made
when it is sold. In a word, it is a weights and
measures provision.

2UtS

SENATE

The second part is d.istinctly weigbts and
measures.
It prescribes what shall be the
weights per bushel of certain commodities
when sold.
What I cannot get through my bead is
why we now have three measures. In fact I
do nlot see why we should have two. There
sh*ould be only -one. The leader of the Goverilment intended, I know, but bas likely forgotten, to mention this matter.
I should like to have this Bill go to coinmittee su that I may inquire of the officers
of the dcpartment why they do flot bring
in une consolidated Act, to -which anybody
could refer when iooking for the law of
weiglit- and mneasures.
Hon. Mr. DANDLTRAND:
I would suggeýzt that the Bill, when it receiv es the second
reading, should be sont to the Committee
on Agriculture.
I wiil let my honourabie
friend know the date on which that coinmittee meets.
lion. DUNCAN MARSHIALL: I think the
two things deait with are entirely different.
I hav'e tried to get a copy of th2 Potato
Act, but have not yet been able to do so.
1 should take the inspection of potatoes to
mean inspection in the field, something which
has nothing to do with the weigbt in the
bushel.
It may mean inspection for leafcon, mosaic and other disease. I have not
the Act by me. Already there is an Act
whicb provides for the inspection of potýatoes,
and under which, if they are free from disease,
they are qualified as fit for export to the
West Indies. The West Indies get their seed
potatoes from Canada because their own
potatues are unfit for use as seed.
Hon. Mn. SINCLAIR: The Weights and
Measures Ac-, does nlot deal with commodities
at ail.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: Do you know the
chapten number of the Potato Act? I tbink
you will find that these Acts have no connection.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Committee
on Agriculture will go into this matter.
Hon. J. A. MacDONAID (Cardigan): The
bonourable gentleman from Peel (Hn. Mr.
Marshall) do.es not seema to, grasp the situation
at ail. What he says about inspection in the
field is true, but that inspection applies only
to certified seed potatoes, flot to the generai
potato crop. The general potato crop must
be inspected when it is being shipped; but
there is no field inspection of it at any time.
Rght Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: Then this really
bas to do witb the inspection of potatoca to
be shipped.
Hon. Mr. MacDONALD: Yes, but not inspection in the field.
As far as tbe West Indies trade is concerned, I may say that the development of
dýisease there is not the neai reason why they
get new secd. The neason is that in Cuba
and othen couintries in that tropical area
tbey cannot precerx e thein cirop fromn one
season to another.
Hon. J. E. SINCLAIR: Honourzable mcmnbprnz. if you will stud., the Bill closel.v ,ou
wvill see that except for the clauses rclating
to the sale of binden twine, and the standard
busbel weiglits for eight different commoditics, ail the sections of the nid Inspection
and Sale Act have been ne-enacted by previous legislation.
In Part II of this Bill
thene are some 32 diffenent commodities to
whichi we give a standard bushel weight.
The Weights and Measures Act, as administered by the Department of Trade and
Commence, deals exclusively wvitli weigbts,
scales and measures. It provides lhow many
inches there shal ýbe in a yardstick, how a
gallon shall bla determined, how the different
scales shiah
be inspccted and with whiat
standards they must comply. Ail that work
is under the jurisdiction of the Department

of Trade and Commence.

The provisions of

this Bill, as they relate to binder twine and

the

standard

w'eighits

of the

commodities

mentioned, are ad.ministered ýby the Depant-

ment of Agriculture.. This, I think, is langely
owing to the fact that that department bas
inspectors who iare canrying on operations
under othen Acts hike the Root Vegetahies
Act, the Insect Pests Act, the Hay and Feeding
Stuifs Act, and the F'ertilizers Act. I think
that if my rigbt bonourable fniend. (Rigbt
Hon. Mr. Meigben> bas an opportunity to
look into the Bill in committee he will understand that there is really no direct connection
between the standard weights. of commodities
and the Weights and Measures Act, whicb

Hon. Mr. MARSHALL. The situation witb

bonourable member is net correct in stating

we had intended.
But the alteration that
the leader of the Government now asks us to
make is one that would simply put the Bill
in the shape that everybody thought it was
in. lt neyer occurred to me that the measure
as we passed it did nlot mean what it will
mean if we accede to the honourable gentleman's suggestion, namely, that the limitation of the Government's liability applies to
the principal only and not to interest. I have
no objection to the third reading heing rescinded in these circumstances. I would suggest that the amendiments be proposed in
a separate motion.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Then, with
leave, I move that the third reading of Bill
78, an Act to assist the Provinces of Alberta

seted and seeding operations for the crop year

COPYRIGHT BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. BLACK: The Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, to whom
was referred Bill 12, an Act to amend the
Copyright Act, 1931, has given consideration
to the Bill. As a resuit of its deliberations the
committee has produced what is virtually a
ncw Bill, and I arn going to suggcst that the
consideration of the report be postponed
until ýto-morrow. I have before me a short
statement, prepared by the Law Clerk, as to
the progress of the Bill since its introduction
in the other House. Instead of reading it, I
would ask permission to place it on Hansard.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The statement,
which my honourable friend has not read,
will appear in Hansard?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Yes.
The following is tbe statement prepared by
the Law Clerk:
Bill 12 was sponsored in the House of Commons (where it passed unanimously) by a
private member, Mr. Esling.
The Senate Committee on Banking and Commerce has completely re-written the Bill and,
as well, bas added to it several new clauses.
An explanation, therefore, is owing, so that
the relevant causes, changes and results may
be known in the Senate and elsewbere.
0f clause 1 of the Bill as it passed the House
of Communs the committee would leave only
its first twenty lines, ending with the word
" Canada." The resuit is to leave subsection 1
of section 10 of the Copyright Amendment Act,
1931, as enacted in 1936 , unchanged except for
the substitution of the word "has" for the
word "dlaims" in the third line from the end
of the subsection. A clerical error is corrected
in the third line f rom the beginning of the
same subsection by striking out the word "ýof."1
The committee would strike out the wbole
of clause 2 of the Bill.
The changes proposed were made with the
concurrence of Mr. Esling, who would thereby
achieve bis aim, but by another route than that
proposed in the House of Commons.
It was developed before the committee that

is party to international conventions whicb.
pledge that Canada wîll not impose any
"formalities" upon the eninyment or exercise
of copyrights by owners thereof wbo adbere
to sucli conventions. Following upon the passing of Bill 12 in the Commons, international
and other representations were made that the
compulsory provision of lists of copyrigbted

5195-Hi
EEVISED ]MITION

SENATE
matter which Bill 12 proposed would amount
to the imposition of a formality and a breach
by Canada of the terms of the conventions.
These representations came before the committee, which did not, in the result, find it
necessary to reach any conclusion as to their
soundness or validity. The committee concluded
that the new provisions of the Bill as to lists
should be struck out and the same end achieved
by the substitution of two new clauses in the
Bill. These are clauses 4 and 5 of the Bill
as proposed to be amended. They are easy
to understand and the committee is advised
that they are not in conflict with any convention. The conventions by their terms allow
considerable freedom te enact national law to
the parties thereto.
The remarks already made account for clauses
1, 4 and 5 of the Bill as proposed by the
committee.
The new clause 2, as proposed, is merely to
correct an error made in 1936 in the mode
of legislation. The committee, being advised
that as a result there were conflicting duplicate

provisions in the Copyright Act, would clear
the letks. so to speak, and enact again, without
change, what lad been imperfectly done in 1936.
The new clause 3 as proposed is designed
to clear upi a suggested doubt whtether the
provisions of the legislation of 1931. as since
added to, could be regarded as am ïendlnts of
the Copyright Act, se as to enable the two
Acts to be read together. It is important
that they be read together because, otherwise,

the definitions of the Copyright Act, as in the
Revisedi Statutes,

cannot

be

applied

to

the

Copyright Amendmient Act, 1931.
Finally, since the Bill as now proposed extends to the Copyright Act, as well as to the
Copyright Amendment Act, 1931. the comittee
proposes that the title of the Bill be amended
to conform.
Consideration, of the report was postponed until to-morrow.

PRIVATE BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING

Hon. G. LACASSE moved the second reading of Bill M-1, an Act respecting Madame
Belle Hervey Harper Cazzani.
Hon. Mr. BLACK.

He said:
Honourable members, may I
offer a brief explanation of this Bill? The
purpose of the Bill is to provide for the entry
into Canada of a woman by the name of
Belle Hervey Harper Cazzani, an Italian
citizen at present residing in Edinburgh, Scotland. She is an American-born woman who
married an Italian and lived for some years
in Brazil, where her husband died. She went
to Italy for the burial of her husband, and
has remained in Europe ever since. Three
or four years ago she developed some mental
trouble, which necessitated the appointment
of a curator bonis.
The Immigration Act prohibits the entry
into Canada of a person who is not mentally
sound; tence this appeal to Parliament by
the petitioners.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
sterling.

She has £55.000

There are
Yes.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE:
other details, of course, which could be added;
but I would plead with this House, whatever
may be the grounds upon which the petition
is based, to allow the Bill to go to committee
for further study, so that the petitioners may
have a chance to explain more thoroughly
the reasons for its introduction.
I move the second reading of the Bill.
lon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
Honourable senators, I regret to have to state that
if is my intention to challenge this Bill on
the second reading, not in committee. The
explanation given by my honourable friend
(Hon. Mr. Lacasse) is to be found in the
preamble of the Bill. This being so, the
story cannot be varied, and I accept it as it
is; but I must say that it can support neither
my honourable friend's conclusion nor the
Bill itself.
The statement which I have froua Mr. Blair
Director of the Immigration Branch, reads
as follows:
Belle Hervey Harper was bon in the United
States, of American parents, in 1875, continmed
to reside there until 1911, when she married
an Italian citizen named Cazzani and went
with lhim te Brazil and resided there until
his death in February, 1931, when she took
up residence in the British Isles, being at
present resident in Scotland.
It is alleged that in 1932 she became mentally
incapable of conducting her own affairs and a
guardian named John Henry Waterston, of
Edinburgh, was appointed. The forma of mental
trouble discloses itself in ultra extravagance
and in religious matters. She is now being
cared for in a sanatorium.
Mrs. Cazzani has a brother, Robert O.
Harper, an American citizen resident in Detroit,
who on lier death is expected to become ter
sole heir, as she has no children. Her estate
The larger part
is valued at $345,000.

APRIL 4, 1938
($260,000) is said to be in British securities
and the balance ($85,000) in U.S. securities.
It is understood to be the desire of Mr. Harper
to have his sister transferred to Canada to
be cared for, presumably, in some institution
at Windsor, in order that he may better protect
his interest in her estate.
Mrs. Cazzani has never resided in Canada,
nor has her brother. She is not a British
subject and bas no claim on this country to
the very special consideration this Bill involves. Because of her mental condition she
belongs to a prohibited class under U.S. Immigration law as well as under Canadian Immigration law. See Immigration Act, Chapter 93,
R.S.C. 1927, section 3 a).
Many requests have been made to the
Dominion Government over a period of years,
and continue to be made, for the admission
of the mentally defective whose admission either
as immigrants or non-immigrants is prohibited
by the Immigration Act. This case, like other
similar requests, was refused.
There is no fear on the part of Government
that Mrs. Cazzani would become a public charge
in Canada, as her estate is more than ample
to provide for her needs. There is an important
difference between the background of this
application and most others received, in that
neither Mrs. Cazzani nor her relative has the
slightest claim on this country, while in most
other cases those seeking the entry of the
mentally defective are Canadian citizens established here and much more entitled to any
consideration that Canada might show.
The present Bill, so far as we are aware, is
the first effort to accomplish the admission of
a prohibited person by means of an Act of
Parliament. Should it be successfui it will
establish a precedent that will quickly be seized
upon by many others desiring similar concessions. It constitutes a serions blow to the
administration of the Immigration Act, designed
for the protection of Canada against the entry
of not only the mentally defective, but various
other groups included in the "prohibited classes"
(sec section 3 of the Immigration Act). Divorce
applications became so numerous as to be a
nuisance to Parliament, but any encouragement
offered in the direction of Bill M1 will produce
a similar but greater harvest of trouble.
That remark is one which perhaps might
beotter have been made by myself.
I would draw the attention of the Senate
to the fact that we have an immigration law
and that its provisions forbidding 'the entry
of mentally unsound persons have been enforced even when application for permission
to enter has been made by Canad-ians on
behalf of relatives or friends who had some
ground for being admitted here. This woman
has none. She is an Italian, a Brazilian or
an American. The Bill sets out that she was
born in the United States, in, which country,
I believe, she was married. Why does she not
appeal for admission to her motherland by a
special Act of Congress? But no, she makes
application to Canada. It just happens that
her brother lives in Detroit. He apparently
thinks it would be easier for our Parliament
51958-14j

to make an exception to the Canadian law
than it would be for Congress to make an
exception to the American law.
Whatever good features there may be about
this case, such as the fact that the woman
has means, they do not alter the situation.
Our law has been uniformly administered,
and I believe that instead of authorizing
exceptions to it by Act of Parliament it
would be better to amend the law so as to
give some leeway to our immigration officials,
permitting them to use their own discretion.
I submit that this is not a case-I doubt
whether, so long as the law remains as it is,
there could be one at all-which would justify
the making of such an exception as this Bill
contemplates. If it were contended that a
rank injustice had been done, or the Act
grossly violated or falsely interpreted, and if
evidence were offered in support of that contention, the situation would be entirely different.
The case is simply and clearly
stated in the preamble of the Bill. Under
these conditions I move in amendment,
seconded by the right honourable senator
from Eganville (R-ight Hon. Mr. Graham),
that the Bill be not now read the second time,
but this day six months.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I rise simply to thank the honourable leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) for so clearly placing before the
House cogent reasons why we should not
assent to second reading of this Bill. I cannot
add anything to what has been so plainly
stated in his own remarks and in the Department's memorandum which he read. I hope
the House will concur in the amendment
moved by the honourable leader and seconded
by the right honourable senator from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham).
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN:
Honourable
senators, here is a woman who, I am informed,
has £55,000 sterling. Naturally no bill such
as this would be necessary if Madame Cazzani could enter under our present law, or if
it were intended so to amend the law that
such a person could come in. I for one would
gladly admit immigrants who would each
bring in £55,000, but I say that instead of
enacting an amendment that would permit
this woman's entry we should simply pass
this Bill. We have been receiving paupers
here, many of whom become a charge upon
us. Some of those people have been brought
to Canada from the south-east of Europe,
where they were misfits in their own parishes.
Once they get here they do not want to go
back.

on the motion for second reading. I submit
that we should follow the usiial course and
refer the measure to a committee wliere the
petitioners could bo afforded an opportunity
of supplementing the explanations they have
already given in the preamble. The procedure
now proposed is what a surgeon would termi a

I may state for my personal satisfaction,

SECOND READING
The purHon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
pose of this Bill is to grant to His Majesty
the sum of $36.717,668 for the public service
of the financial year just expired, which sum
represents expenditures made under special
warrants and otherwise. With the consent of
my right honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) and the leave of the House, I would
move second reading now. Of course, if any
honourable member desires that second reading
should not be taken up until to-morrow, I
shall not press my motion.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: I have
no desire to impede the passing of the measure.
The House, of course, understands that this
is a Bill to provide for $36,717,000 odd already
expended, and chargeable to the year which
ended on the 31st of March-nearly a week
age.
I should like the honourable leader of the
Government, and the House as well, to turn
to page 6 of the Bill, where it will be found
that, of the $36.717.000 odd, no less than
$29,371,500 consists of a series of payments
under Governor General's warrants. The first
of the main items is $13,750,000 to provide
for feed and fodder for hive stock in drought
areas, and the last is $6,890,000 to make good
a deficit in respect of the Canadian National
Railways. These further sums should have
been in the supplementary estimates of last
year. I would ask the honourable leader of
the Government to present to the House the
Government's justification for these huge payments, made on Governor General's warrants
without the authority of Parliament, on the
well known and oft repeated principles of
"constitutional government," the "rights of
the people's representatives," and "the sovereign aiuthority of Parliament."
I have no

parliamentary practice. I have not the documents before me, but I shall be prepared to
produce them to-morrow.

SECOND READING

and fluid exportation.

to the Senate it was examined from various
angles. It was a public bill sponsored by a
private member. I do not recollect who sponsored the bill in this House, but, as it seeimed
to be a measure of considerable importance,
and as we had never had occasion to review
the whole question of export of fluïids and
electricity te the United States, the bill was
examined minutely. I recall that honourable
senators did net know exactly the history of
the export of power and, as representing the
Government, I was asked to furnish this

SENATE

I see that my right honourable friend to
my right (Right Hon. Mr. Graham) spoke
at length on this matter; but I desire to cite
the view expressed by my right honourable
friend on the other side (Right Hon. Mr
Meighen).
The motion, as amended, was
agreed to on June 15, 1925. It will be found
at page 4288 of Volume 5 of Commons
Hansard of that year, in this form:
That in the opinion of this House the export
of hydro-electric power from Canada should
be permitted only on yearly licence, and that
hereafter no licence for export of power beyond
that already granted should be issued except
with the concurrence of the province or provinces in which it is proposed to develop such
power and of any other provinces adjacent to
such development and interested therein.
My right honourable friend opposite said
at page 4282 of the same volume:
Power is not something that is in the world
market, that another country can substitute for
if a first country withdraws. Power is something vhich once exported becomes the foundation of a great vested right and the withdrawal
of it-however closely, however narrowly and
carefully it may have been provided forbecomes a practical impossibility. We found
ourselves in the position that when we needed
the power badly we could not withdraw it,
and we found, as well, that although we applied
the system of yearly licences the company undertook to give ceontracts extending over a period
of time, and we were bound not only by the
rights secured by the industry erected, but
were also bound, in a measure, by the contract,
although that contract had no warrant to be
entered into.
Then at page 4287 my right honourable
friend said:
I accept the amendment in order that we
may be united and that the wliole wrorld may
know how we are travelling in relation to
this great question. But I would prefer that
governmental responsibility should not be
shirked, and I would have preferred that it
be declared once and for all that we are against
further exportation; but I accept it inasmuch
as I believe this amendment in its practical
result will reach the same end as the amendment that was moved before, because I do
not believe that our provinces will agree to
the export at all. That being my opinion I
accept the amendment as now agreed to by
the Prime Minister himself.
In view of the fact that endorsation by the
provinces affected would be required, my right
honourable friend saw sufficient protection in
the assumption that the provinces would net
agree to the expert at all. I think that today he doubtless prefers full parliamentary
control over this important matter. But
throughout the discussion of 1907, and more
especially the discussions of 1928 and 1929for the Stewart Bill was introduced in 1928-.
it was the unanimous opinion of the House
of Commons that Parliament should be vested
with the right of control.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

This Bill provides that, apart from the renewal of existing licences, to which the present
law shall continue te apply, there shall be no
expert of power unless it is authorized by a
private Act of Parliament. The petitioner for
such a private Act must secure an Order in
Council from the province in which the power
is generated, and the province from which it is
to be exported. Power is net te be exported
if it is needed in Canada. The price charged
for the poîwer exported is not to be lower than
the price charged for power sold in similar
circumstances in Canada. The authority to
expert is net to be effective for more than one
year, but may be renewed from year to year
by the Governor in Council. No private Act
is te run for more than five years; and the
authority given is to be revocable at any time
by the Governor in Council. It will be seen
that the restrictions are much more rigid and
the safeguards much more efficient than those
provided in the statute of 1907.
The amendment also vests in the Governor
in Council authority to meet temporary emergencies, but only for the period of such emrergencies; and it leaves with the Governor in
Council the authority te renew or te cancel the
licences which exist at the present time.
I commend this Bill to the wisdom of the
Senate. It restores to Parliament the authority
which was granted te the Governor in Council.
It covers a matter of considerable import to
Canada-the disposition of one of her natural
resources which is transformed into enormous
power and keeps the wheels of industry turning. Requests for permission te expert power
are to be made through a petition to Parliament. The conditions under which the export
is te be permitted will be contained in the
petition and in the private bill, which will be
examined by committees of both Houses. I
believe this offers a safeguard which will be
welcomed by the people. The discussion will
be open, and the decision will not be that of
the Governor in Council based upon the report
of experts. What we need in such a large
matter as this, which affects the natural resources of Canada, is a decision taken by the
two branches of Parliament in the full light
of day.
During mny career I have been aware at
times of a reluctance on the part of Parliament, ineluding the Senate, te divest Parliament of power and grant it to the Governor
in Council. What is proposed now is just the
reverse. The Governor in Council says te Parliament, "We are now desirous of returning to
yen the powers yen granted to us."
I move the second reading of the Bill,
seconded by the Right Hon. Mr. Graham.

APRIL 5,1938
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, the subject-matter of this Bill
is not new to the Parliament of Canada. Its
importance bas been recognized for decades.,
It involves the whole question of the export
of power, the problem whether Parliament
should say yes or no as to the export of
power in toto, and, if Parliament does not
say no, the proper method of regulating export,
and the principles to be followed. Nothing
could be more obvious than that the Bill bas
to do with a matter of public policy. It is
distinctly public policy in every aspect and
in its very essence.
The honourable member has recited the
history of parliamentary treatment of the
subject as far back as 1925, and bas referred
to certain remarks of Sir Robert Borden on
one phase of the subject in the year 1907.
I shall endeavour in a brief space to make
known to the House my position on the question. Attempts have been made to inform the
public in advance as ,to what I would do
and what I would say. I prefer to express my
opinion for myself. I do not intend to be
influenced in the slightest degree by any
predictions, and I hope the House will give
me credit for being sincere when I say I shall
certainly not be influenced by any personal
affiliations or alleged personal animosities.
Though I welcome the reference, I had no
need to be reminded of the debate of 1925. I
have made no extensive research into the
farther past to ascertain what was said on a
cognate or perhaps the same subject in 1907.
The honourable member, in moving the
second reading, referred to the policy behind
this Bill. I am afraid his words were inept.
Most obviously there is no policy behind the
Bill. This Bill is a skilful effort to avoid all
policy. This Bill, in the boast of the Government-and the word is not used offensivelymasquerades as an attempt to return certain
authority to Parliament, but it is authority
which by statute the Government now possesses. Could such a course be declared a
policy on the suþject of the export of power?
If so, what is the policy? Has anyone an
answer? Some will say, "The same device has
been resorted to on other subjects." Of course;
but there is no statement of policy until the
Government declares what Parliament should
say, and there is no such declaration here.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Each case will
be treated according to its merits.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is not
a policy; it is avoiding all policy. That is
merely leaving until a later date the declaration of where the Government stands. And
the avoiding is rather awkward, and all the

219

more manifest, by reason of the statement
in this Bill that when the subject comes up
again it must come up by way of a private
bill. Why should Parliament direct that a
matter of public policy of the highest importance must in future be dealt with by the
bill of a private member? Did we ever so
direct in other days? Is there a case in history
where this Parliament, by statute, has provided
that what shall be done in future in respect
of a matter of public policy must be done
on the initiative of a private member? I cannot remember any such instance.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is in order
that Parliament may be seized of the petition.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Parliament
does not need to be seized by meains of a
private bill. A public bill can be introduced
by the Government, which is responsible for
public policy.
So I say this Bill has no public policy
behind it. This is merely an attempt on the
part of the Administration to avoid a declaration of policy. It simply throws its hands in
the air. I shall not try to avoid making a
definite statement, before I sit down, as to
how I think the matter should be handled.
In 1907 Sir Robert Borden, as quoted by
the honourable leader of the Government, said
-I have not been able to attach his words
to the specific subject, but I am ready to
agree that it was the export of powerHon. Mr. DANDURAND: It bore on the
delegation of authority to the Governor in
Council.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: On the general subject of the delegation of authority. I
have no fault to find with Sir Robert
Borden's declaration. He was deprecating the
conduct of Parliament in giving such wide
powers to the Governor in Council, involving
even the determination of policy. In his
speech he referred to an effort being made
to give the Governor in Council power to
determine the effect of a preferential tariff, and
where it should apply and where it should
Sir
not. That is a delegation of policy.
Robert Borden would be quite right in taking
exception. He may have taken exception even
to the delegation to the Governor in Council
of the right to make administrative decisions
incidental to a general statutory authority as
regards the export of power. The reasons he
gave were that when it came to the practical
application of the statute the Governor in
Council, of necessity a partisan body, might
be influenced by party considerations, and that
it was crowded with work. For these two
reasons he felt there should be another body.

220

SENATE

But did he say that the body to assume
the administration of public policy should
be Parliament itself? Every reason Sir Robert
adduced against the delegation to the Governor in Council would apply with multiplied force against a delegation to Parliament.
Is the Governor in Council more partisan
than a majority of Parliament? Not at all.
Is Parliament not occupied with matters political? Of course it is. Sir Robert's argument
would tell, a fortiori, against the course the
Government now contemplates of bringing a
matter of administration into Parliament.
What he argued for in the case before him
was that a more appropriate body to deal
with administration would be the Railway
Commission. If the honourable gentleman
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) had read the next
paragraph he would have seen that. There
is no objection at all to a dclegation to the
Railway Commission or any other commission
established by Parliament. But that is not
what the Administration is doing. It is simply
declaring: "We don't know what to do. We
are in a corner, and we are going to get rid
of the subject by getting out of our own
responsibility."
The leader of the Government calls attention to the debate of 1925. I remember that
debate. It was precipitated by a resolution
of the then member for Lambton, Mr.
LeSueur. After considerable argument pro
and con, an amendment of the then Prime
Minister, was accepted on both sides; and by
the terms of that acceptance I am prepared
to stand now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
in the present Bill.

It is embodied

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, no; not
at all. The resolution as amended provided,
net that the Electricity and Fluid Export
Act should be repealed, but that the powers
vested in the Governor in Council under that
Act should be exercised subject to certain
overriding principles, which were definitely
stated, and that there should be no export
in the future beyond what there was then,
save with the consent of the provinces interested.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
bodied in the Bill.

That is em-

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Very good.
The law, as approved by that resolution,
declared a principle that should be applied
in respect of public policy, and stated what
public policy was, and we said to the Government, "In the execution of your duty in
administering that Act, see that you bave
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

the approval of the provinces before you
grant licences." But the administrative body
to carry out the policy was the Governor in
Council; and to that, though we were in
opposition, we agreed.
Why should it not be the Governor in Council now? It may be that I have more confidence in the Governor in Council than bas
the leader of the Government. I am not
at all unwilling that the Government should
be given its proper functions of administration and be ield responsible for the proper
discharge of those functions.
Not at ail.
The business of Parliament is to lay down
policies, and, if it wishes, to put special restraints on the adiministrators it appoints.
But to say, as this Bill does. "We de not
know what on eartis public policy should be,
and will wait until a special private bill is
presented to us before deciding," is absurd.
Was there ever such a proclamation of infirmity? If the Government is not satisfied
with the policy in respect of the export of
power as declared by our present legislation,
let it say so and propose amendments to
that legislation. If it would rather delegate
to the Board of Railway Commissioners authority to administer the statute, I will take no
exception. But I do protest against an Administration coming into the House and saying:
"Parliament bas laid down a policy,
which it ias entrusted to us to administer.
We have a difficult case before us and we do
not know what on earth to do about it. We
are in doubt as to how to administer the
policy; so we ask Parliament to wipe its statute
out and let us postpone decision as to what our
attitude shall be until a private member's
bill is received." I find that position all the
iarder to understand since the difficult case
which the Government had before it bas gone
up into thin air.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will my right
honourable friend allow me to say that the
difficult case which he visualizes as having
been confronting the Government, and which
I take to mean a case that originated in
Ontario, is not at all the one which led to the
declaration in the Speech from the Throne
that control over these export licences would
be returned to Parliament. That declaration
was elicited by three petitions from Montreal,
from the Montreal Light, Heat and Power
Company, and was not in any way concerned
with the Ontario request, which was made six
months later.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: To my mind
it does not matter a whit where the difficulty
arose, whether in Ontario or Quebec. Faced
with a problem respecting administration of

APRIL 5, 1938
a statute, the Government does not know how
to act and it cornes to Parliament and says:
"Do not entrust us any longer with this
control. We do not know what to do. Take
this responsibility off our backs. When an
individual case arises, let it come to Parliament through the back door, a private member's bill, and then we shall do the best we
can with it."
In 1925 I felt strongly opposed to the
export of any power beyond the quantity
then permitted. At that time the Hydro
Commission of Ontario was exporting, I think,
about 100,000 horsepower a year, and I should
have been ready to support a bill forbidding
entirely any further export. The compromise
as embodied in the resolution of that year
was accepted by me largely in the belief that
the actual result would be the same-that no
additional licences would be granted-for I
did not believe the provinces were in favour
of export.
Any argument which I adduce from now on
is not necessary at all to explain my opposition
to this measure. I am opposed to it because
it is not in accordance with the tradition of
Parliament, the function and responsibility of
Government. It is a defiance of that tradition
and an evasion of that function and responsibility. But I will not refrain from speaking
what I feel about the export of power. There
was, there bas been, and there is to-day, grave
danger in the export of power. It is not like
other commodities. There is not an alternative market from which it can be purchased.
And there is always danger that by exporting
power we may ultimately bring about an
emigration of some of our own people. Export
may lead to conditions under which there
spring up in another country industries which
would have been developed here had power
not been sent abroad. And if you export
power directly to industries or communities
you are in grave danger of bringing about
dependence upon the export, and consequently
there arises a very serious practical difficulty
if it becomes necessary in the interest of
Canada to discontinue exporting because of
need for more power at home.
But there have been developments. There
are to-day gigantic power distributing agencies.
Instead of being exported directly to consumers, power may be delivered to one or
more of those agencies. They may be able to
save money by importing, but they would
have recourse to other sources of current if
their importations were cut off. In that case
there is not the same dependence-and I
have had enough experience to know that that
case can well arise.

221

Even there strictest limitations and safeguards must be provided. It is easier to provide
them to-day than it was fifteen, or even ten,
years ago. The principal reason why it is
easier is that the margin of advantage in developing and distributing hydro power as compared with its competitor, steam power, has
been constantly diminishing. There is still an
advantage in the major area of circumstances.
Where the load factor is high, where power
is used constantly the year round, there
is still an appreciable advantage in favour of
hydro power, though it is not as great as it
was ten, fifteen and twenty years ago. As
this margin of advantage of hydro power over
steam power diminishes, the peril attached to
çxport tends to diminish as well. I do not
argue for a minute that severest safeguards
must not be provided, for they must be.
I am not convinced to-day that there are
not sometimes, and will not be in Canada for a
considerable while, circumstances under which
we could justify a properly safeguarded export
of power. I am not convinced that we could
not improve our present Act and provide by
statute reasonable general safeguards. And personally-I am asking no support from anyone
in this decision-I should not be prepared today, as I was in 1925, to stand four-square
against power exportation under all conditions.
It seems to me that the proper thing to do is
to establish conditions under which export
may be permitted, making them such that
there will be no reasonable fear of international complications when a change of circumstances arises, and to leave further details
to the Administration, or, if the Administration prefers, to the Railway Board.
Then let the thing be worked out, as every
other governmental problem is worked out, by
the appropriate body designated by Parliament to administer the policy embodied in
the statute.
The honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) says we are declaring here conditions
under which a private bill can pass in future.
He knows, just as well as I do, how futile
those conditions are: he knows that they are
only window dressing-just a facade. They
mean nothing whatever.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If a private bill
is presented, will it not have to go before
two committees, one in each of the Houses
of Parliament?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Of course
it will. But what is the sense of our deciding
to-day what legislation will have to be passed
two years from now, or at any other future

222

SENATE

date? We cannot tie the hands of Parliament. We may surround the contemplated
introduction of a private bill with ail the
trimmings we like, and they will go for nothing. If a man comnes forward with a private
bill providing, "Notwithstanding anything in
the Electricity and Fluid Exportation Act,
it is enacted as follows," and succeeds in having
his measure ýpassed, it will not matter what
is in this Act. Conditions change from time
to time, and a year from now it may be necessary to make some restrictions which are not
necessary to-day, or to abandon some upon
which we have to insist to-day. Any attempt
to tie the hands of Parliament for even a
year would be a mere futility. Let us lay
down general principles and guiding restrictions, and provide that if occasion arises,
when the appropriate administrative body
declares it is in t-he in.terest of our country
to permit export, then within those principles
and restrictions and on the basis of this
st:atute we shahl permit it. That is the way
public policy should b declared.
But if anyone is opposed to export of
power ulnder all conditions. he should advocate
rcpeal of thiS Act and a declaration that
there shall be no more export.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
My right
honourable friend says that a future Parliament could change any statute, no matter
xwhat it was.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Certainly.

Riglt Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: If the Railway Board were given certain authority, Parlianent could at any time afterwards take
away that authority or change anything that
the Board had done. The whole thing is in
the hands of Parliament.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That supplements the case I was trying to make. If
we are ondeavouring to determine what shall
be the form of a private bill in the future.
we are just wasting time. Anyone who is
opposed to the export of power and wants
his view confirmed by statute should vote for
a bill repealing the Electricity and Fluid Exportation Act and enacting that there shall
be no expert of power, or at least no
further export. He who believes in exportation under certain conditions should vote for
a measure which sets out those conditions
and commits administration of the law to
an appropriate body. Any person who takes
either of those stands should oppose this Bill.
Support of it can be justified by anyone only
on the ground that he wants to help the
Government out.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
There may
be a difference of opinion about that.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
There may
be two different opinions, but one will be
right and the other wrong.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
That is a
matter of differing opinion again.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
On this
question Parliament bas been right for a
long time.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: But Parliament bas changed its mind several times.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
This is a
new exercise of Parliament. This measure
simply declares that as to exportation of
power we shall do nothing at all except provide what kind of bill ought to be introduced
by a private member in future. when the
hour strikes for a decision to be made.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My right
lonourable friend was not in the other House
in 1929.

Hon. Mi. DANDITRAND:

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. I was
not in the House at that time or that
decision would not bave been unanimous. I
should hiave had exactly the same opposition
to it as I have to-day, no matter how highly
I regard the private member who introduced
that bill. it is very manifest that there is
no polities in this. I do not know whether
the view J am expressing had even a single
supporter in the House of Commons or
whother it will have one here.
But it is
my opinion. That is the way I like to pass
on public problems:
I do not like to run
backwards and forwards and sideways, seeking to put off the hour of decision.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Then my
right honourable friend was rigbt in entering
this Chamber.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I followed the
same principle in the other House. I do not
think I ever had a reputation for dodging
anything.
This measure is nothing but a
sort of high policy of dodging; it is just an
exercise in the art of getting away from an
immediate difficulty-and a rather clumsy
exercise. I do not know what the great difficulty is. Why cannot the Government state
under what conditions it believes power should
be exported? Or, if it does not believe in

223

APRIL 5, 1938
exportation under any conditions, why not
say so and present a bill for complete
abandonment of the policy of exporting
The

power?
trouble should be far removed by now, for I
am unable to see that very much remains
of the difficulty which faced the Government
and impelled it to take this course.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have corrected
my right honourable friend on that point.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That difficulty
is pretty well gone. Whatever other difficulty
remains, why not face it frankly? I have
helped the Government to face it, by stating
general principles which I think should be
followed.
I am against the main provisions of this
Bill, though I am not opposed to export of
power under all conditions, even under some
conditions which cannot properly be designated
as an emergency.
The measure would give 'the Governor in
Council power in certain circumstances. A
private member would not be necessary then:
there would be no need to bring in a private
bill on which the Government could divide
because of inability to agree. These are called
emergency circumstances. But who decides
whether there is an emergency or not? The
Government. If the Government decides an
emergency exists, then for the purposes of this
statute there is one, and the Government
can do what it likes.
In addition to its other infirmities the Bill
is utterly futile. It is a pretence; it really
does not restore power to Parliament at all.
If there were a restoration of power to Parliament, then Parliament should state its new
policy. That would be the correct procedure.
The business of Parliament is not the administration of policy; it is the declaring of policy,
the putting of it into statute form. But here
we have no putting of policy into statute
form. By retaining for the Administration
emergency powers, the same to be determined
by the Government, the Bill becomes just a
pretence. I do not want to intimate that this is
what the Government intends, for I do not
think it has any such intention at all. The
Government's only intention is to postpone the
hour of decision and to provide for having
questions on a matter of important public
policy come before it in such a form that one
member can vote one way and another can vote
differently, according to political exigencies
with which each may be surrounded. That
course I do not favour and cannot support. I
will support sending the Bill to a committee
of this House so that amendments may be proposed for the purpose of having the will of
Parliament declared in this great matter of

principle and policy, and, in line with what
we have always done throughout our history,
leaving administrative features of the Act to
the Governor in Council or the Railway Board
or any body we may care .to establish.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Does my
right honourable friend intimate he is in
favour of the proposal to provide in this
Bill that when the becasion arises the Government may refer the matter to the Railway
Commission?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, no. If
the Government would prefer that administration of the statute should be delegated, I
would not object on the score that it is
delegated to the Railway Commission instead
of being exercised by the Governor in Council. But my confidence in the Government
is not so meagre nor so destitute of reality
that I would shrink from the Bill if it
entrusted administration to the Governor in
Council. While the Government is constitutionally in office, that is its duty and its
function, unless it feels the burden of the
details to be so great that the administration of the Act should go ta sema other
permanent body established by Parliament.
What I say is that the function of Parliament is clear in this as in all matters of
public policy: declare your course, put it
into a statute, hem that statute about with
whatever restrictions you like, and then
commit to the body of your choice the
administration of the will of Parliament.
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: Honourable
members, as recently as last Monday I was
informed by a gentleman whom I regard as
one of the greatest authorities on the generation of electric power that to-day you can
produce as much current with one ton of
coal as you could have produced ten years
ago with three tons. This has an important
bearing on the cost of production as between
power and hydro-electrie
steam-generated
power.
As my honourable friend from Rigaud
(Hon. Mr. Sauvé) will doubtless rememberhe was then leading the Opposition in the
Legislature-the Quebec Government some
years ago arranged to export 300,000 horsepower-100,000 to be contributed by the
Beauharnois Company, another 100,000 by
the Shawinigan Company, and the remaining
100,000 by the Montreal Light, Heat and
Power Company.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE:

I was not there.

My honourable
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
friend was there a long time.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE:

In opposition.

224

SENATE

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
Those power
companies were supposed to have that amount
of electric energy for sale; but it was not
exported. No inquiry was made, but the
reason why the power was not exported is
obvious. Right at Massena Springs, in New
York State, and also at Niagara, on the
American side, the generating companies have
surplus power that they cannot give away. I
furnished the House with the exact figures
on a former occasion.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Where is the power
generated that they cannot give away?
Hon Mr. CASGRAIN: At Massena Springs,
in New York State, and also at Niagara
Falls in the same state. Whether the lack
of demand for power is due te the depression
or not I cannot say, but in both places there
is surplus power going abegging.
Now, some persons entertain the idea that
hydro-electric power costs nothing.
They
would be quickly disillusioned if thcy started
to build a generating :plant. Suppose they
issued $300.000 worth of bonds. They would
find it would cost at least 75 per cent of the
procceds to install their plant. A similar
installation to generate electric power by
steam would only cost between 40 and 45
per cent of that bond issue. There is a big
difference to start with, the hydro-electric
plant costing nearly double the expenditure
ncessary on the stcam plant. Then in connection with the hydro-electric plant you
have to pay a royalty on the water-power.
Mr. Duplessis bas stated that on every horsepower generated in Quebec, whether it be
exported or not, $1.50 a year must be .paid
to the province by way of royalty.
I admit that once you export power you
can say goodbye to it, because if that power
is uscd for lighting a town or city, or running
a street-railway or any other public utility,
it would be an unfriendly act to cut off the
current. For example, during the last war
Switzerland permitted the exportation of electric power, but when that power was required
for the use of Swiss industry the Government
found it would be impolitic to discontinue
the exportation.
To my m'ind we are wasting a good deal
of useful time in discussing this Bill, for
undoubtedly we cannot at the present time
sell any power to the United States. In
New York State there are four or five big
companies manufacturing electrie energy by
steam, and they can generate it at a cost
much cheaper than the price at which we
tan afford to export our hydro-electric power.
Hon. Mr. SAUVE.

I have just read a book, issued by an
organization subsidized by the Rockefeller
Foundýation, in which it is stated that the cost
of each horse-power of electrie energy rises
$1.50 every additional hundred miles to take
care of the laying of cables and the transmission losses. I know of a company that
undertook to bring 100,000 horse-power from
Quebec at a cost of $4,500,000, but the ultimate figure relached a total of $6,000,000. As
I have said, there is the heavy cost of building the line and the increasing transmission
losses on every added hundred miles. On
the contrary, with steam-generated power you
need no transmission line, and of course you
have no transmission losses. Another advantage of steam-generated power is that in case
of a strike you simply shut down your plant;
but you have to operate your hydro-electric
plant twelve months in the year.
It is apparent that there are several advantages in steam-generated power as against
hydro-electric power. I do not wish to be
disrespectful, but to my mind this Bill, if
enacted, will have no more effect than a
mustard plaster on a wooden leg. I cannot
see that it will do any good; but I admit
it will do no harm. And there is something
to bc said in favour of taking an innocuous
medicine, rather than a dangerous specific
such as the cancer serum which during the
last week has produced fatal results to patients
in the United States to whom it was administered. I repeat, I do not think this Bill
can do any harm, and I wonder why the right
honourable gentleman opposite (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen) waxes so eloquent and worries
se much over it. I suspect he was doing it
more for fun than anything else.
If electric power is to be expor-ted, I think
it is a verv good idea that permission to
export it should be secured by a private
Bill. Subseetdon 2 of section 6 reads:
With every petition for a private Art to
authorize the exportation of power there shall
bc deposited a duly certified copy of an order
of the Lieutenant Governor in Council of the
province in which the power proposed to be
exported is generated declaring that the said
power is not required for use in the said
province and that the Lieutenant Governor in
Council makes no objection to the exportation
thereof.
I would ask honourable members to bear
in mind that the Lieutenant Governor of a
province is an officer of this Parliament. If
he signs an Order in Couneil the Provincial
Government cannot find fault with that order.
It may be told, "You have asked for it, and
now you have it." That is all. It is very
simple. I do not see any reason why we
should worry further about this Bill.

APRIL 5,1938
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
If no other
honourable members desire to intervene, 1
will close the debate.
The oniy point of difference hetween my
rigbt honourable friend and me is as to the
main reason for this Bill. I think he was
somewhat unjust to, the present Goverment
in aileging that it presented the measure to
Pýarliament because it hesitated or disliked to
take the responsibility whic'h is vested in it
under the present statute dealing with the
axportation of electric power. I know my
right honourable friend is very busy, perhaps more su than I am, and he may flot
have read the debate in the other buse.
I mu'st confess that since I had to bring the
Bill before this Chamber I devoted several
htours to a perusal of that debate. I would
draw his attention to this fact, that in 1928
the StewartRight Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN:

In 1929.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
In 1928 first.
In that year the Stewart Bill was given
second reading unanimously in the House
of Commons.
In 1929 it was given first,
second and third reading unanimously. I arn
aware that my right honourable friend was
not there at the time, but the Communs
then decided that control should be vested
in Parliament. That is the guiding princîple
which the Prime Minister bas had to take
notice of since 1929.
When, prior to his
departure for Europe in April last, the Montreal Light, Heat and Power Company presented a petitition-it was renewed during his
absence, while I was acting for him-a considerable effort was macle, because of the
pressing nature of the business, to, obtain a
licence. What did the Prime Minister answer? He said, "I arn bound by the statement I macle last year"ý-that is, 1936-"in
the House of Commons."
In that speech
he stated that he feit bound by the unanimous will of the House of Commons as expressedc in 1929, and cited a similar declaration by the Minister of Trade and Commerce. And he declined to grant the application of the Montrent interests, stating he
woulcl have to submit it tu Parliament. Under
what form? Under the very form which
the bouse of Commons had approved of-the
sanction of Parliament.
The Stewart Bill
clid nut indicate in precise terms how that
sanction should be given, whether by resolution or by private Bill. A long discussion
took place in the other House about the
difference between a private Bill and a publie
Bill presented by a private member; but
no one contested the authority of the Stewart
Bill of 1929, by which the Low-er Chamber

declared itself in favour of approval by Parliament.
Why did the buse of Commons favour a
private Bill? It would take a considerable
time for me to read to honourable members
the debate on this question in the other
buse and the opinion of Mr. Eclwards, the
Deputy Minister of Justice, whieh wus cited
in that debate. The Commons said, in effect,
"We favour a private Bill, because we lay
clown the principle that no expurt of power
shahl take place without the approval of
Parhiament." And that is the principle underlying both the Stewart Bill and this Bill.
Now, that is a general law embodying a
certain policy, just as we have other statutes
governing administration.
But that general
law can be varied by a private Bill, and it
may be su varied under certain conclitions.
For instance, in railway matters the Railway
Act lays down certain general principles, and
petitions are presented to Parliament in support of private bills emboclying powers varying such principles.
But my right honourable friend says that
other conditions may be embodied in the Bill
varying even this clause 4, ancl Parliament
wuulcl be supreme.
Certainly Parliament;
woulcl be supreme. But I see the advantage
of the Bill in dealing with this important
question which divicles public opinion to-day.
We can realize it when we histen to my right
honourable friend; for, without cloubt, as
there are those who favour, su there are
others who are absolutehy against, export of
power. It will be for Parliament to dEcicle
each specific case as it is presented, but
Parliament says uncler this Bill that each
province interestecl shahl pass an Order in
Council in support of the petition for a
private Act.
Section 4 of the Bill provicles:
(1) Except as otherwise pruvided in this Act
nu person shall export any power unless expressly authorized to do so by a private Act
of Parliament, or otherwise than in accordance
with the terms and conditions containeci in
such private Act.
(2) With every petition for a private Act
to authorize the exportation of power there
shaîl be deposited a duly certified copy of an
order of the Lieutenant Governor in Council
of the province in which the power proposed
to be exported is generated declaring that the
said power is not required for use in the said
province and that the Lieutenant Governor in
Council makes no objection to the exportation
thereof.
(3) Similarly, if the power is proposed to
be exported frum a province other than that
in which the same is generated there shaîl also
be deposited with the petition a duly certified
copy of an order of the Lieutenant Governor in

Hon. Mr. DUFF: If consideration is to be

my honourable friend would be good enough
to consider the proposal I am now going to
make. I am ready to proceed at once to
liscuss one of the amendments made by the

to Nova Scotia. I would ask whether this
matter can be put over until the Senate resumes later on?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I mray say the request
for postponement comes by reason of the
fact that the Department of Justice wants to
be sure that this measure will not interfere with
international law.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: That is the point I want
to bring up.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
senators, it bas been represented to the
Government that a certain part of this Bill
infringes upon the rights of nations that have
joined with Canada in the Berne Convention.
The suggestion has been made that the Bill
be suspended for a time in order that the
Department of External Affairs and the
Department of Justice may examine into the
situation. I hope to have some information
on the subject by Thursday. If I have not,
I shall then move that consideration be postponed until after the recess.
Consideration of the report was postponed.

ONTARIO AND QUEBEC CONTRIBUTIONS TO DROUGHT RELIEF
INQUIRY

On the notice by Hon. Mr. Casgrain:
That he will inquire of the Government:
1. What proportion will Ontario and Quebec
pay of the twenty-seven millions odd in the
estimates of this year for the drought in the
Northwest?
2. What will be the amount contributed by
Ontario?
3. What will be the amount contributed by
Quebec?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have the following answer for the honourable gentleman:
The questions which the honourable senator
asks should be dropped. It is impossible to

51958-15*

tell what sums have been derived from the
provinces of Ontario and Quebec in the fiscal
year ended March 31, 1938. It is possible
to ascertain sums collected at the customs
houses and income tax offices in each province.
Obviously, however. imports at cities like
Montreal. Quebec, Saint John, Halifax, or
other cities at the seaboard do not always
show their destinations.
Questions along
this line which have been asked in times
past have not produced results. The Dominion
Bureau of Statistics has not been able to get
the information. It is not a question which
the Government could accurately answer, and
an inaccurate answer would be worse than
none at all.
It would also be as difficult to compute
what return from that expenditure would be
received by Ontario and Quebec, in the
millions of dollars accruing to their manufacturing industries and commercial businesses,
if the Western Provinces were blessed with
a good crop this coming season.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Does the
honourable gentleman style a request to drop
a question an. answer to it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The impossibility of answering means necessarily the dropping of the question.

Hon. F. B. BLACK moved concurrence

amend the Lord's Day Act.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, this Bill as amended is completely

Committee has deemed it proper to transfer
responsibility for violation of the Act from
directors and officers of a corporation to the
corporation itself; and for the penalty of
imprisonment has substituted fines on a very
iuch increased scale.
The amendment will occasion surprise in
certain parts of the country where corporations, convicted of violations of the law, have
paid the fines imposed and then continued to
violate the law. I thought it would perhaps
have been advisable to try te reach the representative of the corporation who had given
the order to work on a Sunday, but the committee has decided otherwise, and I bow to
its decision.
The motion was agreed te.

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I take no exception to the
account which the honourable leader of the
House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) has given of
what transpired in committee, but as this
Bill will now go back to the House of Commons amended in most important respects,
indeed transformed almost into another Bill,
I feel the viewpoint of those responsible for so
transforming it should be put upon our records
in order that it may reach the House of
Commons.
As the honourable leader of the House has
said, the Bill as it reached us sought to amend
the Act by providing additional penalties by
way of imprisonment for violation of the
law by any director, officer, superintendent,
foreman, or other employee of a corporation, whose orders other employees were
by the conditions of their employment bound
to obey. With that proposed amendment the
Bill, I understand, passed the House of Commons unanimously.
One has only to state the effect of a law
of that kind to make very obvious the impossibility of any assembly after due consideration accepting it. Companies at the
present time are in many cases operating at
a number of points throughout the country.
There is no occasion to name certain companies to make plain what honourable members already know, that a corporation may
operate three, four or five plants in Quebec,
as many more in Ontario, and perhaps another
in Manitoba. In the practical operation of
any company dealing with perishable commodities, or using exceedingly delicate machinery which may get out of repair at any
time, the directors cannot meet and decide
what is to be done in each case. An
emergency may have arisen five hundred
miles from where they meet, and perhaps there
is no possibility of their meeting to deal with
it. Consequently the company must have a
policy, and it commits to its managers or
superintendents at its various plants the
responsibility of deciding whether or not,
at a particular point, it is necessary to continue a plant in operation on Sunday. The
manager may not be at the point where this
Sunday work has to be done; he may be at a
distance from it; consequently he in turn may
have to commit to another the responsibility
for the decision. Under the Bill as it passed
the Commons, each of these officers would be
liable to a jail term if he did not decide rightly
under the law; and he might have only five
minutes in which to decide.
As was impressed on this House by the
honourable member from Wentworth (Hon.

APRIL 6,1938
Mr. Smith), the result would be that this
responsibility-if I may use the term-would
not be assumed by the employee. It would
be most unjust to ask him to assume it. He
uses his best judgment. If lie did not exercise
good judgment his position with the company would be imperilled, but exercising it
as best he can might leave him liable to a
jail term. This is somewhat unconscionable.
It seemed to me unfair-and I think this
vipw was shared by nearly all the members
of the committee-that the employee who
initially gave the order, or even a subforeman, should be liable to a fine. If lie
makes a mistake to the prejudice of the
company lie is going to suffer anyway. But
he does not profit by the operation of the
plant on Sunday; the organized company is
the beneficiary. Therefore it is the organized
company which should suffer.
There is of course no way of making a
company suffer except by a fine. It was represented to the committee that the fines had
been too smali, and that in certain districts
of Quebec-from which alone representations
came-companies had satisfied their consciences by paying the fines and had then
proceeded again to defy the law. I do not
question for a moment the good faith of
those who made those representations. Let
us assume there is no misunderstanding on
that phase of the question as respects the
past. Obviously, however, companies will not
defy the law if the fines are heavy enough.
So the committee decided that the best and
indeed the only thing to do was to make a
very substantial increase in the maximum
fines. I think it was said before the committee that in the past even the lower maximum had never been imposed. If that is so,
it merely shows that the magistrates, judges
or justices who heard the cases felt there were
extenuating circumstances sufficient to justify
their imposing less than this maximum. We

could not possibly assume that the magistrates
or judges did not do their duty. The committee felt the right thing was to give them
power to impose a maximum penalty up to

$2.000 a day. For myself, I should not have
objected to a higher maximum; but the
large body of the committee agreed the fines
should be as stated in the report. and it passed
by a considerable majority. Indeed, I never
before appreciated so highly the loyalty of the
leader of this House to the Government as

when I heard his lonely voice in opposition.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK:
Honourable
senators, I was unable to be present when
this question was before the committee, and
therefore I shall not vote against the third
reading of the Bill as amended, though I

regard the amendment as merely a wooden
gun with which to do some hunting. I think
it is absolutely useless for the purpose of
accomplishing what all honourable members
of the committee desire, that is, to prevent
unnecessary work on Sunday, which has prevailed in certain parts of the country. The
right honourable gentleman who has just taken
his seat said two or three times in the course
of his remarks, as I think I noted, that the
company suffers.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I said it
would be the company that would profit by
the operation.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: And I think you
will find that you said the company suffers
if a fine is imposed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Should suffer.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Let us read this
provision. There is nothing here about companies so far as I can sec. It says " every
corporation."
Is it possible that some
individual carrying on a lumbering business
in his own name and with his own money is
a corporation? If so, my education has been
wrong, and if the opinion expressed by the
right honourable leader carries great weight,
as I am sure it does, why could not this
amendment have read, "Every corporation or
company which authorizes"?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: The company is incorporated.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: "Company or person."
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: There are many
things I do not know about it. To me it
seems absolutely useless because of the word
" corporation.
Then let me come to the most important
point. Will someone please describe to me
the red tape or expense incident to prosecution by workmen under this Act? They are
dependent on their little jobs for their homes
and futures, as well as for a hundred and one
other things, while the presumably we-althcorporation is sitting back smiling and entirely

ignoring the Lord's Day Act.
Violation of the law in this Canada of ours
is responsible for the death or the disablement
of hundreds, yes, of thousands of Canadian
people. What do I mean? We have on our
Statute Book an automobile law which one
and all, possibly even honourable members of
this House, are guilty of skimming by at
times in order to get away from it and the
obligations imposed by it. Democracy teaches
us that we are in charge. Someone has said
that only a dictatorship would prevent the in-

SENATE

230

fringement of the law. We read from time to
time that in Russia railroadmen who make a
serious mistake are shot. That method should
certainly prevent serious mistakes. It seems to
me that every time an important measure
comes up here which contemplates the protection of the less fortunate members of Canada's
society we devote our enýtire attention to
deciding whether we may not be doing an injustice to somebody higher up in the Canadian
social scale. Personally I think it is wrong. I
think this provision is entirely useless, and
simply ainounts to the hunting of violators of
the Lord's Day Act wiýth a wooden gun; but I
am not going te vote against the third reading.
Hon. CHARLES BOURGEOIS: Honourable members of the Senate, I concur entirely
in what bas already been said by the honourable the leader on this side (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand). The experience I have had in
my own constituency of Shawinigan leads me
to believe that the passing of this Bill as
originally worded is most opportune, because

the law concerning the observance of the

deplorable state of things is a lack of sanction
in tie law as it now stands, and as it will
continue to stand should the recommendation
of the conmittee be adopted.
Many companies find it more advantageous
to violate the liw than to comply with it.
Honourable
Mr. Justice Edouard Fabre
Surveyer, President of the Quebec Sunday
Observance League, who is also a prominent
professor in McGill University, in a brief
which was read before the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, gave very
illuminating evidence to show that the big
companies would rather pay fines, even large
ones, than comply with the law. I quote from
the memorandum of Honourable Mr. Justice
Surveyer. He said:
On Tuesday, before I left Montreal, ee of
the last things I read was a judgment of the
Suprense Court of Canada disposing finally of
a prosecution nider that clause, which iad
dragged for exactly twnity-tlsree montlss froin
a magistrate having the power of two justices
of the peace to the highest tribunal in thsis
country. Althoughs the company did not find
throughout this litigation a single judge ready
to accept its point of view, which, althosugh,
in my humble opinion, untenable, was presented
by an undisputed leader of the Bar, the company persisted in figbting to the end; and I
dare say that, from a business standpoint, it
w as a good course to follow.
And further, at page 5:

from His Excellency the Bishop of Three
Rivers. You cannot deny, honourable members, that His Excellency is aware of the
situation, he being entrusted with the preservation of the morals of the people. He says:
We are informed by the newspapers that
the Brunelle Bill, respecting the keeping of
the Lord's Day, bas been sent te the Senate,
after having been unhappily amended in the
Commons.
I think it might be proper to direct your
attention to the aforesaid Bill, which is of
special importance to our district, for the
repeated infractions of the present law by our

extinction of our people's religious feeling.

Experience lias proved the sanctions, as now
provided by the law, te be of no effect; and it
is reasonable te think that imprisonsent alone
is likely to curb " big business," which is so

cynically transgressing the law, much to the
scandal of the young.
After these 'two documents I read the
opinion of the highest civil authority in this
country, the Minister of Justice. On February
25 he said:
Tlere is no doubt that in the province of
Quebec-I tIo not know whethser it is the same
in the other provinces-tlhis law bas not been
observed by certain big corporations as well
as it should iave been, and labour unions have
been protesting strongly against violations of
the law and asking that some amendiment

should be made. When proceedings are taken
in the courts against offenders-and it is the
attorney-geineral of the province who ias to
authorize the issuing of proceedings before
the courts-a corporation, when it is fined,
pays the fine, and that is all tiere is te it.
Moreover, the members of the House of
Commons have unanimously recognized that

APRIL 6, 1938
infringements of the Lord's Day Act have
occurred because penalties were not severe
enough. Experience has proved fines to bo
of no effect.
Honourable senators, there are many kinds
of bad legislation, but the worst, perhaps,
is that which, because of lack of sanction,
results in bringing ridicule upon legislatures
and contempt upon the law. It is far better
not to adopt a law at all than to accept it
without proper provisions for its enforcement.
The purpose of the Bill as it came to us from
another place is precisely to provide measures
for the enforcement of a law which, though
good in principle, has up to the present
remained unenforced.
With respect to this Bill there are, I submit,
two points whieh we must consider. In the
first place, a most important duty has been
imposed upon all Christians to forbear, on
the Lord's Day, from executing or performing
any servile work which can be postponed
te another day. I believe there is no hesitancy
on the part of those who belong to either
the Catholie or the Protestant church in
acknowledging the necessity of a law to compel
workers in general, whether they be employed
in trades or in industries, to observe the
commandiment which, according to the Holy
Scriptures, God gave to man, namely, to
abstain from work on the Lord's Day. This
country is composed of people of various
religious creeds which differ on many points,
but agree on the existence of man's duty
to keep this commandment, except in certain
well-defined circumstances.
The exceptions
imply that man would suffer too seriously
if he had to comply with it in all circumstances, and that the Supreme Lawg.iver does
not intend that His creatures should obey it
at the risk of very severe suffering.
Religious
writers, moralists and
even
economists assert that a rest is necessary te
man on the seventh day, for the sake of his
mental and physical nature. So it may be
contended with some force that the Lord's
Day Act not only embodies the Divine law
in our statutes, but also conforms with the
law of nature.
Without entering into a lengthy examination of the reasons which might be invoked
in favour of the original measure, I submit
that it meets with the approval of the
majority of our citizens. That submission
is quite logical, since, as I have said, all
the members of the House of Commons voted
in favour of the Bill which we received.
It cannot be denied that several difficulties
are raised by the provisions of the Bill, but
that fact cannot constitute a sufficient reason

231

for our refusing to pass it. We should
endeavour to solve those difficulties, bearing
in mind the main principle embodied in the
measure, as well as the necessity of applying
that principle without infringing upon justice
and unnecessarily handicapping our industries
and trades. Surely the Bill cannot be qualified as drastie if its twenty-four exemptions
are considered. The main difficulty seems to
lie in the responsibility placed upon the
shoulders of the directors of a corporation
when work is carried on in violation of the
statute.
But let me remind honourable senators that
under the federal and provincial laws regulating the organization and functioning of corporations the activity of a corporation is
mainly under the control of its directors.
There is no doubt that without the assent,
either explicit or implied, of the board of
directors, no superintendent, officer or agent
of a corporation can work in its establishment on Sunday, or compel any employee or
workman to work. So the directors of a -corporation have at their disposal a very simple
but effective means of insuring compliance
with the original Bill if it becomes law: that
is, to pass by-laws or resolutions enacting that
their establishment shall be closed on Sundays. Then they should appoint officers or
agents to see that these by-laws or resolutions
are enforced. It is not easy, indeed it is
almost impossible, to imagine such a state of
affairs in a corporation's establishment that
ordinary employees or workmen would work
on Sunday in violation of an explicit prohibition contained in the by-laws or resolutions of the board of directors, and that
superintendents, officers and agents would
permit this.
This Bill is by its nature penal. Anyone
acquainted with penal laws, whether federal
or provincial, may have observed that there is
virtually only one way of enforcing them and
making thein really effective; that is to have
them provide for presumption of guilt, which
may be rebutted by the defendant. This
presumption is sometimes called prima facie
evidence. The only way in law whereby the
defendant can escape the consequences of
that presumption is to produce sufficient
evidence to destroy it. Some of the provisions of this statute create against the defendant such a prima facie case. In other words,
if the evidence shows that work was done on
a corporation's premises on Sunday by a
superintendent, employees, agents or ordinary
workmen, the onus probandi, or burden of
proof, lies upon the directors. They would
be required to show either that the work so
performed fell within the exemptions enumer-

232

SENATE

ated in the Act, or that the board of directors
had previously adopted by-laws or resolutions
prohibiting such work on Sunday.
When a law is enacted it is impossible to
foresee all the difficulties which the courts
may encounter in applying it to particular
cases. It is the duty of the judiciary in deciding cases submitted to them to interpret
and apply the laws, and to make up for
obscurities and deficiencies therein by holding
in accordance with the principles governing
the interpretation of statutes.
Undoubtedly the original Bill, making directors of a corporation liable in circumstances
other than those covered by exemptions in
the statute, embodied a principle of justice
which may be stated as follows: He should
be held liable to the penalty who had the
power to act and did not act.
It is obvious to everybody that under our
laws governing corporations and companies
the ordinary shareholder is in a state of
complete impotency as regards any infringement of the laws by the directors. After casting his vote at the time of the election of
the board, his power of action in the business
of the company, in the management of either
its internal or its external affairs, is paralysed
or exhausted. If we refer to the jurisprudence
of our courts we find it is very seldom that he
may interfere in matters which the law places
under the control of directors. And I must
add that in most cases if the shareholder had
the legal right to interfere it would be useless to him, because of the expense involved
in exercising it.
At all events, any penalty which stops
short of the imprisonment of the directorsany penalty which is merely pecuniary,
whether it be imposed on the corporation's
assets or on the directors or shareholderswill not produce results. If infringement involves nothing more than a pecuniary loss, if
there is no restraint brought about by fear of
being jailed, directors will readily infringe
the law. And in my opinion there is no force
in the argument that imposition of a penalty
under this Bill would be tantamount to punishment of one individual for an offence committed by another, for I have already shown
that under our system of corporation law
prohibited work cannot be done unless it Las
been authorized or ordered by the directors.
I do not minimize the strength of the argument which points out the cruelty of placing
upon the ordinary employee, the subordinate,
the alternative of refusing to obey an order
of Lis superior and thereby exposing himself
t. the risk of losing bis position, or of cornplying with the order and thereby becoming
subject to the penalty. Every penal law,
Hon. Mr. BOURGEOIS.

however carefully worded, will, under certain
conditions, have apparently severe consequences in some respects. We must restrict
ourselves to consideration of the principle
embodied in proposed legislation. If the
principle be in itself conducive to the welfare
of the community, we should adopt it and
leave to the wisdom of our judges the task of
applying it to each particular case, and, in
so doing, of interpreting it judiciously, that
is, in the light of all the circumstances which
may modify its application.
In these remarks I have demonstrated, it
seems to me, that the Bill which was drafted
in the other House safeguarded equally the
principles of law and the rules of equity.
Consequently I feel it my duty to move
that the revised Bill now before us be not
read a third time, but that it be amended on
page 1, line 15, by striking out the words
substituted by the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce and restoring thereto
the words struck out by that committee.
This is seconded by my honourable colleague
from Essex (Hon. Mr. Lacasse).
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I have the greatest respect and admiration for the honourable senator from
Shawinigan (Hon. Mr. Bourgeois). I realize
that he Las a very brilliant legal mind, but
I must say that I have never listened to a
more confused statement in regard to the
problem now before this House than he Las
just delivered.
I have been connected with large corporations all my life. According to the honourable
senator, they are more or less an aggregation
of men desirous of breaking the Sabbath Day.
Why he should come to such a conclusion as
that, I am at a loss to understand. The men
who manage these large corporations are of
very higb standing: they have just as much
regard for the Lord's Day as any other citizens
of Canada. Why should a large corporation
be so desirous of effecting repairs on Sunday
as the honourable member endeavours to
convince this Ho'use it is? From my experience in large corporations I can say that we
are always very reluctant to have any Sunday
work done, and it would be ordered only in
case of emergency. The honourable senator
must understand that if repairs are made on
Sunday the cost is a great deal higher than
for similar work done on week days. You
would have to pay from one and a half to
double the regular rate in order to get men
to work on Sunday. The honourable gentleman cornes from a large industrial centre.

I repeat what I said a moment ago: this
supporting this Bill where the complaints
originated. Are such complaints general? Do seems to me to be a tempest in a teapot and

entering another depression, we are not doing
a good service to the working men of the

whether intended or not, on those who have
put their money, their brains, and their time
into the great industries of this country of
which we are all so proud.
Hon. G. GORDON: Honourable members,
it appears to me that when the honourable
senator from Shawinigan (Hon. Mr. Bourgeois)
addressed us he was dealing with the Lord's
Day Act; and had he been criticizing that
legislation I should be inclined to support
him. But the Bill as amended by the Banking and Commerce Committee raises the maximum penalty to S2,000 a day, and should be
satisfactory to him. I should like to know
what company in Quebec, Ontario, or any
other province, could pay a penalty of $2,000
a day and continue very long in business.
I
think the
honourable
gentleman's
enthusiasm to have the Lord's Day respected
has led him to some rather peculiar conclusions. In committee the other day he said
that to a certain company-I am not sure
that it was located at Three Rivers, but I
assume so-it was worth $15,000 a day to run
its factory on Sunday. Let me repeat what
I said at that time: if it was worth $15,000
to operate the factory every day of the week,
it would manifestly be worth while to keep
it in operation every day of the year. If we
multiply $15,000 by 365, we get a return for
the year of nearly $5,500,000. I hope we have
companies in Canada making money on that
large scale-but I doubt it.
I do not take off my hat to any person, in
this House or outside, as to due observance
of the Sabbath.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. GORDON: Though a comparatively small employer of labour, I have never,
except in an extreme emergency, asked a man
to work on Sunday, and I have never worked
myself on that day. I hope to see everyone
trying his best to observe the Sabbath.
I think this Bill was sent over to us from
another place for the purpose of having us
amend it properly. If we restored the Bill to
its original form, and it became law, then I
think unparalleled harm and injury would
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

result to many respectable working men, for
undioubtedly occasions would arise when
through no . fault of their own they would
be compelled to violate the law and thus
unwillingly render themselves liable to imprisonment. I submit that the Bill as now
amended will effectually deter any decent
company from operating on the Sabbath. I
am glad to say that the directorates and
managers of the majority of the companies
with whose operations I am familiar are
men who would consiýder it a disgrace to be
fined even the minimum amount, and certainly they would not tolerate any infraction
of the law just because by doing so and paying
fines they could make a little more money
for their company.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Am I right in
assuming that it is not proposed to increase
the fine at all for a first offence?
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I think the fine for
the first offence is the same as in the original
Act.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: And for the second
and third offences the maximum fines are
$1,000 and $2,000, but the minimum fines are
$100 and $200?
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Yes.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable members, I must confess I have some difficulty
in understanding the differences between us.
I am not sure of my ground at all, because I
am not a member of the Banking and Commerce Committee and did not hear tihe Bill
discussed in committee.
There are two kinds of work spoken of:
everyday and emergency. As I listened to
my honourable friend across the way (Hon.
Mr. Bourgeois) I could net but think he was
complaining that the company to which he
referred carried on ordinary work on Sunday.
Well, if throughout Canada all sorts of companies are carrying on ordinary work on Sunday, then the practice should be stopped.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I do not want to
interrupt the honourable gentleman, but may
I remind him that certain industries, such,
for example, as sugar refineries, have to operate
continuously.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That is not ordinary
work. I recall what was said by my honourable friend to the left (Hon. Mr. Smith)
with respect to the canning industry. The
work is carried on every weekday, and yet
a condition may arise that makes it necessary to can fruit and vegetables on Sunday.
I am not speaking of such industries. I am
dealing with Sunday work in lumber mills,

APRIL 6,1938
steel plants, and similar industries. I say that
if work which is done on Sunday is not
emergency work in any sense of the term,
Parliament should stop it.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: On the other hand,
if we are dealing with emergency work, I
think the argument of the right honourable
gentleman who sits to my left (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen) is absolutely sound. Emergencies in business arise all over the country,
and I think Parliament would be going too
far in imposing penalties on directors or
individuals for dealing with those emergencies
on Sunday. So if in this Bill we are dealing
with such emergency situations, I have no
hesitation as to how I shall vote.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I suppose you
would not put out a fire on Sunday, for
instance.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I would.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Could you go
to work and put out a fire on Sunday?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I would try to.
Hon. Mr. 'CASGRAIN: There are many
industries which 'call for a continuous process. Sugar refining is one, and the making
of cement is another. As the honourable
gentleman knows, in the manufacture of
cement operations cannot be stopped on Sunday, because the machinery would cool off
and days would be wasted in getting started
again. It takes twenty-four hours to raise
steam on an ordinary man-of-war, and if it
is done in twelve hours the ship will be
endangered. A man did it once, and was
fired from the naval service for doing it.
Sugar refining and the manufacture of
cement are only two instances. There must
be many others in which operations must
be continuous. If anybody can tell me how
this necessity can be avoided, I should like
to know the way. I do not see anybody
getting up to tell me how it can be done,
even the honourable member from Shawinigan (Hon. Mr. Bourgeois); so there must
be some reason for carrying on a continuous process. The manufacture of nickel at
Sudbury, for instance, is a continuous process
which cannot be stopped.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Question!
Hon. P. E. BLONDIN: Honourable senators. this proposed amendment takes me
somewhat by surprise; I did not expect it;

and I do not want to cast a silent vote

upon it. Having had some experience, and
a personal connection, with companies at
St. Maurice, Shawinigan and Three Rivers,

I may say that I have the greatest respect
for the directors of the companies there,
and the men in direct charge of the work.
I think I am in a position to appreciate
what those companies have meant to the
people in the neighbourhoods surrounding
them, and to the whole province of Quebec.
I cannot imagine any case in which Sunday
operations have been carried on by those
companies unless there was dire necessity.
If we were discussing what penalties should
be imposed upon people of criminal intent,
or people who openly flaunt the law without
reason, I should be of the opinion of the
poet:
Il faut des châtiments dont l'univers
frémisse.
Qu'on tremble en comparant l'offense
et le supplice.
But we are dealing with companies composed of prominent and respectable men, and
not with any one case in which they are
charged with infringing the law without necessity.
For this reason-and I could give many
others-I shal. certainly vote against the
amendment. In my opinion the fines imposed are under all the circumstances quite
sufficient.
Hon. L. COTE: Honourable senators, I
would move a sub-amendment. It was proposed and carried in committee when we
were considering the original Bill; and, should
the main amendment carry, this should certainly go with it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Will the
honourable gentleman permit me? I rise to
a point of order. I do not think the amendment is in order. Personally I would rather
have it voted on, because I do not like an
amendment to be ruled out on anything
approaching a technicality. Nevertheless we
must have some regard to principles and rules.
The House has adopted the report of the
committee, which made a specific and definite
amendment to the Bill. Now, on the motion
for third reading, an amendment is moved that
would exactly reverse the action of the
committee, which has been approved by the
House. I submit that such an amendment
cannot be made on the third reading.
Hon. Mr. COTE: The right honourable
gentleman is not referring to the sub-amendment. If the amendment is in order, the subamendment would be in order too.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I am almost
positive that on several occasions in this
House an amendment has been made on the
third reading in terms somewhat like the
terms of the amendment now before us.

23b

SENATE

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: An amendment may be made on the motion for third
reading, but the House cannot on third reading
directly reverse a decision previously arrived
at by the adoption of a report.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators, I
think the point of order is well taken, but
I submit that the honourable member (Hon.
Mr. Bourgeois) would be in order if he moved
that the Bill be not now read a third time,
but be referred back to the committee. If
His Honour the Speaker intends to rule out
the amendment, I suggest that the honourable
member move that the Bill be referred back
to the committee for further consideration.
Hon.
Mr.
BOURGEOIS:
Honourable
senators, I cannot see any reason why the
motion in amendment should be made in the
way suggested by my honourable colleague the
junior member from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Haig). There is no doubt that an amendment
can be moved on the motion for the third
reading, and I see no reason why this amendment should not be made in the way in which
I have made it. If the question is referred
back to the committee, its decision, I presume,
will be the same as before. I want to get the
opinion of the House, and I have no other
way of doing so than to move an amendment
in tice form of the one now before us.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: I am not clear
on this procedure.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Nobody is.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: It is generally
understood, I think, that a report from a
committee is usually adopted as a matter of
course. It is not like a message from the
House of Commons. If the contention of the
right honourable gentleman (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) is correct. I cannot see whv, as we
have already adopted the report, the remedy
suggested by the honourable the junior senator
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) would not
be as contradictory as the amendment
proposed. Having adopted the report, can
we send it back to the committee?
Hon. Mr. CASCRAIN: You can send it
back.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Question!
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, a point of order has been raised.
I would say, first, that section 14 bas aiready
been approved. The amendment now before
us is to strike out section 14. So I do not
think it is in order.
Rule 93 says:
Important amendments may also be made to
a private bill at its third reading, provided
notice of the saine in writing shal have been
given on a previous day.
Hon. Mr MURDOCK.

That would not preclude the honourable
member (Hon. Mr. Bourgeois) from bringing
up his amendment on a later day.
Then I would point out that Bourinot says,
at page 318:
It is laid down in the highest English
authority that "when tho House bas agreed
that certain words shall stand part of the
question, it is irregular to propose any amendment to those words, as the decision of the
House bas already been pronounced in their
favour, but this rule would not exclude an
addition to the words if proposed at the
proper time."
Then, on the following page:
If the aiuendment be resolved in the affirmative, it will not be competent to move that
it be struck out, in whole or in part.
I therefore rule that the amendment is
not in order.
The question, honourable members, is now
on the motion for the third reading of the
Bill. Is it your pleasure, honourable members,
to adopt the motion?
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.

LICENSING

0F TRA.WLERS

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. FELIX P. QUINN:- Honourabie members, before the Orders of the Day are called,
may I draw the attention of the leader of
the Government to a telegram I have received, which reads as foliows:
In view imminent layoff remaining Lunenburg vessels fresh fishing from Halifax, urge
immediate reconsideration by Government of
trawler licensing. Their operation ineans unemployment large number men, loss to vessel
owners and suppliers, and depressed prices for
boat fishermen. Believe dloser study evidence
already before Fisheries Minister shows our
request
for cancellation
trawler licences,
especially at this season, is well founded.
Respectfully urge you bring this matter before
Senate and Government earliest possible date,
lending it your support.
Lawrence Allen,
Secretary Fishernien's Federation
Lunenburg Station 101.
May I say a few words in connection with
this tclegram? The matter of re-licensing the
steamn trawlers of Nova Scotia bias caused a
great deal nf concern, particularly in the constituencies where the shore fishermen and
the hoo-k-and-hine fishermen operate. Since
the renewal of licences many protests have
been made.
Some other honourable members of the Senate have received communications similar to the one I have just read.
I may say that these trawler licences are
renewed.on the lst of April each year, under
an Order in Council now in effeet, which reads:
1. A licence for a fishing vessel using an
otter or other trawl of a similar nature, other
than a small dragger operated by inshore
fishermen, will flot be granted, except under
the following conditions:
(a) That the applicant for such licence shail
furnish the Minister of Fisheries with evidence
that will sai.isfy the said Minister that he
cannot obtain an adequate supply of suitable
fish to enable him properiy to conduct and
develop hie business from the hook-and-line
fishermen, and that if the licence is granted
the extent of his purchase of f resh fish f rom
the said fishermen will not be adverseiy affected.

SENATE

It is contended by the fishermen that we do
not need the steam trawler, as the hook-andline fishermen can furnish all the fish necessary to meet the demand, and just as cheaply.
This matter of licensing trawlers has been
brought to the attention of the Government
on many occasions. I recall that it was
considered of such great importance and concern that the Government appointed a royal
commission headed by the present Chief
Justice of the Exchequer Court, the Honourable A. K. Maclean. who at one time represented in the other House the constituency
of Halifax. which I have the honour to
That commission reported
represent here.
against the operation of the steam trawler,
and in the report Mr. Justice Maclean made
the statement:
Steam trawlers should be used only for the
purpose of taking up the slack, and the
fishernien should have just consideration at
all tinies.
Subsequently the Price Spreads Commission,
with which honourable senators are familiar,
made an extensive inquiry into the condition
of the fishermen, particularly those of the
Maritime Provinces. It also reported against
the operation of the steam trawler.
Then again the Nova Scotia Government
considered the matter of such serious importance that it appointed another royal commission, known as the Jones Commission.
That was headed by Professor Jones, a
prominent professor in one of the universities
in England. Another member was Mr. Alex.
Jolinston, who for many years was Deputy
Minister of Marine and Fisheries, a man well
qualified to investigate and report on the
fishing industry. The third member was a
gentleman from Toronto; I think his name
s Elli-.
Now, there are three commissions which
investigated the fishing industry, and all of
which reported adverselv to the trawler.
It is asserted that companies using trawlers
do so for the purpose of keeping down the
price to the fishermen, who have no interest
in the trawler, and that the renewal of these
trawler licences means unemployment amongst
fishermen. The matter of unemployment has
engaged the attention of the Government for
the last few years, as is well known to all.
The licensing of these trawlers wili put a
great many fishermen oult of employment.
and this means that the Government will
have to provide them with relief.
Hon. Mr. QUINN.

I would respectfully urge upon the honourable leader of the Government in this House
that he bring this matter to the attention of
the Government with a view to having it
reconsidered, so that something may be done
to ameliorate the condition of the fishermen
of Nova Scotia.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, I am sorry that the honourable
gentleman did not notify me of his intention
to raise this question in the Senate, and in
consequence I am unable to give him any
information on the matter. I think that in
the other House the Government generally
expects, except in the case of unusually pressing matters, to bc informed somewhat in
advance of the question to bc dealt with,
in order that it may be able to answer. I see
that this telegram is dated the 3rd of April.
It is now the 7th. All I can tell my honourable friend is that his remarks will be transmitted as soon as possible to the Minister of
Fisheries, who will answer. I do not know by
what means the answer will be made, as the
House of Commons is adjourning for three
weeks, but I am sure the Minister will
communicate with my honourable friend by
some means; perhaps through the press.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: May I say in explanation that it was just before noon to-day that I

this telegram.

SHIP "VENTURE"
INQUIRY

On the notice by Hon. Mr. Robicheau:
That he will inquire of the Government:
1. Was there a contract given by the
Government for building the training ship
"Venture"?
2. Where was it built?
3. Who had the contract for building same?
4. What was the contract price?
5. Were there any extras?
6. If so, what were they? Specify same.
7. Wlat were the wages paid?
8. Was there an investigation held as to
wages?
9. What did said investigation disclose?
10. Have any adjustments of wages been
made? Give details.
il. Have the employees since been paid?
12. Are their wages protected?
13. If not, why not?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have the following answer to the honourable gentleman's
nquiry:
1. Yes.
2. Meteghan, Nova Scotia.
3. Meteghan Shipbuilding Company, Limited.
4. 857,508.
5 and 6. Extras claimed by the contractor
are now under consideration.
7. The contract provided that rates laid
down by the Department of Labour were to
be paid.
8, 9, 10. 11, 12 and 13. An investigation
was held by the Department of Labour, whose
report and recommendations are now under
consideration.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable senator from Digby-Clare (Hon. Mr.
Robicheau) is not present. In his absence it
would net be inappropriate to call the Government's attention to the fact that question
No. 6, which specifically asked what the
extras are, is not answered.

ONTARIO AND QUEBEC CONTRIBUTIONS TO DROUGHT RELIEF
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN inquired
Government:
1. What approximate proportion will

2. What will be the approximate
contributed by Ontario?
3. What will be the approximate

ORDER FOR RETURN

On the notice by Hon. Mr. Robicheau:

amount

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
gentleman was not present when I answered
this inquiry on April 6. If he has taken
cognizance of it he will understand why the
department has asked that the questions be
dropped. However, I will repeat the answer
which I gave to the inquiry in the first place:
The questions which the honourable senator
asks should be dropped. It is impossible to
tell what sums have been derived from the
provinces of Ontario and Quebec in the fiscal
year ended March 31, 1938. It is possible to
ascertain sums collected at the customs bouses
and income tax offices in each province.
Obviously, however, imports at cities like
Montreal, Quebec, Saint John, Halifax, or other
cities at the seaboard do not always show
their destinations. Questions along this line
which have been asked in times past have not
produced results. The Dominion Bureau of
Statistics bas not been able to get the information. It is not a question which the Government could accurately answer, and an inaccurate answer would be worse than none
at all.
It would also be as difficult to compute what
return from that expenditure would be received
by Ontario and Quebec, in the millions of
dollars accruing to their manufacturing industries and commercial businesses, if the Western
Provinces were blessed with a good crop this
coming season.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: May I say a few
words? That is no answer at al. I did not ask
anything about the manufacturing industries.
I asked what aipproxima.te proportion Ontario
and Quebec will pay of the twenty-seven
millions odd in the estimates of this year for
the drought in the Northwest, and what will
be the approximate amount of the contribution by each of those provinces. If anybody
can put the question more clearly than that,
let him do it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I repeat part
of the answer:
It is not a question which the Government
could accurately answer, and an inaccurate
answer would be worse than none at all.

SENATE

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, it is not usual to make any comment
on the first reading, but perhaps I may be
permitted to express the hope that to-morrow
the Government will be able, possibly with
the assistance of the honourable senator from
Grandville (Hon. Sir Thomas Chapais), to
give us some details of the proposed expenditure. I find it difficult to understand why the
annual payment of $75,000 should have to be
continued so long. The object of this Bill is
simply to authorize a like expenditure for ten
years more. This amount seems pretty large
to me, and while the explanation may be quite
acceptable, I should like to have it. None
was given in the other House.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am glad the
right honourable gentleman has called my
attention to this. If the required information
is among my papers it will be given to-morrow;
if it is not there, I will see that it is obtained
later.

Chapais) is on the National Battlefields
Commission.
The motion was agreed to.

relations between our country and Hayti?
Not at all. Really it is just
Mr. Euler:

Mr. Bennett: I was not quite sure.
Mr. Euler: That is so in both cases.
According to
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the discussion in the other House, the reason
for one of the treaties, if not for both, is
that certain restrictions might bc directed
against our exports if no regular agreement
were made.
The motion was agreed to.

What I cannot understand is why these Bills

the fact that the trade is trifling; but we
already have a treaty with each of these
countries. and my reading on the subject
shows that the present treaties are merely
continuations of previous ones. Since a treaty
remains in effect until nullified, why have

REPORTING

REPORT REFERRED TO INTERNAL

On the Order:
Consideration of the third report of the
Standing Committee on Debates and Reporting.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I understand
that this report recommends an expenditure
of money. As expenditure is controlled by
the Committee on Internal Economy, I move
that the Order be discharged and that the
report be referred to the Standing Committee
on Internal Economy.
The motion was agreed to.
COPYRIGHT BILL
REFERRED BACK TO COMMITTEE

On the Order:
Consideration of the amendments made by
the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce to Bill 12, an Act to amend the Copyright
Amendment Act, 1931.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators who were present at our last sitting
will remember that I then asked that consideration of the report be postponed in
order to allow a study of the Bill from the
international angle, as it was alleged that it
contravened the terms of the Berne Convention of 1886 as revised at Rome in 1928. I
have before me a letter from the Office of
the High Commissioner for the United Kingdom advancing the opinion that one of the
clauses may be inconsistent with that convention. I have also letters from the German
Government and the French Government to
the same effect. The Department of External Affairs has studied these representations,
and I have its report, together with an opinion
from the Department of Justice that one of
the clauses of the Bill can hardly be defended
in the light of our international obligations.
Besides, I have a letter from Mr. Gladstone
Murray, of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, making representations from another angle. It is as follows:
Re Bill No. 12, An act to amend The Copyright Amendment Act, 1931, and the
Copyright Act.
When the above-mentioned Bill was passed
by the House of Commons there was nothing
in it of direct concern to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation nor to broadcasting stations
in general, and we were not interested in it.
lI the Senate Committee on Banking and
Commerce, however, it was proposed to add to
section 10-B of the Act a subsection to read
as follows:
"(6a) In respect of public performances by
means of any radio receiving set or gramophone
in any place other than a theatre which is

245

ordinarily and regularly used for entertainments to which an admission charge is made
or in a ship, no fees, charges or royalties shall
be collectable from the owner or user of the
radio receiving set or gramophone, but the
Copyright Appeal Board, shall, so far as
possible, provide for the collection in advance
from radio broadcasting stations or gramophone
manufacturers, as the case may be, of fees,
charges and royalties appropriate to the new
conditions produced by the provisions of this
subsection and shall fix the amount of the
same. In so doing the Board shall take into
account all expenses of collection and other
outlays, if any, saved or saveable by, for or
on behalf of the owner of the copyright or
performing right concerned or his agents, in
consequence of the provisions of this subsection".
This would have the effect of transferring to
broadcasting stations liability for the payment
of royalties for performances which have been
always regarded by the courts as separate and
distinct from performances for which the broadcasting stations pay royalties. In other words,
the amendment proposed would have the effect
of making broadcasting stations liable to pay
not only the amount they have to pay to-day
for the use of copyright music, but also the
amount which other people have to pay for
their separate use of that music. It is like
placing on the Corporation, without its knowledge or consent, responsibility for the rent of
a building occupied by some person with whom
it has nothing whatever to do.
In addition, the proposed amendment constitutes an important departure from the principles laid down in the Parker Report. You
may recall that in order to deal with the
highly unsatisfactory situation regarding performing rights, Judge Parker was appointed
as a royal commission to look into the whole
matter and in 1935 he sat for 37 days, heard
136 witnesses and had the assistance of numerous
counsel. His report laid down the basis for
charges on the various users of music and it
resulted in an amendment to the Act providing
for the Copyright Appeal Board. That Board
bas now sat during two years and it bas fixed
the licence fee payable by broadcasting stations
in accordance with the principles of the report.
The proposal mentioned would change the basis
which was established and which has been
reasonably fair.
For these reasons it is obvious that if the
proposed amendment is allowed to go through
it will react to the great disadvantage of the
Corporation and of broadcasting stations in
general. In the circumstances, I should greatly
appreciate whatever advice and assistance in
connection with this matter you can give.
I have representations from other parties,
but I think this letter fully justifies my
moving that the Order be discharged and that
the Bill be referred back to the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce for
further consideration.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Were the representations
from Germany, France and Great Britain made
on the Bill as it passed the House of Commons or as it came back from our Committee
on Banking and Commerce?

246

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I think this
first paragraph of the letter from the Office
of the High Commissioner for the United
Kingdom covers my honourable friend's question. The letter is dated April 30, 1938, and
the flrst paragraph reads:
I am directed by the High Commissioner in
Canada for His Majesty's Government in the
United Kingdon to invite reference to the
correspondence at present terminating with
your letter No. 2 of the 28th February regarding questions arising out of the Bill for an
Act to amend the Copyright Amending Act,
1931, which is now before the Parliament of
Canada. The appropriate departments of the
Government of the United Kingdom have now
had an opportunity of considering the text of
this Bill as proposed to be amended by the
Standing Committee of the Senate on Banking
and Commerce, and as the result of this perusal
they desire to offer the following observations.
Hon. CREELMAN MacARTHUR: Honourable members, in the letter from Mr.
Gladstone Murray, which the honourable
leader of the House has just read, reference
is made to the Parker Report. One of the
witnesses who appeared at the inquiry, Mr.
Mills, the American director of the Performing Right Society. testified that the expenses of collecting were three or four times
more than the revenue from the licence fees.
In view of this I do not sec why the broadcasting stations should have any fear of being
penalized.
I may say that I received a communication from the proprietor of Station CHGS in
my home town expressing his concern witih
respect to the Bill. I took the matter up
with Mr. Esling, its promoter, and from
what he told me I think the broadcasting
stations need be under no apprehension. Of
cour-e, it is essential that they be accorded
fair treatment. If there is to be no licence
fee paid by any place other than a theatre,
I hope the amendment will be so drafted as
fully to protect the broadcasting stations.
The motion was agreed to.

DIVORCE AND MATRIMONIAL CAUSES
BILL
REPORT

OF

COMMITTEE

Hon. C. E. TANNER presented the report of
the Special Committee on Bill B, an Act
respecting Divorce and Matrimonial Causes,
and moved that it be placed on the Order
Paper for consideration at the next sitting
of the House.
He said: Honourable senators, in presenting
this report I might explain that three principal
amendments are recommended. One defines
cruelty, which is a ground for divorce provided by the Bill. The definition reads as
follows:
"Cruelty" means legal cruelty, as interpreted
and construed by the Higli Court of England
in divorce and matrimonial causes.

That is a new clause.
By way of another amendment it is proposed to strike out clause 5, which provided
that no petition for divorce could be presented until after the expiration of thrce years
from the date of marriage. This clause, we
understand, would conflict with the divorce
law as now administered in several of the
provinces.

The other amendment relates to desertion.
In the Bill as originally presented desertion for
three years constituted a ground for divorce.
The committee now recommends a period of
six years instead of three.
There are several consequential amendments
having to do with re-numbering of the clauses,
but the amendments I have dealt with represent the principal changes which the committee now recommends.
I move that the report be set down for consideration at the next sitting of the House.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
I desire to ask the mover of the motion two
or three questions. First, does the striking
out of clause 5 imply that if a marriage took
place, say, on the lst of January, 1938, and this
Bill became law. a petition for divorce could
be filed on the 2nd of July?
As I understand, in the debate on a similar
Bill in the British Parliament, especially in the
House of Lords, the Lords Spiritual refused
to withdraw their opposition unless a three-

MAY 4, 1938
year praviso was inserted. By striking out
clause 5, do we withdraw the basis on which
the Bishops agreed ta the passing af the
British Bill?
This is my third question: Does the Bili
contain a clause of this character? A marriage
is not invalid merely because the woman is
a sister of the deceased wife of the man, or a
daughter of a sister of the deceased wife af
the man. A marriage is flot inýva]id mereiy
because the man is a brother af the deceased
husband of the woman, or a son of such
brother. As I understand, these sections are
ta be omitted. I think they shauld be in the
Bill.
I should have liked ta speak in the
cammittee this morning, but I was refused
that right.
Saine Hon. SENATORS: No.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Oh. yes. 1 rose ta discuss
amendments ta the Bill, and at once an
honourable mem-ber objected ta my speaking
and asked, "la the honourable gentleman a
member of this cornmittee?" The chairman
said, "No." This indicated~ ta me that I was
flot wanted in the committee at ail. The
chairman refused ta pratect me: he did not
a.sk the honourable member who objected ta
sit down. Then the honourable member who
objected ta my presence immediately made an
effort ta have me prahibited from speaking
on the Bill before the cornmittee.
An Han. SENATOR: No.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: My honourable friend says
"No." But if you are kicked in the face you
do nat turn round ta be kicked somewhere
else; you walk out.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Han. Mr. HAIG: Two years ago the
honourable leader of this House (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) assured me, as did the rîght
honaurable mem-ber fromn Eganville (Right
Hon. Mr. Graham) that a member af this
House could take part in the deliberations of
any standing committee, though he could not
vote unleshe was a member of the committee.
Yet this marning I was positively insulted by
the honourable member fromn Leeds (Han.
Mr. Hardy), and I was nat protected by the
chairman of the committee, who has just read
this repart (Hon. Mr. Tanner). I had intended
ta rise ta a question of privilege, but I will
deal witb the matter now on the motion for
consideration af the report.
1 do not think the Bill as amended is
satisfactory. I do flot think clause 5 shauld
he struck out at ail, for I arn persuaded that
the church-going people oi Canada are deter-

247

*mined ta give every marriage a fair trial.
If this Bill were enacted without clause 5,
divorce procecdings could be started within
two weeks af marriage. I amn convinced that
no one with any respect for the family
traditions oi this country would ha in favour
af such a condition af affairs. I do not 'believe
that the Bill would be accepted in another
place without clause 5. I think the clause
should hie retaincd.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: It is not the law
naw.
Han. Mr. HAIG: That may be; but I want
it ta be the la'w, because this Bill makes
several radical changes in aur divorce law.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: There is nothing
equivalent ta clause 5 in any ai the divorce
laws ai Canada.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Quite true. Ta-day there
is only one ground for divorce in this country,
and it is embadied in this Bill in paragrapli
(a) ai subsectian 1 ai section 6. If we are ta
extend the grounds for divorce, which is the
purpase ai this Bill, I think we should retain
clause 5. It is no argument ta say that
because provincial laws do flot cantain a clause
similar ta clause 5 we should nat enact it. I
am interested in this subi ect as a lawyer. It
cames up in aur practice every day. It is
only within the last twenty years that the
Manitaba courts have been granting divorces.
True, the province always had the power,
but did nat know af its existence until Walker
vs. Walker was decided.
I think that when a member of this House
gaes before any ai aur standing committees
hie should be protected by the, chairman, and
no cammittee member should impliedly abject
by asking, "Is this gentleman a mem-ber ai
au.r carnmitt.ee?" I may be tald that I was
flot asked ta withdraw, but I submit the very
question was equivalent ta a request for
withdrawal. I protest most vehemently againat
such procediire. Even if members ai a comnmittee do flot agree with a senatar wha may
desire ta, address it, lie should be allowed ta
proýceed. The only alternative for him is ta
insist that every Bill be discussed in Committee oai the Whole. It is a rule ai the
Senate, and a good one, though frequently
ignored, that in the House a member may
speak only once on the main motion. As I
have already said, it bas been the practice
ta allas' a senatar not a member ai a coimmittee ta attend its meetings and take part
in its discussions, but nat ta vote. Obviously
a non-member af the committee should not
be subject ta such an insult as that ai whicb

248

SENATE

I complain. I suggest that if this Bili cornes
up again it go ta Committee of the Whole,
sa that this matter may be fuiiy discussed.
Hon. A. C. HARDY: Honourabie senators.
as the hononrable the junior member froni
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) has mentioned my
naine, 1 wouId say that he is labouring under
a complete misappre-hension as to the fa.cts,
and therefore is flot able to state themn fuiiy.
I attended the meeting referred to of the
Special Committee on Divorce, though I arn
flot a member of t1hat committee. Instead
of my insuiting the honourable senator-and
I can assure him that I neyer had the slightest
intention of doing so- the facts are ta the
cantrary. Whilr the honourable senator was
speaking the senior mernber from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. MeMeans) interrupted in a very
proper and very gentlemaniy way ta make a
correction, as is usuai. My honourabie fricnd
-ompiains of having bren insultcd. The insuit
s'as in the tone whieh he used towards his
senior colleagýue. It was then I rither said
he was not a mrmber of the committee or
I asked if he was a member. When someone
said "No." I expresscd the opinion that members of the cammitter should have a littie
mare deference paid ta them than the honaurable junior senator from Winnipeg was according ta the senior member from that city. If
there xvas any insult at ail, it came entirely
from the honourable junior senatur f£rom Winnipeg; certainiy nat framn myseif. But if he
thinks I insuiîed him, let me say th-at I arn
aniy toa glad ta make amends naw. I had
na intention Whatrver of insuiting him, and I
stiii maintain that I *was nat guiiîy of such
ri.scourtesy. The senior gentleman from Winnipeg is anc of the aider members of this
Hause, and had been sitting ber for many
years before the junior member was ever
heard af. I submit that it was nat proper
conduct, an the part of an ýhanourable senator,
not a member of that committee. to address
one of the senior memhers in the tone adopted
by the junior member this marning. That
is the anly reason I spake as I did an that
occasion.
But the hanourabie junior member, not
satisflrd with what toak place before that
commutter. brought the inatter up in the
Raiiway Committre later an this rnarning.
He got bis cornmittees sa badiy mixrd that
for the time being he did nat know just
where he sat. He attends neariy every camnmitter of this Hause, and ustiaily takes
up mare time than any~ cammittre member
ever dors.
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

Hon. CREELMAN MacARTHUR: Honourable senators, an this question we may flot
ail be in order. I do not think I arn.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I do not
tbink any of yan arc.
Han. Mr. MacARTHUR: But with the
indulgence of the House I should like ta say
a frw words on this committee business. I
bave bren a meînber of the Finance Coinmittre for twelve years, but I cannot recali
a sing-le subject that bas ever bren referred
ta it. Certainly it has neyer had occasion ta
make a repart. I suggested ta the honourabie
leader of the Hanse (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
that he have the committre dissoived. I for
one shauld like ta have some work ta do,
and I know there are rnany others an bath
sides of His Honaur the Speaker who feel as
I da. Some years ago a specia] committre
was eanstituted ta investigate the Anditor
General's repart. It was ta be a new departurc and great resuits were cxpected. I da
flot think the cammittee ever met. As I
bave a]ready indicatrd, the Finance Coinmitter bas bren ignorrd.
Members of the
Drain Trust are generally elected ta ail the
cammittees.
Even the newspapers naine
a few men brr who do ail the Senate
wark. Now we have a special Railway Coinmitter in aperatian.
Much of the railway
business ta be invrstigated is, I understand, of
a financial character. Our Finance Committre

of whamn nine arr iawyrrs, yet we engage a

Wherr are we landing?

I

who was then ieading the Hanse (Right Han.

nicely together that I have seldom seen any
honourable member looking up the miles. I
confess it was different when I came into
this Chamber in 1898. 1 can stili see three
or four members who at that time were
very keen on the observance of the rules and
who every session rose to lay down the
law.
Now. I suppose, the discussion of what
took place in the committee is ended. My
honourabie friend from Prince (Hon. Mr.
MacArthur) took advantage of this free-forail to discuss the situation as to membership
of committees. This is an interesting question. and one about which I think 1 know
I shahl endeavour to give my
something.
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. MacArthur),
and others who bave any complaints to make
as to their standing in committees, an opportunity to discuss this situation before the
end of the present session, so that we may
prepare for the distribution of senators among
the committees et the opening of next session. In the meantime I would ask, that this
motion be put. It calls for no discussion
except as to the date when the report wilI
be taken Up.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, the honourable the junior senator
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) intîmated,
and it came to me as a surprise, that a
senator, not a memhpr of a committee, whio
vcntured to addrcss that committee did so
on sufferance. not as of right. I have aiways
understood otherwise, though I have not particulariy studied the rules of this House. I
see that rule Si reade as follows:
Senators, though not of the committee, are
flot exciuded fromn coming in and speaking; but
they must flot vote. They sit behind those who
are of the committee.
Consequentiy the right of the honourable
senator (Hon. Mr. Haig) to address the coinmittee is absolute, and he does not need to
take a rebuke or any other word from anybody. His right to speak is just as ample
as the right -of a member of the committee.

2M~

Referring to the remark of the bonourable
senator from Prince (Hon. Mr. MacArthur)
as to, the selection of committees, inasmuch as
bis words revol'.e around the present motion,
1 cali his attention to rule 83, which reads as
follows:
The senators to serve on a special conimittee
may be nominated by the mover; but, if three
senators so demand, they shall be selected as
foilows: Each senator shall vote openly for
one senator to serve a$ a mnember of such coinmittee, and those senators for whom the largest
number of votes are given shall constitute the
committee.
Usually, the motion for committee being
passed, the committee is selected by the
leaders, after consultation, of course, with
their respective followers; but under the rule
that cannot be done if any three members
objeci.
That is the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
rule as to the appointment of a special coinmittee.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. Standing committees are nominated by the Coinmittee of Selection, which is appointed by the
whoie House; but in the case of any special
committee any three members can insist that
a vote be taken.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUJR:

more democratic method could not be devised. 1 do not think there is any such mile
in the House of Commons, but in this democratic Chamber it seems to be supreme,
though sometimes ignored.
I arn quite agreeable, of course, to the
motion being carried.
Hon. Mr HAIG: Let me ask a question.
Do I understand the rule to be, then, that we
cannot speak on this motion? I thought it
was a mjotion for the adoption of the report,
and that I could speak on it. I want to
know because the honourable leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) suggested
I was out of order.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: You are quite
in order, I think.
I would point

of a date for taking the report into consideraMy honourable friend ro.se and distion.

1 did not me.an to contest his right to, raise

250

SENATE

tîat question, but I think the present discussion should be confined to the, subjectmatter of the motion.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: I must make
myself right with the House. I said that I
knew I was out of order. I took advantage
of the opening made by the honourable the
junior senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig)
in talking about this committee. for I d'id
not want to raise the subject as a question
of privile-ge. Furthermore, I asked the consent of the House. So I do not think I
should be criticized very murch for being
out of order.
The motion was agreed to.

TRAINING SHIP "VENTURE"
INQUIRY

On the Orders of the Day:
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
senators. yesterday I answered some questions
which were placed on the Order Paper by
the honourable senator from Digby-Clare
(Hon. Mr. Robicheau). My right honourable
friend who leads the other side (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen) called my attention to the fact
that the inquiry was not answered in its
entiretv. I now have information to make
the answer complote. It is as follows:
With reference to the Debates of the Senate,
No. 24. page 273, I have the bonour to forward
the following reply to the inquiry by the
Honourable Senator Robicheau in regard to the
Training Ship "Venture":
"5. Were there any extras?
6. If so, what were they? Specify them."
5 and 6. The contractor submitted a detailed
claim for " extras," totalling $36,616.06, but
the question as to whetber any "extras" will
be allowed. and. if so, to what extent and in
what anount, is still under consideration by
the Department of National Defence.

NATIONAL BATTLEFIELDS

(QUEBEC)

BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 53, an Act respecting
the National Battlefieldis at Quebec.
He said: Honourable senators, the object of
this Bill is the continuation of the payment
of $75,000 a year which has been made for a
nunber of years to the National Battlefields
Commission at Quebec. The authorization for
this payment expired on the first day of April
last, and it is now suggested that the payment should be continued for another ten
years.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

My right honourable friend has asked me
for some justification of this measure. I have
received the following explanation from the
Department of Defence:
The National Battlefields Commission was
constituted in 1908 by Act of Parliament.
The object was to preserve the battlefields of
Quebec.
The Commissioners were empowered to acquire
land and to receive and expend moneys, whether
appropriated by Parliament or contributed by
individuals.
The Minister of Finance was
authorized to pay from the Consolidated
Revenue Fund the sum of $300,000 for the
purposes set forth in the Act. This grant,
together with amounts received from publie
subscription, was sufficient to meet all charges
up to and including the fiscal year 1911-12.
For the fiscal years 1912-13 up to and including
1927-28, the amounts required by the Commission were voted annually by Parliament.
By Chapter 36 of the Statutes of Canada,
1928, section 8 of the above mentioned Act was
repealed and a new section was substituted
therefor. The new section 8 authorized the
Minister of Finance to pay out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund to the Commission the
sum of $75,000 a year for a period not exceeding ten years. This authority expired March
31, 1938.
The Bill entitled "An Act to amend an Act
respecting the National Battlefields at Quebec,"
as passed by the House of Commons, provides
for the payment to the Commission of $75,000
a year for a further period not exceeding ten
years from April 1, 1938.
The annual grants to the Commission have
been as follows:

In addition to the yearly grant to the
National Battlefields Commission, there has
been expenditure of a special nature for unemployment relief, as follows:

MAY 4, 1938
Fiscal year 1931-32-Expenditure of $24,809.05
under the 1931 Relief Act for work at
Cove Fields and the exploitation of the
Corrigan Quarry.
Fiscal yéar 1936-37-Expenditure of $74,124.18
under item in ;Special Supplementary
Estimates for work at Cove Fields.
Fiscal year 1937-38-An item of $100,000 in
the Special Supplementary Estimates for
work at Cove Fields.
The National Battlefields Commission, created
in 1908 by statute, was established for the
purposes of "acquiring and preserving the great
historic battlefields at Quebec, and restoring
so far as possible their principal features so
as to make them a Canadian National Park."
It was provided that five commissioners sbould
be appointed by the Governor in Council, and,
moreover, that any province which subscribed
at least one hundred thousand dollars should
be entitled to appoint one commissioner. In
1914, the number of commissioners to be
appointed by the Governor in Council was
raised from five to seven.
Vacancies have been created on the Commission owing to the decease of the following:
Robert Bickerdike, M.P., Montreal; Sir Edmund
Walker, Toronto; Sir Arthur Doughty, Ottawa,
and Hon. A. Turgeon, Quebec. The following
gentlemen have to-day been appointed to fill
these vacancies: Lt.-Colonel Oscar , Gilbert,
Quebec; Lt.-Colonel William Wood, Quebec;
Mr. James Francis Kenney, of Ottawa, and
Professor George Mackinnon Wrong, Toronto.
The Commission with its complete personnel
will now be composed of the following: Sir
George Garneau, of Quebec, Chairman; Hon.
Sir Thomas Chapais, of Quebec; Dr. N. A.
Dussault, of Quebec; Lt.-Colonel Oscar Gilbert,
of Quebec; Lt.-Colonel William Wood, of

The amount of $74,136 in the special account
related to special work on Cove Field for
which there was a special grant last year.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: I am
entirely favourable to the Bill and the proper
maintenance of the battlefields under the care
of the Commission. But I was desirous of
getting a statement from a member of the
Commission who is also an honourable member
of this House (Hon. Sir Thomas Chapais) as
to the nature of the work which is being done,
how far moneys which are being voted and
have been voted are required for maintenance,
and to what extent it has been possible to
make improvements with those moneys. I
was unable to see how $75,000 could be neces-

251

Toronto; Hon. L. A. Taschereau, of Quebec,
appointed by the province of Quebec, and
Lt.-Colonel William H. Price, of Toronto,
appointed by the province of Ontario. All the
members, including Sir George Garneau, Chairman, serve without remuneration. The Seeretary
is Mr. L. Pacaud.

Whilst at the inception of the work of the
Commission contributions and subscriptions
were received from other sources, for several
years past the entire cost has been borne by
the Dominion Government.
I see that on January 29 Sir George Garneau,
Chairman of the Commission, wrote to the
Minister of Finance requesting that the annual
vote be increased to $100,000, but the Minister
did not find it opportune to grant this request.
The memorandum goes on:
The reason for a statutory vote running over
a period of ten years is that a commission of
this type, just like the Federal District Commission, needs to plan its work over a period of
years and can carry out its work more economically if it knows that a definite amount of money
is to be provided by Parliament over a period
of years. This is the arrangement which has
been in effect for the last ten years, and as it
bas worked out successfully it is being renewed
by the present Bill.
Figures showing the expenditures of the
National Battlefields Commission for the last
few years are given in the following statement.
These figures are taken from the Auditor
General's reports.
I do not suppose I need read these figures,
unless I am asked to do so, but in any event
they will be placed on Hansard.

sary for maintenance alone. I may have missed
a little of what was read by the honou-rable
the leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), but in any event I do not know yet
just what battlefields are under the purview
of this Commission. I know the chief one is
the Plains of Abraham, but is there any other,
and, if so, what is it? I notice that the
Commission has two members from, Toronto:
Professor Wrong and Hon. W. H. Price. It is
difficult to see just what service could be
rendered by members at Toronto as to maintenance of the Plains of Abraham battlefield.
It therefore seems to me that some other
battlefields are included in the purview of
the Commission.
Hon. Mr. COTE: No.

SENATE
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
other?

There is no

Hon. Mr. COTE: No.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes. Adjoining the Plains of Abraham there is a piece
of land upon which took place the second
battle between the English and the French, in
the spring of 1760, the battle of Ste. Foy.
This now forms part of the whole battlefield.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, it is

It forms now a

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: From what
the honourable leader of the Government read
I understood it was provided that if any
province contributed $100,000 it would be permitted to have a representative on the Commission, and apparently Ontario is entitled
to a representative-and has one in the
person of Mr. Price-because of having contributed such a sum. The other member
from Toronto was, I suppose, appointed by the
Federal Government.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

I should think

so.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Of course, the
whole of Canada is interested in the preservation of the Plains of Abraham, but the real
work would be done on the g.round. I cannot
see how mucli could be done by representatives elsewhere, and I am wondering whether
a lot of the money is not spent in travelling
and other expenses by members distant from
Quebcc who cannot be very useful. No further
acquisition is going on. I should have liked
to have some statement of the improvements
being made, and so forth, and I was sure
the honourable senator from Grandville (Hon.
Sir Thomas Chapais), who is a member of
the Commission, could have given us a very
interesting account. That was the only
reason I rose yesterday. I notice that he is
not able to be here to-day, and if he cannot
be present to-morrow perhaps we had better
postpone further discussion until next week.
Hon. G. PARENT: Honourable senators,
the right honourable gentleman who has just
taken his seat (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
has undoubtedly made occasional trips te
Quebec, but apparently he has never gone
there for the special purpose of looking over
the work donc by the Battlefields Commission.
If he had done so, he would have observed, like
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

every other visitor at the Plains of Abraham.
that though the territory is not very extensive, maintenance charges are necessarily
heavy on account of the rocky nature of the
ground. As all honourable members know,
the Citadel, headquarters of the Governor
General at Quebec, adjoins the Plains of
Abraham, and it is important that the Battlefields Commission should improve these surroundings as much as possible. The cost of
laying out roads, sewers, drains, and so on,
there, is very high.
Some people may be inclined to think that
the Government is voting too much money to
the Commission, but my impression is that
the vote is not large enough. This battlefield is a great asset to the country at large.
We must not forget that it was the birthplace
of a nation. Wherever you walk there you
are treading on historic ground. The battlefield should be kept up, even if it costs a
little money.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I agree with
that.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: I think the Government has been very parsimonious in voting
only $75,000 a year. The contribution should
have been more than that, but we know that
the present financial situation is such that we
must proceed slowly in these matters just
now, and so we shall have to wait a little
longer for more money. That is why only
$75,000 a year is being asked for from the
Federal Treasury for the maintenance of this
work. It is a very valuable asset from the point
of view of tourist trade alone. Every Canadian should go there, sooner or later. No one
can say he has seen this country who has not
visited the Plains of Abraham, the place where
Wolfe and Montcalm died, where soldiers of
the two races fought valiantly and gallantly.
It is a sacred spot and it ought to be well
preserved. So I am glad to sec that there has
been unanimity in the voting of this sum of
money, and I only wish that it were within our
power to spend more money in such a good
cause.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Can the honourable gentleman inform the House how much
has been spent on maintenance during the
last thirty years?
Hon. Mr. PARENT: I am not a member
of the Commission. But I may tell my
honourable friend that while I was a member
of the other House I never sent any man to
the Commission to get work. I regarded the
undertaking se highly that I thought the Commission should have an entirely free hand.

Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable

this Bihl to, a committee, where we could
discuss it a little more freely and secure
information as to how the money is being
spent? There bas been considerable talk
about economy fromn time to time, but threequarters of a million dollars have been spent
in the last ten years on only one battlefield,
s0 far as we know. There are others in
Canada, but possibly no other so important.
The present Bill provides for the spending
of another three-uarters of a million dollars
over the ncxt ten years on the saine battiefield. That may be ail right, but it seems
to me that we are eptitled to know what
the money is being spent for, and what bas

CANADA-HAYTI

TRADE
BILL

AGREEMENT

SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND rnoved the
second reading of Bill 79, an Act respecting
a certain Trade Agreement between Canada
and Hayti.
He said: Honourable senators, the object
of this Bill is the approval of a trade agreement between Canada and Hayti. The explanatory note to the Bill reads as follows:
The trade agreement signed on April 23, 1937,
between Canada and Hayti provides for exchange of most-favoured-nation treatment in
tariff matters. Each country also undertakes
not to impose prohibitions or restrictions on
imports from the other which are not applied
to imports originating in a third country. In
the event of quantitative restrictions or exchange control measures being established by
either country, the agreement provides that
these measures w ill lie administered in such a
way as to give the other country a fair share
of the trade. National treatment is exchanged,
with a few exceptions, with respect to internal
taxes. Preferences which Canada grants to
other parts of the Empire and any advantages
are excluded from the scope of the agreement.
granted by Hayti to the Dominican Republie
Canada and Hayti have been according each
other most-favoured-nation
treatment since
July 15. 1935, under exchianges of notes in force
for limited periods. An exchange of notes of
until the ratification of the enw trade agreement for one year, i.e., until April 15, 1938, or
until tc
ment.

ratification of the new trade agree-

I may say that I have obtained from the
Department of Trade and Commerce a statement covering this trade agreement, and, with.
the leave of the Senate, I will place it on
Hansard.

This is the statement referred to:
As in tc case of Guatemala, Canada lias also
been avoiding high duties in Haiti through a
modus vivendi and we desire to establish tariff
relations withi Haiti on a more stable basis.
The need for a trade agreement with Haiti
is traceable to a Haitian law of April 9, 1935,
which provided that the existing rates of
customs duty in Haiti would constitute a
mmimum tariff. The minimum tariff was to
apply only to goods (1) origiùating in countries
granting
unconditional
most-favoured-nation
treatment to Haitian products;
(2) in the
absence of an agreement, to countries which
purchase at least one per cent of the total
Haitian exports; (3) or countries whose exports
to Haiti did not exeeed one-half of one per
cent of the total Haitian imports.
Countries
not fulfilling these conditions became subject
to a maximum tariff established by the same
law. and which was double the minimum tariff.
The external trade figures of Haiti at that
time showed imports from Canada at 1-96 per
cent of Haiti's total imports, and exports to
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Canada at only 0-47 per cent of Haiti's total
exports. Thus Canada becane subject to the
maximum tariff uniess protected by a trade
agreement.
As a temporary measure Canada by an exchange of notes on April 12, 1935, granted lier
intermediate tariff to Haiti in return for mostfavoured-nation treatment. Canada's concessions
to Haiti were enlarged in an exchange of notes
of June 7-10, 1935, by an extension of full
most-favoured-nation
treatment,
i.e.,
intermediate tariff, plus any lower rates in force.
This arrangement was made for a period of
nine months, i.e., up to April 15, 1936.
The
agreement was further extended on April 6,
1936, for one year, and on April 15, 1937, for
another year, or until the ratification of a
new trade agreement.
Tariff Concessions
The trade agreement between Canada and
Haiti now before the House was signed on
April 23, 1937.
It provides for exchange of
unconditional most-favoured-nation treatment in
all matters concerning customs duties and related charges on the products of each country
imported into the other. Exception is made
as regards preferences granted by Canada to
other parts of the British Empire, and any
advantages granted by Haiti to the Dominican
Republic with a view to facilitating frontier
traffic.
As regards Canadian concessions this means
that Haiti will be accorded (1) the intermediate
tariff; (2) special rates and discounts from
the intermediate tariff provided for in Schedule
"C" of the Canada-France trade agreement,
1933, and protocols thereto; (3) special rates
in Sciedule I to the Canada-United States
trade agreement; (4) special rates in Schedule
"B" to the Canada-Poland convention of commerce.
Here it will bc of interest to place on record
tc
totals of trade between Canada and Haiti
during recent years, as shown by Canadian
returns. The figures are:
Calendar Years

The outstanding importation from Haiti into
Canada is sisal fibre. It enters this country
free of customs duty from all countries. Of
the $99,000 comprising Canada's total imports
from Haiti in the calendar year of 1936, $89.000
was made up of sisal fibre. The whole of the
imports of $59,000 for the calendar year 1937
consisted of sisal fibre.
Haiti is anxious to
extend her export trade to Canada in some
other lines also, such as tropical fruits, coffee,
cocoa, sugar, cotton. The trade agreement, as
indicated, will ensure on any of these products
the most favourable rates granted to any foreign
country.
Canada's main exports to Haiti are fish,
wheat, flour. rubber tires, potatoes. some meats,
and a wide variety of miscellaneous goods, each

Haiti Duties
On these and all other goode that we might
export to Haiti the agreement insures us the
benefit of the minimum tariff (half the maximum) and any lower conventional duties existing. Some minimum rates of the Haiti tariff,
inclusive of a 20 per cent surcharge, are:
Smoked fish.. .. .. .. $1.85 per 100 bs.
3.60 per 100 lbs.
Dried fish.. .. .. .. ..

An alternative ad valorem rate of 24 per
cent on fish, apples, preserved milk, and rubber
hose applies in any case where it would yield
more duty than the specific rate just mentioned.
There are lower conventional duties on these
goods as follows:

Rubber tires and tubes. 21 per cent ad val. in
years when Haiti
budget expenditures
exceed $8,000,000.
These conventional duties arise out of a
Haitian trade agreement with the United
States. In this agreement Haiti also reduced
duties on sewing machines, fresh beef, pork
and mutton, lard, grapes, pears and radio
apparatus. The benefit of all the reductions
goes to Canada.
Most Articles in the Two Agreements
Are Alike
The articles of the Haiti and Guatemala
agreements are much alike. As well as the
reciprocal assurance of most-favoured-nation
rates, each party guarantees the other National

treatment with respect to internal taxes, Canada reserving leaf tobacco, spirits, beer, malt
and malt syrup, but pledging most-favourednation treatment.
In the event of quantitative restrictions being
established by either country, it is agreed that
in allocation of permitted imports each country
will be granted a proportion of trade equal to
what it enjoyed in a previous representative
period. There are no quota or import ]icensing
restrictions in force in either Haiti or Canada,
but Haiti as well as Canada sees advantage of
an assurance in this regard.
Article IV, respecting monopolistic agencies,
is more elaborately drawn than the corresponding article in the Guatemala trade agreement.
It is identical in terms with Article VIII of
the Canada-United States trade agreement.
This article contains assurance of equitable
treatment for the commerce of either country
in the event that the other introduces any
system of state trading or publie monopoly.
Should exchange control be established in
either country, it is agreed that it shall be
administered in a way to give the other country
a fair and equitable share in the allotment of
exchange. Haiti is at present free of exchange
restrictions, but if Haiti should at any time
resort to exchange restrictions, Article V provides assurance of fair treatment in respect of
payment for imports from Canada.
While the Guatemala agreement is for three
years, the initial period of validity of the
Haiti agreement is one year. The one-year
term is at the request of the Haitian authorities.
the
After approval by this Parliament and force
Legislature of Haiti it can be brought into
immediately on the exchange of ratifications.
It is to remain in force thereafter until terminated on six months' notice being given by
either party.
We know that Hayti cannot very materially
extend its trade into our market, but we are
confident that we can increase our exports to
that country.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, the only observation I made
yesterday on this Bill was that there seemed
to be no reason for the treaty, it being merely
a continuation of a previous treaty, which
continuation is assured anyway unless six
months' notice of denunciation is given.
There has been no such notice.
The honourable leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) has read a memorandum from the Department of Trade and
Commerce to the effect that our present trade
relations with Hayti and Guatemala arise not
from treaties, but rather from some British
agreement giving us a right to come in under
favoured-nation clauses if the Government so
elects; that the Government had so elected
in 1935 by Order in CounciL; therefore our
favoured-nation rights in Guatemala and
Hayti depended merely on this Order in
Council resting upon the treaty with the

256

SENATE

British Government, and the latter treaty had
been denounced.
This statement may be
correct, and it would be very rash on my part
now to dispute it.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Is my right honourable friend correct in that statement? I find
the treaty concludes in these words:
Done in duplicate, in English and in French,
both authentic, at the City of Port-au-Prince,
on the 23rd day of April, 1937.
That was after Parliament prorogued last
year. The treaty was entered into then.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is quite
right. My honourable friend has misunderstood me. This treaty apparently was entered
into then, but according to the account given
to-day, the relations existing theretofore were
based upon a treaty with Great Britain, of
which Canada took advantage by Order in
Council in 1935, and that other treaty has
been denounced by Hayti; hence the necessity
for this treaty and the treaty with Guatemala.
Had we not entered into these treaties, we are
told, we were threatened with 100 per cent
advance in tariff, in consequence of a new law
directed against countries with which Hayti
had an adverse balance of trade. Canada, of
course, was one of such countries.
This
account may be correct, and I should be rash
to deny it, but it is not in accord with the
information the Minister gave the other House.
Possibly he had not full information before
him at the time. The Minister stated, as I
quoted yesterday, that the provisions of the
present treaty were precisely the provisions
now existing. He did mention two infinitesimal things in which there was a change, but
they amount to nothing. I find be said alsoI am only justifying my intervention-the
following, which will be found at page 2451
of the Commons Hansard:
We have had most-favoured-nation arrangements with that country for the past seven or
eight years at least, and practically no change
has been made.
I assume his information was incorrect; that
is all. I have no doubt that the memorandum
from the Department reveals the real position,
and that these treaties should pass. I would
warn all industrialists and Labour in Canada,
though, not to be optimistic as to the relief
in unemployment which may result from the
extension of our trade through these treaties.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCE: I am wondering
whether I can understand what I read. I find
on page 2 of this Bill the following language:
The Government of Canada and the Government of the Republic of Hayti, desiring to
facilitate the commercial relations existing between Canada and Hayti have resolved to
conclude a trade agreement and for this purpose
have agreed upon the following articles:
Right EIon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Then the articles follow, and at the conclusion
of article IX I find these paragraphs:
In witness whereof, the undersigned, duly
authorized to that effect, have signed the
present agreement and have affixed their seals
hereto.
Done in duplicate, in English and in French,
both authentie, at the City of Port-au-Prince,
on the 23rd day of April, 1937.
Is this a trade agreement made as at that
date or is it not? That is what I cannot
understand.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think it is
made as at that date, only mine reads "in
English and in Spanish."
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That is Guatemala. The Hayti treaty is said to be in
Englisli and in French.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: My understanding is that a treaty comes into effect
when made between the governments of the
two countries. Our practice has been to bring
treaties to Parliament for ratification, but
they have effect before ratification.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should like
to draw the attention of my right honourable
friend to the statement of the Minister of
Trade and Commerce at page 2447 of the
Commons Hansard. He was asked by Mr.
Lennard:
Is it expected that these treaties will greatly
increase our trade with these countries?
Mr. Euler: I would not care to make any
prediction with regard to that. Having regard
to all the circumostances, J do not suppose it is
physically possible that our trade with either
of these two countries will ever be very large.
However, it has been thought well to make this
trade agreement because of certain restrictions
which might be brouglit into force with reference to exports from Canada to Guatemala if
no regular agreement were made.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: So I think it
was an opportune move to try to secure that
market for whatever it may be able to absorb
from us. As I have stated, the balance of
trade is largely in our favour, and we must
neglect nothing in our efforts to increase our
exports to these countries.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Has my honourable friend any figures to show the importance
of Our trade with Hayti?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Last year
we had $59,000 of imports and about $160,000
of exports. With Guatemala the figures are
$52,000 and $88,000.

MAY 4, 1938
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I suppose this Bill
is along the usual liues by which two countries make most-favoured-nation arrangements
with each other?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is a littie
more than that. in this sense. In such treaties
the most-favoured-nation extension is generally 100 per cent, but in these particular
treaties it is not. It is 100 per cent from
us to Hayti and Guatemala; but fromn them
to us it is subject to the right of those two
countries to grant special tariff faveurs to
the small Central American countries stîpulated here. And of course it is subject to
our right to grant inter-Empire preferences.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Would the honourable leader of the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) state to how many countries we have
granted most-favoured-nation treatment?
Right Hon.
twenty-five.

Mr.

MEIGHEN:

I

think

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: 1 have a pretty
vivid recollection of what happened in 1929
and 1930 in that respect, when the top wall
of our tariff was taken off stone by stone by
treaties of that nature. The Government of
the day granted to virtually every nation in
Europe most-favoured-nation treatment. This
meant that the general tariff disappeared
completely and our industries had to rely on
our intermediate tariff.
I am wondering
whether the Government is reverting to the
policy which was followed in 1928, 1929 and
1930, with, 1 think, disastrous resuits to our
industries.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am not ready
to concede the last statement of my honourable friend without going into the imports
and exports between Canada and those various
ýcountries during those years. My honourable
friend knows how largely we have expanded
our export trade. The desirability of using
the most-favoured-nation clause is a moot
question, and strong arguments might be
advanced pro and con. The question might
well be examined generally for the purpose of
seeing how it has worked out with respect to
our trade. I can assure my honourable friendand I rcly on the statement of the Minister
of Trade and Commerce-that no such agreement was made without a thorough investigation to see how far it would extend favours
to other countries; because once you give a
low tariff to a particular country, ahl the
,other countries enj oying most-favoured-nation
treatment would also enj oy that further
advantage.
As I have said, we are ahl trying to further
our own trade. We can do so only by giving

257

a quid pro quo. In this instance the situation
is obviously in favour of Canada, for we know
what we are importing from. Hayti and
Guatemala and what we are exporting to them.
So we might throw our doors wide open to
exports from Hayti and Guatemala without
adversely affecting Canad-as trade. We are
getting the advantage to-day in our trade with
those countries.
I recognize that the question of how the
application of the most-favoured-nation clause
affects one's trade is a very interesting one.
My honourable friend knows how we have
been thriving on exports. We are decidedly an
exporting country, and I think our manufacturers are very happy to see more markets
being opened up. 0f course, they sometimes
feel the pinch when certain commodities are
admitted, b-ut that is something which may
be expected. The question is, What are we
giving in rcturn for the favours we are
getting?
Hlon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, I think that when there bas been so
much discussion respecting these two Bis
it would be unfortunate if we did not indicate
.iust how hungry we are for export trade.
Therefore let me put on the record Article VII
of the trade agreement with Hayti. It says:
Nothing in this Agreement shaIl be construed
to prevent the adoption of measures prohibiting
or restricting the exportation or importation oi
gold or silver, or to prevent the adoption of
such measures as either Government may see
fit with respect to the control of the export
or sale for expert of arms, ammunition, or
implements of war, and in exceptional circumstances, ahl other military supplies.
Subject to the requirement that there shaîl
he no arbitrary discrimination by either country
against the other country in favour of any third
country where similar conditions prevai], the
provisions of this Agreement shaîl nlot extend
to prohibitions or restrictions (1) imposed on
moral or humanitarian grounds; (2) designed
to protect human, animal or plant life; (3)
relating to prison-made goods; (4) relating to
the enforcement of police or revenue laws;
(5) directed against maisbranding, adulteration,
and other fraudulent practices, such as are
provided for in the pure food and drug laws
of either country; and (6) directed against
unfair practices in import trade.
In view of Canada's hunger and need for export trade, I do not thinc any particular harm
will be done by putting this article on the

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: These reservations show exactly the contrary. My honourable friend bas misinterpreted them.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Pe.rhaps I shall be
allowed to be out of order long enough to
ask my honourable friend the leader of the
Government whether we may have a list of
the countries that enjoy the most-favourednation clause.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I shall have an
answer for my honourable friend, just as
though he had put an inquiry on the Order
Paper.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: In order that my
honourable friend may be zealous, I will remind him that we are hungry for export trade
and are very parsimonious with respect to our
own market. If our home market were wider
we should not bc so hungry for foreign
markets; therefore we do not want any
further intrusion into our market than is
absolutely essential to enable our trade to
flow in other countries. My honourable friend
will remember how much trouble our Government took in negotiating the treaty with
France, for instance, granting very important
concessions to that country-as to which, of
course, we received soe quid pro queand how, just as soon as these particular advantages were given, the Government handed
similar ones to other countries, including
Italy, without receiving anything at all in
exchange.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
goodwill we gained.

Think of the

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
Perhaps. The
motive behind the policy of the Government
at that time could net h ave been the securing
of certain advantagcs. It was very clear that
what was done wvas simply an indirect way
of cutting down the protective walls around
this country. After all, when a trade treaty
with a foreign country is presented to Parliament it attracts very little attention and no
suspicion at all. If the Minister of Finance
in presenting his budget says that he is going
to cut down the tariff on seme commodity
there is quite a flurry throughout the country
and powerful representations are made, and
perhaps the tariff is not lowered on that
particular item. But in this indirect and very
skilful way the Government goes very gently
and gingerly about making the ebange, and
nobody is aware that stone by stone the wall
of protection is being removed so that comnpetitive goods may flow in. I think this
House will remenber that in 1930 the flow of
foreign goods was so great that a large portion
of our population was swept from our own
territory to the country to the south of us,
and in five years we lest no fewer than

400,000 Canadians. Of course these agreements before us are picayune so far as trade
is concerned; in fact, you would almost have
to wet your fingers, so to speak, te pick them
out from among our other ,trade agreements.
Nevertheless, I should be very much obliged
for the information I have requested. I shall
put my question in writing and send it to my
honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Of course we
have heard my honourable friend's statement
hefore. He forgets to say that if we extended
fav oured-nation treatment to Italy by our
treaty with France, we at the same time got
favoured-nation treatment from Itaily.

CANADA-GUATEMALA TRADE AGREEMENT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 80, an Act respecting
a certain Trade Agreement between Canada
and Guatemala.

MAY 4, 1938
He said: Honourable senators, this Bill is
similar in purpose to the previous one. I
have the following explanation from the
Department of Trade and Commerce:
The object of the trade agreement with
Guatemala is to place our tariff relationship
with that country on a more stable basis. We
have been avoiding a high tariff in Guatemala
only by an exchange of notes.
A Guatemalan law of January 26, 1935, provided means for increasing customs duties and
other taxes 100 per cent on goods from countries
whose commercial balance with Guatemala was
adverse to Guatemala. Figures of total trade
between Canada and Guatemala, as shown in
Canadian records, for the last five calendar
years are:

76,251
1936..
23,106
112,526
1937.. ......
52,270
88,498
In order to avoid the 100 per cent surcharge
just mentioned, Canada took advantage of
Article 13 of the then existing treaty of commerce and navigation between the United
Kingdom and Guatemala, dated February 22,
1928. Under this article the Guatemalan Government had agreed to accord most-favourednation treatment to the products of any British
Dominion in return for most-favoured-nation
treatment of Guatemalan products in such
Dominion.
A Canadian Order in Council,
therefore, was passed on July 20, 1935, which
granted most-favoured-nation
treatment to
Guatemala. In this way Canada for a time
escaped liability to the 100 per cent surcharge.
However, the Anglo-Guatemalan Treaty, under
which this action was taken, was soon denounced by Guatemala and ceased to have effect
on August 30, 1936. Tariff negotiations between
the Canadian and Guatemalan governments then
ensued with the result that the trade agreement
now before the House was signed on Septemiber
28, 1937. At the same time an exchange of
notes was executed providing for provisional
most-favoured-nation treatment pending the
coming into force of the new agreement.
I. Tariff Concessions
The trade.agreement, in Article I, provides
for exchanging unconditional most-favourednation treatment with respect to customs duties
and subsidiary charges, as well as related customs formalities.
In so far as Canadian concessions are concerned, most-favoured-nation treatment at present means the benefit of the intermediate tariff
and the rates lower than intermediate in our
trade agreements with France, Poland and the
United States. Guatemala's exports, however,
are not varied enough to benefit from many
of the tariff reductions thus obtained. Our
chief and only important import from Guatemala is coffee, which made up $51,000 of the
$52,000 total value of goods imported from
Guatemala during 1937.
Under the mostfavoured-nation treatment confirmed by this
trade igreement, coffee from Guatemala may
51958-171

25

be imported under the intermediate tariff at
a rate of 3 cents per pound, as compared with
5 cents per pound under the general tariff.
The chief items making up exports to
Guatemala in 1937 were:
Wheat flour.. ................
$29,645
Cyanamid. ..................
22,387
Pneumatic tires and tubes.. .. ......
6,788
Various vegetable products.. .. ....
5,220
Newsprint.. ..................
4,272

2,319
Silk socks and stockings.. ....

Cotton clothing.. .. ..
1...........1,209
Needles and pins.. .. ............
1,179
Otier goods.. .. ..............
5.282
Total exports.. ..............

$88,498

On wheat flour, the leading export, Guatemala
duty is $1.35 per 100 pounds. There is at
present no preferential rate, but Canada, as
well as escaping the surcharge of 100 per cent,
is assured of the lowest rate that may be
brought into force at any time. The next
largest export from Canada, cyanamid, is apparently duty-free, as a fertilizer. On Canada's
third largest export, rubber tires and tubes,
there is a conventional rate of 20 per cent ad
valorem, compared with 9 cents per pound under
the general tariff. It has been stated that the
20 per cent ad valorem conventional rate whieh
we receive represents a reduction of one-third
of the duty. As regards the normal duties
on some of the other chief Canadian exports
to Guatemala. white newsprint is 45 cents
per 100 pounds, coloured newsprint 90 cents
per 100 pounds, rubber belting 111 cents per
pound, silk hosiery $4.10 per pouud, and farm
implements. some at 45 cents per 100 pounds,
and some at $1.35.
Without assurance of a continuance of mostfavoured-nation treatment in Guatemala we
should be in a quite inferior position to the
United States in that market. In a trade
agreement of June 15, 1936, Guatemala granted
the United States the conventional rate on
rubber tires, already mentioned, and reduced
rates on passenger automobiles, radio apparatus,
metal furniture, certain meats, canned and other

fish, powdered milk, oatmeal, and similar
cereals.
II. Import Restrictions
In Article II each country undertakes not
to impose prohibitions on imports from the
other which are not applied alike to goods
originating in a third country. In the event
of quantitative restrictions being established
by either country, each pledges to the other
most-favoured-nation treatment. Neither Canada
nor Guatemala at present employs any system
of import quotas or prohibitions. At the same
time it is advisable in these days, when trade
barriers of all kinds are of common occurrence,
to safeguard our position as far as possible
when making new trade agreements. Thus it is
provided in this article that, in the event of

260

SENATE

limitations being placed on imports, each
contracting party is assured of a share in the
permitted trade equal to its proportion of the
trade in a previous representative period. The
exception made in this article with regard to
matches and lighters was requested
by
Guatemala. We do not consider it of serious
consequence to Canada. We are advised that
Sweden is the only country exporting matches
to Guatemala.
III. Internal Trade
Article III bas a reservation on Canada's
side in respect of certain internal taxes. Article
III assures national treatment as regards
internal taxes of various kinds except with
regard ta imports into Canada of leaf tobacco,
spirits, beer, malt and malt syrup imported
from abroad, and to special excise taxes imposed
under existing provisions of the Special War
Revenue Act. In these respects, however, mostfavoured-nation treatment is to apply.
IV. Monopolies
Article IV aims at protecting trade against
discrimination at the hands of a monopoly
established or maintained by either government.
This article does not necessarily mean that
such monopoly or agency will function; but if
there should te one, Canada is better off with

to Guatemala than to Canada, but we can see

no objection to meeting Guatemala in
respect.
IX. Preferences Reserved

Article IX gives privileges to each of the
contracting parties in respect of its own peculiar
commerce-Guatemala with its adjacent Latin

is at present free of exchange restrictions, the
insertion of Article V in this trade agreement
provides the best obtainable assurance that, if
Guatemala should later find it necessary to
resort to exchange restrictions, fair and equitable treatment shall be extended in respect to
the payment of imports from Canada.

VI. Adjusting Difficulties
The facilities afforded by Article VI for
discussing measures that nullify or impair the
agreement, with a view to adjustment along
amicable lines, will no doubt tend to the
smoott working of the trade agreement. The
operation of customs regulations may easily
cause unforeseen hardships, and it is useful to
have recognition of this in an agreement.

THIRD READING

CANADIAN

AND BRITISH INSURANCE
COMPANIES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 81, an Act to amend

the Canadian and British Insurance Companies
Act, 1932.
He said: Honourable senators, the explanatory note which is before you would perhaps
suffice, but I will add some further explanatiens. The explanatory note says:
The effect of this amendment is to extend
section sixty of the Act dealing with investments of Canadian insurance companies to

permit investment in equipment trust certificates of Canadian railways.
This, I suppose, will meet with no objection,
because these equipment trust certificates are
of such an order that the insurance companies
can invest their moneys in them with safety.
The second paragraph of the Bill reads:
(i-e) the bonds, debentures or other evidences
of indebtedness issued by an authority constituted by Act of the Parliament of the United
Kingdon of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
or of any British Dominion and responsible
to the Government of such Kingdom or
Dominion or te any Minister of such Government, or to a body se responsible with power
to adminsinister or regulate the administration

MAY 4, 1938
of any port or harbour or system of transport
or to distribute or regulate the distribution
of electricity, water or gas, and to levy, impose
or make taxes, rates, fees or other charges
fixed or authorized by the said Parliament
or subject to the approval of the said Government or Minister or of a body responsible
to the said Government or Minister.
I may say that a number of Canadian life
insurance companies which do business in
the United Kingdom and in other parts of
the world have asked that we take cognizance
of the fact that, particularly in Great Britain,
new types of public authorities have come
into being, and that at the present time there
is at least a doubt as to whether Canadian
insurance companies may invest in the securities of those public bodies. In some cases
there is no doubt that under the existing law
they cannot do so. It is therefore proposed
that power be extended in the language of
the paragraph which I have just read. By
this amendment we are endeavouring to include the various types of quasi-governmental
authorities which are being erected, particularly in England, but which nevertheless are
in reality public authorities. The law officers
have had some difficulty in finding descriptive
terms to cover specific cases which have been
put before the Department, as, for instance,
the Electricity Board, the Port of London
Authority, and the London Transport Board,
all of which have in varying degrees relationship with a Minister of the Crown of Great
Britain. In some cases that relationship is
direct, and they are immediately under the
Minister's direction with respect to rates and
matters of that sort. In other cases they are
responsible to a board which reports to the
Minister, the board itself in most cases being
composed of civil servants, some of whom
are what are called co-opted members.
Various very interesting experiments are
taking place in England, particularly in the
operation of great public utilities, with respect
to the combination of public enterprise on the
one hand and governmental capital investment
or supervision, or both, on the other. You
cannot use a phrase which is descriptive of
all these experiments, because they vary in
certain particulars. There is no doubt, however, that the securities issued in connection
with them rank very high, and for that reason
it is thought that Canadian insurance companies, particularly those doing business in
England, should have the right to invest in
securities which in England are regarded as
prime securities.
With this explanation, I move the second
reading of the Bill.

Right
Hon.
ARTHUR
MEIGHEN:
Honourable senators, ordinarily this Bill should
go to the Committee on Banking and Commerce; but it is very simple, and to me it
seems very reasonable. All I should like to
know is, first, whether the provisions of the
present Bill, looking to an enlargement of the
availability of certain securities, chiefly in
England, for investment by Canadian and
British insurance companies, have the approval of Mr. Finlayson, of the Department
of Insurance. In that respect I should regard
him as a better judge than any member of
the committee could be. As far as equipment
trust securities in Canada are concerned, they
are all right.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have in my
hands a letter from Mr. Finlayson which not
only approves of the Bill, but suggests a few
amendments which have been inserted in it
exactly as he gave them to the Minister of
Finance.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

the Commission, 'You cannot have any more
money than this during the next ten years.'
They know that they are going to receive this
NATIONAL

money each year and can plan their work
accordingly, so I believe it will cost the
Treasury less in the end."
I would ask leave to place on Hansard the
table referred to in the memorandum.
The follow-ing is the table:

SENATE
I think what I have read fairly well explains
the situation, and accordingly I now move
the third reading of the Bill.

lis GovernHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ment did.
I think the secretary is Mr.
Frémont.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I agree absolutely
with the purpose of the Bill. I rise only to
direct attention to the large amount required
under the head of insurance. I never heard
before of insurance on a park. It may be
all right; I dare say it is; but I should like
some information on the point.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
The commission needs a secretary, of course, but not
two. Certainly I knew nothing about the
appointment.

Hon. Mr. BLONDIN: What is the amount
of the insurance?

DIVORCE AND MATRIMONIAL
CAUSES BILL

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

It is $2,000.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not know
what the insurance covers, but I have full
confidence in Sir George Garneau's ability
to make an insurance contract.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. BLONDIN:
I think there is
justification for drawing the attention of the
honourable Minister to the large expenditure on insurance. I have every confidence
in the Commission, but, as honourable members are aware, some insurance agents are at
times very, very astute.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, the honourable leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurandý), in
defending the extraordinary procedure of a
ten-year operating statute, stated it was
necessary in order to enable the Commission
to plan its work. But in the items read,
showing how the money is spent, there was
nothing at all in the way of improvements,
construction, or the like; all the expenditures
were just for maintenance. For instance, there
is $40.000 for labour. And there is $2,000
for insurance premium. What are insured?
The rocks? Then there is $8,500 for expenses
of the commissioners and for salaries of the
secretary and the assistant secretary. For the
life of me I cannot understand what a
secretary would have to do to take up all
his time-except, maybe, to look after the
assistant secretary.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
take all bis time.

That might

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is very likely
that this question came up in Council when
the secretary was appointed by my right
honourable friend.
So ho may be able to
judge of the necessity for the secretary's
services.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
made any appointments there.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.

REPORT

OF

COMMITTEE-CONSIDERATION
POSTPONED

On the Order:
Consideration of the report of the Special
Conmittee to whom was referred back Bill B,
an Act respecting Divorce and Matrimonial
Causes.
Honourable memHon. Mr. TANNER:
bers, I move the adoption of this report.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
Would my
honourable friend allow me to interject here
something which is new to me, and which I
think the House should have an opportunity
of considering? I may say that I am not trying to retard consideration of the report,
but the bonourable gentleman from North
York (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth) has called
my attention to the fact that there are some
clauses of the Bill which are under provincial,
not federal, jurisdiction. This error bas been
made, I suppose, by reason of the Bill being
a copy of the statute in force in Great
Britain, where there are no provincial
institutions.
Here is Sir Allen's note, made in his own
handwriting:
The clauses dealing with extension of grounds
for annulling marriages and legitinacy of
children of sucli marriages are matters of
provincial jurisdiction, not Dominion.
In these circumstanccs. with provincial
rights in the air, and many objections to the
thing- tie federal authorities are undertaking,
would it net be wise to postpone this matter
until the beginning of next week, when Sir
Allen will be here to present his views to the
House? The promoters of the Bill would be
in a mucth better position if they could be
assured that it was not ultra vires of this
Parliament. If it be true, as Sir Allen has
assured me it is, that we have no jurisdiction
with regard to particular sections of the Bill,
but that they come under the jurisdiction of
the provinces, I think it would be wise to
postpone consideration of this report until Sir
Allen can be present. Otherwise we should
only be inviting trouble with the provinces.

MAY 5, 1938
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Doles Sir
Allen's letter indicate what sections have to
do with annulment or the legitirnacy of
ohildren?
Rigiht Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: It is just a
note.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: 1 arn convinced now that matters affecting the validity
of marriage have 'been decided to be provincial. Whether they should have been or
not I have the very gravest doubt; but that
they have been I have no doubt. Therefore
anything connected with the validity of
marriage itself must now be recognized as
provincial. In running my eye over the Bi
1 cannot find just what Sir Allen refera te.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYE: I Vhink he bas
reference to the custody of the children.
Hon. Mr. MIJRDOCK: I do not; think there
is anything that deals with the care or legitimacy of children.
Hon. Mr. BALIANTYE: I think tihere is.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Oh, yes. Section
13, subsection 2, says:
Any child born of a marriage avoided
pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of section
twelve shall be a legitimate child of the
parents thereto notwithstanding 6uch avoidance.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is truc.
Hon. MÉ. MURDOCK: Then subsection 3:
Nothing in this section or in section twelve
shall be conetrued as validating any marriage
which is by law void, but with respect to which
a decree of nullity has nlot been granted.
Riglht Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There can b
no question as to our right to enact subsection 3, but subsection 2 is quite a different
matter.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: If I *may, I
shahl hand this note to the right honourable
leader ýopposite. It would do no harrn te let
tVhis matter go over to next week.
Hon. Mr. COTE: On the question of ultra
vires, I may point out that section 15 of the
Bill deals with the solemnization of marriage.
That is clearly a subject 'Wçhich is within the
jurisdiction of the provinces.
Hon. Mr. DUEF: I would suggest that the
chairman of the committee be alhowed to file
his report, se that it may be printed in the
Minutes of the Proce-edings, and that consideration be deferred until next Monday.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: It is in the Minutes
of the Proceedings now.

ZMt

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I may say that
when Mr. O'Connor, the Law Clerk, went over
tihe Bill he, had some doubt as to one or two
features rnentioned by the right honourable
leader on this side of the House (Rig-ht Hon.
Mr. Meighen), but it wa-s thought that if
those features were beyond the jurisdiction of
the Dominion no harm would be done by
allowing thern to remain in the Bill, se that
the provincial legisiatures could either reject
them or adopt them, as they deemed fit.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Honourable
members. my duty has been perforrned.
While 1 do not desire to retard consideration
of the report at ail, I think, considering the
circumstances, it would be the part of wisdom
to postpone this subject so that Sir Allen may
lay his proposition before the House on
Tuesday next. The lawyers in the House
rnight agree with Sir Allen. H1e seemed to be
very definite about it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: 1 arn entirely
agreeable to leaving the Bill over until
Tuesday next, but, so that it may appear
upon the record, I should like to say that 1
hope Sir Allen will in the meantime have
prepared such amendments as he thinks will
best achieve the end he has in mmnd, the
elimination of what he deems to bc purely
provincial. and, if it is essential for the
purposes of the Bill, the substitution of a
clause which is within our jurisdiction. As I
look at the Bill hastily I cannot see that any
substitution will be necessary, but if it is, we
should have it here so that we may put the
Bill into the form in which it ought to be.
Then, the debate can take place on the merits
and not on the question of jurisdiction.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: In the Rivière du
Loup case of the Fraser Estate, the Privy
Council held that although, according to our
lights, there was no regular marriage, the
marriage under the blanket held good; and
the child of the squaw got the same rights
as if there had been a regular marriage.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Would honourable
gentlemen like me to move that consideration
of the report be set down for Tuesday?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I arn pleased to do
that.
Consideration of the report was postponed
until Tuesday next.

266

SENATE

QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE
Hon. CHARLES TANNER: Honourable
members, I did not intend to discuss this
report, but I have a few observations to make,
which I intended to make on the Orders of
the Day, and have deferred until now at the
request of the honourable the leader of the
House.
I want to refer to some comments made
yesterday by the honourable the junior
member from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig)
wbich strike me as constituting a rather serious
reflection on the special committee that
considered the Bill just disposed of, and upon
myself as chairman of that committee. I quite
acquit the bonourable member of any intention
to say anything incorrect or even unkind about
myself or the committee; but I am a little
surprised that an honourable member of long
parliamentary experience, not only in provincial
legislatures, but also here, should make the
stateiuents which be made yesterday. I was
unable to follow the bonourable gentleman
with
certainty yesterdav,
and therefore
deferred my comments until I should see his
words recorded in Hansard. I did bave a
gineral impression from the rema rks of the
honourable memsber that there was coming
upon us some sort of constitutional crisis, or
that freedon of speech was in deadly peril.
J should not liave expected a member with
the experience of the honourable gentleman
toehe rither dismayed or turned aside from
bis intended activity by a few questions in a
committee. or even by someone asking wbether
or not he was a member of that committee.
It appears from what he says, however, that
he was very much impressed by the irrelevant
talk that went on around the committee table.
I now want to point out just what the
honourable gentleman said.
It appears at
page 280 of yesterday's Hansard.
J should have liked to speak in the committee
this morning, but I was refused that right.
That is a very positive and rather comprehensive statement. I mentioned a moment
ago the long experience of the honourable
member. He knows as well as I do, I am
sure, that a refusal by a committee to bear
him would require a vote of that committee;
that otherwise the chairman-in this case
myself-would be taking a high-handed
position in refusing to bear him; and that if
the chairman did that be would still be subject
to the will of the committee. All I have to
say is that there was absolutely no refusal to
hear the bonourable member, no refusal of
the committee to meet him. Yet he puts on
record-as 1 say, I believe it is done unintentionally. and somewhat hastily-a statement
that is not correct as a matter of fact.
Hon. MIr. TANNER.

Then he goes on to say:
I rose to discuss amendments to the Bill,
and at once an honourable gentleman objected
to my speaking and asked, "Is the honourable
gentleman a member of this committee?" The
chairmcan said, " No." This indicated to me
that I was not wanted in the committee at all.
The chairman refused te protect me: he did not
ask the ionourable member who objected to
sit down. Then the honourable member who
objected to my presence immediately made an
effort to have me prohibited from speaking on
the Bill before the committee.
Now, that is a rather serious allegation to
make against any committee of this House.
When the bonourable junior member from
Winnipeg says that the chairman said "No,"
I give that a distinct and positive denial. I
never said "No." I said nothing whatever
in reference to the matter; I made no answer
wliatever.
Withb regard to his statement that the
chairmsan refused to protect him, and did not
ask the honourable meinber who objected to
sit down, I will now relate precisely what
happened.
Tie honourable junior member
from Winnipeg was on his feet addressing
the comnittee, at the far end of the table.
The lionourable senior memsber from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. McMeans). the sponsor of
the Bill, was sitting at my left hand. He
rose and interrupted my honourable friend
ci
the junior member. I at once asked the
lionourable senior memnber to sit down and
not interrupt the honourable junior miemsber,
and the honourable senior memiber immediately did sit down. My honourable friend the
junior member then proceeded with his address to the conimittee. I listened to him,
and wien ie hurriedly left the room I thouglt
ho had concluded his address. I never asked
hsin to stop; I never suggested that ie should
stop.
And no iember of the con1mittee
suggested that lie should stop. Some few
words passed between himself and the honourable senator froin Leeds (Hon. Mr.
Hardy). but tlhey were irrelevant to wlat I
am saving; they referred to another aspect
of the matter.
I am making these remarks with the kindest
of feelings for my honourable friend across
the wav (Hon. Mir. Haig), but I want to put
the matter right. In the very statement I
have read he admits that nobody drove him
axxay frocs the coimittee; all be says is,
"This indicated to ie that I was not wanted
in the coimmittee at aIl.'
Well, tise chairman and memsbers of a committee cannot get
into Ilie msind of an honourable member. All
I can say is that not one of the fifteen members told hiici to go out or to stop speaking.
J am surprised that an honourable gentleman
of his long and figiting experience in par-

MAY 5, 1938

liaments should have been dismayed at any
thought that he was not wanted at the committee. He should have stuck to his guns
and said every word that he had to say.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I do not know whether the honourable
gentleman spoke under privilege or under the
motion that was made. If his statement was
made under privilege, I have no right to
reply; if it was under the motion, I have a
right to say something.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
carried.

The motion was

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Then lie was out of order,
and the Speaker should not have allowed him
to proceed. I do not know whether I should
say anything now.
An Hon. SENATOR:

Proceed.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yesterday I went to the
committee and listenedHon. Mr. TANNER: Mr. Speaker, this is
not a debatable question. I quite realize that
we are not very strict about rules here, but
I submit that, my honourable friend having
made his statement and I having made mine,
he has no right to debate in the matter.
I asked the Speaker
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
to rule. The motion had been carried before
the honourable gentleman from Pictou (Hon.
Mr. Tanner) spoke; therefore lie was out of
order. If the House allowed him to speak
when lie was out of order, I have a right to
be allowed to reply. However, I am absolutely in the hands of the House. If honourable members say I am not allowed to go on,
I will sit down. The honourable gentleman
from Pictou is trying to give me the same
treatment now that I got yesterday; he is
trying to prevent me from saying anything.
If the House will permit me, I should like to
say something, but if I cannot get permission
I am quite willing to sit down.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I would direct
the attention of the House to Rule 41, which
says:
Whenever a matter or question directly
concerning the privileges of the Senate or of
any committee or member thereof, has arisen,
a motion calling upon the Senate to take action
thereon may be moved, without notice, and
shall, until decided, unless the debate be
adjourned, suspend the consideration of other
motions as well as Orders of the Day.
There is no motion before the House just
now, but I am sure the honourable member
will be allowed to make any remarks he
wishes in reply to the statement by the honourable senator from Pictou (Hon. Mr.
Tanner).

267

Honourable members,
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
I went to the committee yesterday because
when the Bill was before the House and I
objected to certain clauses in it, J was invited
to attend the meeting of the committee. I
listened to the discussion of the Bill in committee by the honourable the senior senator
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. McMeans). When
he had finished and sat down I rose to speak.
I made one statement and he immediately
got up and objected strenuously and then
lie and I had quite a few words. During all
this time the honourable chairman of the
committee (Hon. Mr. Tanner) never interfered for one minute; he just sat as still as
an oyster. Then after I had talked some
time, having refused to yield the floor to the
honourable senior senator from Winnipeg,
he sat down. Then the honourable gentleman
from Brockville got upHon. Mr. HARDY: Make it "Leeds."
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The honourable gentleman
from Leeds (Hon. Mr. Hardy) got up and
asked, "Is the honourable senator a member
of this committee?"
Hon. Mr. DUFF: He was just curious.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, he was not. He did
not say it that way: he said it to indicate
that I was not required any longer in the
committee. During all this time the chairman
made no attempt at interferenceHon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I say a word?
I was sitting alongside the chairman and I
distinctly heard him say to the honourable
senior senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
McMeans): " Sit down. The junior senator
has the floor."
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I am quite candid in
stating that if he said that I did not hear him
at all.
I spoke yesterday because I had the impression that our ruie was the same as obtains in
the Provincial Legislature of Manitoba, that
a non-member of a committee cannot take
any part in discussion at a committee sitting
without consent of the committee. I did not
know I had an absolute right to speak, and
when my right was challenged by an honourable senator whom I presumed to be a member
of the committee, for I did not imagine that
he himself was not a member, and when no
protection was given me by the chairman-in
fact, the proverbial oyster "had nothing on "
the chairman at that time-I withdrew from
the room.
I certainly had no intention whatever of
insulting the honourable chairman, nor the
honourable senior senator from Winnipeg, nor
the honourable senator from Leeds. But I did

268

SENATE

feel that the treatment I received showed I
was not wanted at the committee, and I
withdrew.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Was the honourable
gentleman not asked by the chairman to
continue his speech?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I heard the honourable
gentleman from Manitou (Hon. Mr. Sharpe)
ask me to go on.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: I heard several members
of the committee.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Five or six of us
asked you to continue.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: As I considered my right
to be there at all was questioned, I thought I
ought to get out.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Most of us asked
you to stay and finish, but you were " mad"
and you quit.
The Senate adjourned until Monday, May 9,
at 8 p.m.

LORD'S DAY

BILL

MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE OF COMMONS

The Hon. the SPEAKER:
Honourable
members. a message has been received from
te lIHouse of Commons in the following
words:

Resolved, that a message be sent to the
Senate to acquaint their Honours that this
House disagrees to their amendment to Bill
No. 13, an Act to amend the Lord's Day Act,
for the following reasons:
1. The amendment penalizes the corporation,
while the object of the Bill was to impose the
penalty for breach of the Lord's Day Act on
any person being a director, officer, superintendent or employee of a corporation;
2. The amendment will be ineffective inasmuch as it does not raise the minimum penalty
imposed by the present statute;
3. The imposition of fines without imprisonment has no practical effect in offences against
such a law as the Lord's Day Act.
When shall this message be taken into
consideration?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I move that the
message be taken into consideration on Thursday next.
The motion was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT

BILL

INQUIRIES

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, before the Orders of the Day are called,
I should like to ask the honourable leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand),
when we may receive a copy of the opinion
of the Department of Justice on Bill 12, an
Act to amend the Copyright Amendment
Act. 1931.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
My honourable friend might perhaps have asked his
question when I moved that the Bill be
referred back to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce. That motion was
carried and the Bill is still before the committee. I was intending to give the committee the opinion of the Department of
External Affairs and that of the Department
of Justice at the same time. As there is
nothing before the House just now relating
to this matter, I shall in the meantime pass
these two opinions to my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
I should also like to
inquire from the honourable Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce when that committee will sit to consider this Bill.
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honorable senators,
at the present time I am not in a position to
answer that question.
Since coming back
here to-day I have been given to understand
that arrangements have been made for the
special committee inquiring into the railway
problem to hold sittings on Tuesday, Wedncsday and Thursday of this week. If I am
rithtly informed in that respect, would it be
possible to have this Bill taken up by the
Banking and Commerce Committee on Friday
of this week?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would draw
the honourable chairman's attention to the
fact that requests have been received from a
considerable number of parties who desire to
be heard before the committee. There will
be time to notify them of the committee's
next sitting. if that is to be on Friday.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I should like to have
the committee called for Friday, because if
that is done il will be possible to notify
persons who have intimated a desire to be
present. As chaiman of the committee I have
received from interested parties a number of

it may as well be on the railway inquiry. So
Friday wouhl be suitable for this committee.
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 40, an Act to amend the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police Act.
He said: Honourable senators, there are
two main amendments in this Bili.
As the law now stands, it provides that the
time served in the permanent forces of Canada may be included in the term of service of
an officer for the purpose of pension under
part II of this Act. This Bill inserts the words
"naval, military or air" in the expression
"permanent forces of Canada." It has not
been clear under existing statutory definitions
that the expression "permanent forces of Canada" included the naval and air forces as well
as the military. It has always been the intention to include these services.
The other amendment has to do with
reservists of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police. Honourable senators will remember
that last year we created a reserve corps, and
we enacted the following clause:
Every member of such reserve on being
called up for duty or training will be subject
to this Act, and all rules and regulations made
thereunder from the date of his being called
up, which date shall be the day on which he
is advised by registered letter to report himself
for duty.
The Bill restricts the application of this
section so that a reservist shall not be entitled
to all the benefits of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police Act, such as pensions, etc.,
unless he is injured or killed on duty. Under
the section enacted last year, reservists were
entitled to all the privileges of the permanent
police force.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I have no objection whatever to the
naval and air services being placed on the
same footing as the military in regard to
pensions.
There are a couple of questions that I
should like to ask the Government. Prior to
1922, when the Naval College was closed, a
number of Canadian cadet graduates were
placed every year in the Imperial Navy and
paid by our own Government. If any of these
cadets have joined the Canadian Navy, will

the number of years they spent in the Imperial service count the same as if they had
been spent in the Canadian Navy?
My second question is this. When the
"Aurora" was in commission she carried a
complement of something like 318, all ratings,
and when she was tied up a great many of her
officers and other ratings were sent adrift.
If any of those who were then let out of the
service have since rejoined, would the time
they spent on the "Aurora" count for pension
purposes?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am not in a
position to give the information asked for by
my honourable friend. My intention was to
suggest that we go into Committee of the
Whole on the Bill. If we finish with that
stage to-night I shall give my honourable
friend the desired information on the third
reading to-morrow.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine in the Chair.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-Act not to apply except as
specified:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is a consequential amendment.
Section 2 was agreed to.
Sections 3 to 7, inclusive, were agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed to.
The Bill was reported without amendment.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. T. HAIG moved the second reading
of Bill B2, an Act to incorporate the Workers
Benevolent Society of Canada.
He said: The Workers Benevolent Society
of Canada is now a provincial society in
Manitoba, and the purpose of this Bill is to
secure Dominion incorporation. The society
carnes on benefit and insurance work solely for
the protection of its members and not for
profit. It will be observed that by section 16
the Canadian and British Insurance Companies
Act, 1932, is made applicable to the society.
I regret that I know the name of only one
of the incorporators, but full information can
be furnished when the Bill is before the
Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private
Bills.

271

MAY 10, 1938
original company are virtually ail owned by
companies, there was a littie difficulty in
getting directors; so the privilege was sought
of appointing as a director any person who
is an employee. Ini the House of Commons
it was objected that this was flot in accordance with the ordinary principle of corn
pany law, and that nobody could be a director
who was flot also a shareholder. Hence the
amendment providing that a director must
be a shareholder.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That is ail right.
Rîght Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: 1 feel more
fortified now that 1 have the imprimatur of
the honoùrable senator opposite (Hon. Mr.
Casgrain).Hon. Mr. CASCRAIN: You could not get
any better.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHE'N: -but 1 do
flot see why a director should be an employee.
Under the Iaw a shareholder is entitled to be
a director. As the Bill now reads, he may be
appointed a director if he is an employee.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Quite right.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is a mystery
to me. Many companies are owned by other
companies, but they get their directors 'by
placing shares in the names of individual employees merely for the purpose of qualiiying
them as directors. This company can do the
sanie. Why it should not be allýowed to make
directoTs of persons who are not employees I
do not know.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I think the comment of the right honourable gentleman is
very appropriate. But this is what was done
in the House of Commons I arn only acting
as sponsor oi the Bill. I have no interest in
it whatever. 1 understand that there was
serious objection in the House of Commons to
the way the Bill was drafted, and that as a
compromise they put in these words. The
matter appeals to me as it appeals to the
right honourable gentieman-that if one is a
shareholder that is all he needs to be. I
cannot really see what made this amendment
n:ecessary. However, the Bill received the
careful attention of the Commons, and passed
in that way, and I bow to their decision.
Right. Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: I would suggest that the amendment, instead of being
now confirmed, be referred again to our
PTîvate Bis Committee, by whom it can
easily be re-worded so that any shareholder
can be a director, as is the case with any
other company, and there will be no exception

in this instance. There may be the additional
advantage of listening again to the honourable
senator whose voice we so rarely hear.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:- Not a few
companies to-day are taking their employees
more and more into their confidence, and are
giving them shares so that they may have
something to say about the management.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN : That is
quite right.
H-on. Mr. ROBINSON: 1 quite agree to the
suggestion made. I arn not quite clear in my
own mind on this. I will move that the
amendment be referred to the Committee
on Miscellaneous Prîvate Bills, if it is in order
to do so. I may be wrong.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: May I suggest
to the honourable member that the message
be taken into consideration to-morrow?
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Can the message ba

referred to a committee?
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: Yes.

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Then I move that
the message 'ha referred to the Standing
Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bils.
The motion was agreed to.
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED
BILL

POLICE

THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third
reading of Bill 40, an Act to amend the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the honourable senator who xvas leading the other aide
of the House last night (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne)

put a couple of questions to me apropos of
this Bill. I told him that I would procure the
answers and give them on third reading.
I now have the following statement iromn
Colonel L. R. LaFleche, Deputy Minister of
the Department of National Defence:
With reference to the Debates of the Senate,
No. 27, dated May 9, 1938 (page 304), in
which the Hon. C. C. Ballantyne asks the
following questions:
(1) Prior to 1922, when the Naval College

was

closed,

a number

of Canadian

cadet

graduates were placed every year in the
Imperial Navy and paid by our own Government. If any of these cadets have joined the
Canadian Navy, will the number of years they
spent in the Imperial service count the same
as if they had been spent in the Canadian
Navy?
(2) When the "Aurora" was in commission
she carried a complement of somnething like 318.
ail ratings, and when she was tied up a great
many of her officers and other ratings were

272

SENATE

sent adrift. If any of those who were then
let out of the service have since rejoined, would
the ýtime they spent on the 'Aurora" count for
pension purposes?
I have the honour to advise you as follows:
(1) All time served by officers of the Royal
Canadian Navy in H.M. ships and establishments counted for all Canadian Naval purposes,
on exactly the same basis as time served in
H.M.C. ships and establishments.
(2) All time served by officers and ratings
in the Royal Canadian Navy prior to 1922, in
respect of any officers or ratings discharged
and subsequently re-entered, counted as time
for all Canadian Naval purposes, including pension time subject to the provisions of the
Pension Act.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.
DIVORCE AND MATRIMONIAL
CAUSES BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

On the Order:
Consideration of the report of the special
committee to whom was referred back Bill B,
an Act respecting Divorce and Matrimonial
Causes.-Hon. Mr. Tanner.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Honourable members,
I move that this Order be discharged and set
down for consideration at the next sitting of
the House.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
gentlemen. the special committee on Railways stands adjourned until 4 o'clock this
afternoon.
If this Order is now set over
until to-morrow, we shall have half an hour
during which we can do nothing. I suggest
we go ahead with the debate until 4 o'clock.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: I made the motion at
the request of the honourable leader of the
House.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am making
the suggestion on my own responsibility.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Since I suggested that this matter be adjourned, my
right honourable friend has proposed that we
should go on until 4 o'clock. I have had no
time to turn around and ask the honourable
s;enator from North York (Hon. Sir Allen
Aylesworth) whether he is ready to proceed.
I had told him the Order would be postponed
until to-morrow.
Hon. SIR ALLEN AYLESWORTH: Honourable senators, I wish te acknowledge gratefully the kindness and courtesy of the honourable cha.irman of the special committee (Hon.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Mr. Tanner) in moving last week that consideration of this report should stand until
to-day.
I notice in reading Hansard of last Thursday that a suggestion was put upon the record
that if I wished to say anything with reference
to this Bill I should come prepared with
amendments. I have not attempted to prepare
any, for the reason that there is no amendment I can think of that would make the
provisions of this Bill any the less objectionable to me than they already are.
I am opposing adoption of the report of
the committee because they have not taken
out of the Bill sections that I think would
better have been taken out, and because
sections of it are there which to my mind
are not within the competence of this Parliament to enact.
When consideration of the report was first
moved, last week the honourable the junior
member from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig)
sta.ted that his objection to the committee's
report consisted, in the first place at any
rate, in the fact that they had recommended
dropping from the Bill the clause which limits,
or tends to limit, the extent of divorce proceedings that may be undertaken; the clause
that provides for a three years' trial marriage-I suppose one may call it-before any
application for divorce could be entertained.
The honourable gentleman desired to oppose
adoption of the report because it recommended
dropping that clause. I, too, oppose adoption
of the report, and with regard to that particular clause -which has been dropped, I
think it is the only one in the Bill that I
should be willing to support and content to
have appear upon the Statute Book: it is
the only clause which in any way seeks to
limit the operation of our divorce law.
Because I am opposed to the whole Bill,
as well as to this report, which does not
strike out enough of the Bill, I have no
doubt that what I wish to say in opposition
would be more in point if the report had been
adopted and the motion before the House
were for third reading of the Bill. But I
shall at once refer to the clauses which to me
seem certainly not within the competence of
this Parliament, and which therefore, in my
opinion, ought to have been taken out of
the Bill by the committee.
Our right to deal with the subject depends
entirely upon the language of the British
North America Act-our Constitution. I ask
honourable members to consider the exact
limitations upon the jurisdiction and authority
of this Parliament.

MAY 10, 1938
In the first place I refer to section 92. What
is the authority of provincial legislatures with
reference to this subject of marriage? The
section provides that in each province the
Legislature may exclusively make laws relating to matters coming- within the subject;and then the subject follows: the solemnization of marriage in the province. With reference, then, to matters coming within that
description, "the solemnization of marriage in
the province," power to legislate is purely
and wholly a provincial matter.
Section 91, which defines the jurisdiction of
this Parliament, fits in exa*ctly with the language of the other section. It provides that it
shall be lawful for Parliament to make laws
in relation to all matters not coming within
subjects assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces. Wherever you have
any subject assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces, then that subject is
one in relation to which the Dominion Parliament has no power to legislate. Accordingly,
all matters relating to the solemnization of
marriage are for provincial legislation, not in
any way for Dominion legislation. The general subject of marriage is within the competence of the Dominion Parliament; but out
of that larger field is taken the particular
matter of the manner in which the marriage
contract can be validly entered into, and upon
that particular branch of the general subject
of marriage this Parliament has no power to
legislate.
Now, I ask honourable senators to consider the next subject upon which power to
legislate is conferred by the Constitutiondivorce. As to divorce, provincial legislatures
have no power whatever; the whole subject of
divorce is for this Parliament, and for this
Parliament alone, to legislate upon. But in
this connection we must remember what
divorce is. A definition of it is given by someone who prepared the explanatory notes to
this Bill; and I would not seek to offer any
better definition. "Divorce means," it is said,
"dissolution of marriage." There you have
it in three words. Divorce necessarily assumes
a valid marriage. If the marriage is not valid
there can be no dissolution of it; it does not
exist. Divorce, therefore, applies only to cases
where there is existing a marriage which is
valid, and that marriage is the one dissolved
by the divorce.
Accordingly, where the question is as to the
validity of the marriage, it is a subject not
of divorce at all, but of a proceeding for
declaration of nullity-for declaration that the
marriage never possessed legal validity. And
that is exactly the matter which, by the British

273

North America Act, is assigned to the provincial legislatures alone. As those legislatures
have the exclusive authority to enact the
manner in which marriage is to be solemnized,
so it necessarily follows that the proceeding
to have some competent authority declare that
a particular marriage never did possess legal
validity is one entirely under control of provincial legislation.
That is the point of my objection as to
the clauses of the Bill that I am about to
refer to. But before doing that I want to
say just one thing more about the necessary
and complete distinction and difference there
is between divorce and proceedings for the
nullifying of marriage. Divorce necessarily
proceeds upon the assumption of a valid
marriage to start with, and then the ground
for divorce must be, and always is, something
which has taken place after the valid marriage has been entered into. A proceeding to
annul a marriage is utterly different; in fact,
in many senses, it is the exact reverse. A
proceeding to declare a marriage null takes
place upon the ground of something which
existed at or before the time the contract
of marriage was entered into. It is a proeeeding to have it authoritatively declared
that there never was a valid marriage. And
that makes the distinction between the Dominion's jurisdiction over divorce, which is
exclusive, and the jurisdiction of the province over proceedings for annulment, which
is equally exclusive.
The committee have seen fit to leave in
the Bill sections 12, 13, 14 and 15. None
of those sections deals with divorce at all.
Each of them deals with this proceeding for
annulment. Take section 12. The sidenote is:
New grounds for decree of nullity.
Then the section states the new grounds. I
hardly need to refer to them in detail. But
suppose it is found by the courts that one
of the parties to the marriage was subject to
recurrent fits of insanity or epilepsy: that is
to be a ground for setting aside the marriage.
My submission is that this Parliament has
no power to make it so. That is a matter
with regard to which provincial legislatures
alone have authority to pass laws.
On the second reading of this Bill there
was some discussion about newspaper reports
of decisions for annulment from one of the
provinces of this country, and I think that if
I had heard it, I should have liked to take
part in it at the time. With reference to
such decisions I would suggest that newspaper writers, and everybody else, ought to
remember that they are decisions of judges
of the courts. Those judges have simply the

51958-18
EEVISED
EDITION

274

SENATE

duty to administer the laws that are put
before them. Each province has the right
te make its own laws with reference to the
manner in which a marriage within its territory must be solemnized. If any provincial
legislature chose to say that within its province marriage should be solemnized only by
the parties appearing before some appointed
officer of the Crown and registering their
desire or consent to be married, that provincial legislature would have perfect authority
so te legislate; and if it did so legislate
every judge of that province would be conpelled of necessity to hold that the solemnization of marriage in that manner was the
only legal form of solemnization se far as
that province was concerned. Equally is it
truc that if the law of any province provided,
as the law of the old province of Upper Canada did for many and many a long year after
the province was first settled, that marriages could be solemnized only before a
priest of the Roman Catholie Church or a
priest of the Anglican Church, that law would
have to prevail. And when people in some
other province complain that in, say, Ontarie, judges arc holding a marriage invalid
because it was net solemnized before a clergyman of some particular church, it ought to
be remembered that the law of the province required the marriage te be so solemnized, and that the judge could do nothing
under the law but administer it as he found
it. The question of what the provincial law
ought te be is none of our business; that is
fer each provincial legislature; and no doubt
each provincial legislature makes its marriage
laws, just as it makes its other laws, those
which the majority of its people want.
Now, te come back te the section that I was
discussing. it is here proposed that the
Dominion Parliament should enact a clause
which would afford a new and additional
ground for annulling a marriage. declaring that
a marriage whiclh has been solemnized according te the law of the province never had any
legal validity, because one of the parties was
liable to recurrent fits of epilepsy. Well, I do
net know why epilepsy should be singled out
as the one disease of the body which would
justify the annulment of a marriage. The
old-fashioned idea used to be that marriage
was te be for better or for worse; that if, by
affliction, one of the spouses needed the more
the help and sympathy of the other in a case
of illness, or even in the case of insanity, that
was the very time when the sanctity of the
marriage contract ought to be most carefully
observed. But under this Bill the affliction of
insanity is a ground for divorce.
If an
unfortunate married woman becomes insane,
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH.

she has no right te any further claim upon the
protection of a husband who wants to get
rid of ber. If this Bill becomes law, he may
divorce her as soon as ho can get into court
te take the necessary proceedings.
As te the provisions affording additional
grounds for annulling marriage, I content
myself for the moment with pointing out that
they are te my mind clearly beyond the
competence of this Parliament te enact.
In one of the subclauses of section 13 it is
provided that any child born of a marriage
which bas been annulled upon a certain ground
shall be a legitimate child. Surely nothing
could be a plainer invasion of the exclusive
power of the provincial legislatures te legislaite
upon a question of civil rights, upon a
question of the status of the individual. Here
is a child born of a marriage which some
competent authority afterwards declares never
had any legal validity. But this merciful
legislature, this Parliament of Canada, is
saying that that child. none the less, shall be
legitimate. Well, the legitimacy of that child,
however proper it might be te declare it, is a
matter with regard te which I venture to
express the clear opinion that this Parliament
ha 0 no power in the world te legislate.
The clauses which follow are really but
riders. Section 14 empowers the provincial
court-for, of course, it is a provincial court
always-to order the provision of alimony
and the settlement of the wife's property.
That is something the provincial courts have
been doing ever since they were constituted,
without any regard te nullification of marriage
or to divorce. They had nothing to do with
those things, but through all the years that
the courts have existed, in Ontario at any
rate, the power to award alimony to a deserted
wife has frequevntly been exerciscd. The settlement
of the property of tle wife is
another subject that is se clearly within the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
provincial
legislature over property and civil rights within
the province that it seems idle to labour the
question at all.
But subclause 2 of clause 14 of the Bill goes
even further. It says:
The court may, if it thinks fit, on any decree
of divorce or nullity of marriage, order the
husband, or (in the case of a petition for

divorce by a wife on the ground of her
husband's insanity) order the wife to secure
for the benefit of the children such gross sum

of money or annual surn of money as the court
may deem reasonable.

What on earth has this Parliament to do
with a matter of that sort? A few years ago,
when it was proposed here in this House to
transfer the jurisdiction over divorce to the
courts of Ontario, I opposed the proposal as

275

MAY 10, 1938
strongly as I could, upon the simple ground
that it was widely opening the door to the
increase of divorce applications in the province. The answer that was made across the
floor from the honourable member who was
then chairman of the Divorce Committee was,
"But we have no power over alimony, the
custody of the cbildren, or provisions for the
wife or child." Well, surely my honourable
friends who favour legislation of this sort
cannot have it both ways. When they wanted
to widen the power to divorce by transferring it to the courts of the province they
argued, in favour of their proposaI, "We have
no power over alimony or the custody of the
children." 1 agree that that is true. But
now, when additional grounds for nullification
are sought to ho conferred upon the provincial
courts, the argument is turned just the other
way, and it is now proposed that this Parliament empower those courts to award alimony,
to, settie property for the maintenance of
children, and to deal with the whole matter as
only a provincial court and a provincial legislature have power to do.
I might notice, just in finishing, the clause
to which the honourable gentleman from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Côté) called attention the
other day. providing that no clergyman shall
be compelled or bound to solemnize the
marriage of any person whose former marriage
has been dissolved on any ground. Did anyone ever heur, in this country, at any rate, of
any clergyman being compelled or bound to
solemanize a marriage if he did not want to do
it? Or is there any pretence for speaking of
this provision as something necessary? It
seems to me a wholly ridiculous thing, so f ar
as this country, at any rate, is concerned. I
suppose such a clause is in the English Act,
of which this Bill is said to be in part a copy;
and possibly recent public events in connection witb the marriage of the most prominent
man in the Empire had something to do with
the enactment of this particular clause. So
far as C'anada is concerned, it would seem
to me to be like the proverbial chip in
porridge: no good, certainly, and perhaps not;
particularly harmful. But I wonder that the
committee should have thought it advisable
to leave such a clause in a Bill to ha placed
upon our Statute Book.
As to, the whole matter, 1 am root and
branch opposed to this legislation. I intend,
if given the opportunity in a recorded vote, to
vote against the third reading of the Bill, no
matter what, if any. changes are made ini it
before that time cornes. And 1 put it, for
myseif, at any rate, upon this short and simple
ground. It is not on my part any conscientious
feeling that marriage is necessarily a sacra51958S-i

ment of the Church. but I know that conscientious feeling is deep-rooted in the hearts
of many, many of my best friends, and 1 am
not willing to sit in Parliament and concur
in putting on the Statute Book anything which
would

do

DIVORCE AND MATRIMONIAL CAUSES
BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned débate on the report of the Special
Committee to wh.om was referred back Bill
B, an Act respecting Divorce and M-atrimonial Causes.
Hon. GEORGE LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Honourable members, I do not intend to discuss this question on the -ground which ýCatholies usually take when discussing it. I know
that in divorce matters the question of religion
and morality is "out of the window'~ We

Catholics do, as the honourable member from
North York (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth) stated
yesterday, conscientiously abject to divorce.
We do so because we are brought up to
accept the teachings of our Church. We must,

if we

are proper members of the Roman

Catholic Cýhurcb,

I, from my

listen to our ýteachers, and

childhood,

have been taught

to, obey the injunction which every clergyman
addresses to people who are about to marry:

"What therefore God hath joined together,
let ýnot man put asunder." We, as you have
heard repeatedly-and I amn not going to
refer to it in extenso-4believe, as do many
other Christians, that matrimony is a mystic
union. There are Cthers who regard it as a
commercial deal. Those who regard it as a
com.mercial deal caminot be experted to aecept
our point of view, and we who, regard it as a
religious and moral question canriot be expected to, accept their point of view. There
is no use in their addressing their arguments
to us, nor in our addressing our arguments

Hon. Mr. HAXIG: Wili my honourable

Hon. Mr. LYNCI1-STAUN-ýTO-N: That is
wbat I mean. I have heard it arguod bore
that ularriage hs a more contract, nething
more and nothing less.
Noix, divorce is a mnocîcrn invention. It was
unknown in the British Empire untýil 1858

MAY 11, 1938
According to some people, cruelty justifying
a divorce bas consisted in the fact that a
wife went to bed with cold feet; in other
instances ýthat she nagged her husband; in
others that ihe n.agged her.
Hon. Mr. POPE:

What?

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: That lie
nagged her. Perhaps the honourable gentleman and I do not know what that is. We
have had no experience of it.
Hon. Mr. POPE:

Quite right.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Cruelty
may be mental or physical. It is cruelty to
desert a wife for a month. I am glad I shall
net have te study all those books, for I am
out of practice now. I suppose the members
of the committee did net know what cruelty
was and they said, "That is a good phrase;
we will put it in."
Next, they have struck out the most statesmanlike, the wisest and best provision that
I
I ever saw in legislation of this class.
believe the man who inserted that clause in
the Bill was thinking of what be was doing.
It says:
No petition for divorce shall be presented
to or entertained by the court until a period
of three years shall have elapsed since the
date of the marriage.
Were there ever two persons who in the
early days of their marriage did not have
disagreements? Have not some of those disHave they not
agreements been serious?
induced the husband or the wife to go away?
When a young man I knew a young woman
who left her husband the first week after
marriage. She did not return to him for a
year. She brought up a family and lived
to be a weman of eighty years of age. Her
family, of course, are all grown up and have
not te reflect with regret that they are the
children of an abandoned mother or an
abandoned father. In the first three years
of married life husband and wife will become
well acquainted. Many couples marry after
an acquaintance of only a week or two weeks.
If two young and inexperienced persons can
live together without any serious disagreements, a separation on some trivial quarrel
would be something which they might lament
for the rest of their lives. I repeat, I think
that clause was the one piece of statesmanshi in the whole Bill. And it is struck out.
I am very, very sorry.
Another clause, paragraph (b) of section
12 as in the Bill, bas to do wi.th insanity.
The numbering of the sections bas been
altered, though the report does not say so.
That section reads:

277

Subject to section thirteen, in addition to
any other grounds on -wrhich, in the province
and in the court to which the petition bas been
presented, a marriage is by law void or voidable,
a marriage shall be voidable on the ground
(b) that either party to the marriage was at
the time of the marriage either of unsound
mind or a mental defective within the meaning
of any statute in force in the province of the
court concerned or subject to recurrent fits of
insanity or epilepsy.
If they had said that insanity was a ground
for nullity, the applicant would have been
bound to satisfy the court that the defendent
was of unsound mind. But they say: "No:
here it is not necessary to prove it. All you
must do is show that he bas been confined in
an insane asylum, or bas been under control
as a lunatic or a person of unsound mind."
Now, our statute in Ontario provides that a
person who is unable to look after himself or
his property is of unsound mind. It stops
there. Any two doctors may certify that a
man is of unsound mind; that is to say, that
he is unable to look after himself or his property. Then lie can be put into a lunatie
asylum. You read the other day of a man
who was confined in the sanitarium at Guelph
at the instance of his wife and on the certificate, I presume, of two doctors. I do not
know definitely as to that, because the case
came from Quebec. In any event, the wife
got possession of his property. He says that
he never was of unsound mind at all. But he
bas no remedy. In this province, if any two
doctors who are not relations certify that
a man is crazy, lie goes to the asylum. He
may not get out before five or six years. I
know of many who have been detained as long
and have then been discharged as sane. Some
wife might "frame" lier husband and get two
doctors te say that he was insane. In other
words, if they said lie could not look after
himself and his property-and many people
who do not think they are insane cannot do
so-he would be immured in an insane asylum,
and if the wife asked for a divorce the court
would be bound to give it. The court cannot
inquire whether or not lie is sane. She bas
only to prove that he was in the asylum for
the necessary length of time.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I should
like someone to point out anything to the
contrary in the Bill. I have not been able to
find it. I know my honourable friend (Hon.
Sir Allen Aylesworth) thinks it is awful,
terrible, absurd, that there should be such a
law, and I quite agree with him. That, to
my mind, is a serious enough question to be
discussed.

278

SENATF,

Then there is a clause that I arn sure must
have been drawn by an Irishman, for I do
not believe even the Pope ever made a more
extraordinary bull.
It provides that if a
man is absent for a certain oumber of years
and there is no reason tu, tbink bie is alx o,
tbe court shahl presume that lie is dead and
shall thereupon divorce him from bis wife.
This is the first time I bave beard of a living
person and a dead one being divorced.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Are you sure it is
a question of div orce?
Dues it not say
"lannulment"?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STÂIJNTON: I think it
is divorce.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Quote the section.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I may be
wrong. Yes, it is "oullity." Well, the court
can declare the marriage nuil. I can make my
point just as well on that ground as on the
other. According to the English acceptation
of the word "nullity," it means the marriage
nover took place.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:

No.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
In iaw.
Well. if the man descrted hwife tbere roust
bave been a legai marriage, and I wouid ask
wby the court shouid proceed to anoul tbe
marriage if tho man ils dead. I tbink tint

hie is alive, the laxi xxould presume him to, ho
dead. If a man is pre'.umed to ho dead, bis
wxife tan got marriod and bis estato can ho

Wbyv sbould the courts pass
auy kiud of judgm-rent after they bave found
ont that the man is dead? Perhaps my bonourable friand who introduced tbis Bill did not
xvant it to pass, and made it as absurd as
possible.
Hon. -Mr. MeMEANS: It does not say that
at ail.
Hon. Mi'. LYNCH-STAUNTON:

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: It applies to one

Hon. Mr. LYNOH-STAUNTON:
Well,
there are some curious laws. But if that is the
law in all the provinces there is no necessity
for this, because all married persons will have
Government certificates 'to show that they are
sound of wind and limb, and otherwise. At
all events, I think we ought to provide that
diseased people of the class referred to shall
not marry again. That, I think, is worth
considering.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: They might be

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Apart
from all my conscientious objections, which
I have put aside for the purpose of considering this Bill, I shall be willing to admit that
I am wrong in my assertions if any person
will show me that the law is not as I have
stated it.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, I do not desire to speak
on the subject of the merits of this Bill in
the sense in which I ventured to offer a few
remarks some weeks ago, nor particularly
with relation to the nature of marriage itself
and the obligations of those of certain religious beliefs as respects the sanctity of its
contract. What I want to speak about,
solely, is the question of jurisdiction, with
special reference to the address delivered
yesterday by the very distinguished senator
from North York (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth). I cannot help, though, making a
comment on certain words spoken by the
honourable senator from Hamilton (Hon.
Mr. Lynch-Staunton). He said that persons
of his religious faith regarded marriage as
having a religious sanction, and that others
regarded it as a mere commercial contract.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
"Some
others." I said. There are many people not
of my faith who regard marriage as I do.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I did not
take the meaning that no doubt the honourable gentleman desired to give, which he now
repeats. I have only this comment to make:
I know of no religious denomination which
regards the marriage contract as of nothing
beyond commercial significance, nor do I
know of any which does not regard it as a
religious ceremony, with religious sanction.

The honourable senator from Hamilton
quotes, as affirmative of his final conclusion
that there can be no breaking of that contract, the words of Seripture, "What therefore God hath joined together, let not man
put asunder." I wonder whether there is any
real difference, in relation to the injunction
of Scripture, between a declaration of nullity
and a declaration of divorce. If in one of
our provinces-similar remarks would apply
to others-the law enacts that no person
below the age of twenty-one may marry
without parental consent, and therefore a
marriage consummated by a person under
twenty-one without parental consent may be
declared by the courts as a nullity, is it
to be said that on the marriage of a young
girl of twenty years there has been no joining
together at the hands of God, but on the
marriage of a girl of twenty-one the Deity
has interposed?
But I confine myself to the question of
the authority of Parliament to pass this
legislation. I differ very firmly from the
words of the honourable senator who has just
taken his seat (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton)
to the effect that the measure is loosely drawn.
I had nothing to do with the composition
of the Bill, but I have made some study of
it, particularly of late days, and I regard it
as one of the most carefully drawn measures
which have ever come to my attention. Of
course, a Bill may be carefully constructed
and yet transcend our powers, but I am convinced the utmost care has been taken to
keep within the limits of the jurisdiction of
this Parliament in territory perhaps as subject to dispute as any that could possibly be
exposed to us for attention. I have the
greatest regard-we all have-for the views
in matters of law, constitutional and other,
of the honourable senator from North York
(Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth). I do not set
myself up as at all fitted by experience or
equipment to combat a position which he
deliberately takes after careful study, but I
venture in this case to hold and expound an
opinion wholly opposite to his own, and
to justify myself only because I believe that
he has not given to the question that thorough review which is essential in the circumstances.
The problem of where the line ai division
lies between the Federal Parliament and the
legislatures of our provinces in respect of
matters related to marriage has puzzled me
for many a long day. The honourable senator
f·rom North York correctly quotes section 91
of the British North America Act as specifically conferring upon this Parliament jurisdiction in respect of, first, marriage, and,

280

SENATE

second, divorce, and section 92, as specificaily
conferring upon the provincial legislatures
jurisdiction in respect of the solemnization of
marriage. That .the power in respect of
solemnization of marriage is exclusive no one
can dispute.
Thaýt Dominion jurisdiction
wberever specifically conferred is always exclusive is equally beyond dispute. So we
must address ourselves to a discussion of
what is included in the term "solemnization
of niarriage," and, on the other hand, what
naturally and inevitably falls under the terms
"marriage" and "divorce."
As to divorce, there is no controversy. The
honourable senator from Hamilton bas rightly
said that divorce never bhad its source in
the common law of England, nor could any
court of England give a decree of divorce
prior to the passing of the Matrimonial Causes
Act of 1858. But there bad grown up a
jurisprudence as respects marriage, and one
bas to give the closest attention to the
development of that jurisprudence ýas respects
ma<rriage, or, as it was there termed, matrimonial causes, in order to be able to understand clearly what must be the meaning
of the terma "marriage" as expressed in section 91 of the British North America Act.
I approech the subject in this way first
If the honourable senator from North York
is correct in his contention that legitimacy
is not included within the term "marriage."
and that legislation as to legitimacy is not
witiin our purview arising out of our marriage jurisdiction; if lie is right in his statement that provisioning for children when
a valid marriage is aftenvards declared void
for cause is also sometbing not wit hin
our purview under our marnage jurisdiction;
if, further, he is right in saying that it is
beyond our powers ýto provide tbat for stated
statutory reasons a marriage initially valid
may be declared void, I should like the
honourable senator to tell me, when lie can,
what there is in the word "marriage" in the
British North America Act that gives us
any power to enact anything at ail. I afflirm,
after a careful review, that if all these matters
included in this Bill are really beyond our
legislative authority, as they are by him
asserted to be, then there is nothing at al]
upon wbich we can legislate under that marriage jurisdiction. I have put this question
to a great many persons. I first put it to
myself. and I have posed it to other Liawyers,
old and young, and have given them days to
come with an answer, but I have never vet
had an answer. In a word, then, the argument of the honourable senator from North
York means that the jurisdiction which the
British North America Act conferred on this
Riglt

Hon.

Mr. MEIGHEN.

Parliament in respect of marriage was a pure
illusion and gave us no authority to legislate
on anybhing whatever.
If someone advances the argument that our
marriage jurisdiction gives us power to legislate as to who is qualified to be married, all

I need do is quote the Privy Council in the
celebrated reference now known as the Lancaster case, where it is declared that the
provinces, because of their authority under
sole mnization of marriage. can say wo is
competent to enter into the marriage state;
in a word, tiat they. and they' alone, can
legizlate on matters affecting the validity of
marriage. Therefore this conclusion follows.
that under the British North America Act
we get jurisdiction, not at ail in respect of
marriage, but only in respect of dissolution
of marriage. that is, in matters of div orne.
I suggest to honourable members that we
are thus brought to a reductio ad absurdum.
Never could it have been intended by the
framers of that law, and by the great Houses
of Parliament which passed it, that a Parliament created here in Canada should be told
that it had authority to legislate in respect of
marriage, if the words of the statute giving
that authority were mere breath and air and
meant nothing at all.
Then we must proceed to inquire what
there is in respect of marriage upon which
we can legislate. There are some things in
respect of marriage upon which we cannot
pass laws. We cannot pass laws upon that
aspect of marriage which is denominated in the
British North America Act the solemnizatien of marriage. Possibly the word "aspect"
is inadequate: what I refer to is really the
creation of the marriage itself. And under
the Lancaster case we bave to include within
the ambit of the words "solemnization of
marriage" the capa;bility of entering into a
marriage contract.
Now I want to put this postulate to the
House, and I hope to support it with convincing argument-it bas convinced me-that
we can legislate in respect of marriage, minus
the solemnization of marriage, over the whole
field. No one would dispute that assertion
put just in that way. But when we come to
survey the territory included in that phrase
"over the whole field," the name of the field
being marriage, then we must be careful.
The British North America Act was passed
in 1867. As I stated before, there existed at
that time a law of divorce, enacted in 1858.
Prior to that there was no law of divorce, but
a distinct, definite, highly-developed jurisprudence in respect of matrimonial causes; and
the ecclesiastical courts of England gave effect

MAY 11, 1938
to the common law in respect of matrimonial
causes, and included in those matrimonial
causes are all causes affecting marriage. Matrimonial causes, all through the centuries, were
held by the courts of England to be embracive
of everything denominated a cause related te
marriage, and included, it need hardly be
added, matters of nullity, whether antecedent to or coincident with the marriage,
or matters that would give rise to a declaration
of nullity afterwards because of voidability of
the marriage. All those things were included
in the historic term "matrimonial causes."
The field extended further. It took within
the authority of the courts, under this common-law jurisprudence, al.imony, legitimacy
of children, provisioning for children, jactitation of marriage-all these causes having
ta do with matrimony and the matrimonial
state. I submit these facts must have been
within the contemplation of the legislators at
Westminster when they used the word
"marriage" in the British North America Act.
Marriage as understood in the law of England
was accepted in the courts of England as
comprehending the various things I have
named, all related to marriage, all arising out
of the marriage state. If those things were
not in the mind of the legislators at Westminster in 1867, then, when they used the
word "marriage" they had nothing at all in
mind.
It is argued against this view that when
a legislature sets to work to provide, let us
say, for damages assessed against an adulterer
-also a matrimonial cause-this is a matter
of civil rights, and therefore provincial. It
was very forcibly asserted by the honourable
senator from North York (Hon. Sir Allen
Aylesworth) yesterday that the legitimacy of
a child is a matter of civil rights, and therefore wholly within the ambit of the province.
It is contended that the iprovisioning for
children who are a product of a marriage
made void is also a matter of civil rights
and also wholly a provincial power. Al this,
I venture to suggest ta the House, arises
from a misconception of the very genius of
the British North America Act itself. Everything naturally included within a named
power, or reasonably ancillary to the exercise
of that power, whether it be a matter affecting
civil rights or not-and there is nothing in
'the world that does not in -eome way affect
civil rights-is held to be within the specific
designated power, and has been s0 held, I
think consistently, through all .the decisions
of our courts. In this connection, although
I may weary the House a little, I wish te
put upon the record, first of all, a quotation

from an eminent English authority on the
subject. For this, and indeed for much help,
I ami indebted to the very distinguished parliamentary counsel of this House. This quotation is from Browne and Powles on Divorce,
edition of 1889:
"The Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty
Division of the High Court of Justice" inherits
from the Court of Divorce and Matrimonial
Causes, for which it was substituted by the
Judicature Acts of 1873-75, power (partly
given by the substantive enactments of the
Matrimonial Causes Act, 1857, and subsequent
statutes, and partly derived from the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts transferred to
the old court by the 6th section of that Act)
to pronounce decrees of1. Dissolution of marriage;
2. Judicial separation;
3. Nullity of marriage;
4. Restitution of conjugal rights;
5. Jactitation of marriage;
6. To establish legitimacy and the validity of
marriages, and the right te be deemed
natural born subjects.
These may be called decrees in original petitions,
but, besides these decrees, the Court bas jurisdiction in matters subsidiary to or consequent
on such original matters, as7. Reversal of decree of judicial separation;
8. Damages against an adulterer, and how
such are to be applied;
9. Custody of children;
10. Provision for wife;
11. Concerning settlements of property.
These are all included within the term
"divorce and matrimonial causes." They all
grow naturally out of the marriage state,
and any legislature empowered te deal with
that marriage state (and forbidden te touch
upon solemnization of marriage) has these
powers or none at all. There may be certain
of them subtracted by express enactment,
and under the limitation of just such a subtraction we cannot legislate in respect of
nullity ab initio. That bas been held because
the provinces have jurisdiction in solemnization of marriage, as interpreted by the Privy
Council in the Lancaster case. But subject
te what is included in the term "solemnization of marriage," with that subtraction, and
that alone, this Parliament alone has jurisdiction as te the whole marriage state.
I come now te another author, Evans, on
the Law and P.ractice relating ta Divorce
and Other Matrimonial Causes in Canada.
First of all I read this at page 75:
In addition to proceedings for dissolution of
marriage, six other different kinds of actions
mentioned in the beginning of the preceding
chapter may be instituted under the provisions
of the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Act,
1857,-.

SENATE

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: R. R. Evans,
of the Ontario and Alberta Bars.
Not only did the British North America
Act, by section 91, give to the Canadian
Parliament jurisdiction in respect of marriage
and divorce, but by section 129, a section
of the higbest consequence. if provided that
the laws in force in the various provinces
at tbe time of the-ir ccming into the union
shoild continue to be in force thereafter,
should continue to be the laws of those respective provinees, until altered by the appropriate Parliament as set out in the British
North America Act itself. And the laws
that werc
so declared confirmed in this
country as in force. by the words of the
British North America Act. naturally embraced
the common law then in force, as well as the
statute law. As a consequence, until this
Parliament legislates under the heading of
marriage and divorce and anything affecting
this subject, the courts of our various provinces-Quiebec excepted, because in that province there are no such courts, and this Bill
does net affect Quebec at all-have power in
respect of divorce by virtue of section 129,
making the law of flic province at the time
if came into Confederation flic law after it
came in, subject to its being changedI as I
stated a moment ago. Therefore our courts
al] along have been exercising jurisdiction in
re1-pcrt of matriionial causes, and were net
exercising if. in many provinces anyway, in
respect of divorce. If might be assumed, net
unnaturally, that as they were exercising jurisdiction in respect of these matrimonial causes
and not in
et
of divorce, their jurisdiction in nespect of matrimonial causes was
provincial. In fact this was net so at all.
The jurisdiction came te them as a legacy
of fe British North America Act, establishing the law that existed in the province at
the time of the passing of the Act, and was
to continue until that law should be changed;
but it could be changed only by the Parliament which had jurisdiction in respect of the

subject-ratter, aul flic only Parliament which
has jurisdiction in respect of any subjectmiatter
relating to marriage, minus the
solemnization of marriage. is the Parliament
of Canada.
Now, then, under this subject, dealing with
Canada, Evans quotes the following:
(1) Judicial separation;
f2) Nullity of marriage;
(3) Restitution of conjugal rigits;
(4) Jactitation of marriage;
(5) To establish legitimacy;
(6) Damages by husband against adulterer.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:

Does

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: He is speaking of the Matrimonial Causes Act.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Yeu said
be stated it was under the common law.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Noý. The
Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857,
in effect in 1858, established divorce and
matrimonial courts to carry out the law as
respects divorce and matrimonial causes. As
respects divorce, the law was just enacted
then; but as respects matrimonial causes, in
the broad, embracive sense that I have
sought to elaborate to fie House, the law
w-as the common law and had grown up
through the centuries and been given effect
to by the ecclesiastical courts of England.
That is the common law which bas affected
matrimonial causes and which, I humbly submit, was necessarily the law in the minds of
legislators at Westminster when they used
the word "macriage" in the British North
America Act.
I want to read the following from Evans at
page 106:
It lias already been pointed out that by
virtue of the Constitutional Act of 1791 and
flic first statute passed by the first Assembly
of Upper Canada the law of England relating
to property and civil righîts became the law
of Upper Canada, and tliat by so introducing
the law of England that portion of flic law
relating to nullity wlhich was not inapplicable
became part of the law of Upper Canada; that
the Act of Union does not affect the issue;
tliat such a body' of law by virtue of ch. 9,
C.S. of U.C., 1859, was continued in force after
the Act of Union had been passed and awas in
force at the finie of C'-onfederation; that by
the British North America Act the law ii
force in "Canada" was continued as the law
of Ontario until altered or repealed pursuant
to the provisions of that Act; that after Confeleration only the Parliament of Canada could
alter, vary or repeal all or any part of that
body of law relating to nullityI call this specially to the attention of those
who could not help being impressed by the
honourable senator from North York yesterday in his contention that this Parliament
had notiing to do with respect to matters

MAY 11, 1938
of nullity. This Parliament has everything
to do with all matters of nullity, save such
nullity as means that the marriage is void ab
initio. Thus it is said by this authority-I
read part of the last sentence again:
-that by the British North America Act the
law in force in "Canada" was continuedl as the
law of Ontario until altered or repealed pursuant to the provisions of that Act; that after
Confederation only the Parliament of Canada
could alter, vary or repeal all or any part of
that body of law relating to nullity (save and
except that part relating strictly to solemnization of marriage within the province).
More particularly affecting the question
of civil rights, there is a further quotation to
be given, if I can put my hand on it. If the
House will permit, so as to save delay, I shall
have this quotation inserted in Hansard. It
is of some length, and at the moment it escapes
my eye. But it argues very definitely what I
sought to impress earlier this afternoon, that
though the exercise of a jurisdiction as respects a defined subject may necessarily entail the affecting of civil rights, that in no way
removes the jurisdiction, but the power to do
all things incident ýto or naturally or reasonably
embraced within the defined subject exists all
the same, and only in the legislature which
has jurisdiction over that subject so defined.
The quotation is as follows:
By the British North America Act, section
91, power to legislate with respect to "marriage
and divorce" was delegated to the Parliament
of Canada, while by section 92 the capacity
to legislate with respect to "solemnization of
marriage" within the provinces was delegated
to the provincial legislatures. Since this Act
was in force prior to the passing of the abovementioned Act of 1888, no portion of the
English law as to nullity which relates strictly
to solemnization of marriage can therefore be
deemed to have been introduced. But there
did exist in England a body of law relating to
nullity which did not relate strictly to
solemnization, but which affected directly the
very essentials of marriage, e.g., impotency,
bigamy and insanity as grounds precluding the
possibility of a valid marriage or rendering a
marriage voidable. That such a branch of law
might either in whole or in part come within
the classification of "property and civil rights"
could under certain circumstances be urged,
but in view of the provisions of the British
North America Act, its general plan and the
manner in which the various classes of subjects
were allotted to the Dominion Parliament and
to the provincial legislatures respectively for
legislative consideration, and adopting the principles of construction which have been laid
down from time to time by the Privy Council
in considering the apparent conflicting and overlapping provisions of that Act, the sounder
opinion would appear to be that legislation
which affects the very essential validity of a
marriage would come within the classification
of "marriage and divorce" and not within the
classification of "property and civil rights."

283

I now want to make more plain to the
House certain definite phases of the Bill.
Under section 4 there is a recognition of the
derivation of the powers of courts in our
various provinces as respect marriage and
divorce. Not only is there a recognition of
the derivation, but there is a definite declaration that the derivation of power as now
enjoyed by those courts shall continue to be
so enjoyed, and the derivation shall be the
same, and only as respects further power
given to those courts by this statute shall
the parent of the power be considered to be
the Parliament of Canada.
The Bill then proceeds to legislate in respect
of divorce by sections 5, 6 and 7; but when
we come to those sections having to do with
the avoiding of a marriage because of misconduct or for other reason, the honourable
senator from North York (Hon. Sir Allen
Aylesworth) says we are wholly without
power.
I ask the House to follow me while I make
it plain that, as every lawyer, of course,
clearly knows, there is an important difference
between a marriage contract, or any contract
that is void ab initio, and a contract that is
merely voidable. A marriage contract will
be void, under the Lancaster case, if a person
enters into it who is not qualified so to do.
A marriage contract will be void if it is
carried out or solemnized by a person who
is not empowered to solemnize marriage under
the provincial legislation. It may be void for
other reasons, such as lack of qualification
for marriage at the time of entry into it.
These are things which, by the law of the
province, make a marriage void. This Parliament never could legislate to restore or make
valid any marriage void because of such
definite provisions of the legislation of a
province.
But it is quite another thing to legislate
that a marriage that is absolutely valid when
it is completed wholly in accordance with
provincial law may be avoided afterwards
for cause without being dissolved at all. Dissolution of marriage is one thing; avoidance
of marriage is another, and this Bill provides that where the party entering into the
contract has physical disease of a certain
character, under certain conditions the other
party afterwards may seek an avoiding of that
marriage. No one would suggest that that
marriage would be void ab initio. The provincial legislation does not say so in the first
place. It is valid under provincial law the
minute the declaration of the minister is
sounded, and the offended party may elect that
it shall be valid for ever. The man or woman

284

SENATE

whose wife or husband was at the time of
marriage afflicted as defined by this Bill may,
just as he or she may prefer, continue in
their marriage state, and, if so, that continuance is a legal marriage state and all the
consequences of marriage flow frein it. If,
on the contrary. he or she elects to go to
court, establish the causes specified in this
Bill, and say, "I want my marriage avoided,"
then the court has power to declare accordingiy. and the avoiding of the marriage does
net affect the solemnization of marriage. We
are not legislating as to solemnization.
If
Quebec. Ontario or Manitoba says what shall
constitute solemnization, and as part thereof
who shall be qualified to enter into marriage,
that is its prerogative.
We are legislating
to avoid a dulv solemnized marriage-to
avoid it for cause. Will anyone suggest that
the power to do so resides in the provincial
legislatures?
It does not rest there unless
we are going to assume that when the British
North Amierica Act vested us with jurisdiction in marriage it intended to vest the
provinces.
This, surely, is about all one need impose
upon the House. Kcep away from solemnizatien as defined in that most generous possible
interpretation in tie Lancaster case-indeed,
one cannot help conimenting that it was an
all-embracive interpretation-keep away from
that and you are in the field of marriage, net
in the field of solemnization.
What cimos there would be if this Parliament should venture upon legislation giving
to a married person the power to have the
marriage declared void, and should then depend
upon the immediate consequences being taken
care of elsewhere! I do net think any lawyer,
after reading what I have said and what I
have quoted, will venture to deny that this
Parliament alone can declare the conditions
upon which a validly solemnized marriage
may be declared void. Then, if Parliament
bas such power, what a situation would result
if the consequences of that declaration were
in every case to be determined by the several
provinces! Why, the consequences that flow
out of the married state are incidental to it,
ancillary to it, really a part of it. From it
they take their birth. Necessarily they are
within the purview of this Parliament.
The whole history of this subject, as readable
by anybody, shows that marriage as a field of
law and legislation means matrimonial causes
as dealt with in the courts of England, and
that the British Parliament in its statutes
intended the word "marriage " to carry the
same acceptation. I submit that the honoirable senator from North York (Hon. Sir Allen
Aylesworth), while entitled, of course. to
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

oppose this Bill on its merits, is not right
when he assumes that we cannot avoid
marriages, that we cannot determine the rights
of persons who were parties to avoided
marriages, that we cannot determine the
consequences that flow from marriage and its
avoidance. I believe we can.
But be says, and with more convincing force,
I think, that we cannot enact, as we propose
to do in one section, that in certain conditions
no parson or person shall be compellable to
solemnize a marriage. When I read the section
I assumed at first that there we wcre within
the territorv of solemnization. It is true that
I know of no legislation w-hich compels
anybody to marry anybod-. I an not quite
certain that thore is noce, nor do I know juist
what is the obligation of a minister under
certain laws. But, assuming that there is
none at all, let us take this section and read
it in connection with section 4, which frankly
admits and declares the present authority of
our courts and the derivation of that authorit.
It is a fair statecient to say the section in
question is not legislation in respect of
solemnization of marriage, but merely goes to
the extent of providing that because of this
Act no clergyman shall be compelled to marry,
inder stated circumstances, a porson whose
divorced wife or hushand is still living. The
power so to enact flows fron our jurisdiction
in respect of divorce.
I ask bonotîrable
members to put to themselves this question.
If we are now clothed with plenary authority
to legislate as regards divorce-and this authority no one disputes-thon are we not also,
consequentially, emponwed to legislate that a
div orced person shiall not marry for. sa'. ten
years? Would that be getting into the field of
soleimnization of marriage?
I submit not.
Could we not indeed legislate tliat a divorced
person could never marry while the offended
partner was still alive? I submit that we
could, under ouri jurisdiction in divorce; and if
we could, can we not also say that no minister
shall be compellable to marry any divorced
person while the husband or wife is still
living, or within so many years?
That is
precisely what we are doing. That provision
is merely to release from the mind of any
person the feeling that it is part of his duty,
if net a legal obligation, to marry any person
who cones within the section. I present to
the House the argument that by declaring
that someone does not need to solemnize
under certain conditions we are not affecting
solemnization itself.
We are mercly making
provision, by virtue of our ancillary powers
flowing from divorce jurisdiction, respecting
consequences which follow the coming into
iffect of divorce decrees.

MAY 11, 1938
If the
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Legislature of Ontario had enacted that it
was the duty of the minister or the priest
to marry any person, would this relieve the
clergyman of that duty?
It would if
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
this is proper divorce law. As I argue, it
is ancillary to our rights in respect of divorce.
While I will not say that the argument is
overwhelming, or has no answer, or that there
can be no reasonable doubt, I think the
argument is fairly convincing and would probably be accepted.
Possibly, while I am on my feet, I should
make a brief comment respecting the Bill on
its merits. I certainly could not vote against
it on the ground of invalidity or the transgression of rights. I think it has been improved in substance by the committee. It is
true the improvement is only a matter of
degree. When I spoke before, I intimated
that giving the right to get a divorce after
three years' desertion was opening the door
in such a way as to affect the general moral
attitude as to sanctity of marriage and was
tending towards inducing married couples to
regard the marriage state as merely a trial
spin. We find it hard to keep out of mind
individual cases. They stand every day before
us. But we must consider the general effect
of a law on the whole state of the public
mind, particularly the mind of the young.
Having regard to all the circumstances, and
knowing. as I feel I do, that divorce under
certain conditions is essential, that nothing but
cruelty unspeakable and indefensible follows
the denial of many hundreds of petitions, I
do not think five years in the case of desertion
too short, and as respects that provision my
objections would be removed.
As regards the definition of cruelty, I do
not know that the law is being changed. It
is an improvement, however, to embody in
the Act a definition which, I fancy, would be
the one used by our courts anyway. There
are, of course, cases of cruelty which are
of such a character as te bring about gross
and palpable injustices and most irritating
conditions, but which nevertheless, cannot be
made grounds for divorce. It is said that
even in defining cruelty as in the amended
Bill we are going te lower the level of public
thinking and reverence for the sanctity of
Nevertheless, I do not know of
marriage.
any better definition or any wiser precaution,
and I fancy we do well to leave the matter
to the test of experience and see how it all
results. My information is that the operation
of such a law elsewhere does not generally
give rise to abuses based on charges of cruelty;
that courts are extremely careful in its application; and I feel certain the courts in
Canada will be careful.

Z4à

While I 'have still some hesitancy and reluctance on the score of those two causes, I feel
that 1 can support the measure.
I do not like the striking out of clause 5,
especially with respect to cases where petitions
of divorce will lie only by reason of this Bill.
Maybe we should not interfere with rights
now existing, but when we are giving extended rights it is not unreasonable to say
they shall not be exercised until the expiration of a period of trial, and I should hope
that some amendment could be introduced
to re-insert clause 5 with this limited application.
I hope I may have contributed something
to clarify the question of jurisdiction. It is
tremendously important that we understand
properly our powers.
I conclude, honourable senators, with the
words with which I commenced. Just assume
in your own minds that we have not this
jurisdictio-that we cannot legislate as respects the voidability of marriage, legitimacy,
damages from an adulterer, the return, say,
of conjugal rights-all those things recited
by the honourable senator from North York
(Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth); cast aside the
lessons drawn from the history of this subject
in the British Parliament and in the courts
of England; refuse to accept the reasoning on
which my contention is founded, and the
authorities on which it is supported, and you
come inevitably and inescapably to the dilemma that the Parliament of Canada has no
jurisdiction whatever in marriage, and that
for seventy years we have been under a delusien.

thing.
There were two or three couples
before that mayor of Morrisburg and they

MOTION FOR THIRD READING

Hon. J. W. deB. FARRIS:
Honourable
menbers, I feel that I should speak shortly
on this Bill; not from any desire to make a
speech about it, for I should prefer to keep
silent. My sympathies are entirely with the
principle> of th1e measure, but we have had
here a serious legal discussion of its constitutional aspects, and as a lawyer I feel
that if the Bill is voted upon and goes to the
Ilouse of Commons, sanction will bave been
given in one way or another to legal propositions that have been advanced in this
House. I find myself on strong ground and
on weak ground.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: You cannot help
being on weak ground when you are talking
about divorce.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I find myself on weak
ground because I am somewbat in disagreement with both the honourable senator from
North York (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth)
and the right honourable leader on the other
side (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen); and I feel
I am on strong ground because I agree with
what they said in other particulars.
As to the question of alimony and other
matters-what one might term the incidentals
of the powers assumed under this Bill-I am
in complete accord with the views expressed
by the right honourable leader opposite. It
seems to me, honourable senators, that
whether we look at this question as one of
substantive powers or of purely ancillary
powers, there can be no question that the
Parliament of Canada has full and complete
jurisdiction to deal with any matter inci-

dental to marriage and divorce, as such. I
might supplernent what has already heen
said on that hy a very brief reference to a
judgment of the Privy Coundil. Dealing with
bankruptcy, their Lordships said:
It appears to their Lordships that such
provisions as are found in the enactmnent in
question, relating as they do to assignments
purely voluntary, do not infringe on the
exclusive legislative power conferred upon the
Dominion Parliarnent.
They would observe
that a system of bankruptcy legislation may

necessary for this purpose to deal with the
effect of executions and other matters which
would otherwise be within the legislative
competence of the provincial legislature. Their
Lordships do not doubt that it would be open
to the Dominion Parliament to deal with such
inatters as part of a bankruptcy law, and the
provincial legisiature would doubtless be then
precluded from. interfering with this legislation,
inasmuch as such interference would affect the
bankruptey law of the Dominion Parliament.
But it does flot follow that such subjects as
might properly be treated as ancillary to such
a law and therefore within the powers of the
Dominion Parliament are excluded from the
legislative authority of the provincial legislature, when there is no bankruptcy or
însolvency legislation of tlie Dominion Parliament in existence.
The samne principle applies to bankruptcy
and to railway legislation, to bills and notes
and to every form of federal jurisdiction; and
when we corne to the express provision in section 91, subsection 26, marriage and divorce,
there is in my mind no doubt that every
matter that is necessarily incidental or ancillary to dealing completely with such legislation falîs properly within the purview of the
Parliament of Canada.
But the difficulty in rny mind, and it is
one of very serinus importance, is section 12
of the Bill, dealing with nullity. The hionourable senator wbo spoke first yesterday afternoon (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) suggested
there neyer wvould be any appeal in this matter,
and therefore one might leave it alone. If
I were sure there neyer would be any appeal
or any question raised, I certainly would not
raise my voice in this House, for something
that everybody agrees on and tacitly allows
to take effect cannot do very much harm.
But I can sce rnany situations wbere trouble
might arise. If, for instance, under section
12 of this Bill. a woman secured nuliity of
bier marriage because of the physical condition of bier busband, she might then marry
a man witb a very large estate and have
children. On the parent's death the right of
those children to inherit the property would
depend absolutely on the validity of the
second marriage, and its validity would
essentially depend on the validity of the first

287

marriage and its annulment. There are s0
rnany ways in which, for sentimental, farnily
or business reasons, a question of this kind
can come up, that it is not a light matter to
allow legisiation to pass if there is any serious
question as to jurisdiction.
It will be recalled from what bas already
been said that under section 91 marriage and
divorce is exclusively within the competence
of this Parliament. On the other hand. under
section 92, the solemnization of marriage is
exclusively within the jurisdiction of the promeans
vincial legislatures.
"Exclusively"
exactly what it says. If sornetbing is exclusively within the .Iurisdliction of the prov'inPi9i
legisiatures. it follows that it cani by no possibility be witbin the jurisdiction of this Parlisment.
My right bonourable friend opposite <Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) yesterday deait witb that
point in a very able and very clear maniner.
He referrcd to a decision of the Privy Coun cil
in 1912, in what is known as the Lancaster
case. Questions were there submitted to the
Supreme Court of Canada hy the Government of Canada. They were answered by their
Iordships, and an appeal was taken to the
Privy Council. Dealing with that case, iny
right honourable friend said:
Ahi I need do is quote the Privy Council in
the celehrated reference now known as the
Lancaster case, where it is declared that the
provinces, because of their authority under
solemnization of marriage, can say who is
competent to enter into the marriage state;
ni a word, that they, and t.hey alone, cau legislate on matters affecting the validity of
marriage.
I arn not so sure that rny right honourable
friand is correct in that interpretation of the
Lancaster case. But for the moment I accept
bis interpretation. We are now to consider
whether or not the present measure under
that interpretation interferes with the sohemnization of marriage. In the Lancaster case
there was a provision, made by the Parhiament
of Canada, that marriages perforrned by any
person who had authority to performi a
marriage would be valid throughout Cainada,
notwithstanding the religion of eit'ner of the
contracting parties, and notwithstanding the
question wbether or not there was a prohibition in the provincial Act against a clergyman performing this particular form. of
marriage. Their Lordships of the Privy Council bad to decide wbat was meant by solemmization of marriage, but tbey did not bave to
exbaust tbe definition. I arn inclined to think,
however, that tbey went as far as my rigbt
bonourable friend saîd yesterday, because in
tbis case-and this is the only otber quota-

288

SENATE

tion I am going to inflict on the House-Lord
Haldane said:
Prima facie these wordsThat is. "solemnization of marriage."
-appear to their Lordships to import that the
whole of what solemnization ordinarily meant

in the systems of law of the provinces of
Canada at the time of Confederation is intended to come within then, including conditions which affect validity.
I want honourable members to get a picture
of wbat that means. It means, as distinguished fron a marriage without any solemnization. a marriage under our provincial laws
in which a solemnization took place at the
marriage ceremony. It is a combination of
what the bride says. what the groom says,
the putting on of the ring. and the clergyman's pronouncement, "I pronounce you man
ind wife." I take it that all that ceremony
is part of the solemnization; and I agree
with my right honourable friend, so far as I
cai f*llow from this case, that the question
of thPe validliv of that ceremonv of solemnization cm he raised only by the legislature
which has exclhsive jurisdiction to deal with
solemnization.
Nw, lionourable members will follow what
happens in our legislation.
There are two
tvps of proccedings in court in relation to
the dissolution or severance of the marriage rclationship. One is by way of nulity
proceedings and the other by way of dissolution. Dissolution is divorce. It accepts the
narriage as be.ing valid up to the time of
the court order, and it never interferes with
its validity till then. But from the date of
the court order it does intenfere, and there
is a dissolution as of that time. Nullity may
exist apart altogether fror the decision of
the court, but if it is declared by the court
it means that there never bas been a valid
marriage. There are two types of nullity,
the void marriage and the voidable marriage,
and that is where, with great respect, I find
myself unable to follow my right honourable
friend opposite in bis argument. As I gathered,
what he said was this. that so far as relates
to the power to declare a marriage void ab
initio, this Parliament cannot interfere, having no authority to deal with the solemnizatien of marriage, which is exclusively witbin
the iurisdiction of the provincial parliament,
but that in regard to a voidable marriage
the principle is different. Now, let us examine
that for a moment. What is the meaning of
the term "voidable marriage"? It means, as
in the case of any other contract, that the
contract is capable of being rendered void.
If it is void. as distinguished from voidable,
yon do not need to go to court at all. That
Hon. Mr-. FARRIS.

is the end of it. If it is voidable, it does
not become void until one of the parties bas
taken steps and the court bas declared it void;
but once the court bas made the declaration

the contract is void ab initie, just as in the
case of a void contract. From a voidable
contract it becomes a void contract.
Yesterday the rigbt bonourable leader
opposite cited Evans on Divorce.
I have
the same book bore, and I find that at the
bottom of page 119 the author says:
Once a marriage whether voidable or void
is set aside, however, it is as if it had never
been entered into and is rendered void from
the beginning.
So honourable members see that the difference between void and voidable is only as to
the time. Once the courts step in, at the
instigation of one of the parties, and declares
a marriage void, that declaration is retrospective or retroactive. It reaches back and
affects the verv thing that the originally void
contract affects. As an illustration of this I
would point out tbhat if there were not in this
Bill a provision with regard to legitimacy,
as there is, the avoidance of a marriage by
the courts would make the children orn cf
that
marriage illegitimates,
because the
declaration that a marriage is void means that
it never had any legal validity or sanction.
Now, if that is se, I am unable to follow
the nicety of reasoning which contends that
because the marriage lias not been interfered
with up to the time the court acted, the
Parliament of Canada has jurisdiction.
I
could follow such reasoning if the proceeding
were one for dissolution. If, for instance, this
Bill had said-as, with great deference, I think
it should have said-that a woman whose
husband bas a certain incurable or communicable disease may apply to the courts for a
divorce, that provision would have been net
merely a recognition of the marriage, but a
continued recognition of it, and the dissolution would operate only from the date of the
court's judgment. But by this Bill such a
wornan is given the right to ask the court for
a declaration that her marriage never existed,
never bad any validity. Well, honourable
senators, it seems to me that the picture of
the solemnization of marriage, as we get it
from the Lancaster case, and my right honourable friend's proposition that jurisdiction with
respect to solemnization of marriage resta
with the provincial legislatures, are inconsistent
with the theory that legislation passed by this
Parliament can be applied one month or six
months after the event of marriage for the
purpose of effecting retroactively what it
could not have done in anticipation. For these

MAY 12, 1938
reasons, it is my opinion that there is grave
doubt about the validity of this provision in
the Bill.
As I say, I am entirely in sympathy with
the principles of this measure. I believe,
honourable senators, that it is in the interest
of the proposed legislation that Parliament
should make it abundantly clear that what
we are doing is within our jurisdiction. I
believe that can be accomplished by the
amendment of section 12, to change it from
a provision for nullifying the marriage to a
provision for dissolving the mapriage. If that
is not done, and the Bill goes through in its
present form, then, in my opinion, in the
interesta of persons who may be affected, the
suggestion should be made to the legislature
of each province that it enact a similar
provision. A generation may pass before this
legislation is tested. It may be that a
question with regard to a divorce granted this
year will be raised twenty-five years from now,
in connection with the right of innocent
children to inherit.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Will the
honourable gentleman permit a question?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Yes.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Will he not
admit that there is a very wide difference
between the declaration of a court that a
marriage was invalid ab initio, and the
declaration of a court that what was a valid
marriage is hereby made void?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I can see no difference,
in respect of the point we are now discussing.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is vital.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: The point we are discussing is that the Bill seeks to make void a
solemnization of marriage. My right honourable friend may be right, but I am saying
that the question is so close to the line that
it would be a wise legislator ,who could sa4
which view the courts would take. I say
that the distinction between this Parliament
saying in advance, "This shall preclude the
solemnization of the marriage," and saying,
after the event, "We will reach back into the
past and declare that the solemnization never
had the legal effect which the provincial legislature provided it should have"Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But we do
not declare that.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: When the clergyman
who officiates et a ceremony pronounces a
couple man and wifeRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They are.

289

'Hon. Mr. FARRIS: It may be said that for
the time being the marriage is valid. But
under this Bill Parliament would assume the
power to wipe out the validity of a marriage
that had been solemnized, and wipe it out,
not as of the date of the court order, but
retroactively, to the extent of saying that the
marriage in question never was valid.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not wish
to interrupt unless the honourable gentleman
is agreeable to my doing so.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Yes, certainly.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The court
does not say that the marriage never was
valid; the court wipes out the validity. It
admits that the marriage was valid when made,
but voids the effect of the validity whieh
existed from the time the marriage was made
up to the time of the declaration.
'Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I do not think we can
gain much by continuing this cross-fire.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am sorry.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I am not at ail embarrassed; I am grateful to my right honourable friend for pointing out the distinction as
he sees it. But I want to repeat that, so far
as I can see, there is no difference in principle
between a declaration in advance that if you
do a certain thing it is void, and a declaration
which goes half that way, as it would under
this Bill. Parliament would be saying: "We
will reserve the right to decide after the
event whether the marriage had any validity
or not. If one of the parties moves the court,
then we take to ourselves the right to say
that the marriage never had any validity."
Whatever else may be said, honourable
senators, it is plain that there cannot be any
degree of a thing that is void, any more than
there can be of something that is dead. If a
thing is void, it is void completely; it has no
legal validity and never had any. The distinction my right honourable friend makes is
that by reason of a pause or delay occurring
before the death sentence, or the declaration
of lack of validity, is pronounced, Parliament
has jurisdiction. My right honourable friend,
with his persuasive powers, might be able to
convince a court of that, but I certainly should
never want to attempt any such task.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I do not intend to take any part in the
discussion as to the constitutionality of this
Bill. We have heard addresses by the right
honourable leader opposite (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) and the honourable senators from
North York (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth),

SENATE

Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) and
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. Farris), and I do not
presume to suggest who is right and who is
wrong. But the Bill as at present drafted,
as it has come to us from the committee,
does not meet with my approval. I think
that section 5 should have been retained in
the Bill, and that section 4 should be amended
to preserve the provincial rights that now
exist. The argument against section 5 was
that it interfered with existing rights of the
provincesHon. Mr. MeMEANS: Will the honourable gentleman excuse me? I rise to a point
of order. The deletion of section 5 was agreed
to by the committee, and the committee's
report has been adopted by this House.
Therefore, I submit, the matter cannot be
discussed again now.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I can discuss the Bill
on third reading.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I ask the Speaker
for a ruling.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I will make a motion,
to put myself in order. I move that the
Bill be not now read a third time, but be
referred back to the Committee of the Whole
House for further consideration. That motion

The motion
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
has not been put by the Speaker.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Does the honourable senator mean the Committee of the
Whole?
Committee of the

Hon. Mr. HAIG: No; the Committee of

The Hon. the SPEAKER: The motion
before the Senate, honourable members, is
that Bill B, an Act respecting Divorce and
Matrimonial Causes, as amended, be not
now read a third time, but be referred to
the Committee of the Whole House. When?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Now.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Forthwith.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The reason I want the
Bill referred to the Committee of the Whole
House is that I think clause 4 should be
amended so as to preserve the existing rights
of provinces to deal with divorce, and section
5 should be reinserted, but so worded that
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

there will be no interference with the present
jurisdiction of provinces. I understand that
the Lords Spiritual in the House of Lords
voted for the British Bill because, as they
argued, if a marriage was not satisfactory
after three years there was reasonable ground
for permitting an application for divorce. I
will not say anything further on the matter
now. I wish to have the Bill sent back to
Committee so that these two clauses may be
further considered.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
menbers, as this Bill has never been in Committee of the Whole, I am rather at a loss
to understand the motion that it be referred
"back" to Conimittee of the Whole.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Haig was
agreed to: contents, 35; non-contents, 19.
QUESTION

OF PROCEDURE

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Mr. Speaker, I am
not objecting to the procedure, but, so far
as I can recollect, such procedure has not
been followed in my time. When this Bill
was given second reading it was referred to
a special committee for consideration, not to
Committee of the Whole House. It was twice
considered by the special committee and reported here, and the report has been considered and adopted by the Senate. Now
we are asked to refer this Bill to Cornimittee
of the. Whole.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: Itt has been so decided by a vote just taken.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yet it may be contrary to the rules. I do not know. That is
why I am raising the point. According to
my recollection, the procedure is somewhat
like this. If at this stage an honourable
member wishes to object to any portion of
the Bill, and desires to have it amended,
he moves that the Bill be referred again to
the committee that dealt with it, and that
this committee bc instructed to amend section
so-and-so by adding thereto or taking therefrom certain words. But now we are throwing not merely section 5, but the whole Bill
into Committee of the Wholei. I rise only
for the purpose of trying to get some understanding as to what the rules of the House
are in this regard.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable senators, with great respect, and not at all for
the purpose of preventing discussion of the
points that I know are in the mind of my
honourable friend the junior member from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig), I take the position
that this procedure is entirely out of ordernot in accordance with the rul.es and practice

MAY 12, 1938
of this House. What is the use of appointing
a special committee to consider a Bill if after
the committee's report has been adopted you
Bay, "Let us have another shake a.t it in
Committee of the Whole Houffe"? My honourable friend is enitirely justified in seeking
an opportunity ta bring forward the points
that hie wishes te make on. this divorce
question, but I submit that ta follow this
procedure is simply to do violence ta the
ru-les and praotice of the Sonate as I have
understoad therm for these many years.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: May I be permitted
a further word or two? What bas just been
said is my view of the situation. It strikes
me that if the honourable gentleman (Hon.
Mr. Haig) wishes ta aitain his abject, his
proper procedure would be ta mave that this
Bill be again referred ta the special committee which bad it under consideration, and
that that committee be instrucited ta amend
the Bill aà hoe wisbes ta have it amended.
This .would obviate thrawing the entire Bill
in-to Committee of the Whale.
Hon. Mr. HEUGHES: Hanourable senatars,
cannat a meniber movo an amendrnent ta any
Bill on the motion for third reading?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes; hie can do it naw.
Han. Mr. DANDURAND: I cannat lay my
hand. on any particular rule. oif tbe Sonate
relevant ta this situation, but, generally speaking, I would say that tbe Houso can refer a
Bill back ta a select committee as often
as it pleases. 1 bave yet ta learn that it
cannot decide that a Bill shahl be sent ta
Commîttee of tbe Wbole. I think the point
of order is somewbat belated, since the House
bas already decided that the Bill shahl be
referred ta Committee of the Wbole. I do
nlot see wberein that does violence ta the
general principle that the Sonate is master
of its own procedure and can refer ta Comnmittee of the Whole or back ta a standing
committee a Bill that bas already been considered and reported, upon by tbat standing
cammittee. 0f course, the honaurable gentleman could move that tbis Bull ho nlot now
read a third time, but Vbat it be amonded in a
certain part'jcular. But hoe bas chosen a difforent procedure and tbe House bas decided
in his faveur.
Haln. Mr. HAIG: When a Bill is givon
second reading it is presumed that its principle is adopted. Section 5 was in this Bill
when it waa read a second time, and I submit that the special committee ta whom
the Bill was referred had na rigbt ta delete
the section. Under the rules of the Legishature of Manitoba, which are based on those
51958-191

291

of tbe British House of Commans, it is permissible at any stage ta refer a Bill ta Cainmittee of the Wbole.
Han. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
May I point
out that the select cammittee reported theBill with certain amendments, and that that.
report was approved by this House?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Just as the principle af
the Bill was approved on second reading.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Tbat is a
different thing.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Na. I decided nlot to
move any amendments on the motion for
third reading because the honourable the
senior member fram Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.MeMeans) ahi ected ta clause 5 being restared.
That clause bad not been amended,
but.
had been struck out. The only course apen
ta me was ta move tbat the Bill be referrect
ta Committee of the Whole, and that le tbo
course I have taken. It has been approved
by this House. Were the Bihl referred back
ta the special cammittee, I sbauld have no
right ta move my amendment there. Apparently the cammittee &truck out section 5
deliberatehy. Therefore I must seek in Coinmittee of the Wbale ta have section à reincorporated in the Bill. My motion ta refer
the Bill ta Committee of the Whohe ha&
been carried without objection.
Han. Mr. ROBINSON: I think rule 12&.
covers this caze.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Read it.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: This is rule 128:Unhess the Sonate otherwise orders, a private.
bill reported f ram a standing or special committee s eot committed ta a Comm ittee af
the Whole.
"Unhess the Sýenate otherwise orders."
Han. Mr. CALDER: That rule applieff
ta private bills. This is a public bill.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: A public bill is
generally introduced by a representative of
the Governmont.
Han. Mr. CALDER: No. A private bill
relates ta tbe incorporation of companies, and.
the like.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I arn nat s0 sure
of that. But lot me refer hanourable membors ta another rule, 130. It reads:
No important amendmnent may be propoued
ta any private bill, in a Committee of the
Whole, or at the third reading of the bill,
unhess notice of the saine shaîl have been given
on a previaus day.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That ride also appliea
ta private bills.

SENATE

292

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: It is not customary to refer public bills to a special committee, is it?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: The rules must
contain a definition of what constitutes a
public bill.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: All bills for incorporation of railways and insurance companies, building bridges across the Niagara
river, and all that sort of thing, are private
bills.
May I say that I was merely asking for
information. I have been a member of this
House for fifteen or twenty years, and, as I
have stated, this is the first time I can recollect this procedure being followed. If it is
correct, then any honourable member will
have the right, after a Bill has gone to a
special or standing committee, to move, instead of adoption of the report, the reference
of the Bill to Committee of the Whole House,
in order that every member may have a
chance to take a whack at it. Such is the
effect of the decision now reached.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Mr. Speaker, I
still submit, with great respect, that this procedure is entirely out of order, as not being
in accordance with the rules and practice of
the Senate. I should like a decision on the
point.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, I think the motion of the honourable the junior member from Winnipeg (Hon.
Mr. Haig), that this Bill be referred to Committee of the Whole, is in order. The motion
has been agreed to by the House.
OONSIDERED

IN

COMMITTEE

The Senate went into Committee on the
Bill.
Hon. Mr. Murdock in the Chair.
On section 2-definitions:
The CHAIRMAN: This section includes
paragraph (b):
"cruelty' means legal cruelty, as interpreted
and construed by the High Court of England
in divorce and matrimonial causes.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Honourable members,
as a matter of phraseology, cruelty is defined
as interpreted by the High Court of England.
It does not say "as now interpreted," but
simply "as interpreted." Obviously that means
as interpreted from time to time. Therefore,
as the law changes in England so will it
change in Canada. In other words, we are
adopting a definition which may be varied
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

by the legislature of another country. That.
to my mind, is not sound practice. We should
provide against the modification that may be
made elsewhere. I have no objection to the
definition of cruelty as at present interpreted
by the courts of England being adopted by
us as a basis, but I do think it is very bad
practice-rather, it is not a practice, but a
departure from practice-to adopt a definition
subject to such change as may be at any
future time, and without our consent, made
by the legislature or the courts of England.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: I think the words of
the Bill are quite clear. The definition
relates not to the future, but to the time
when this Act receives the Royal Assent and
comes into force. I do not think we need
spend much time on amending things which
have been carefully thought out by the coinmittee. I submit that the wording relates to
the exact time of the passing of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. COTE: My understanding is that
the original draft read "as now interpreted."
But the word "now" does net appear in the
amendment, and it simply reads "as interpreted by the High Court of England."
Naturally, in the future the statute will be
speaking in the present. It is on that ground
that my argument is based. If in 1940 the
court has to interpret the statute, it will not
refer to the jurisprudence of England prior
to that date, but will note the jurisprudence
of 1940. I may be wrong, but I think I
am right.
The CHAIRMAN: Shall the definitions as
previously adopted carry?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, I was not on the committee, and
so am not invited to speak, but I should like
to say this. While I am disposed to agree
with the honourable senator froim Leeds
(Hon. Mr. Hardy) that the word "interpreted"
without the word "now" would refer to the
moment of the passing of the Bill, I do not
feel 100 per cent sure. Why was the word
"now" omitted? That word having been in
the Bill as drafted, I am wondering whether
it was struck out deliberately or was dropped
accidentally.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: It was eut out
deliberately.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am not
expressing an opinion, but I feel that the
honourable senator from Leeds is right.
The CHAIRMAN: My recollection is that
it was contemplated that the law would
continue on the same principle and basis as
the English law in respect of this matter.

MAY 12, 1938
Hon. Mr. TANNER: It was struck out on
the advice of Parliamentary Counsel.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: The chairman of the
committee, it seems to me, has been travelling
very fast in the handling of this Bill. I do
not know whether I have correctly understood
the remarks of my right honourable friend
the leader on the other side (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen). If cases of divorce are essentially
within the jurisdiction of the Dominion, the
question might be asked how we can constitute
courts and delegate to the provinces powers
that belong to the federal authorities. I cannot sec anything in the British North America
Act that entities us, by the creation of courts,
to divert these riglits that belong to the
federal authorities to the provinces. Consequently I think that we are treating this
matter very lightly. Section 91 of the British
North America Act provides that divorce,
which means the dissolution of marriage, can
be dealt with only by the federal authorities.
Sometimes, when I see the restrictions which
were placed around divorce by the Fathers
of Confederation, I feel their purpose was to
make it so difficul't that nobody would have
the courage or the audacity ta appear before
the courts of this country to ask for a divorce.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Is the honourable
gentleman discussing the point before the
Committee? I think flot.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: With the knowledge
I have of the situation, I think my remarks
are justified.
The CHAIRMAN: We are discussing a
definition provided for in section 2, subparagraph (b).
Hon. Mr. PARENT: I was contending,
wîth due respect, that you are going too far,
and I would suggest that clause 2 should be
removed from this Bill. I make this motion,
seconded by Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth.
The CHAIRMAN: It is moved hy the
honourable senator from Kennehcc, seconded
byHon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH: Having
been told what the present discussion is about,
I am wondering whether the situation is not
exactly the same as that in which the courts
find themselves when dealing with a question of fraud. We have many statut-es to
try to prevent fraud or fraudulent practices.
When our courts are called upon to interpret
such statutes it frequently happens that ini
argument someone asks the question: "What
is fraud? What is it that is necessary to
constitute fraud in law'?" Uniformly judges
have answered. and legislatures too: "That is

291,

something we will not try to define. It is
something which has to be decided upon the
particular facts that arise in evidence." We
ail know what fraud means, but if once you
try to define a thing like f raud or cruelty,
some adroit gentleman will circumvent your
definition by doing something else.
The CHAIRMAN: It is moved by the
honourable senator from Kenn6bec <Hon. Mr.
Parent), seconded by the honourable senator
from Shawinigan (Hon. Mr. Bourgeois), that
clause 2 of Bill B 'be struck out in its entirety.
That would include, as I understand it, al
the definitions.
The proposed amendment was rejectcd.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Before the definitions are
carried, I should like to say something furtber.
It may look like obstinacy on my part,' but
I assure you it is not. The honourable senator f rom. Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner) said the
word "now" was struck out on the advice of
the Law Clerk. That leads me to believe
that there was a misunderstanding, because
the other day, after the report of the committee was printed, I mentioned to the Law
Clerk the matter of the exclusion of the word
"now" from the definition of cruelty, and he
seemed very much surprised that the word
was not included, and pointed out to me that
the word appeared on the draft which he had.
I think I am at liberty to quote the opinion
which he then expressed to me. It was that,
if we wanted to fix the meanîng of the word
"1cruelty' as it is at present interpreted in
England, the word "now" should be used.
That is the reason why I stood up a moment
ago.
So that there may be no mistake, I now
move that subelause (b) of section 2 be
amended by adding ini the first line, after the
word "as" and before the word "interpreted,"
the word "now."
The CHAIRMAN: It is moved by Hon. Mr.
Côté, seconded by Hon. Mr. Taylor, that
clause (b), as adopted by the committee, be
amended by inserting the word "now" between
the words "as" and "interpreted." The clause
would then read:

if the Bill should be amended in order to
attain the certainty the honourable iýenator
aims at, it would be better to say, "as interpreted at the time of the passing of this Act ."
Hon. Mr. COTE: I would gladly accede to
the change.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I feel sure
the Law Clerk would accept that.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: There is just one
thing.
The CHAIRMAN: The Hon. Mr. Coté
accepts the proposed change, which, if there
are no objections, would make the clause
read:
"Cruelty" means legal cruelty, as interpreted
and construed by the High Court of England
in divorce and matrimonial causes at the time
of the passing of this Act.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: 1 just want to make
this suggestion. The courts of Canada are
always governed by the decisions of the highcr
courts in England. It is almost impossible
to put into an Act of Parliament an exact
definition of cruelty. The case of Russell v.
Russell, decidcd by the Privy Council, laid
down the doctrine of cruelty and what it
meant. Even if that were modified, or some
words a little different were added by another
iudge, the proposed ýamendmeut would prevent
us from ever departing from that one judgment. The doctrine of cruelty as decided by
the English courts should be followed, and in
interpreting the word " cruelty" we should
not be restricted to the one judgment. Surely
we can depend upon the judgments of the
High Court and the decisions of the Privy
Council to guide us in the matter.
At une time it was suggested that the
decision in Russell v. Russell as to the meaning
of cruelty should be put into the Bill, but
there is great objection to putting into a
statute the exact words of a judgment. A
certain act committed by the husband might
be construed as cruelty, as it renders the
woman unfit to carry on the duties of a wife.
I would argue as strongly as 1 can that we
are absolutely safe in following the decisions
of the Privy Council or the higher courts in
the Iland, and that the section should be left
as it is.
The CHAIRMAN: It bas been moved by
Hon. Mr. Coté, seconded by Hon. Mr. Taylor,
that the words " at the time of the passing of
this Act" be inserted in sulbclause (b) of
clause 2.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: After the
words "as interpreted and construed."

discussing it outside of this Chamber at ail.
Apparently, to judge from the remarks of the
honourable the senior senator from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. McMeans), it-is intended that if
at a subsequent time the interpretation now
given to the word "cruelty" by the High
Court of England should be in any way
modified, the modification shaîl govern our
courts here. Very good. Then does it not
follow that if a modified interpretation of the
word is adopted by the British courts, we are
bound also?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: You mean, if a
statute is passed regarding cruelty?
R.ight Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: Yes. Does
the honourable gentleman say tha-t then,
when the courts interpret cruelty in the terms
of the statute, we shahl be affected, not by the
change in the statute, but only by a change
in interpretation?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: 1 did not go so far.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Should we
not 'be affected by a change in the statute?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: But may I point out
that cruelty is neyer defined hy statute?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: But it may be.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: So far such a thiug
is unknown. The courts interpret what cruelty
means, but I do not know of any statute
defining it, and I do not think the right
honourable gentleman bas ever heard of any
that does.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It might be
donc.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: There is a possibility
of it, but it is s0 remote that I do not think
the House need bother itself about it.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Mr. Chaîrman, we
have had more or less discussion about the
regularity of this proceeding. Personally, I
bave no doubt as to the right of the Senate
to send a Bill like this to Committee of the
Whole flouse, but for my own information,
because I can sce thaýt there will be a good

like to have a ruling at this stage as to the
regularity of the proceedings in this regard.
Let us take as an illustration the motion

cruelty within the meaning of the Divorce and
Matrimonial Causes Act.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Will the honourable
gentleman excuse me? There is no such thing
as -any statute law on the meaning of the
word "cruelty." The interpretation is made
by the courts.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: But there is nothing
to prevent the British Parliament from passing an Act saying that if such and such a
thing is done it shall be considered as cruelty
within the meaning of the Divorce aq Matrimonial Causes Act. It can m.a e such
statutory interpretations as often as it wishes.
If that were done, the British courts would
have no alternative but to declare, in any
case where it was proved that one of the
things mentioned in the statute had been done,
that a cause for divorce existed. Now, do we
want to be tied by what the British Parliament m.ay do? If we do net, let us settle
the point by having "cruelty" defined to mean
legal cruelty as it is now interpreted by the
English courts.
There has been a great deal of discussion
around this very point. Many people who are
in favour of the general principle of divorce
have been opposed to this Bill because they
thought it opened the door to divorce too
widely. Everybody knows that in the United
States "cruelty" has been interpreted in a
ridiculous way, and there was a widespread
fear lest the word should be interpreted too
freely in this country. But if we decide that
the word shall mean what the British courts
take it to mean at present, we shall know
where we stand.
The CHAIRMAN: It is moved by Hon.
Senator Coté, seconded by Hon. Senator
Taylor, that the word "now" be inserted between the words "as" and "interpreted" in
subclause (b) of section 2 of the Bill as
amended by the special committee.
The proposed amendment of Hon. Mr. Coté
was agreed to.
Section 2, as amended, was agreed to.
Section 3 was agreed to.
On section 4-jurisdiction of the court augmented:
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators, I
want to move that the words "(saving the
effect of section five)" in lines 10 and 11,
section 4, be reinserted, and that these words
be added: "except as to adultery as a ground
for divorce."
Bon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I would
suggest that we defer consideration of section
4 and proceed, te section 5, because the
amendment will follow consequentially if we
decide in favour of section 5.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Then I ask that section
4 stand until we deal with section 5.

peculiar position the Chairman is in when
he finds there is no section 5, it having been

The CHAIRMAN: There is no section 5,

On section 5 of original Bill-restrictions
on petitions for divorce:
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Then I move that a
new section 5 be added to the Bill, as follows:
No petition for divorce shall be presented to
or entertained by the court until a period of
three years shall have elapsed since the date
of the marriage unless the court, upon application made je accordance with rules of court,
shall otherwise allow.
I do net presume the House wants me te
read the whole section.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I move that section 5,
as printed in the original Bill, be reinserted.
The CHAIRMAN: Is there a seconder te
the motion?
Hon. Mr. McGUIRE: Yes.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Will the honourable
junior senator frem Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Haig) give us an explanation of what he bas
in mind?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I desire that the existing
jurisdiction of the provincial courts in respect
of divorce be preserved. A petition for divorce
on the ground of adultery may now be presented to the courts of any province other
than Que-bec, at any time after the marriage,
but under section 5 no such petition could
be presented before the expiration cf three
years from the date of the marriage. I do
net want the rights of the provinces limited
to that degree, and so I am suggesting that
section 4 specify that section 5 shall net apply
when the ground alleged in the petition for
divorce is adultery. Then, even if section 5
were passed, the courts of Manitoba, for
instance, could still receive petitions for
divorce on the ground of adultery without
restriction as te the date of marriage, just
as they can now.

MAY 12, 1938
As to section 5, 1 plead with honourable
members who are ini favour of this Bill to
vote to have this section restored, because it
meets the objection that many people would
otberwise have to the measure. As I pointed
out earlier this afternoon, that section met
the objection that certain parties had to the
English Bill, because persons ini favour of
the principle of divorce feit that if a marniage could neot succeed af.ter three years it
was reasonable to permit a petition for divorce
on other grounds than adultery. I am nlot
appealing to anyone who is absolutely opposed
to the Bill, sucl as those who take the stand
that was stated yesterday by the honourable
gentleman from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton). I think the three years provision
is a reasonable one, except where the ground
Then, if section 5 is passed,
is adultery.
I shahl propose my amendment to section 4.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I quite agree with
the honourabie member, but 1 suggest that
lie shouhd simply move an amendment to
clause 5 providing that it shaîl not apply to
any petition based on the ground of adultery.
Is that what my honourable friend means?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes. 1 thought that
section 4 would have to be amended to cover
that.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: It is simphy a question of drafting.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: 1 am in this embarrassing position. -I arn quite prepared to
vote for the amendment of section 5 if I am
sure that section 4, with the proposed amendment, is going to pass. But if section 4 does
flot pass, then I arn against section 5, because I am certainly opposed to any limitation
of the rights that our provincial courts now
have to deal with the question of adultery as
a ground for divorce. So it seemis ta me
that section 5 must be amended as suggested
by the honourable senior senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. McMeans), so that we may
know what we are doing.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I am agreeable ta tliat.
The CHAIRMAN: Then section 5 is ta
read:
No petition for divorce, cxcept an the ground
of adultery, shail be presented ta or entertained by the court until a periad of tliree
years shaîl have elapsed since the date of the
marriage.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That covers it.
I wouhd

If I understood him, lie would add ta aid
section 5 another subsection simply stating:

"This section shaI flot apply in the case of

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Ail right; put it that
way. It is the samne thing.
The CHAIRM AN: Shail subsection 1 of
section 5 carry-restrictions on petitions for
divorce?
Hon. Mr. McGUIRE: It says, "No petition shail be presented ta the court." That
does not exhaust the whcle subjeet. What
about a petition ta Parliament?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Nothing can
interfere with a jpetition ta Parliament. That
is deaht with by the rules.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Parliament can
grant divorce by a private Bill.
Subsection 1 of section 5 was agreed to.
Subsections 2, 3 and 4 of section 5 were
agreed ta.
On subsection 5 of section 5--misconduet
within three years after marriage:
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: That subsection goes
out.
The CHAIRMAN: What shahl be substituted?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: It is suggested by
the right honourable leader on this side (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) that there should be a
subsection reading: "This section shall not
apply to petitions filed on the ground of
adultery."
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I think subsection
5 should remain, because there miglit be
grounds for judicial separation within a period
of tliree years.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Subsection 5 shouhd
stay in.
Subsection 5 was agreed ta.
The CHAIRMAN: I think you were going
to add another subelause as No. 6.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. I suggest it read as follows:
This section shall not apply in tlie case of
a petition for divorce on the ground of
adultery.

The proposed amendmnent was agreed ta.
Section 5, as amended, was agreed tc.
The CHAIRMAN: Now we will return to

On section 4-jurisdiction of the court augmented (reconsidered):
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It will be necessary to

The proposed amendment was agreed to.
Section 4, as amended, was agreed to.
On section 6-grounds of petition for divorce
by either husband or wife:
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: This section states
the grounds of petitions for divorce. I must
confess I was much impressed by the argument

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have no
objection to the motion carrying. I do not
pretend to have given any lengthy thought
to the subject introduced by the honourable
senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris), but in the meantime, as I am not a
member of the special commi-ttee, and as for
other reasons I shall be unable to attend its
sittings, that is, if this Bill goes back to the
special committee to be dealt withHon. Mr. HUGESSEN: No, no.

honourable senator from Vancouver

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am inclined
to think it should. This is a fundamental
change. However, I just want to put on record
a few thoughts. I sec a very great difference

South (Hon. Mr. Farris) early in the afternoon as to the possibility that sections 12 and

between the avoidance of a voidable marriage
and the dissolution of that marriage. That

13 are beyond the competence of this Parlia-

difference has been established for a long
period of time in the Old Land. Grounds that
are approipriate for dissolution may not be
appropriate for avoidance, and, vice versa,
grounds appropriate for avoidance may not
be appropriate for dissolution. There is a
very wide difference between a marriage which
is a nullity from the beginning, no matter
what may be the conduct of either party
thereafter, and a marriage which can be made
a nullity only by effective court decree. A
woman may marry a man afflicted as stated
in section 12-which was in the mind of the
honourable member-and the affliction may
be serious or it may not. If it made a
ground for nullity, the poor woman has no
choice; anybody can take steps to have that
marriage annulled-her father or any other
relative, or a relative of the man. But the
woman may say: "No. I married this man in
accordance with the law of my province, and
the marriage is valid. It may be I could get
it set aside, but I do not want to, and I do
not want anybody else to, either." That is
just such a thing as is contemplated by the
wording of this Bill. I think it is the law
that a voidable marriage cannot be set aside
by anybody except one of the parties to the
marriage. If either chose to take action, and
establish cause, he or she could do so. Of
course, a marriage void ab initio is void whatever anybody does; and if it is thought wise
to have a court declaration, anybody can
institute proceedings and have a marriage
which was never validly contracted declared a
nullity.
I hope honourable senators have the matter
clear in their minds. It is a very grave distinction. The whole scheme of this Bill is to
assert what this Parliament thinks the
grounds ought to be on which a marriage is
voidable at the instance of one of the parties
to it, but otherwise absolutely valid and

of the

nient for the reason that those sections purport to make a marriage voidable on certain
grounds defined in section 12. It seems to
me that any possible doubt as to the competence of this Parliament to enact sections
12 and 13 would be avoided if, instead of
enacting them as they are at present under the
heading of "nullity," the causes of nullity now
to be found in section 12 were to be added to
the causes of divorce in section 6. This would
place the matter on the basis, not of the
nullification by this Parliament of a marriage
previously valid by provincial law, but of
divorce on the same basis as the other causes
in section 6. That, of course, would entail
considerable redrafting of section 6, and probably the disappearance of sections 12 and 13.
I think what I have suggested would meet the
constitutional objection of the honourable
senator from Vancouver South. As he indicated
-and I think the Senate is seized of the pointit might be extremely prejudicial several years
hence if sections 12 and 13 were passed in their
present form, with doubts as to their constitutionality; whereas by this simple recast-

ing of the Bill we could make it abundantly
clear that what we have done, that is, making
these causes matters of divorce rather than
of nullity, was within our competence.
I must admit that I have not in my hand the
necessary amendment for this purpose. It
would require a good deal of consideration
and redrafting. Having in mind the important
end to be achieved, I would suggest that
the Committee report progress, with a view
to the redrafting of clause 6 and any other
substantive clauses which may need to be
redrafted, in order to clarify them and make
it quite evident that this Parliament is acting
within its constitutional powers.
I therefore move that the Committee rise

Pand report progress and ask leave to sit again.

MAY 12, 1938
binding until avoided, even though avoidance
may go back to the time of the marriage.
Parliament states the grounds upon which that
action may be taken, and also the separate
grounds on which a divorce action may be
taken-another thing altogether, a dissolution
of the marriage because of conduct of one of
the parties subsequent thereto. The penalty
which the man or the woman pays is that
their marriage is subject to dissolution if that
conduct occurs during the marriage state.
But something that the man was afflicted with
at the time of marriage may be an appropriate
su'bject for the avoidance of the marriage,
not for its dissolution. With all possible respect for the views of others, and with high
admiration indeed for the way the case was
stated by the honourable senator from Vancouver South, I do submit the Bill is constructed
on sound lines-sounder lines than would be
effected by modifications suggested by honourable gentlemen.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: May I ask my right
honourable friend this question? Is it not a
fact that the proposal made by my honourable friend from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) would cure any doubts as to constitutionality?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, I admit
that quite clearly. But I answer in this way.
First, I do not think there are doubts. I
may be just as liable to be wrong as anybody else. Secondly, the curing is done at
considerable expense. You are making something a subject for divorce and dissolution
which should not be; something whioh is
an appropriate subject for avoidance if either
party chooses to take advantage of it; something which the man has not committed since
he was married, I would rather have the
Bill as it is, where the appropriate subjects
meet the appropriate penalties and remedies,
both as respects the field of avoidance and
the field of divorce.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Honourable senators
will, I hope, allow me to make two or three
more observations, since I am not on the
special committee to which this Bill may go.
First, what my right honourable friend has
just said about anybody having the right to
deal with something which is void is not in
issue on this immediate point,Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: -because, as to the
difference between a voidable marriage and a
dissolution of marriage, in either case none

but the parties to the marriage càn take
action.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: Quite right.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I quite understood my
right honourable friend did not intend that it
should have any relation to this part of the
case. Certainly, as to the theory that dissolution relates to subsequent conduct, while
nullity relates to prior conduct, the section
itself is not consistent, for if honourable
members will look at paragraph (a) of section
12 they will see it reads:
that the marriage has not been consummated
owing to the wilful refusal of the respondent
to consummate it.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I did not say
prior altogether. It may be prior or coincident. No marriage is complete without
consummation; and therefore failure to consummate is prior or coincident.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: My right honourable
friend says it is not complete?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: So far as the legal
effects are concerned, it is complete.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: And if either party
does not raise the question of the legal incidents the marriage is valid.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
The motion was agreed to.
Progress was reported.

SENATE
REPORT OF TURGEON ROYAL
COMMISSION
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. GILLIS inquired of the Government:
What matters or facts relating to the grain
industry of Canada that were heretofore unknown to Parliament and men in the industry
did the Turgeon Royal Commission on Grain
discover and report upon to the Government
and Parliament?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have received
the following answer to the inquiry:
The Commissioner, Mr. Justice Turgeon,
was asked by the Government to inquire into
and report upon the various matters cited
in the Order in Council P.C. 1577 of 27th
June, 1936. The report tabled in the House
of Commons on Monday, May 9, embodies a
review of the evidence taken and the judgment
of the Commissioner upon each of the specified
subjects listed in the Order in Council.
The inquiry related chiefly to economic
matters and facts. These are listed and related in the report in such a way that a
proper and considered judgment may be
derived from them. It is impossible to state
what matters or facts were "unknown to Parliament and men in the industry."
The Order in Council referred to reads as
follows:
P.C. 1577. Certified to be a true copy of
a Minute of a Meeting of the Committee of
the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency
the Governor General on the 27th June, 1936.
The Committee of the Privy Council have
had before them a report from the Acting
Minister of Trade and Commerce, stating that
the various problems pertaining to the production and marketing of Canadian wheat and
other grains have been engaging the earnest
consideration of the Sub-Committee of the
Privy Council. consisting of the Minister of
Agriculture, the Minister of the Interior, the
Minister of Finance and the Minister of Trade
and Commerce, which Sub-Committee was
authorized to examine and advise upon such
matters; that the Sub-Committee has taken
cognizance of the discussions upon the subject
in the House of Commons and has come to
the conclusion that it would be to the public
advantiage that an inquiry be made into all the
matters involved.
The Minister, therefore, recommends that the
Honourable William Ferdinand Alphonse Turgeon, of Regina, Saskatchewan, a Judge of
the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan, be
appointed a Commissioner under Part I of The
Inquiries Act being Chapter 99 of the Revised
Statutes of Canada, 1927, to inquire into and
to report upon the subject of the production
buying, selling, holding, storing, transporting
and exporting of Canadian grains and grain
products, and other questions incident to such
matters, and in particular, but without restrieting the generality of the foregoing terms, to
inquire into and to report upon:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

1. The method now or heretofore employed
in marketing Canadian grains abroad, including Government grain boards, co-operative or
pool marketing, price stabilization measures
and the open market or competitive method;
and the effect of these various methods upon
markets.
2. All transactions since the year 1930 pertaining to the handling of grain for relief and
seeding purposes in the provinces of Manitoba,
Saskatchewan and Alberta under the Dominion
Government guarantee, or otherwise.
3. The extent. if iany, to which the Canadian
Wheat Board protected speculative short interests in the Winnipeg wheat market in December
1935, immediately following the higher price
fixed by the Argentine Government for Argentine wheat: and the effeet, whether beneficial or
harmful, of any such action taken by the Board.
4. The effect of the practice of mixing and
of the selection of grain for protein content
by millers and exporters.
5. The causes of the decrease in Canadian
grain exports in recent years.
6. The measures which should be taken to
retain and to extend the marketing throughout the world of Canadian wheat and other
grains and their products.
The Minister further recommends that for
the purpose of making such inquiry the Commissioner shall have the special authority
specified under Part 3 of The Inquiries Act
aforesaid.
The Minister further recommends that the
Commissioner be instructed to make his report
as speedily as possible.
The Committee concur in the foregoing
recommendations and subrmit the same for
approval.
(Signed) E. J. Lemaire,
Clerk of the Privy Council.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: This is a very gratifying answer, I am sure.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I am quite
certain the honourable gentleman will be
very much interested in the report.

DIVORCE AND MATRIMONIAL
CAUSES BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On the Order:
The House again in Committee of the Whole
on Bill B, an Act respecting Divorce and
Matrimonial Causes, as amended.-Hon. Mr.
Murdock.
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
Honourable
members of the Senate, before I leave the
Chair I should like to make a short state-

MAY 17, 1938M
ment with regard to a certain question Of
procedure in relation to Bill B which wua
raised on Thursday Iast. It was noV possible,
in rendering my decision, to quote the authorities, owing to the limited time available at
the moment. Ais a matter of fact there doea
not appear to be any specific rule covering
the point. It has been suggested, however,
by an honourable member, that I should
make a reference to the matter, coupled with
the reasons for my decision, and this I
now do.
Senate Rule 1 states that in instances where
the Senate has no rule applicable to the
question under consideration, the Rules and
Procedure of the House 'of Lords shahl be
followed.
The Senate has no specific rule with respect to the recommittal of a Bill; therefore
we must go to the House of Lors for
guidance.
May, page 420:
A Bill may be recomamitted as often as the
House thinks fit. Bills have been recommnitted
twice, and even six or seven times.
Sometimes, after the House has ordered a
Bill to be read the third time on a future
day, this order is diocharged and the Bill
recommitted; Dr amendmenta have been movedas was done by the honourable the junior
senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig)-to the question for reading a Bill the third
time in order to obtain the recommittal of
the Bill...
Even though -a Bill has been considered by
a select committeeas in the case of Bil1 Bis recommitted to a Oommittee of the
-it
Whole House.
May, at page 419:
A Bill may be recomsnitted without limitation, in which case the entire Bill is again
consjdered in Committee and reported with

Hon. Mr. Murdock ini the Chair.
The CHAIRMAN: When this Bull was in
Committee the other day we had prooeeded,
I think, to the extent of discussing it up Io)
clause 4, giving some consideration te claowe
5, and returning to clause 4. Then the Cern'
mittee rose, reported progress and aked leave
teosit again. It would now appear that we
should begin at clause 6 of the Bull.
On clause 6--grounds of petition for divorce,
etc.:
Hlon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Perhaps 1 should
explain that when the Committee rose the
other day, at my suggestion, the intention
was te see whether certain amendments could
not be made tu clause 6 in order te meet the
constitutional objection raised by the honoursble senator frnm Vancouver South (Hon.
Mr. Farris). It was thought then that it
might be necessary to amend clause 6. 1
understand, however, that after discussion and
consideration it has been decided to submit
certain eanendments to clauses 12 and 13 which
will accomplish the same purpose with respect
te the question of constitutionality. Therefore, so far as my suggestion of the other day
is concerned, I have no ameudment ta offer
to clause 6 as now before the Committee.
Section 6 was agreed to.
Sections 7 to 11, inclusive, were agreed to.

On section 12-new grounds for decree of
nullity:
Hon. W. M. ASELTINE: Honourable
senators, in connection with this section I
should like to place on the record some
observations having to do with the constitutional question which arose the last time
this Bill was being considered in Committee.

SENATE

The other three paragraphs of section 12
ail assume an existing, valid marriage, interruptable within one year, by election, because
of what is tantamount to fraud. The doctrine is, as in the English Act, mentioned as
one of "nullity," and heading and side note
use the saine expression.
But the resuits
provided for are flot those of nullity at coinmon law, and that the marriage is flot treatable as void from the beginning is plain. ALso,
by reason of section 4, the provisions of
sections 12 and 13 are segregated as new
jurisdiction. And lines 26 to 28 of section
4 state:
And isuch new jurisdiction, so conferred, and
that only, shall be deemed to be based upon
and derived under this Act.
Upon the avoidance of a marriage on any
of the four new grounds ail the ordinary
incidents of a dissolution of marriage are to
resuit. This is quite unlike a common law
"4nuli" or "avoided" marriage.
Note, for example, section 14. "Nullity"
is therein bracketed with divorce and judicial separation, with the samne consequences.
The annulled marriage of which the section
speaks gives "the wife" ail the alimony and
other advantages of any other "wife." And
the children are not only legitimate, under
section 13, but under subsection 2 of section
14 they, "on any decree of nullity of marniage," are entitled to have moneys secured
for them until they are of age.
For the foregoing reasons I believe the Bill
as a whole is intra vires; but I think it
should be amended so, as to remove the
reasonable doubts of those who have raised
objections to sections 12 and 13.
I intend to move the following amendments, seconded by the honourable the senior
senator fromn Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. MeMeans).
In view of the fact that section 5 was reinserted, it wili be necessary to renumber
ail the sections as tbey originally appeared in
print on second reading.
The CHAIRMAN:

We shall do that at

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Then I move the
following amendments:

Page 5, uine 13: leave out "six"; restore

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE.

Page 6, uine 19: strike out "annulment" and
substitute "avoidance."
Page 6, lines .23 and 24: between lines 23
and 24 insert the following as new subsections
2 and 3, and renumber existing subsections 2
and 3 as 4 and 5. Before reading subsection
2 1 should like to point outThe CHAIRMAN: Will the honourable
senator aliow the Committee to deal again
mith. section il?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I think we adopted
11. We are dealing with 12.
The CHAIRM AN: I shoulýd like to ask
the chairman of the special committee whether
the word "desertion" was struck out of line
31 of section 11. My impression la that it
ivas struck out. Then the subsection would
read:
On any such petition for divorce the court
may treat tlie decree of judiciai separation
as sufficient proof of the adultery or other
ground on which it was granted ...
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: The idea apparently
was to, provide that the evidence taken on an
application for judiciai separation, after, say,
the lapse of three years, could be used in an
action for divorce, which could not be instituted until after the lapse of five years.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I was dealing with
a proposed amnendment of section 13 when
you, Mr. Chairman, referred back to section
11. In connection with the ameodment which
I intcnd to offer, I would say that the oldest
jurisdiction in Canada h-aving to do with
divorce and matrimonial causes is that of the
province of Nova Scotia. In 1866 the law
of that province was amendeci to read that
the court might direct the examination of
witnesses orally and declare by definite
scntence or otherwise the marriage between
the parties to the suit nuil and void from.
such time as the court might deemn proper. It
is chiefly in view of this law that we propose
to, surmont the difficulty raised by the hionourabie senator from Vancouver South (Hon.
Mr. Farris). The proposed subsection 2,
which I was deaiing with, would read as
foilows:
In the case of a marriage avoided pursuant
to paragraph (a) of section 12, the decree
shail relate back to such date, not earlier
than three months 'after the date of the marriage, as shail be lixed and namied in the
(iecree hy the court.
In other woýrds, it does not become voici ab
initio.
Then subsection 3 of section 13:
In the case of a marriage avoided pursuant
to paragraphs (b), (c) or (d) of section
tweive the decree shall relate back to such

MAY 17, 1938
date, flot earlier t'han the .time of discovery
by the petitioner of the existence of the grounds
for a decree, and such date shall be fixed and
named in the decree lby the court.
By thoee amendments, 1 submit, the constitutional difficulty will be overcome.
There are some further arnendments on page
6. At line 19 leave out the word "annulment" and substitute the word "avoidance."
Line 25, leave out "eleven" and restore
"'twelve." At line 28, leave out "eleven"
and restore, "twelve." At lines 32 and 33,
leave out the first two uines of section 14 and
substitute the following:
When a petition for divorce or judicial separation or avoidance of marriage has been
presented to the court under and pursuant to
any one or more of sections six to thirteen,
both inclusive, of this Act, the court shalAnd then the remainder of the clause remains.
Then on page 7, line 2, leave out "nullity of
marriage" and substitute "avoidance of
marriage muade under and pursuant to this
Act."
On page 7, lime 2, leave out clause 18.
The CHAIRMAN: You said to, leave out
something from page 7. line 2. Would you
repeat that? You had one amendruent in
line 2, to, strike out "nullity of marriage" and
insert "avoidance of marriage."
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: "Avoidance of marniage made under and pursuant to, this Act."
The CHAIRMAN:
What is the other
amendment?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Strike out clause 18.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Line 31.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Yes.
The CHAIRMAN: What is your pleasure
as to these amendruents? Shall we take them
up one at a time as we come to them?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Carried.
The CHAIRMAN:
Shall these amendments that have been proposed carry?
Rîght Hon. Mr.. MEIGHEN:
I arn in
favour of the amendxnents as I understand
theru, but I think the Committee desires to,
have their purpose clearly in -mi.
There
was a difference of view as to a possible doubt
arising.
The CHAIRMAN:
Would the honourable senator (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) let me have
a copy of what he ie proposing?
Right Hon,. Mr. MEIGHEN: There was
a difference of view about the possibility o>f
doubt arising ini respeçt of Dominion jurisdic51958--20 J

tion as to avoidance. The ground of the
doubt, according to the honourable senator
froru Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris)and probably he is correct-was that inasmuch
as avoidance under the common law juris.
diction, nut ini respect of jurisdiction founded
upon this measure, is retroactive to the extent of declaring the marriage void ab initio,
there might be an infringement upon provincial jurisdiction as to nullity. It will be recalled that I took the view that there would
not be an infringement, and the honourable
senator from Vancouver South very strongly
insisted that there was at least a doubt.
Now, Parliamentary Counsel has been good
enough to, outline a via media, if I may s0
eaul it, though he maintains very strongly
that our jurisdiction in avoidance is undoubted. This via media provides for avoidance
without necessarily making the marriage void
ab initio. I have not had an opportunity of
consulting with tbe honourable senator fromn
Vancouver South, but I kn-ow he will have
read the memnorandumn prepared by Parliamentary Counsel. I am in entire agreement
with this method of meeting the situation,
and if the honourable senator agrees wîth it
the work of the Committee will, I am sure,
be facilitated. I have no doubt that thîs is
what is suggested by the honourable senator
from West Central Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine), but 1 should like to be certain
that the senator who raised the point (Hon.
Mr. Farris) feels that this is the best method
of handling the matter.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Honourable senators,
I arn not sure whether this is the best method
or not, but I think it is an effective method,
and, after anl, that is ahl we need. As I said
when this question was up before, my apprehension was that an avoidance simplicitur
did constitute an avoidance ab initio, interfering with the contract which was made by
the parties at the ceremony, and which was
part of the solemnization. This amendment,
clearly, prevents that from happening, for
it fixes the date of nullification-if that is not
a contradiction of terms. The only thing
that bothers me is its artistic correctness.'
But we have the precedent of a statute of
Nova Scotia which bas been sixty or seventy
years in existence. So I thînk that in the
circumstances the proposai might very wel
be accepted as meeting the situation.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Perhaps the,
better way would be to hand the memorandum, to the Chairman.
The CHAIRMAN:

I have a copy now.

SENATE
The proposai now before us is to strike
out on page 4, line 15, the word "seven" and
restore the word "eight." That wull be necessary, I judge, as a result of some amendments made, and the adoption or re-adoption
of section 5 of the Bill.
The amendment was agreed to.
The CHAIRMAN: Then, page 4, line 19,
strike out "six" and restore "seven."
The amendment was agreed to.
The CHAIRMAN: On page 5, line 13, strike
out "six" and restore "seven."
The amendment was agreed to.
The CHAIRMAN: Also leave out "seven"
and restore "eight" in the same line.
The amendment was agreed to.
The CHAIRMAN: Then, on page 5, line
41, leave out "twelve" and restore "thirteen."
Shall that carry?
The amendment was agreed to.
Hlon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Was the heading in
line 41 of page 5 flot to be changed by the
insertion of "Avoidance" instead of "Nullitv"?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think so.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I arn advised by
the Senate Counsel that that and the marginal
note are matters of clerical correction.
The CHAIRMAN: On page 5, at line 41,
the word "Nullity" will be struck out and the
word "Avoidance" substituted.
Section 12 as amended was agreed to.
On section 13-limitation of effect of section 12:
The CHAIRMAN: Page 6, line 14, heave
out "eheven" and restore "twelve."
The amendment was agreed to.
The CHAIRMAN: Then page 6, line 19,
strike out "annulment" and substitute "avoidance."

Hon. Mr. PARENT: I understand, of
course, that after ail these amendments have
been carried the Bill will be reprinted so that
the Senate may know what it is about. We
cannot amend a Bill of this nature without
knowing what we are doing. Just a few
honourahie members have certain papers in
their hands; everybody bas not got them.
The CHAIRMAN: The amendments will
appear in the Minutes to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: There should be an
entirely new Bill. Then we shall have time
to think it over.
Right Hon.

Mr. MEIGHEN.

The CHAIRMAN: That will be determined
by the Senate.
The amendment was agreed to.
The CHAIRMAN: Now, page 6, uines 23
and 24: between uines 23 and 24 insert the
following as new suhclauses 2 and 3, and
renumber existing subelauses 2 and 3 as 4 and
5. The new suhelauses would he as follows:
(2) In the case of a marriage avoided pursuant to paragraph (a) of section twelve the
decree shahl relate back to such date, flot
earljer than three inonthis after the date of
the marriage, as shahl be fixed and named in
the decree by the court.
Shahl the new subsection carry?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: What is
the meaning of that?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It just means
that in the event of an avoidance founded
upon subelause (a), which relates to refusaI
f0 consummate, the avoidance cannot be made
an avoidance ah initio, or in effect relate farther
back than to, a date three months subsequent
to the marriage.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: What is
the point? What is the difference betwcen
making it void three months after the marriage
and making it void ah initio?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: The difference
is just three months, that is ail.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Does the
right honourable gentleman say that is al
the difference?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is ahi
the difference. That is not a smart answer.
The CHAIRMAN: Shahl this new
section 2 of clause 13 on page 6 carry?

sub-

The amendment was agreed to.
The CHAIRMAN: Now, new subsection 3
of the same section:
(3) In the case of a marriage avoided pursuant to paragraphs (b). (c) or (d) of section

Right Hon. Mr.

MEIGREN:

It

seems

very logical.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:

Is this

a Chinese puzzle?

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is reahly
very simple. There are three causes, besides
the one I mentioned before, for which, if
established, the marriage may be avoided.

They are really causes that might be said to
revolve around the establishment of fraud.
That la to say, if the marriage was secured
hy some quasi-fraudulent method, such as
a man representing himself as fit to be
married when he was not, the quasi-fraudulent character of his act, if established, would
give grounds for avoidance of that marriage
eontract. Then the deelaration of avoidance
can relate bark in any single case flot farther
than to the discovery of the existence of the
facts upon which the fraud la alleged. That
la to say, if one party finds a month after,
a year after, or a week after, that one of
these causes existed, and desires to have the
marriage avoided on that account, and estahlishes the cause, the decree takes effeet not
earlier than the date of the discovery of the
facts.

Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I presume
there might be unsoundness of mind which
would be not of such a character as to give
grounds for nullity, but sufficient to give
grounds for avoidance. I do not know just
what the doctrine of nullity based on unsoundness of mind la.
I arn
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
asking this seriously, because it seems to me
that Parliament is saying that the nullity
shall he only from the time of the discovery
of insanity, while provincial leglalation might
provide that the petitioner is entitled to a
decree of nullity ah initio. In sucli circumstances there would be a contradiction.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: No. If the
suit were for a declaration of nullity ah initio,
based on provincial leglalation, then the petitioner would be entitled to such a declaration,
no matter what we enacted.
The amendment was agreed to.
The CHAIRMAN: The subsections that
were numbered 2 and 3 in the original Bill

SENATE
ORDER FOR THIRD READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
Bill be read a third time?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I would suggest that
it might be read a third time now.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Honourable members,
a suggestion was made that, in view of the
several amendments made to the Bill, it
would be reprinted and sufficient time would
be given to honourable members to re-read it.
If that course meets with the approval of the
House, the third reading would have to go
over until the next sitting, in any event.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Maybe after
consideration for another twenty-four hours
the honourable member will support the Bill?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Well, I would not
make that promise.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: If there is any
objection to having the third reading now,
I an agreeable to putting it over until the
next sitting.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: Do I understand,
honourable senators, that this Bill will be
reprinted in its present form before we are
asked to vote upon third reading? After
having made so many amendments we should
have an opportunity to see how the Bill as a
whole reads.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, I suggest there is really no need for
reprinting the Bill. While a lot of amendments have been made, I should say that
about four-fifths of them are for renumbering sections because of our having reinserted
a section that had been stricken out. There
are only two other changes. Two subsections
provide for the earliest date at which a
-declaration or decree of avoidance can take
effect, and in another section the words
avoidance of marriage" are substituted for
"nullity of marriage." The various amendments will appear in the Minutes to-morrow.
The Bill was ordered to be placed on the
Order Paper for third reading to-morrow.
UNEMPLOYMENT
AND
TURAL ASSISTANCE

AGRICULBILL

SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 105, an Act to assist in
the alleviation of Unemployment and Agricultural Distress.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this Bill is stated clearly in the preamble:
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE.

Whereas it is in the national interest that the
Dominion should continue for a further period
to support and supplement the measures of the
provinces and other bodies to establish certain
unemployed persons in gainful occupations, to
train other unemployed persons for like establishment and to assist those in need and thereby

lessen provincial and municipal burdens consequent upon unemployment and agricultural
distress.
The object is to provide for a continuation,
in the coming fiscal year, of federal support to
the provinces and other bodies in their efforts
to alleviate unemployment and agricultural
distress. The terms of the Bill are essentially
the same as those of the Unemployment and
Agricultural Assistance Act, 1937, which expired
on March 31. The measure authorizes negotiation of agreements with the provinces and
others to support and supplement directly
their financial efforts to the extent that Parliament appropriates moneys for the purposes
mentioned, and, indirectly, to make loans, to
such of the provinces as require that form of
assistance, of an amount up to, but not exceeding, their respective shares of the costs of
projects and undertakings which they may
carry on, under the agreements, during the
coming fiscal year.
Although conditions relative to unemployment in general, throughout the Dominion,
and to agricultural distress in certain areas
have considerably improved within the last
twelve months, the Government considers that
necessity still exists for a continuation of Dominion support to the provinces and, through
them, to the municipalities.
The terms of the Bill are sufficiently broad
to allow the Governor in Council to continue
to carry on for the year all forms of activities heretofore carried on under preceding
relief Acts. In the preamble special emphasis
is laid on assisting efforts to train and establish in gainful occupations the unemployed
persons who are capable of being so trained
and established.
Substantial headway was made in the past
year in initiating, organizing and executing,
with the co-operation of all provinces, a wide
program for the training of youth. The training
and rehabilitation of other age groups was
also assisted, and it is hoped that the scope
of those particular forms of endeavour will
be considerably extended through the medium
of this proposed egislation.
It is further hoped that within the course
of the year substantial progress will be made,
through collaboration with the provinces, first
in definitely settling constitutional difficulties
so as to allow the Dominion and the provinces
to make equitable division of the responsibilities and problems of employment, unem-

MAY 17, 1938
ployment 'and retraîninig, and, secondly, in dealing with those problems in a long-view,
comprehensive manner.
Action i this respect will he taken i the
Iight of our own experiences and those of
other countries. Assistance and guidance will
be sought from the labours and reports of the
National Employment Commission and such
parts of the reports of the Rowell Commission as may touch upon these problemas.
In the interim. the legisiation suggested by
this Bill is required to bridge the gap.
As I have already said, the terms of this
Bill do not vary in any essential from those
of the Act which is now expiring. There are
a few changes i the Bill, but these are purely
minor and do not change the principle of
last year's and previous Acts.
As my honourable colleagues know, the Bill
of last year was followed by a special supplementary estimate containing detail votes of
the moncys to be spent under the enabling
legisiation. This year, I understand, instead of
a special supplementary estimate to cover
the expenditures which will be made when
this Bill is enacted, those expenditures will be
provided for in the final supplementary estimates.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Is the Government estimating how much money it will
be spending under Governor General's warrants over and above both estimates?
My right hionHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ourable friend knows that such expenditure
ie inescapable. If hie himself had been confronted with a drought in southerni Saskatchewan and southern Alberta hie would have
been obliged to take the responsibiity of
askjng for special warrants from the Governor
General.

1

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The previous
practice was to make statutory provision in
advance. for just that sort of contingeney.
That statute was spurned by the honourable
member.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We proceeded
otherwise, and I will now lay before the
Senate the form which we adopted last year.
That special supplementary estimate contained twelve separate votes as follows:
Vote 301-To provide for comxitmnents under
relief settiement agreements with provincial
governments.

Vote 302-To provide for federal contribution to provincial and municipal relief projects.
Vote 303-To provide for agricultural reestablishment in co-operation with provincial
governmetits.
Vote 304-To provide for federal contribution to farmn employment and supplementary
plans.

Vote 305-To provide for outstanding dlaims

for direct relief under Unemployment Relief

Acts of previous years.
Vote 306--To provide for outstanding dlaims
for drought area. relief under the Relief Act,
1933.

Vote 307-To provide for federal contributions towards the Greater Winnipeg Sewage
Disposai Scheme.

My right honourable friend will remember
that thîs sewage disposai scheme was initiated by his own Government in 1934-35.
Vote 308--To provide for development and
training projects for unemployed young people.
Vote 309-To provide for direct relief in the

dried-out areas.
Vote 310-Amount required to provide for
administration expenses generally, including
salaries and travelling expenses.

Vote 311-Unforeseen contingencies.
Vote 312-Grants-in-aid.
For the enlightenment of honourable senators, I should like to place on Hansard a detailed statement of what was done under those
various heads. The statement is as follows:

I may say there are only minor differences
between this Bill and that which was enacted
lst session. The title is the same as that of
last year. The preamble is new, but does
not deviate in principle from that of last
year. There is no change in the short title
except as to the year. There is no change
as to administration.
If honourable senators have the Bill before
them they will notice that in clause 3 there
is no change, except that the words "works
and," which appeared between the first and
second words of line 3, "such" and "undertakings," have been omitted, and the words
"Governor in Council" have been substituted
for the word "he" which appeared in the
second last line of this subsection.
The words "work or" have been omitted
in this year's draft where they appeared
between the words "such" and "undertaking"
in the first line of subsection 2 of section 3
of last year's Act. I may say that in a couple
of places the word "relief" has been dropped
and the word "assistance" substituted.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
reason for that?

What is the

When a simiHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
lar Bill was before us last session the word
"relief" was dropped from the title, which
read "an Act to assist in the alleviation of
unemployment and agricultural distress." So
the word "assistance" was carried into the
Bill to conform with the title itself. I am
not sufficiently well versed in the English
language to state whether one word or the
other should be preferred, but I notice that
in the debate which took place in the other
House a prominent member, who was a colleague of my right honourable friend, spoke
of the humiliating situation of people who
had to accept relief. That may have been
one of the reasons why the substitution was
made. There may also have been a sentimental or psychological reason. But this is
of very little concern as to the interpretation
of the Act.
In subsection 3 of section 3 the words
"such work or," which appeared in the first

51958-21
REVIsED EDITION

SENATE

line

of this subsection in last year's Act, have
been omitted, in accordance with deletion of
the words "works and" and "work or" in subsections 1 and 2.
The words "towards which the Dominion
Government is providing financial assistance"
have been substituted after the word "undertaking," the third word in the present draft,
for the words appearing in last year's Act,
"to which the Dominion Government is contributing." This change is made by reason
of the fact that the Dominion's assistance to
the province is not confined to contributions,
but also takes the form of loans.
The words "then, unless otherwise provided by agreement" have been inserted
after the words "provincial jurisdiction" in
the third line of this subsection.
Subsection 4 of section 3 has been deleted,
as it is the view of the law officers of the
Crown that the provisions of section 2, in
conjunction with the provisions of section
7, provide the Minister with all the authority requisite for the proper administration of
the provisions of the Act.
The provision authorizing the Governor in
Council, where necessary, to make loans to
the province for its share of expenditures
under any agreement, which was incorporated
in clause 4 of last year's Act, has been
lifted out of clause 4 this year and becomes
subsection 1 of clause 5; so that clause 4
in this year's Bill covers the other authority
provided by clause 4 of last year's Act,
namely, the authority of the Governor in
Council to enter into agreements with any
of the provinces respecting assistance to those
in need, and the alleviation of unemployment
conditions and of agricultural distress, and also
to enter into agreements with corporations,
partnerships or individuals engaged in industry
respecting the expansion of industrial employment and providing for payments for any of
the said purposes out of such moneys as may
be appropriated by Parliament for the present
fiscal

year.

The words "and to assist those in need"
have been added to paragraph (a) of this
clause.
This phrase does not in any way
expand the authority granted under previous
Acts, but it clarifies the authority of the
Dominion Government, so that there may be
no doubt as to its authority to extend a grant
in aid to any province where such grant is
deemed necessary.
I think I have fairly covered the amendments made to the Act of last year, and I
believe they justify me in saying that the
present Bill is in its essentials that of last
year. With these remarks I move the second
reading of the Bill.
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, I do not intend to delay the House at
any great length, nor do I intend to discuss
the legal details of the Bill. I am very
much delighted with the Bill, but I notice
that under clause 8 the Government apparently can pass an Order in Council and give
it the force of law. I have a distinct recollection that when I was a young man in the
Legislature of Manitoba there was great objection to such provisions as that. However, I
want to discuss the question of relief.
We have had the problem of unemployment relief before us since 1930. It is true
that since then there has been a reduction in
unemployment relief; but if you include relief to the farmers of Saskatchewan and Alberta you will find that to-day's figures are
very little lower than those of five or six
years ago. If you cut out the relief to farmers
the figure is about half what it was at its
peak.
The present Administration appointed a commission under the chairmanship of Mr. Purvis,
which recently brought in a report. I have
one objection to that report. The unemployed
have been divided into two classes, the employables and the unemployables. Technically that may be a proper classification, but
the fact remains that, as time goes on, the
number of unemployables will increase to a
marked degree. I am persuaded that in my
own city of Winnipeg at least one-third of
those who are unemployed are unemployable. During the six, seven or eight years
they have been idle they have reached the age
limit of employment, and therefore have lost
their employability.
What I rose to say was this. Mr. Bennett
and bis Administration held that the primary
responsibility for unemployment relief rested
on the municipalities; that if they were unable to take care of the responsibility, it
came back to the provinces, and that in an
emergency the Dominion Covernment had
to help. At the present time the Dominion
Government is paying about one-third of the
cost of unemployment relief, and is lending to
some provinces further sums of money. What
this actually means is that in a city like
Winnipeg, or Montreal, or Vancouver, the
property owners are carrying one-third of
the unemployment relief burden. The city of
Winnipeg has paid hardly any of its relief
costs. It has paid the interest on the money
borrowed. but nothing else.
I think that
during the first year or two the city paid a
part of the unemployment relief, but no
more than went into improvements such as
bridges and other government works of that
character. I heard the member for Windsor

MAY 17, 1938
in the other House say that the same thing
was true of Windsor, and 1 have no doubt
that it applies equally to every other large
city in Canada.
In Winnipeg conditions have been such that
our buildings have been running down for
eight or fine years. Old buildings have been
getting older, no improvements have been
made, maintenance bas been neglected. Furthermore, very often two, three, four or five
families are living in one bouse. In one
quarter of the city the cost of health services is as great as the cost in the other
three-quarters, and amounts to enough money
to provide for the old buildings being replaced with new ones. That, however, is
more easily said than donc. Up toeciglît
years ago, if you werç- a business man and
had money to invest, 'vou might have built
houses and rented or sold them, 'but to-day
nobody will build new bouses in the city of
Winnipeg. 1 venture to say that at least
sixty per cent of the heads of the 4,000 odd
families on relief in our city are niembers
of the building and allied trades, and I have
no doubt that this is true also of cities in the
other parts of Canada. I arn persuaded that
if the Government of Canada would take
over the total cost of relief, even of the unemployables, as recommended by the Purvis
Commission, the dead load of taxes on the
property owners in our cities would be lifted
to such an extent that building operations
would start again in the cities and many
who are now unemployed would be going off
relief.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: To what extent will the
existing boan, companies and insurance cornpanies lend money on mortgages in Manitoba
and the other Western Provinces?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I shahl answer that. Up
to the lst of January of this year aIl the large
life insurance companies would lend money
on the Government Housing Scheme, which,
by and large, worked very well. The owner
had to put up 20 per cent, the boan company
60 per cent, and the Dominion Governanent
20 per cent. The boan was ainortized over a
period of years. The boan company looked
after the collection and kept its share, and
paid the balance to the Government. Since
the lst of January this year the boan cernpanies have stopped lending money in
Winnipeg. One reason is that at the last
session of the Manitoba Legislature the province said it would lend iqo more money, and
W'innipeg would have to look after its own
unemployment relief. This meant that if
the city could not get money to carry on,
the unemployed would have te starve to death.
The mortgage companies and prope:rty owners
51958-21 j

323

stopped lending money because they were
afraid that their equities weuld be wiped out.
A second reason, and a more important
one, is that the Government of the province
of Alberta during the recent session passed
legislation which, if I may say se, is not
Social Credit. We in Western Canada understand Social Credit to mean a manipulation
by whicb the people cau write a cheque, as
they say the bankers do, and caîl it m-oney.
But during the recent session legislation was
passed which simply means, in a word, that
the Government refuses to allow any more
debts te he collected in the province of
Alberta. I need not go into the detail of
that. Another measure imposes a tax of two
per cent per year *on capital, and if it is not
paid by the lst of June there is a penalty of
$10 for evtery day of default. Furtbermore,
you cannot start foreclosure proceedings on,
a mortgage unless you pay $2,000 into court
for the mortgagor, and if you make an
adjustinent with your debtor and it is not
completeL by the lst of July, 1940, the debt
is outlawed. This bas caused a reaction in
the province of Manitoba, and the loan companies and 'life insurance companies have
retired frorn the field altogether, and nobody
can bl-ame them.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The result is that virtually
no building is going on in the province of
Manitoba.
From my knowledge of the building business, in which I was engaged for ten years, I
am persuaded that at least 60 per cent of the
unemployed in Winnipeg are members of the
building trades. They include net only builders, plumbers, electricians and brick.layers,
but carters, quarry men and the like. The
moment you put the unernployed te, work
they want to move out of the five-family
bouse and tbey demand accommodation for
themselves alone. Therefore I am convinced
that if building were stimulated there would
be an increased demand for accommodation.
The city council of Winnipeg bas proposed
a housing seheime with which some agree and
others do not. Apparently the systemn of
housing developed in England, namely that
of the single-family bouse, was the best. This
costs a little more than the building of flats,
but it furnisbes a great des! more labour and
gives a greater number of diversilied trades an
opportunity to engage in tbe work.
I arn convinced that tbe builders in Winnipeg, Montreal or Vancouver should go te,
work on the construction of new buildings.
Rents are going up in Winnipeg. As you
know, we bad in Manitoba last year one of the
best erops we have ever had. I tbink the

324

SENATE

1915 crop was the only one that surpassed it.
Yet with that very good crop and very high
prices-we shall not get as high a price this
year-there has been practically no forward
movement in our cities.
I want to urge on this House and on the
Government the necessity of coming to the
assistance of the cities with respect to the
relief problem. It is a national problem-a
very great national problem.
Another solution of unemployment has been
to place the people ba-ck on the land. Winnipeg has donc a real service in getting farmers
out on the land, and in only a very few
cases has it resulted in failure. It is true
that only people who were farmers before
the depression were placed on the land. Of
nearly 5,000 families on relief in Winnipeg
more than 1,000 have in the last six years
moved into the city from the farm. They
believe that they get a better allowance in
the city than they do in the rural parts. The
back-to-the-farm movement in Manitoba has
been a success so far as it has gone, but it
has its limits. Already all the farms with
empty buildings on them have been occupied,
and any new movement of this kind will
necessitate new buildings. Nevertheless, this
program still has possibilities, particularly
in view of the good crop last year and the
prospects for a crop this year. I know that
the rains of June and early July are
essential to a good crop, but conditions today are very favourable.
But the first step towards solving the
problem of unemployment relief is to take
the load of supporting the unemployed off the
backs of the land owners. Millions of dollars'
worth of property in the city of Winnipeg has
been sold for taxes; therefore there is no
encouragement for building development in the
city. Unless there is some assurance from the
Government of this country that it will
assume that load, I do not sec any prospect
of any new building development in our city.
This is true also, I believe, of Montreal. I
know it is truc of Toronto, because not long
ago I discussed this subject with some people
in that city.
The training of youth is all right, and in
Winnipeg a very good service is being performed in this direction. But it only touches
the surface, for there are from four to five
thousand married people who are on relief,
with their children, and are not touched at all.
If you went into the schools you would find
'hildren in the second and third grades who
have never known of any other kind of
existence than living by relief, and when the
teachers go to visit the homes of these
children they are so discouraged that they
Hion. Mr. HAIG.

are not able to do their best work the next
day. The inspectors have now forbidden them
to visit those homes. I could tell you stories
about that, but I shall content myself with
simply stating that those children are growing up in an atmosphere that is most unfavourable for future citizens of this country.
Members of Parliament may talk in this
House and the other House, and the Minister
of Labour may say what he is going to do, but
the fact remains that unemployment is here.
And unless we take some active measures, it
may always be with us. I admit that there are
many men and women who do not want to
work, but the majority of unemployed are
qualified and willing to work. Of course,
there is no use in going to an unemployed
mechanic or clerk in Winnipeg and telling him
that a farmer out on the Prairie needs a man
to drive a team. The unemployed fellow
will say to you, "I do not know how to
drive a team," and the farmer would not hire
him in any event. With the advances that
have been made in farm machinery-and I
could quote facts to show that great advances
have been made-there is not the employment on our farms that there used to be, and
this has helped to swell the numbers of people
who come to the cities looking for something
to do.
I suggest to the Government that a more
active policy with regard to relief has to be
brought forward. If we could take the cost
of relief off the property owners in our cities,
towns and villages we should make a forward
step toward solution of the problem. Just
look at the financial situation of our Western
Provinces to-day. I doubt whether they will
ever be able to pay their bonded indebtedness.
The Government of Manitoba asserted that
the provincial budget was balanced last year.
Yes, it was, aside from relief, but the expenditure for relief was three and a half million
dollars. I presume that rich provinces like
Ontario and Quebec may be able to meet
their responsibilities under present conditions.
And I say in all sincerity that I believe the
Maritime Provinces never have had the relief
problem that has faced the Western Provinces. I admit that part of the fault is our
own; I admit that some of the trouble bas
been caused by our own extravagance; but
the fact we are concerned with now is that
large numbers of our people are unemployed.
We are threatened to-day with a new theory,
a theory of repudiation of liability for debt.
Unless the Dominion goes to the assistance of
those parts of Canada that are so heavily
burdened by the relief problem, that theory
will spread all over Canada. I appeal to the
Federal Government to try to understand just

MAY 17, 1938
what a serious problem the West is facing.
Canadians living in the East may complacently
say that no people in their senses would believe in such a theory, or in other foolish
ideas, but the truth is that they are believed
in. Saskatchewan may for the time being
resist invasion by them, but I do not see any
real and lasting hope for our Western country
unless the sane people out there are helped in
their fight against present conditions and
given a chance to get back on their feet.
Therefore, while I am in favour of the Bill,
I ask the honourable leader of the House to
take to his Government a request that
responsibility for unemployment relief be
taken off the shoulders of the small property
owners in our cities, towns and villages and
assumed by the Dominion.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I should like to ask a question of the honourable leader of the House.
Section 6 provides that no province shall be
assisted under this Bill unless it agrees to disclose fully its financial position to the Dominion authorities. Has any province declined
to make such a disclosure? Is there any
special reason for this provision?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have some
information, but I do not know that it will
completely answer my right honourable
friend's question. This section of last year's
Act made it a statutory obligation upon the
province, before any financial assistance could
be granted by the Dominion, to furnish the
Dominion, from time te time as required, with
certified statements as to the province's financial position in such detail and in such form
as the Dominion might require, and also to
permit such examination and audit as the Dominion might deem necessary. The section
is redrafted this year to make the firstmentioned provision necessary only where a
province seeks a loan frem the Dominion, but
to make it a matter of agreement between the
Dominion and the province where other financial assistance is granted that the province
supply such information as the Dominion may
desire. It was net thought advisable, except
where a loan is sought, te require a province
to lay its whole financial position before the
Dominion, but this is made necessary where a
loan is sought.
I am unable to give a direct answer to my
right honourable friend's question just now,
but I may be able to do so when we come
to the third reading.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Bill
carries forward a change that was made in

325

the Act last year. The word "relief" appears
to be ostracized, and "assistance" takes its
place.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The change in
the title was made last year, as I have said.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I would be
the last to claim that there are not many
deserving and unfortunate people in need of
help, to whom the application of the word
"relief" may be to some degree humiliating,
but from the general standpoint of the country I question the wisdom of adopting these
more dignified terms with respect to what is
really charity. The feeling has grown up,
fed no doubt by parliaments, legislatures, governments and the press, that claims for
assistance are of the nature of rights. That
feeling becomes stronger and more general
day by day, and with each accession of
strength to that state of mind the problem
of relief becomes greater. It is unfortunately
necessary, however distasteful it may be to
us, that a measure of humiliation should
attend a demand for public help. Though
a needy individual may be 100 per cent
blameless for his condition-and that is not
at all the usual case-the fact is that what
we call civilization will not work unless a
measure of humiliation does attend the condition resulting from failure to make a living.
This is not the first time I have made such
a statement. I said the same thing in another place years ago. I expressed that view
in connection with the old age pension legislation. Then it was lamented that people
reaching old age had to go to the poorhouse
or almshouse, which was just too bad. It
was argued that the country should provide
for them so that they should not be surrounded and depressed by that humiliation.
We made such provision. I think I forecast
what has taken place. No longer is the
State's provision for the otherwise helpless
indigent regarded as alms and charity; it
is now regarded as a pension, as an absolute
right, something paid for. With elevation of
the status of recipients, an inevatible multiplication of their numbers takes place, and
there are added burdens on the State. If
the penalty is removed the individual ceases
to struggle, and his whole resources and determination are not applied, as in days gone
by, to providing for himself in the years to
come when he can work no longer.
All this burden comes back upon the nation,
and by the nation it is distributed over the
area of workers. It presses down on operations of business and construction and everything else, with the consequence that as one
class multiplies the other class becomes help-

326

SENATE

less and the nation becomes stagnant. Carry
this tendency further and see how it would
work. If we dispensed with the word "assistance" and substituted "gratuity," we should
have a still larger number of recipients, and
there would be an even less ardent desire
to get out of that class. If we went farther
and adopted the word "compensation," a still
greater number of people would assert their
right to be helped, and before long relief
would be looked upon as nothing but a
pension.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS:

Call it a bonus.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Yes, or an
honorarium. And then the strikes of reliefees
would be far more widespread than they are
to-day.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: And everybody would
vote for the honorarium.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
Of course
it would be popular. Te the degree that a
Government seeks popularity for popularity's
sake, it strikes at the very roots of our system. Democracy is breaking down in every
country, and everywhere it is democracy's
fault. It is net because there is anything
xvrong witïh it, or that the principle upon
which it rests is not vastly better than the
principle of any other system. No. The
fact is that democracy just has net been
working, that it has been breaking dowvn,
and for causes which are creeping into this
country-rather, which are already present in
alarming proportions.
The honourable the junior senator from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) bas called attention to what is taking place in the West.
I take occasion to emphasize what he said.
I think we must lift sone of the load off
property owners. It is easy to say from
whom the burden should be removed; the
problen is to decide to whom it is te be
transferred. As at present advised, I am not
in favour of the policy suggested by the
honourable junior senator from Winnipeg.
namely that the whole probleim should be
taken over by the Dominion. I an afraid
that unless responsibility for relief-I still
call it that-is localized. so that taxpayers
sec who are receiving and who are imposing,
we shall net be able to avoid running wild
with relief.
I do net believe we can ever get away from
this principle of local responsibility in respect
of relief. Perbaps some form of Dominion
assistance might be given to municipalities,
to urban centres in particular, because that
is where taxes are especially heavy and construction industries are paralysed. In towns
Rigit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

and cities where there is manifestly
a
need of construction and also manifestly a stoppage of it, if some of the moneys now devoted
to relief were applied to a reduction of taxes,
which are wholly out of proportion to the
reovenue-bearing powers of property, erection
of new buildings would become possible. If
that were the direction in which federal
assistance went, and if municipal responsibility
for relief were maintained, our course would
be a much wiser one, in my judgment.
But even if all that were done, and if we
acted in the wisest possible way, the three
Prairie Provinces would remain helpless under
conditions existing to-day. The big cause of
their trouble was given by the honourable
junior senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Haig).
Reasonable people out there are
overwhelmed by it. They can pay taxes and
help to pay taxes in those three provinces,
but in the presence of that threat which overshadows them would anybody from Ontario
or Quebec or anywhere on earth, except a
madhouse. lend money on real estate there?
Evoryone would roar 'No" at once, if he
had to answer. We all know what the cloud
is. Repudiation runs rampant, centering in
Edmonton. And J am afraid our Government
is drifting. I arn going to say something
frankly. In ny humble judgment, as regards
the whole principle of disallowance, this countr- got off theo track some years ago. It bas

We are approaching a crisis; indeed, we are
right on the edge of a crisis. It is a crisis
whiihn means disintegration, which means net
a better distribution, but universal poverty
and, ultimately, universal crime. Something
has to be done to hold this country together,
to bring us back to principles upon which

ago. It got off the track, in my .IudgmentI say it very frankly-when the Departrnent
of Justice was under the very distinguished
senator from North York (Hon. Sir Allen
Aylesworth). The principle heý outlined was
supported by his successors. It bas been
supported, I believe, by the present Minister
of Justice. It cannot be sustained; and I
arn trying to drive that home. If the sheetanchor goes we may just as wel'l throw our
hands in the air, for the integrity of this Confederation cannot survive. We must have this
sheet-anchor to hodd this country together.
The United States employed another, and

through every decade of their history. But
we had this sheet-anchor provided by the
Fathers of Confederation, and I want to iropress upon the Government that we dare not,
we cann-ot, throw this sheet-arichor away.
Hon. WI. A. BUCHANAN:
Honourable
senators, I arn not surprised that certain
legisiation has heen brought into this discussion. Some ýhonourable
memnbers rnay
wonder what relation it has to the title of this
Bill, which has to do witb unemployment.
But I arn aware -of this fuct, and have been
for several years, that employment would
have been provided in my province for very
many of the class which the honourable the
junior memnber frorn Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Haig) has ment.ioned if confidence in the
financial integrity of the province had flot
been destroyed.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Heur, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

ilear, hear.

Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: Certain legisiation destroyed the confidence of the peuple
within the province in making inveStments
there. It also destroyed the confidence of those
outside the province, and so prevented rnoney
corning in to be invested in what is necessary,
in the cities particularly, and that is the construction of homes. That legislation undoulbtedly har, created a situation which
means that any persan in Alberta with money
will not invcst in his own province, and

naturally no persan outsidie will invest there.
Countless homes are needed in the chties and
towns of Alberta and on the farmas, but thiev
cannot be built, because no money can L
borr-owed for the purpose. Money already
loaned may neyer be recovered. I arn glad
that the matter was brought to the attention
of the Senate this afternoon, for in considering unemployrnent we have probably not
thought of what ill-considered legisiation, not
only in Alberta but elsewhere, is doing to
adversely affect investmnent and discourage
employment.
There are so many angles to a discussion of
un:employment, and so many opinions might
ïbe expresscd as to its relief, that I wonder
whether it is wise for -me to express a th.ought
or two that have been running through my
mind during the discussion of this Bill; in
fact for some time. We have a Standing -Cornmittee on Tourist Traffic, which bas to do
with the bringing of tourists into Canada to
enjoy our holiday resorts. I shail confine rny
remarks to the Rocky Mountain area of
Western Canada. It should be one of the most
attractive sections for tourists. But tourists
f rom the United States are so used to good
paved roads that they are disappointed and
discouraged by the type of roads they find in
Alberta and British Columbia. Our roads out
there are not bard-surfaced, and at certain
seasons of the year tbýey becomne so dusty
that Arnerican tourists very soon return to
their own country. I do not say that we can
enter upon a large program. of road improvement in that area, but I do say such a policy,
if it could be undertaken, would have a
permanent value in that it would enable tourists from the United States to reach the great
park areas of western Alberta and eastern
British Columbia. This would mean a flow
of money into Canada, not in hundreds of
thousands of dollars, but in millions of dollars,
by the expenditures made by tourists each
sum.mer. I arn not prepared to say whether
a road poliýcy for the purpoee I have indicated
would give very rnuch employ-ment, but I
wouid rather see the Government rnaking
expenditures in that d-irection, and so providing employrnent for men who are now
idle, than see such men reduo-ed to a condition in wbich eventually they will prefer
idleness to work. Among our coal miners in
Alberta there is probably greater distress than
arnong any other section of the population.
There is very little possibility of a revival of
coal mining suficient to bring many of those
men back into ernployment. They are on
relief in the citiee and in coal camps throughout Alberta. This relief is costing a great
deal of money, with a consequent increase in

328

SENATE

the burden of taxation. If we could give
those men employment on road construction
we should be getting something of permanent
value to the Dominion, for, as I say,
those improved roads would attract American
tourists, who spend their money freely. Furthermore, we should be getting some return
for the expenditure, whereas now we are getting no return whatever.
My other thought relates to giving employment to our unemployed youth. We have
them moving backwards and forwards on
trains, we see them at street corners begging
money for a meal, and we wonder if they are
going to become convinced that they do not
need to work at ail so long as they can impose
upon their fellow-citizens.
In the United
States they have what are known as civilian
conservation camps.
I have seen them in
operation and know what they can do to
salvage forests and improve park areas.
I
remember an area in Glacier National Park,
in the State of Montana. It was burnt over
some years ago, the fire leaving the billside a
black mass of fallen trees and stumps, and the
underbrush a fire hazard. Unemployed youths
from aIl over the Republic were noved into
conservation camps in that area and put to
work to clear away the fallen trecs and underbrush, and so remove the fire hazard. We
have similar areas throughout all our mountain
section. If we have to provide relief, we
might much better spend the money on constructive work of real value to the country.
It would also, I think, belp to restore the
morale of our youths who are now drifting
around aimlessly. I do not say that what I
am proposing is feasible. but I think the suggestion should be made, because if we continue to spend money on what we call the
dole, and net on any constructive purposes to
keep men employed, we aire not going to get
out of this impasse at all. On the contrary,
we shall conpletely undermine the character
of our youths and others who have been on
relief for some years past.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable senators,
I should like to make a few remarks in reference to the general situation that has arisn
<ut of this depression. There has finally resulted a condition between the provinces and
the Dominion which has become more or
less intolerable. We ail know the demands
for social legislation and the difficulties that
have confronted us. We know a number of
the provinces to-day demand that the Dominion Government should take over the cost,
and probably the administration, of relief, or
a large section of it.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN.

Now, as a result of that situation we have
in Canada to-day a commission dealing with
federal-provincial relations: I refer to the
Rowell Commission. I desire to express my
opinion for what it is worth. I think a very
grave mistake has been made. The opposing
views expressed before that commission at
its various sittings throughout the Dominion
are doing great harm to Canada as a nation.
I have the very highest regard for the members of the commission, as I have also for the
purpose that lay behind its appointment, but
I think it is operating along entirely wrong
lines. and I doubt very much that it should
ever have been brought into operation at ail.
What actually is happening throughout Canada to-day? It is this. The commission goes,
we will say, to Manitoba, and aIl and sundry
are invited to- attend and give their ideas as
to what the relationship should be between
the Dominion and Manitoba and the other
provinces. Those who are interested in politics
naturally arc there, and they strive with one
another to the fullest extent to get tbo greatest
possible political advantage out of the situation. I know generally the nature of the
submissions.
The province of Manitoba,
through its representatives, put forward the
strongest possible demand on the Federal GovThat is actually what occurred.
ernment.
Tben the commission moved on to Saskatchewan. where the same thing occurred, the
province of Saskatchewan vying with tho province of Manitoba in trving to make greater
demands upon the Federal Government. That
is donc largely for political reasons. So the
performance is going on aIl over Canada in
so far as the politicians are concerned. Tien
you bave business men, insurance companies
and all other kinds of organizations and
associations putting forward their views as to
what should be the outcome of the commission's work.
It seems to me that a desired change in
Confederation could be brought about only
by a conference of those who arc directly
concerned, and if such a conference had been
held we should not have had all this "muss"
and fuss throughout the country in connection
with demands made by the various provinces.
The parts of Confederation-the provincesshould have been brought together, and it
sbould have been more or less a private
conference, so that every person could put his
cards on the table in full confidence until
such time as an agreement should be made.
There should net be any rivalry among the
provinces as to what they want from the
Federal Government, and that sort of thing.

MAY 17, 1938
There is one danger which I hope will be
avoided. If the commission is a fact-finding
body, well and good; let it gather all the
facts that are necessary in order that the
Parliament of Canada and the provincial legislatures may have the facts upon which they
can base their judgment. But if the commission is to undertake to make recommendations as to what should be done, there will
be, in my opinion, very grave danger to the
existence of Confederation. I hope it is not
too late to mention this now: I am only
expressing my own opinion that while the
idea of having a fact-finding commission is
sound, the idea of inviting recommendations
from all and sundry as to what should be
done is unsound, for the reasons I have stated.
I sincerely trust that the commission itself
will not undertake to make any recommendatien to the Government as to what should be
done to change the British North America
Act.
Hon. EUGENE PAQUET (Translation):
Honourable senators, looking back on the
legislation passed since the beginning of the
depression, we find that each year "it is expedient to legislate in the matter of unemployment," which is stifling the country, and to
seek means of ending it. At every session the
Government votes large sums for the relief
of the needy, in the hope that business will
soon return to normal and that the depression
will soon come to an end.
All kinds of palliatives have been tried:
tariff barriers of more or less height to maintain
our industries and thus provide employment;
relief to the destitute; unemployment camps:
loans to the provinces, which in turn lend to
the municipalities; various kinds of public
works undertaken by governments alone or
jointly; commercial agreements intended to
promote the sale abroad of our surplus production. We have gone so far as to undertake
the manufacture of war material, munitions,
implements of destruction and of death. What
is more, the Minister of Labour bas recently
stated in the House of Commons that only the
militarized countries have succeeded in ending
or lessening unemployment.
Honourable members, it is time to take
thought and to ascertain where we are going.
It is time to locate the trouble. Once we have
found it, we should have sufficient energy and
courage to eradicate it or to remove its causes,
whatever interests may be involved.
I do not assume to make a complete analysis;
I simply wish to present a series of facts which
may serve as a guide in the diagnosis which
necessity compels us to make.
In the first place, it must be admitted that
the evil is general, that unemployment exists

329

and persists throughout the length and breadth
of the country. The crisis is neither local nor
seasonal. With slight variations unemployment has been with us for nearly ten years
and even appears to be extending to additional classes of the population. Figures have
been quoted to prove that it is decreasing,
but such figures usually do not include the
youth of the country, and there are many
unfortunates whose state is not revealed by
statistics. Moreover, -the increased needs of
those who have suffered se long greatly exceed the decrease in the number of unemployed. The needs of the destitute are ever
increasing, because since the beginning of
the depression they have never received
enough to satisfy the barest necessities, to
provide themselves in normal quantities with
the articles indispensable to life. In the distribution of relief or of wages intended to
replace relief, the authorities have rather
sought to give as little as possible; they have
never ventured to attain the strict minimum
required to fill a consumer's needs. In order
to eke out their meagre pittance the destitute
have had to divest themselves little by little
of their already scanty household effects, of
articles of clothing and even of family mementoes. They have had to resort to dubious
shifts; they have been forced to beg and
sometimes to steal, by fraud, by violence or
otherwise.
Numerous families have thus been ruined
m-orally and physically. The doctor who is
called upon to visit these families is struck
by the dire misery, the incredible destitution
that he finds. It is impossible for him to
restore to health the human beings entrusted
to his care, for their health is already too
greatly impaired and they lack all the elements
indispensable to their recovery, including
wholesome food in sufficient quantities. But
the chief impediment which the physician finds
is the discouragement, the anguish, the despair
by which these unfortunates are overwhelmed.
However, honourable senators, I wish to
appeal less to your pity than to the cold
logic of your reason. Besides, this distressful
situation of the unemployed and the destitute
is known to all, and my colleagues from
every part of the country can testify to it. In
passing, I wish to pay tribute to all the
physicians of the country who have so far
devoted themselves without stint, giving unsparingly of their care, their remedies, their
time and their health, to the relief of their
fellow-citizens affected by the depressionmost of the time without charge or without
hope of payment. If their noble example
had been followed te the fullest possible
extent by our rulers of aIl classes, there would

330

SENATE

be less distress and the depression would
probably have ceased to exist.
The chief defect to be pointed out in this
regard is the lack of a measure. I shall use
a simple illustration to make my meaning
clearer. If we are faced with the task of
passing a roadway over a river one hundred
feet wide, common sense tells us that the
bridge should be at least one hundred feet
long. And if we wish this bridge to carry
loads up to one hundred tons, it is absolutely necessary that the bridge be able to
carry at least this weight. There is nearly
always a minimum which must be attained;
otherwise the undertaking is futile.
It should be the same in matters of unemployment relief. So long as any government-no matter which-has not attained
the strictly required minimum, it will not
have performed useful or durable work; it
will not have done its full duty.
Halfmeasures, palliatives, makeshift and haphazard
devices simply perpetuate and even aggravate
the evil.
We must therefore ask ourselves what this
minimum is. To find it is a simple matter,
to my mind; for this minimum bas been
established after careful inquiry; it bas been
enacted by both Houses of Parliament, sanctioned by the Crown, then accepted and put
into force by all the provinces of the Dominion. In the case of old-age pensions, it
las been enacted that a minimum of $20 a
month is required for the subsistence of the
pensioner. I therefore logically conclude that
this suin is the minimum required for the subsistence of a needy adult. Any relief falling
below this essential minimum is inadequate,
ineffective and even helps to perpetuate the
depression.
I firmly believe that every unemployed person is entitled to this minimum, for Christian
philosophy teaches that society is under th%
strict obligation of ensuring the livelihood of
each one of its members. The unemployed
therefore have grounds for complaint and the
public is entitled to demand results. Constitutional discussions. transfers from one jurisdiction to another, driving people from pillar
to post, do not solve the question. The right
of people to live imposes upon Government
the duty of providing them with the indispenable minimum. The public, I say, has a right
to demand real and tangible results and not
only a meagre pittance often accompanied by
harsh words. Whatever may be the ideas and
tendencies, the virtues and faults of the unemployed and the destitute, we are ail brothers.
we are aIl members of a nation endowed with
a superabundance of wealth. We have an
enormous surplus of bread, of grain, of meat,
Hon. Mr. PAQUET.

of goods of all kinds; we have an abundance
of linen and clothing; we have houses, wood
and coal; we have equipment and labour more
than sufficient to supply our people with all
they need.
It is our bounden duty to find the means
of distributing this wealth.
The Liberal
party is now in power; it will be held responsible for the results that the people have a
right to expect. If it cannot find the means
of ensuring a decent living to aIl the members of this nation so richly endowed with
easily accessible wealth, it should be pitilessly cast aside and replaced by other administrators.
The Conservative party will
shortly be electing a leader and redrafting
its programme. If this programme does not
conform to the just wishes of the people,
if it is made up only of expedients or of
antiquated and ineffectual palliatives, that
party either will not obtain popular support.
The people are sick and tired of the eternal
seesaw between the two parties. Exasperated
by poverty, driven by hunger, animated by
a fierce desire for a change, they want someone and something that will bring the desired
results. And they are entirely right.
Let us see what bas been said by the
greatest economist of our time, the man who,
placed at the summit of the universe, is able
to see the clashes of human passions and
to form sound judgments on the state of
advancement of science and the progress and
development of civilization in the entire
world. The whole world is before him and
he is incapable of being wrong when teaching to all the peoples of the earth. I am
happy and proud to read his words into the
record of our proceedings. In the encyelical
"Quadragesimo Anno," published in 1931, he
laid down the following policy for all rulers:
The economic and social organism will be
soundly constituted and will attain its end only
when it will provide each and every one of its
members with all the goods which the resources
of nature and industry, as well as the truly
social organization of economie life, are able
to provide them with. These goods should be
sufficiently abundant to satisfy the needs of a
decent existence and to raise man to that degree
of comfort and culture which, wisely used, does
not stand in the way of virtue, but on the
contrary singularly facilitates the practice
thereof.
Have the governments so far distributed
to our unemployed, to our needy, "goods in
sufficient abundance to satisfy the needs of
a decent existence?"
Have they ever provided "each and every one of the members"
of this nation with "all the goods which the
resources of nature and industry, as well as
the truly social organization of economic
life, are able to provide them with"? This

MAY 17, 1938
full measure of justice has never been attained, and therefore our rulers have never performed their full duty.
But, some will ask, where shall we find
the money to pay this minimum to every
unemployed or needy person, plus an equal
amount for each member of his family?
We are overburdened with debts and taxes
and the country has reached the point where
it has to borrow to pay the interest of its
debt. The provinces and the municipalities
have reached the end of their financial tether.
Farmers and other property owners are labouring under a terrific weight of debt and taxation. Business itself is handicapped by all
sorts of vexations and restrictions. Further
taxation is impossible and our debt is constantly increasing. Where shall we get the
money?
Honourable members, this simple question
and the picture that accompanies it complete
the cycle of facts necessary to place our
diagnosis on a solid basis. We have established
the people's needs, their right to a minimum,
the amount of this minimum, and the
imperative duty of society to see that they
get it. We know also that production is
superabundant, that we have all the goods and
services that the people need. The people are
suffering and we are told that it is because of
the lack of money, the lack of financial
resources. The defect therefore lies in the
financial system. To use the language of
medicine and surgery, we have located the
abscess that is poisoning our social organism.
We have located the centre of infection which
is contaminating all classes of our society and
leading them to death. Our entire social
organism is able to function normally, except
the financial system. Logically and indubitably, the trouble is due to the financial system.
Should we destroy it, uproot it, or is it
possible to reform it? I am not in a position
to give a definite answer to these questions
to-day. I shall simply establish the main
heads of the treatment that should be used.
In the first place, the human person should
be placed above all financial considerations.
Man was established king of creation, and his
domination should extend to all things,
animate and inanimate. This is an elementary
principle known to us all, but which modern
times seem to forget. Finance, the work and
creation of man, should therefore serve man
and serve society. Any claim on its part to
dominate man and enslave society would be
a reversal of the proper order and a usurpation of rights.
Secondly, work has been se far practically
the only means of procuring an income for the
people. Wages, in al] its various forms, are

331

the reward of man's labour in every sphere
of activity. Now machinery is more and more
replacing human labour. It is therefore necessary to find a way of paying the wages of the
machine to man and net entirely to finance.
The men who in all lines of work have been
replaced by machinery should receive a share
of the work performed, because the machine
is the fruit of human labour, of human invention throughout the centuries, and it is not
right to pay the entire wages of the machine
te finance; it is not right to consider these
wages as belonging entirely te capital. Man,
for whose benefit the machine was invented,
should not be made its slave or its victim.
The earnings of the machine should be
distributed in large part te man, whose work
it replaces. This seems to me te be a just,
resonable and even elementary proposition.
Thirdly, the banks, according te a recent
official statement of the Minister of Finance,
are in a position to iend ten dollars for
every dollar in currency. The banks monetize
their customers' credit and issue currency
based on their productive capacity, on the
efficiency of their labour and their employees'
or their workers' labour, on the productive
capacity of their manufacturing plants or
their commercial organizations. Why is our
currency se unproductive in the hands of
the Government? Why is it always born
in the form of debt, to become afterwards
so prolific, so active, so reproductive in the
hands of bankers? The Government, it is
commonly said, cannot multiply it without
risking inflation, but banks communicate to
it, without any risk, a marvelous fecundity.
Farmers and manufacturers produce or multiply useful goods, but the multiplying process does not go beyond production and they
never sell on the basis of ten te one. That
happens only in the financial world. Banks
are endowed with that magic power and we
are told that the Government, from which
the banks receive it, cannot use it. It is
absurd, on the face of it. It ought te be
easy to find a body of respectable citizens,
such as our judges or our magistrates, a
body of experts to whom would be entrusted
the task of multiplying our currency for the
benefit of the country and without any danger
of inflation, as it is done by bankers for
their sole benefit. In fact, I have never
come across an accurate and logical definition
of the word inflation, and I would ask all
those making use of that bogy to give us
a true idea of it, before advancing that
fallacious and misleading argument. In the
same manner as the bankers, that body of
experts could monetize the productive capacity of their customers, that is to say of the

332

SENATE

entire nation. I think that the comparison
is quite fair and logical, and that such a
policy would have good results.
On this subjeet, a friend of mine gave me
a financial problem to solve. It is a curious
but very easy problem, says my friend,
altbough the facts appear a littie disconcertiog. Here it is, word for word:
1. Given that ten-elevenths of our
current rnoney is made of credit money issued
by banks on the basis of their customers'
credit, that said rnoney is sound and fonctions
admirably, according to the most orthodox
ecooomists;
2. Given that ooly 5 per cent of banking
operations in Canada are made in currency,
the remaining 95 per cent being made by
way of cheques or other negotiable instruments:
What amount, apart frorn administrative
costs, would the Goveroment have te, issue in
order to make available, in banks or savings
institutions or appropriate offices and to, each
one of the 11,000,000 Canadians, a credit of
$20 the first of every month for twelve consecutive montbs?
Note: The 5 per cent of transactions conducted in currency could or should cease, as
ail citizens would be customers of the cooperative credit association.
I ask you, honourable senators, to s9tudy
that problem without bias or prejudice and
in a m'inner befitting the serene atmosphere
of this Chamber. I would also ask ail schools
of ecooomics to study it, to organize coinpetitions, if necessary, in order to solve it to
a dollar.
Until recent ycars, it was my duty tu
alleviate physical suffering and misery around
me. My public duties have ooly served as a
derivative or an incentive to increase my
services to my fellow-citizens. I did it with
ail possible devotion to, duty, and with al
rny hueart. I can say that I neyer refused rny
professional services to anyone on account of
a miserable question of money. I arn not a
financier nor an expert in floanciai matters,
but sceing that Divine Providence bas given
me responsibilities of another nature, I arm
willing to do my duty conscientiously and
fairly. I am eager to do rny part in the settlement of our problerns. I arn eager te, study
tbem in the ligbt of the principles in whicb I
bave been brougit, up, and wbicb have been
rny guidance ever since. I mean by tbose
words that I striv'e for a solution agrecable to
the ideals of my religion and my race, and tbat
I arn anxious to respect tbe rights of otbers, as
I arn to upbold those of the common people.

complete collapse in the depression by which
we are now assailed. It bias a virtue of its
own, 'by which we shall be enaibled to find a
happy solution, if we look for it with ail our
bearts, ail our power and knowledge, and, above
ahl, if we sincerely wish to promote the happiness of the masses instead of the power of
finance.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
mernbers. 1 sec tbat no other honourable mernber desircs to speak on this question, and 1
should like to say a few words in closing the
ilebate. My honourable friýend the junior ýmcmber frorn Winnipcg (Hon. Mr. Hlaig) bias told
us of the situation in bis city, which is sornewbat sirnilar to the situation tbat exists in
otiher towns and cities. We are ail faeing the
difficult problcm of feeding people w~ho wvcrc
drawn into the larger cities during the crisis
that began in the autumn of 1929. I have
been wonderiog bow it bas corne about that we
havec in our large centres a surplus population
whicb is clairning relief from the municipal
authoritics, who in tomn are supported by the
provinces and thec Federal Goveroment. One

Europe, the sarne practice prcvailed. Butt when

obtain soine data as to the number that w'ere
taken caeof uncler the old system, wveshould
be able to make an intcresting comparison.
Anoth)er deýveloprnent is in part responsible
for tbe large number of our rînenployecl. Up
to 1929 our Canadian youtb who eould not flnd
wxork at borne, or m-crc unable to get a salary
that satisficd tbem, could cross the line and

MAY 17, 1938
find a ready market for their services in the
United States. They were all the more welcorne there after that country had almost
closed its doors to immigrants from Europe.
But that market has been closed since 1930 or
1931, and that part of our population which
under former conditions would have gone to
live in the United States has been forced to
seek employment at home. We all know what
a considerable Canadian population there is in
the New England States. Nova Scotia has
given a large number of its people to our
neighbours; New Brunswick perhaps to a lesser
extent; but Quebec and Ontario have contributed a large proportion of our emigration
to the United States. While this emigration
continued it relieved the labour situation in
our towns and cities.
There is fortunately a redeeming feature in
the closing of the United States to our
young people, which is familiar to all honourable senators who are within the sound
of my voice. It is that to-day there is a
considerable opening northward. Our northern country, through its mining development,
can now take care of thousands of young men.
I believe that if they are sufficiently trained
to enter that field there will be ample compensation for what we were losing to the
south-not only ample compensation, but an
improvement in Canada, since we shall be
retaining these young men.
I have noticed during the last few years
that our towns and cities have been flooded
with people who heretofore were being taken
care of by their families and by local institutions. Now they have to be taken care
of by our municipal, provincial and Dominion
authorities.
My honourable friend from Winnipeg (Hon.
Mr. Haig), in giving advice which he felt
should reach the Government, has intimated
that it was not his intention to criticize the
efforts put forth by the Government during
these last few years to solve this very difficult
problem. Of course the West knows, I
believe, that it bas no grievance against the
Central Provinces and the Maritimes, which
provinces have contributed their share to
alleviate the Western situation.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
We have paid
our share of the cost. We have advanced to
the Western Provinces, on their notes, their
share of relief, which my honourable friend says
he doubts very much they will be able to
repay. We have felt it to be our duty to
make that contribution because we are all
one country. We have, besides, thrown in
millions upon millions of dollars for people

suffering from the drought in southern Saskatchewan and Alberta, and I am quite sure
that in view of the formidable amount which
bas gone from the federal treasury to the
provinces of the West, those provinces must
feel that, although their situation is not very
bright, the Dominion has shown, through its
representatives from all the provinces, that
we are capable of understanding the situation
and are meeting it as best we can.
In the last f ew years we have all done
our best in trying to find a solution, and
the activities of the present as well as the
preceding Government have been directed
towards solving the present problem. What
is in store for us in the years to come we
do not know, but we were all somewhat
optimistic last year in thinking we were at
last moving towards better days, as indeed
we did for a number of months. There is
somewhat of a recession just now, but I
hope it is temporary. Of course, we are to
a considerable extent dependent upon aur
southern neighbour in matters of economics,
because when there is a depression in the
United States the purchasing power of its
immense population is lessened, and consequently Canada's exports shrink. We all
recognize that such is the situation to-day.
Yet it is extraordinary that we have not been
drawn into the recession to the same degree
as the United States. This is a good omen
for Canada, which on its own feet is forging
ahead. Our population is still at work. It
is interesting to note the fact, though it
relates to the year 1937, that men have been
doing sufficiently well to increase their income tax payments to the Federal Treasury.
I noticed this morning that our Customs
returns are less than they were for the corresponding period last year.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable gentleman should make it plain that the
income tax returns largely reflect earnings
of 1936.
But the inHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
come tax paid on the 30th of April last was
on 1937 incomes.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIIGHEN: No; in very
large degree it was otherwise. In respect of all
companies-take our own, for example-whose
business year ends on the 31st day of March,
the earnings are nearly altogether in 1036.
The same is true in respect of all private companies, which are almost universally owned by
large income tax payers. So the earnings
reflected in the present income tax returns are
in the main 1936 earnings.

334

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It will be very
interesting to see the income tax returns for
the present year, 1938.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They will be
very high.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The first months
of this year have not been too good, but we
must hope that the situation will improve
and that conditions in the West will give
us such returns as will help Canada to meet
the situation. Of course, we shall have to
wait for some months to see how things turn
out, but I hope that with the help of Providence there will be a turn for the better.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am glad my
right honourable friend draws my attention to
this situation, because. though this Bill may
pass, if the need for a larger operation became
apparent, we could come back next year and
move to provide for it.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at
3 p.m.

I move the second reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
On the Order:
Second reading of Bill 107, an Act respecting
the Canadian National Railways and to provide
for the refunding of matured, maturing and
callable financial obligations.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I move that this
Order and the remaining Orders be discharged
and placed on the Order Paper for the next
sitting of the House.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have no
objection, of course, but I wish to say this.
When the Canadian National Refunding Bill
comes up I should like the Minister to explain
why we could not make the Bill ample to put
the 'Government in a position te take care of
the future over a long period, if not indefinitely, in respect of refunding. There may
be some reason why this Bill should be only
a temporary measure, but I do not seee why
the Government should not be in a position
to take care of Canadian National refunding
continuously. Certainly it has to be repeatedly
empowered to make provision for this refunding.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Minister of
Finance stated that under the Bill lie could
take care of the refunding until 1941. The
last ActRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Of 1935.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -of 1935. allowed
$200.000,000, and about $7,000,000 or $8,000,000 of that authorization still remains to
be expended. He has asked for the same
amount, but lie lias explained that that would
cover the refunding of our obligations up to
1941.
Right Hon. Mr. MEICGHEN: There may be
good reasons. I do not know.

BATTLEFIELDS-INSURANCE
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. BLONDIN inquired of the Government:
1. With reference to the Quebec Battlefields,
what amount of insurance is represented by
the $2,000 premium of insurance?
2. What is the nature of such insurance,
whether against fire, accidents, robbery, etc.?
3. What are
the buildings, machinery,
materials or any other properties covered by
such insurance, and what is the amount and
what is the purpose of insurance on each article
insured?
4. How many years are covered by such
premium?
5. What is the name of the insurance agent
or agents, and if representing one or many
firms, what is the name of such firm or firms?
6. What is the percentage or commission
charged, and what is the individual valuation
put on each and every one of the insured
articles or buildings?
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators will remember that when we discussed
the National Battlefields Bill a little while ago
I gave some details of the Commission's expenditures, among which appeared an item of
$2,000 for insurance premiums. That seemed
to some honourable members a high figure
and I was queried as to the details of that
sum. My honourable friend from Laurentides
(Hon. Mr. Blondin) placed a notice of inquiry
on the Order Paper, requesting this information, and I now have a series of answers to
bis varions questions. I feel sure that these
answers will give full satisfaction to this
House. As they are of some length, I ask
permission to place them upon Hansard instead
of reading them.

MAY 18, 1938
Hon. P. E. BLONDIN: Honourable senators,
perhaps I rnay be permitted to say a word of
personal explanation on this question. To
those who happen tc know the membiers of
the National Battlefields Commission-ail men
of the highest and most unimpeachable character, among whoma is one of our distinguished
members, the honourable senator from Grand-

335

ville (Hon. Sir Thomnas Chapais)-this question may seemn to be unnecessary and even,
to some, uncalled for. But those who do not
happen to know the mem-bers -will, I arn sure,
understand from the answers which have just
been presented the very high regard in which
these gentlemen are held in our province.
The answers are as follows:

SENATE
POST OFFICE BILL (NEWSPAPER
OWNERSHIP)
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 20, an Act to amend the
Post Office Act (Newspaper Ownership).
The Bill was read the first time.
DIVORCE AND MATRIMONIAL CAUSES
BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. L. McMEANS moved the third reading of Bill B, an Act respecting Divorce and
Matrimonial Causes, as amended.
Hon. A. MARCOTTE: Honourable senators,
it is with great relurtance that I rise to make
a few remarks on this proposed legislation.
Being of the Catholic faith, I must be opposed
to any amendments to our legislation on
divorce which will open wider the doors to
people seeking dissolution of marriage.
The law exists, and we respect it. Those
who are not of my religious faith are convinced
that the law of divorce is a good law. It is
their right to thinlk so, and I respect their
conviction.
The most recent addresses by some of our
honourable members have covered the one
phase which I am free to discuss without
referring to divorce and marriage under
religious considerations, that is, the phase of
jurisdiction of this Parliament as to marriage.
So far, we have had three main addresses on
this question of jurisdiction. We all pay great
and deserved tribute tc the honourable senators
from North York (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth)
and Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) and
the right honourable leader on this side (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen), who have spoken. We
admire their knowledge of law and their
talent of exposition, rnd we are proud of the
reputation they have gained in the legal
profession. Being a very humble member of
the same profession, I know that I am taking
a risk in venturing to express an opinion on
this same question.
The honourable senator from North York
made, as is customary with him, a very sound
exposition of the law as he knows it, and he is
a recognized authority. The right honourable
leader on this side, with his superb powers of
oratory, has given us what he claims to be an
unchallengeable thesis on our jurisdiction in
this particular field. The honourable senator
from Vancouver South, whom I for the first
time heard in a discussion of law, bas given
Hon. Mr. BLONDIN.

me, as I am sure he bas given to all of us,
real pleasure by bis clear, concise and eloquent
exposition of the legal aspect of this Bill.
I am in nearly total agreement with the
honourable senator frcm North York on the
question of jurisdiction, in nearly total disagreement with the right honourable leader on
this side in bis argument on our jurisdiction
on marriage, in disagreement with the honourable senator from Vancouver South on our
jurisdiction on marriage, but in agreement
with him on the question of nullity of marriage
and void and voidable marriages.
In bis remarks on the address of the honourable senator from North York, the right
honourable leader on this side said, as reported
at page 279 of the Debates of the Senate:
I have the greatest regard-we all havefor the views in matters of law, constitutional

and otier. of the honourable senator from
I
North York (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth).
do not set myself up as at all fitted by experito combat a position which
ence or equipment
he deliberately takes after careful study, but
I venture in this case to hold and expound an
opinion wholly opposite to bis own, and to
justify myself only because I believe that he
bas not given to the question that thorough
review which is essential in the circumstances.
He further said, at page 280:
I have put this question to a great many
persons. I first put it to myself, and I have
posed it to other lawyers, old and young, and

iave given them dlays to corne with an answer,

but I have never yet had an answer. In a
word, then, the argument of the honourable
senator from North York means that when the
British North America Act conferred on this
Parliament jurisdiction in respect of marriage
it was a pure illusion and gave us no authority
to legislate on anything whatever.
According to that statement, complete review is essential. Has the right honourable
gentleman entirely reviewed this question?
I do not think so. I should also be surprised
to hear that he put bis questions to those who
created the legislation and who, if they
cannot answer from their graves, are able to
answer -by the records left in the reports of
their deliberations.
Surely, in giving this matter a thorough
review, one would read the debates on Confederation of the British North American
provinces of 1865 and would try to find out
what the meaning of the word "marriage"
was intended to be, and why it was placed
alongside of " divorce." This matter of
marriage was at that time one of the most
important questions of the residents of
Lower Canada, that is, the province of Quebec, and was carefully covered at the Quebec

MAY 18, 1938
Conference before the provision in this
respect was drafted for the British North
America Act.
Let us find out the facts as to the intention
of the legislators and the meaning of the
word "marriage" in the section covering
marriage and divorce. This will lead us to
the question of civil rights, solemnization of
marriage and, finally, the jurisdiction of this
Parliament on these questions.
I shall be as concise as possible, because I
do not intend to give honourable senators a
lecture on this very mooted question.
The Hon. Mr. Langevin, then SolicitorGeneral,
in addressing
the
Legislative
Assembly, spoke as follows, as reported at
page 388:
Notwithstanding the advanced hour of the
evening, I cannot pass over in silence another
observation made by the honourable member,
and I beg he will accord me his undivided
attention at the present moment. The honourable gentleman has asked the Government what
meaning was to be attached to the word
"marriage," where it occurred in the Constitution. He desired to know whether the Government proposed to leave to the Central
Government the right of deciding at what age,
for example, marriage might be contracted.
I will now answer the honourable member as
categorically as possible, for I am anxious ta
be understood, not only in this House, but
also by all those who may hereafter read the
report of our proceedings. And first of all I
will prove that civil rights form part of those
which, by article 43, paragraph 15, of the
resolutions, are guaranteed to Lower Canada.
This paragraph reads as follows:
"15. Property and civil rights, excepting those
portions thereof assigned ta the General Parliament."
Well, amongst these rights are all the civil
laws of Lower Canada, and among these latter
those which relate to marriage. Now it was
of the highest importance that it should be
so under the proposed system, and therefore
the members from Lower Canada, at the Conference took great care ta obtain the reservation
to the Local Government of this important right,
and in consenting to allow the word "marriage"
after the word "divorce," the delegates have
not proposed to take away with one hand from
the Local Legislature what they had reserved
to it by the other. So that the word "marriage,"
placed where it is among the powers of the
Central Parliament, has not the extended
signification which was sought to be given to
it by the honourable member. With the view
of being more explicit, I now propose to read
how the word marriage is proposed to be
understood:
The word marriage bas been placed in the
draft of the proposed Constitution to invest
the Federal Parliament with the right of
declaring what marriages shall be held and
deemed to be valid throughout the whole extent of the Confederacy, without, however,
interfering in any particular with the doctrines
or rites of the religions creeds to which the
contracting parties may belong.
51958- 22J

339

This is a point of great importance, and the
French Canadian members ought to rejoice to
see that their fellow-countrymen in the Government have not failed in their duty on a
question of so serious a nature. On many
other points many of them will doubtless claim
that we have not thoroughly fulfilled our duty,
but as regards the matter in question there can
be no difference of opinion, as we have all a
common rule to guide us; and I repeat that
they ought to rejoice that their co-religionists
in the Conference have not been found wanting
on this occasion. The whole may be summed
up as follows: The Central Parliament may
decide that any marriage contracted in Upper
Canada, or in any other of the Confederated
Provinces, in accordance with the laws of the
country in which it was contracted, although
that law might be different from ours, should
be deemed valid in Lower Canada in case the
parties should come to reside there, and vice
versa.
Hon. Mr. Dorion: There was no necessity
for that provision.
Hon. Sol. Gen. Langevin: I have just proved
that it was necessary.
You have in those citations the reason
for the word "marriage" being placed alongside of "divorce," and you will have to pay
particular attention to the fact that Hon. Mr.
Langevin declared that he wes speaking in
the name of the Government. As you know,
there were in the Ministry at that time such
men as Hon. Sir Etienne Pascal Taché, Hon.
John Alexander Macdonald, Hon. George
Etienne Cartier, Hon. Alexander Tilloch Galt,
Hon. Alexander Campbell, Hon. Thomas
D'Arcy McGee, Hon. Jean Charles Chapais,
Hon. George Brown, Hon. William McDougall,
Hon. William Pearce Howland, Hon. Hector
Louis Langevin, Hon. James Cockburn. There
was not one word of protest from any oif these
Ministers who were not of the Catholic faith;
so you might say that this opinion, so carefully worded as to the meaning of the word,
is one which has always been respected up to
now, even if challenged at one time or another.
We now come to marriage as being a contract, and oansequently coming under civil
rights. Let -us leave aside the solemnity of
marriage and direct our minds to marriage
as a natural contract. I am borrowing from
the Hon. Mr. Cauchon, in his address on the
same subject, to be found at page 577 of
the same debate:
It is-that is, marriage-the social formula; it is, as I had occasion
to write elsewhere, the natural mode of transmitting property, which is the fundamental
base of society, and, to go farther, society
itself in its constitution. (Hear, bear.)
If
we cannot suppose a body without a form, so
we cannot suppose society without its formula,
and in destroying its formula you destroy
society. That is the reason why the marriage

SENATE

tie should be indissoluble; it is it which constitutes the family, and in breaking that tie
you destroy the family, in breaking that tie
you strike a mortal blow at society, because
family ties are its only base, its only foundation
its only element of composition. (Hear.) IÎ
is from those fundamental truths that spring
the rights, duties and civil laws which prove
their existence and at the same time protect
them. . . .
I am leaving out that part of the speech
whieh deals with the subject-matter on
religious grounds.
Marriage presents itself to us here under
another aspect-that is. marriage with regard
to its civil effects. This project attributes
the civil laws and legislation as to property
to the local legislatures. Now, marriage, considered as a civil contract, becomes necessarily
a part of these laws, and, I might even say,
it affects the entire civil code, containing in its

broadest sense all the marriage acts, all the
qualities and conditions required to allow mar-

riage to be contracted, all the formalities relative to its celebration, all its nullifying causes,
ail its obligations, its dissolution, the separation of the body. its causes and effects; in a
word, all

the possible consequences

that can

result from marriage te the contracting parties,
their ciildren and their estates. (Hear, hear.)
If suchi had been the intention of the delegates,
we night as well say that the civil laws will
not be one of the attributes of our Local
Legislature, and that those words, "property
and civil rights," have been placed ironically
in the fifteenth section of the forty-third clause
of the scheme.
But I was sure beforehand
that such ceuld not be the case, when the lioneurable Solicitor-General for Lower Canada
declared the other day, in the name of the
Government, that the word marriage. inserted
in the project of Confederation, expresses the
intention to give to the Federal Parliament
the power to declare that marriages contracted
in any one of the provinces, according to its
laws, should be considered as valid in all the
others. Then am I to understand that that
part of the Constitution relating to this question will be drafted in the sense expressed in
the declaration of the honourable SolicitorGeneral and will be restricted to the case
ientioned?

Hon. Soi. Gen. Langevin:
I made, Mr.
Speaker, the other day. in the name of tihe
Government, the declaration now alluded to by

the honourable member for Montmorency, relative to the question of marriage. The explanation then given by me exactly accords with
tiat which wxas affixed to it at the Quebec
Conference.
It is undoubted that the resoiu-

tions laid before this honourable House contain in all things only the principles on which
the bill or measure respecting Confederation

will be based.

I can assure the honourable

member that the explanations I gave the other
evening, relative to the question of marriage,

are perfectly exact, and that the Imperial Acf
relating to it

will be drawn up in accordance

with the interpretation I put upon it.
Hon. Mr. Dorion: I thought I understood
from some one, who m I had reason to consider well informed, that that article
intended to protect mixed marriages.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE.

was

Hon. Sol. Gen. Langevin: In order that 1
may be better understood by the honourable
member, I will read the written declaration
whieh I communicated to the House the other
evening. This declaration reads as follows:
"The word marriage has been placed in the
draft of the proposed Constitution to invest the
Federal Parliament wvith the right of declaring
what marriages shall be held and deemed to be
valid throughout the whole extent of the Confederacy, without, however, interfering in any
particular with the doctrines or rites of the
religious creeds to which the contracting parties
may belong."
The honourable member for Hochelaga will
please to remark that I have been careful in
reading this declaration; and in order that no
doubt may exist respecting it. I have given
to the reporters the very text of the declaration.
Marriage, being a contract, belongs essentially to civil rights and then is under exclusive provincial jurisdiction. As to the solemnization of marriage, there is absolutely no
doubt that it belongs to the jurisdiction of
the provinces.
There is one question which appears to me
deserving of consideration, and that is, as to
what is the power with respect to marriage,
solemnization of marriage and all other matters
pertaining to marriage in parts of the Dominion which have not been as yet erected
into provinces and are consequently under the
federal jurisdiction. Might it not be said that,
as the British North America Act contemplated
the addition of new territories to the first
provinces, marriage would come under the
jurisdiction of this Parliament in these territories?
In his address the right honourable leader
on this side (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
made the remark that this Bill does net affect
It seems to me that if
Quebec at all.
there is one province in the Dominion which
would bc affected by this Bill, it is the
province of Quobe because residents of that
province have only one court te go to in
order to secure a divorce. and it is this
Parliament. So any amendment tîat we pass
te the existing legislation on divorce is going
to affect the residents of the province of
Quebec the same as the residents of any other
province.
J do net intend to elaborate any more on
this question. My purpose is achieved. But
let me refer those who would be interested
in finding more law on the subject to the
discussion in the House of Commons on the
Lancaster case, and to the judgment of our
Supreme Court in the same case. They may
also refer to the discussion of the Girouard
Bill, presented in the House of Commons
and later withdrawn, in 1880. They will find
there some very illuminating opinions of
legislators and judges.

MAY 18, 1938
May I say, before concluding these remarks,
that the Honourable Mr. Langevin, who at
the time of Confederation was SolicitorGeneral, and who later became Sir Hector
Langevin, was the father-in-law of our
esteemed colleague from Grandville (Hon. Sir
Thomas Chapais), and that the Honourable
Mr. Chapais, also a member of the Ministry
at that time, was his father. I have to
thank him for information he bas given me,
not only in this particular case, but on many
occasions, on what took place at the time of
Confederation.
It has been stated very often that Confederation would not have been possible without the co-operation of the province of
Quebec. From what I have cited it will be
seen that this co-operation would never have
been secured if this question of jurisdiction
on marriage had not been left with the provincial jurisdiction, with the exception already
mentioned.
Are we going to say that this declaration
by the Government of the time was just a
snare and a trap to secure the adhesion of the
Catholics and of the province of Quebec
to the scheme of Confederation? Some of
the men who framed the legislation were
great lawyers and greater statesmen. They
knew what they intended to do, and said
so in no equivocal manner. They took the
pledge that this interpretation and declaration
should be embodied and construed in that
manner in the British North America Act.
Is it to be said that the first move to change
that interpretation, to cast away the pledge,
will corne from this Senate, which is rightly
considered as the safeguard of vested rights?
I do not believe it. Before we did that we
should have to think, think hard and think
twice.
I shall vote against the Bill.
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourable senators,
naturally I listened with all the attention I
could command to the speeches delivered by
the honourable senator from North York (Hon.
Sir Allen Aylesworth) and the right honourable leader on the other side of the House
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) with respect to
instant
this Bill on the 10th and the lth
respectively. I suppose no better example
ever was given of how able lawyers can differ
on legal questions. A day or two later other
lawyers spoke on the Bill, and to. some extent
they all differed from one another and from
the first two gentlemen mentioned. But, as I
see it, none of them touched the real merits
of the question, which are moral, and which
go to the very foundation of all Christian
society. Under these circumstances what can

authority which the proponents and the opponents of this Bill will acknowledge to be
an authority, and to which they can go for
I know of no
guidance in this matter?
authority that will fill these requirements
except the Bible. Therefore, to the Bible I go.
When speaking on the second reading of
this Bill on the 15th of March last I quoted
from the Bible the passages in which the
Lord Jesus Christ clearly and distinctly taught
the indissolubility of marriage and declared
divorce to be unlawful. Now, if Jesus Christ
was and is God, that closes the case for
Christians. On the other hand, if Jesus Christ
was not God, Christianity and all that it connotes go by the board. Of course, it may
be sta.ted that the Bible is so hard to, understand that one may get authority for almost
anything from its pages, and I think this is
what the right honourable leader on the other
side meant when he stated on the 24th of
March iast, as reported in Hansard, at page
146:
I shall not pursue the inquiry further. I
have cited that-meaning his previous statements that dayillustrating how it is impossible to act
-as
save in the sunlight of the whole writings-meaning the Bible-the
sunlight of the teachings which these
writings are intended to give, and as showing
that we should net seek to follow the specifie,
isolated wording of a single sentence or paragraph.
I think this means that to get a proper
grasp of the meaning of any part of the Bible
one would have to read it through from
Genesis to Revelations, compare book with
book, chapter with chapter, and verse with
verse. and perhaps compare the translations
with the original documents. As I see it, .this,
without Divine assistance. would be a task
beyond the capacity of any person who ever
lived, and certainly a task beyond the capacity
of the members of this House. What, then,
are we to do? Are we to cast the Bible
aside, as a book of no practical value? I
think not. I think Lord Tweedsmuir, for
instance, was practical when he advised public
men to read the Bible and be guided by its
teaching.
Now, I admit at once that I quoted specific
verses from the Gospels and from St. Paul's
epistles, to prove the indissolubility of marriage
and the unlawfulness of divorce. But I hold
that I did not take these specific verses from
their contexts, or seek to distort their
meaning in any way whatever. I also hold

342

SENATE

that these verses are as clear, plain and distinct as anything else that ever was written
and published in the English language and
that they are not dependent for their meaning on any other part of the Scriptures. If
any person holds they are so dependent, the
burden of proof is on him.
I admit that it is possible to have divorce
and a Bible at the sarne time, but it will not
be the Bible of the Christian. It will be a
Bible shorn of its power and reduced to the
level of a scrap of paper, or a book of fables
Yes, it is possible to have divorce and such
a Bible as I have described, but it is not
possible to have divorce and specific belief
in the divinity of Jesus Christ at the sarne
time, and it is explicit belief in the divinity
of the Saviour that is going fast in a large
part of Christendom, and bas gone in some
parts. And it is this state of affairs, rather
than economics and kindred subjects, that
gives us the world we have to-day.
When I hear honourable members in this
Chamber say they believe in the principle of
divorce, I am shocked. The declaration comes
to me with the force of a blow, because the
principle of divorce is the very thing that
Christ condemned. And it seems a terrible
thing for a mere human being te challenge
the wisdom and authority of Almighty God.
In a word, man cannot ma-ke right what God
Himself bas made wrong. Every thoughtful
person who belongs to, and bas an interest in
the endurance and welfare of, the Englishspeaking world must ibe alarmed. We are
travelling the road that in the past led to
the extinction of many nations, and we have
the same God they had.
I know it is good Christian ethics that
when you cannot eliminate an evil you do
what you can to minimize it. Accordingly
I move, seconded by the honourable gentleman from Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duif), an
amendment to the Bill which, if carried, will
prevent the guilty party fron marrying again
during the lifetime of his or ber former
spouse. If this be a punishment it is, I feel
sure, a light one, and one that ought to be
inflicted. We have been told-in fact, I think
the judges in Ontario have stated-that
seventy or eighty per cent of the divorces
given in that province are obtained by collusion and accompanying perjury on a large
scale. This amendment would, I believe,
virtually wipe out such frauds and crimes.
For these reasons and for many others that
could be mentioned, the amendment should,
I think. be accepted by this House. I therefore submit it for the careful consideration of
honourable members.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES.

I move, seconded by the honourable senator
from Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duff):
That the Bill be not now read a third time,
but that it be amended as follows:
Page 4, line 34:
By adding to section 8 of the Bill as subsections 2 and 3 the following:
(2) Notwithstanding anything in this Act,
whenever, hereafter, in Canada, any divorce is,
by statute or by the decree of the court, enacted,
decreed, pronounced or granted, the respondent
in the proceedings for the divorce, hereinafter
referred to as the "delinquent spouse," shall
not during the lifetime of the petitioner in
such proceedings, hereinafter referred to as the
"former spouse," be competent to intermarry
with any person other than his then unmarried
former spouse.
(3) Notwithstanding anything in this Act,
if, during the lifetime of his former spouse such
delinquent spouse
(a) in Canada goes through a form of marriage with any person other than his former
spouse, or
(b) leaves Canada with the intent to intermarry with any person other than his former
spouse and thereafter out of Canada goes
through a form of marriage with a person
other than his former spouse,
he shall, in Canada, be and be deemed to be
guilty of bigamy and punishable as in and by
the Criminal Code provided.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, our highly respected friend who bas
just spoken (Hon. Mr. Hughes) bas on several
occasions quoted the Bible with regard to
divorce. Though I can assure him that I
have read the Bible all through on more than
one occasion, there are in it many passages
that I have forgotten; so I have undertaken
to find out what the law as handed down
to Moses by the Lord bas to say on this
subject. From my perusal of the Old Testament I have concluded that unquestionably
there was in former times such a thing as
divorce. I do not know how it came about,
but I am going to give ta my honourable
friend and to other honourable senators the
references to divorce that I find in the laws
banded down by the Lord to Moses.
I
presume it may be inferred that in olden days
divorce was recognized by the Lord and the
instructions in relation thereto were given to
Moses for promulgation to the children of
Israel.
My honourable friend asked, "What can
ordinary people do?" I agree with him in
that respect. Then he said, "I know of no
source to which I can go except the Bible."
All right. I agree with him again. Leviticus
deals with divers laws and ordinances, and in
the first verse of chapter 21 I find the following:
And the Lord said unto Moses, Speak unto
the priests the sons of Aaron, and say unto
them-

MAY 18, 1938
Then in several verses the Lord proceeds to
instruct Moses what the people are to do in
regard to the many and various questions
affecting buman conduet. Before I cite verses
13 and 14, I would ask bonourable members
to bear in mind that the Lord is directing
Moses to instruct the priests. In verse 13
He said unto Moses:
And ha shall take a wife in her virginity.
Now verse 14:
A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane,
or an harlot, these shaîl he not take: but he
shaîl take a virgin of his own people to wif e.
I quote that verse as indicating that surely
divorce was recognized in Israel at that time.
If anyone reading the Bible wishes to take
an opposite view, I admit at once that proba.bly bis interpretation is better than mmne.
Tben I corne to Numbers, chapter 30, and
find the page captioned, "Vows are not to
be broken," and so on. Verse No. 9 reads:
But every vow of a widow, and of ber that
is divorced, wherewith they have bound their
&ouls, shall stand against ber.
Does that not rnean that in olden days there
were divorced wornen? I think we may assume
without question that there were. I think we
may assume also that verse 1, chapter 21, of
Leviticus contains a command to the priests
that they must not marry a divorced wornan.
This appears to me to indicate that aven in
those days divorce was recognized by the
Lord in His instructions to Moses, and,
through Moses, to the children of Israel.
This particular question bhm dernonstrated
considerabla differences of understanding and
opinion, and not for a moment would I insist
that my view is correct. I have no more
dasira than my honourabla friand who has just
spoken that tbere should be an inordinate
number of divorces in this country, but I think
it would -be a crying shame to tie soma couples
together after it had been provan conclusively
that thay could not continue to live together
under proper conditions.
A few days ago I was durnbfounded by a
statement made by an honourable senator,
appointed, I presurne, to represent the peopla
of Canada in accordance with the dîctates of
bis conscience and bis judgment as to right
and wrong. If such is not the purposa for
wbicb I arn here, I arn utterly mistaken. This
is the statement:
It is not on tny part any conscientious feelin~
that marriage is necessarily a siacrament. oi
the Church, but 1 know that conscientions
feeling is deep-rooted in the hearts of rnany,
rnany of my best friends, and I arn not willing
to sit in Parliament and concur in putting on
the Statute Book anything which would do
violence to their conscientious, solemn, sacred
matters of belief and creed.

;4

If ever in the world we saw in this assernbly
a dernstration of the dodging of responsibilities-responsibilities which, it seems to
me, are God-given as well as nationally-given
-it was on that occasion. 1 arn in a sorry
position if, having no conscientious convictions
,of what it means to vote for that 'which in my
best judgment is for the good of Canada, I
scratch the Ibacks of some friends outside to
make them feel content, or if in order to
satisfy their personal feelings and inclinations
1 refuse to take this, that or the other position.
I think it was a great misfortune ever to have
a declaration of that kind put upon the records
of this House by a senator presumably
appointed to speak for the people of Canada.
I realize that in the Senate there is a very
marked difference of opinion in respect of
divorce. 1 concede absolutely that it is the
right of those distinguished members who from
lifelong personal and religious convictions are
opposed to divorce in any way, shape or form,
to maintain that position; but it would be
going perhaps a littie too far afield, certainly
'beyond any such position as 1 would adopt,
if some members should undertake to say to
those holding a different view of the matter,
"'We will nlot let you do 'what you propose."
I think that is nlot the proper attitude. I
should not regard myself as being on good
ground if in opposing the view of others I
sought te determine for them what they ought
or ought nut to do.
Speaking to the amendment, I do flot
think we should say in effect that those who
bave been parted under the divorce laws of
Canada, presumahly for proper cause, should
be prevented from ever again enjoying the
privileges and home comforts of married life
with partners with whom. possibly they might
get along very much better.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: May I make an
explanation? The honourable member from
Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) bas cited the
law of Moses. Surely he must know that
for tbe last 1900 odd years we have been
living under the New Dispensation.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: We still have the
Ten Commandrnents.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: That is the very
point whicb Our Saviour decided on this
question. When asked as to that, He said
His teaching superseded the law of Mosea,
A large number of persons believe tbis to ha
so. The very thing which in my opinion
is wrong with the world to-day is that it bas
got away from the idea tbat Jesus Christ
was the Son of God and bad power to supersede the Old Law. Let me repeat, we are
living under the New Dispensation.

344

SENATE

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
I thought my
honourable friend might take that view; and
I admit it.
Hon. J. P. MOLLOY: Honourable senators, I had not intended to take part in this
debate, as I have not been here during all
the discussion, but as everybody seems to be
taking a wallop at it, I thought I might as
well do su myself.
In the first place I am going to put to
the sponsors of the Bill what I think is a
very fair question. I ask them and all other
honourable senators who support this Bill:
Who asked for it? Did the United Church
of Canada, a strong, splendid, powerful body,
ask for it? Did the Baptist Church ask for
it? Did the Salvation Army, a great religious body, ask for it? Nobody will say that
the Catholic Church asked for it.
An Hon. SENATOR:
Or the Anglican
Church.
Hon. Mr. DUFF:
byterians?

What about the Pres-

Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: I will come to them
now. Did the Presbyterian Church ask for
the Bill? Did the Ministerial Association of
Canada ask for it? Did any of the great
secret and fraternal organizations of this
country ask for it? Did that great body
known as the Free Masons, established not
only in Canada but throughout the world,
ask for it? Did the Oddfellows of Canada
ask for it? Did the Knights of Columbus?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Sure!
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. MOLLOY:
And last, but certainlv not least, did the Orange Order of
Canada ask for it? Have anuy of the great
welfare associations in Canada like the
Kiwanis Club or the Rotarv Club, or any
other organization in Canada, asked for it?
If they have, it is without my knowledge.
Who is behind the sponsors of the Bill and
what J am pleased to term the hand-picked
committee, in support of the Bill?
Myi honouraible friend the senior member
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. McMeans), for
whom I have the greatest respect, said this
was a reforn. A reform, as I understand it,
is somuething for the betterment of the
people; not sonie of the people, but all of
the people. This is not advanced legislation;
it is retrograde legislation. Will this make
the people of Canada botter? It will not.
It will certainly make thom worse.
There are two things that the Senate and
the Parliament of Canada. or any other government in the world. cannot do: they canHon. Mr. HUGHES.

not by legislation prevent the manufacture,
sale and use of liquor, and they cannot prevent
the committing of adultery. I challenge any
honourable member in this Chamber to contradiet successfully that statement. We know
both these things go on. The divorce laws
of Canada relate to one; we are not dealing
with the other. Why introduce this Bill at
all? Why has it had to travel the rocky
read it has been travelling, and will have to
travel further before we are through with it?
I believe it is walking as fast as it can, if I
may put it that way, to an early grave. I
may be mistaken, but I do not believe the
Parliament of Canada will pass this Bill.
I hope it will not, because it is not in the
interest of the people, regardless of what any
man may say.
Now, what support have I for my stand?
Many years ago, shortly after his election as
Governor of his state, a gentleman who afterwards became President of the United States
was called into conference on the question of
divorce. Governor Wilson was a Protestant.
I am a Catholic. I respect good Protestants,
and I try to be a good Catholie, which is
mighty hard.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: What did he say?
Did he force himself on that conference? He
did not. In fact it had to be forced on him.
This is what he said: "Divorce was settled
centuries ago in the only way in which it
could be settled. It was settled by the
Catholic Church and by the prohibition of
divorce."
We know the history of divorce in England.
It was introduced into that country by Henry
VIII, the greatest monster England ever knew.
He was not a very lovable character; there
was nothing enchanting about him.
We will go a little further. Will this logislation maRe the homes of Canada better?
Wil iL make the people botter? The right
honourable gentleman opposite (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen) is a man whom I have known
for a long time, and if nobody else in this
House respects him I do. He is the man who
bit the nail on the head. I thought he was going
to vote against the Bill when he first spoke.
I alwavs listen to what he says. And why
would I not? In effect he said this: "If you
interfure with the home you start to undermine the nation." Those are not his exact
words. but that is what they meant. He put
ne a good deal in mind of a cartoon I saw
about fifty years ago. It showed an Irish
handord with a bottie of whisky in one hand
and a glass in the other, giving the gardener
a drink at the end of the day. "Paddy,"

MAY 18, 1938
he said, "I am afraid I am putting a nail
into your coffin." After Paddy had the drink
he said, "Kind sir, put in another while you
have the hammer in your hand."
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: My righ-t honourable
friend dropped the hammer, and is now, perhaps, one of the strongest supporters of this
Bill. I have no objection to that; but I
say the thing is wrong from the very beginning. It is not a reform.
Desertions have been referred to. Well,
desentions will go on as long as history is
written, and no matter how many bills you
pass or what amendments you make to the
Divorce Act, there will be misfit marriages.
And no wonder! Marriages are taking place
largely, I am afraid, as a matter of convenience, not, as in the old days, when people
believed that marriage was right and all that
came with it or from it was proper. Marriage to-day is regarded by many as simply
a matter of convenience. If I diared I would
go so far as to say it was legalized lust. If
you are not satisfied with the one partner
you are at liberty to pick another, and under
this law you can certainly pick quite a
number. It is opening wide the door, not to
reform, but just the opposite.
In Chicago many yeàrs ago the Hearst
papers carried on, at great length, a campaign
against divorce, and I rernember some of the
cartoons placed before the people. One of
these cartoons showed a child, with the father
on the one side and the mother on the other,
each holding on to its hand, all of them
distressed. Divorce would not be so bad if
it affected only the man and the woman who
enter inito this most sacred contract, a contract more sacred than any law that any
country can ever write. What is the contract?
It is a pledge of honour, the man to the
woman, and the woman to the man, for better
or for worse, in sickness or in health, no
matter what the world may say, no matter
what enemies, innumerable as they may be,
may say, that "We two and our offspring will
stand together, and the one will defend the
other as long as life lasts."
Some people will say this is a Catholic
point of view. It is not only a Catholic
point of view; it is a Christian point of view.
I do not like to enter into any'thing that
savours of a religious controversy. In my
young days I engaged, in political discussion
by the hour and by the week, and offten
wasted rmy time on it, but I always tried to
keep away from religion. I am a Catholic
who has lived in a Protestant community al]
the days of his life, and I may say that

345

the Protestants have always treated me as
fairly as J deserved. I have nothing against
the Protestant population or against my
neighbours; they have always treated me
fairly; but I arm opposed to this thing on
the principle of the teachings that I received
at my nother's knee, and I am not going
back on that. now.
It is said that the four greatest wits Ireland
ever produced-and Ireland is the only country that ever produced anything worth
whileSome Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: -were Curran, Swift,
O'Connell and Father O'Leary. Dean Swift,
a Protestant clergyman, in his rambles in
Ireland was overtaken one day by a very
severe electrical storm, and took refuge under
an oak tree. While he was there a young
man and a young woman approached and also
took shelter. They recognized Dean Swift
as a minister of the Gospel. They were somewhat in a hurry. I might say that nowadays
we are quite accustomed to the term "shotgun marriage." It simply means that the girl
is in a hurry and the man knows why.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hou. Mr. MOLLOY: We might as well be
plain about it. Everybody knows what it
means. The hyprocrites will say this shocks
them. I hope it does.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: Anyway, these two
young persons recognized the clergyman and
said they wished to be married. Dean Swift
said, "All right, I will marry you," and he
married them under the tree. When the
ceremony was over they asked him for a certicate. He said, "Certainly," and he took a leaf
out of his note-book and wrote this:
Under an oak in stormy weather
I joined this rogue and wench together,
And none but le who rules the thunder
Can put this rogue and wench asunder.

CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
REFUNDING BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 107, an Act respecting
the Canadian National Railways and to
provide for the refunding of matured, maturing and callable financial obligations.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this Bill, which is a short one, is explained
by its title. In 1935 Parliament authorized
the Governor in Council to provide for the
refunding of matured and maturing obligations of the Canadian National Railways, and
voted for this purpose a sum not to exceed
two hundred million dollars. In reply to some
remarks by my right honourable friend yesterday I said that that amount had been
exhausted except for about $7,000,000 or
$8,000,000. The object of this measure is to
give the Governor in Council power, as stated
in section 2, to:
provide for the refunding of matured, maturing
and/or callable stocks, notes, obligations, bonds,
debentures and other securities of the Canadian
National Railway Company and/or of any one
or more of the other companies comprised in
Canadian National Railways, as defined in
chapter ten of the Statutes of Canada, 1929,
and/or of any company or companies controlled

through stock ownership by any company comprised in Canadian National Railways.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: The
honourable leader has probably forgotten that
yesterday I asked if he would be in a position
to say why we have these recurrent bills, and
why it is not in the public interest to have
one bill blanketing the entire authority so
that obligations of the Canadian National
Railways could be looked after in future with
the same plenary powers on the part of the
Government as are the obligations of the
Dominion itself. I want te be understood as
saying, not that there is no good reason for
the present practice, but just that I do not
know what the reason is.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: After my right
honourable friend had put his question yesterday I asked the Minister of Finance about
the matter, and he told me he would have
been inclined to ask for a larger vote in order
to be able to proceed, in due time, to make
such refundings as become possible at the
maturity of obligations, but that he had
simply followed the practice of his predecessor,
who in 1935 asked for authorization for the
$200,000,000. He has intimated his desire to

MAY 18, 1938
come back to Parliament, whenever the
occasion arises, with a measure along the lines
of the suggestion made by my right honourable
friend. He was not sure that the request for
a larger amount would be welcomed by
Parliament, but because of that suggestion
he may gather moreRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Courage.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, and ask for
a larger sum next time.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I earnestly
hope lie will not get too far away from the
path of his predecessor in office, which he has
been following.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Along these
lines.

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

FARMERS'

CREDITORS ARRANGEMENT BILL
SECOND READING

On the Order:

Second reading of Bill 25 an Act to amend
the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
senators, I have asked Hon. Mr. Farris to
kindly take charge of this Bill, and be has
consented to do so.
Hon. J. W. deB FARRIS moved the second
reading of the Bill.
He said: The last time I had occasion to
discuss the original Act I argued very strenuously before -the Privy Council that it was
ultra vires. I do not know whether that bas
anything to do with my being asked to discuss this Bill to-day.
It seems to me that the amendments meet
with unanimous approval because on the
one hand they make more effective the
provisions of the Act, and this ought to satisfy
those who are in favour of its principle, and
on the other hand they provide for the
termination of the operation of the Act in
any of the provinces.
Section 1 re-defines "creditor," in order
to include in the terni the relationship of
mortgagor and mortagee where there has been
a conveyance of property subject to a
mortgage. If property is mortgaged by A to
B in consideration of, say, $5,000, A has
an equity of redemption in the property.
He then sells the property to C, subject of

347

course to the mortgage. C is a farmer in
an insolvent condition within the meaning
of the Act. The Court of Appeal in Ontario
ruled that as between C and B there is no
relationship of debtor and creditor, there
being no privity of contract between them,
and in these circumstances the board has
no jurisdiction. I understand that in Ontario
and in Manitoba, but not in Saskatchewan,
a large number of orders had been made
before that decision was handed down. In
Saskatchewan there are some 3,000 applications where this question is involved. The
purpose of the amendment is simply this,
that where A has mortgaged his farm and
then has sold that farm to C, a farmer who
finds himself unable to carry on and pay his
debts in full, C will be able to come before
the board and have a composition or arrangement made which will govern that mortgage,
although there never had been any privity
of contract between the holder of the property and the mortgagee.
The other two subsections, Nos. 2 and 3
of section 1, provide for retroactive application of that provision. I have checked up
the progress of this Bill in the other House
and find these provisions were not in it
originally, but the discussion there led to what
seems to me to be a very logical conclusionthat all cases which had already been reviewed
and rejected should be dealt with in the
same way as new proposals under the scheme.
I understand that in some cases an application has been made and the board has
refused to consider it, because of the ruling
of the Ontario Court of Appeal to which I
have referred. In other cases, which had
come before the board prior to that ruling,
orders had actually been made. It seems to
me that in order to ensure uniformity of practice in all the provinces the provision should
be made retroactive in its effect. It is, of
course, retroactive only within the field and
the time provisions of the original Act.
Section 2 defines "proposal" and requires,
I think, no explanation.
Section 3 repeals old subsection 3 of section
2, which is now covered by the new clause 5.
Section 4 introduces an important amendment. It provides that in case of the death
of a farmer his legal representative may apply
to the board and submit a proposal, provided
that a member of the deceased person's family
is to carry on the work of the farm. On the
next page there is a definition of "member of
the family." It reads:
"member of the family" means a parent, or a
widow or widower, or a brother or sister, or a
child of the decedent.

348

SENATE

One recalls the principle of the original Bill,
which was to enable farmers to remain on the
land, in the public interest, in cases where they
were for the time being in insolvent circumstances. The provisions of this amendiment
are limited to cases where the fariner was
insolvent at the time of his death and had
already made application for a scheme, or,
because of his condition, would have been
in a position to make the application if death
had not supervened. In those limited circumstances, if the person who is to succeed him
on the farm is a member of his family, the
board can make the saine provision as could
have been made if the fariner had not died.
Section 5 is in substitution for subsection
3 of section 2 of the Act. It provides in a
readjusted forim for the saine matter as
was dealt with in the clause to be repealed.
If a farmer succeeds in having an order made
under the original Act, and then he does not
carry out the order, and the board decides that
the reason he has not carried it out is not
beyond his control-putting it in the form of
a double negative-in such circumstances the
arrangement or composition may be cancelled.
If it is cancelled, then the fariner shall be
deemed to have committed an act of bankruptcy

under

section

3 of the

Bankruptcy

Act. Honourable members will recall that
originally the Bankruptcy Act did not apply
to fariners who are actually working on the
land. The principle of this amendment, which
is merely a modification of the original section, is simply this, that where a fariner bas
invoked the Act and has brought about a
composition by an order of the board, and
then has failed to carry it out, and can offer
no proper excuse for not carrying it out,
not only is the composition annulled, but lie
then bas committed an act of bankruptcy.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I ran over the
Bill very rapidly some time ago and have
not read it since. Does it provide that thoreupon the fariner becomes subject to the Bankruptcy Act right throughi?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Let me read what it
says. This is subsection 2 of section 5:
In any case whbre
ithe Court has anilled
the composition. extension of tine or scheome of
arranemient as provided in the next preceding

sbsetio.u fthe farimer shall be deeiied to have
commiiittel an act of bankruptcy witi in the
mieaning of setion three of the Bankruîptcy
Act and Part I of the ]anklrptcy Act shall
notwithstanding section seven thereof apply to

siich fariner.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, yes.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I can sec nothing objectionable in that, because, after ail, he brings
the situation on himself. It is only in case
Hon. Mr. FARRIS.

it bas been determined that he is in default in
not carrying out an order of the board that
this provision applies.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Does that not change
the law of bankruptcy, which provides that
a farmer cannot be forced into bankruptcy?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: It changes the law to
the extent of this provision. But it is not a
new provision. Let me call the honourable
gentleman's attention to the old provision,
which reads as follows:
In any case where the affairs of a farmer
have been arranged by a proposal
approved
by the Court or confirmîed by the Board as
hereinafter provided, Part I of the Bankruptcy
Act shall notwithstanding section seven thereof
thereafter apply to such fariner bot only failure
on the part of such farier to carry out any
of the ternis of the proposai shall bc deemed
to be

an

act of baiikriptcy.

Provided

such failuire shall not be deemed an
bankruptcy if. in the opinion of the
such act was due to causes beyond the
of such farner.
So it is actually a modification of the
it lias existed since 1934, without any
in principle.

that

Court,

Act as
change

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Although a fariner
cannot be forced into bank'ruptcy under the
Bankruptcy Act, would it not mean that if
he makes application under the Fariners'
Creditors Arrangement Act, and the Board of
Review makes a composition. or proposai,
and he does not carry it out, lie can be immediately declared a bankrupt?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: With one other qualification: if lie does not carry eut the proposal and does not offer a reasonable excuse
for failure to do so. It applies only in the
case of delinquents who have no excuse to
offer.
Section 6 merely changes the provision as
to stay of proccedings by a creditor. Under
the Act that stay was only ninety days;
then, if the compSition had not been coinpleted, it was necessary to apply to a court
for extension after extension. It was found
to be an expensive and unnecessary provision.
This amendment provides that stay of any
right of action by the creditor continues until
the date of the final disposition of the proposal, unless in the meantime the court bas
ordered otherwise. This is an obvious improvement in the routine working out of the
Act.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES:
"court" mean?

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: "Court" is defined in
the original Act.

349

MAY 18, 1938
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Who is it?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I can quote the
statute.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: In British Columbia it
is the Supreme Court.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: It is not the Board of
Review?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Oh, no. I mention the
Supreme Court of British Columbia because
I happen to be familiar with the province.
Section 7 is a still furtbher expansion of the
operation of the Act. It enables the Governor in Coundil to appoint more than one
board in a province. The information which
has been furnished me is that in certain provinces, particularly in the West, because of the
number of applications it has been found
definitely necessary to provide additional
boards to carry on the work.
Section 8 deals with the other side of the
picture as I outlined it in the beginning. It
provides as follows:
On and after a date to be fixed by proclamation of the Governor in Council, no new proposal shall be made or filed by any farmer or
accepted by any Official Receiver in any province in respect of which the said proclamation
is issued.
In other words, the Government by Order in
Council may at any time terminate the
operations of this Act in any one of the
provinces.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: That is on
the request of the province?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: My right honourable
friend may be right as to that, but so far as
this amendment is concerned that is not so.
I take it that the responsibility for
terminating the operations of the Act rests
entirely with the Federal Government.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think so.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I think there was some
discussion in the House of Gommons on that
question. So far as I have studied it it is
definitely the responsibility of the Government of Canada.
I move the second reading of the Bill.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, I was not expecting the Bill
would be presented for second reading today. I thought we were going to get through
our work as soon as possible in order that the
Special Railway Committee might be reconvened. Therefore I am not as familiar as I
ought to be with the Bill, and do not intend
to discuss it as if I were.

What I rise to say now-and it is appropriate to say it on the second reading-has
to do with the old Act rather than with these
amendments. I do not know that I have
objection to any particular amendment. I
was rather disappointed, though, for I thought
the main purpose of the Bill was to point the
way to the termination of the whole farmers'
creditors arrangement policy. I do not see
very much in the amendments designed to
that end.
I was a member of the Government which
presented to Parliament the measure now
being amended. Indeed, I had charge of it,
of course, in this House. At that time I
could not see any reason in principle why
there should be a distinction between the
farmer's position in the event of bankruptcy
and the position of a merchant or other
business man, and I commended the Bill to
this House sincerely and conscientiously and
as well as I could. I have not been able to
watch the working of the Act as closely as
one should if one is to speak dogmatically,
but I have had some association with it, and
I frankly say I have changed my mind a]most diametrically with respect to the whole
measure. I do not believe it is possible and
proper and defensible to legislate with respect
to the bankruptcy of a farmer on anything like
the lines on which we legislate with respect
to the bankruptcy of a merchant or man of
business; and it is because of the distinction
that the consequences which I have seen, and
which I cannot help saying frankly I deplore,
have flowed from this legislation. A farmer
may be bankrupt throughout one year, in
the sense in which a merchant is bankrupt,
in that he cannot pay his debts in cash. In
ninety cases out of one hundred it is not
his fault; that is to say, the fault is more
manifestly traceable to visitations of nature,
for there is no occupation on earth so
hazardous as farming.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES:

Except fishing.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There is
none at all. I know something about it,
and no one can ever suggest that I have not
sympathy with the farmer's position, particularly in the West. I have endured very
much of what he has endured. But through
all the decades, though the farmer may have
been bankrupt one year, he may have been the
next year, without any bankruptcy proceedings
at all, in a condition not merely of solvency,
but of comparative affluence. To treat him
as a bankrupt because for one year the conjunction of circumstances has rendered him
unable to discharge his maturing obligations
is to take away from his creditors rights of

350

SENATE

which they cannot be deprived on any moral
grounds.
The purpose of the measure was to devise
some means of keeping him on the land.
That was a quite sufficient purpose. The
fear was that men would be driven off and
would get into the cities to take their places
in relief linos, or would get out of the country. I do flot feel that I can say dogmatieally people have flot beon saved to the land
by this measure, but in my .iudgment the
number saved is very small. The creditor himself, if ho is flot a foolish man, if ho is a man
of business, will flot force a farmer off land
unless some better farmer can be got to do
the job more efficiently.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES:

Hcar, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is something we have to keep in mind always. Therofore these cases liquidate themselvos by the
actions of the two parties, tbe farmer on tbe
one hand and the creditor on the other. For
every one of the men wbo bas been liquidated
by this measure thore have been a dozen wbo
have themselves made a deal with their
creditors. I tbink I know something of the
operation by which that is accomplisbed;
I bave done it twenty or thirty times myscîf;
and now, in distinguisbing my position from
that wbicb I took wl'.n the legislatien went
tbrougli, I express the view that the whole
problem will wvork out more satisfactorily by
this method than on the lines of tho legisiatien we have to-day. I bave known of cases
where what bas been acbieved bas brougbt
about
the grossest
and most repellant
injustices; where a man bas borrowed money
on land normally worth many times the amount
loaned, and under emergent circumstances bas
got into such a position that ho could net
take caro of bis debts, and thon he bas get a
board of review to eut down the size of the
loan which ho secured in gond faitb from
somoone who, perhaps, bas notbing elso at alI.
It is cut down irrespectivo, or in large degree
irrespective, of the security behind it. Though
tbe creditor may be ready te take the land as
security, he is net allowed te do that; bis
security is taken from under bis feet. The
consequence is a spre.ading loss of confidence
in tbe value of any security, and a contributing te the deterieration of debtor morale,
a disease which is a voritable cancer at the
heart of this country to-day. There was a
time when obligations wvere really cousidered
te ho obligations, but thagt idea is ýbecoming
antiquated and eld-fashioned.
To-day an
obligation is regarded as s.omething that one
bas te devise some method of gettitig rid of.
Tbis is becoming more, and more the public
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEICHIEN.

attitude, and I stand bero te confess that the
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act bas
contributed in ne smalIl degreo te tbis stato
of mind
I am net at sîl criticizing tho
Government. The Government whicb put it
into effeet was one of which I wus a membor,
and ne one was more responsible than mysoîf;
but I should like to see the eyes of tbe
Government directed to tbe termination of
the Act at the earliest possible date.
We listened last session te an almost
incredible recital by the henourable senator
from Xing's (Hon. Mr. Hughes) of conditions
in Prince Edward Island. With my own eyes
I bave seen tbings very little less incredible.
When the honourable member is giving the
facts about Prince Edward Island I am able
te follow him mucb more intelligently than I
can wben he is discussing marriage.
Somo Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I sbeuld like
bim te tell us something more te-day, for I
do net doubt that the experiences he related
have ýbeen repeated. I hope I shaîl net ho
understood as attacking the .iudges wbo are
beads of these boards of review. It would
seem, tbough, that if tbere is wisdom in certain
of the decisions my mind must be getting
astray from tbe mrinciples of wisdom and
.iudgment.
However, in my public position
I say we ought te direct our pelicy more and
more te putting an end te aIl these extreme
measures and restoring a sound and sane
debtor morale. If we do net, the deterioratien that is geing on, though it cannet grow
mucb worse than it is new in some cases.
will becomne more and more universal.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I was surprised
te hear my rigbt honourablo friend express
the opinion that in very many cases--I do not
know that he did net say nine eut of tenfarmers wbo felt the pincb on one year's
eperations would lean on sucb an Act for
relief in the following year althougb by reason
of a good crop they wero back on their feet.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I said that in
nine eut of tee cases the farmer would feel
bis position unsafe and migbt be in that position for one year, but the next year bis
situation migbt be tbe very reverse.
This
applies particularly te the Prairie West.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I was just coming te that conclusion. My right henourable
friend was explaining the situation tbat prov'ails in the West, where the operations of
the farmer are very porileus because gonerally
he bas but one kind of crop. This dees net
apply te tbe Eastern Provinces. It is very
seldoma that a farmer in the East is bit so

MAY 18, 1938
badly by crop failure during one year that
he is reduced to a condition of distress. He
knows that while one crop may fail, he has
other crops which will pull him through.
The experience we have had of the operation of this Act leads us clearly to the conclusion that if the Act was justifiable at all,
it was, strange to say, justifiable with respect
to the Western Provinces, where a good crop
will put a man on his feet in a year. But I
think it bas done considerable harm in the
Eastern Provinces. My right honourable
friend says, "I hope this Act will be terminated
as soon as possible." I have read the debates
in the other House and have observed a
general consensus of opinion that the lst of
July next should be the ultimate date at
which Ontario should be relieved from it. I
do not know that I have heard very many
representations from the province of Quebec,
but I feel that the province of Quebec would
follow the province of Ontario. We should
then return to this situation, that if the Act
could be justified at all through the experience we have had of it, it would be because
it was justified in the Western Provinces.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: How do the numbers
of applications in the different provinces of
Canada compare?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: They were, to
my surprise, very great in Ontario, and as
great in Quebec.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Greater.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: It was not a Western
measure.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It was a Western measure, and it should not have been
made applicable to the Eastern Provinces,
because it has affected the morale of a number of our farmers who otherwise would have
pulled through.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: For a hundred
years they have managed to stand any yearly
adversity.
I find from the debates in the other House
that the Western Provinces are not absolutely
ready to ask for the repeal of the Act. We
passed this legislation in 1934. I think it will
be gradually recalled. But from what I have
learned through reading the debates in the
other House I believe there is a consensus of
opinion in favour of withdrawal as far as the
Eastern Provinces are concerned.
Honourable
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN:
members, I intend to occupy but a few moments of your time. I have had one exper-

ience with respect to this legislation in Alberta which leads me to believe that there
is a very considerable number of farmers
who are honest and prefer dealing with their
creditors under this Act to benefiting from
some of the legislation that bas been placed
on the Statute Book of Alberta during the
past few years. I have not the exact figures
with me. but I think I am right in saying
that at the time some of the debt legislation,
or moratorium legislation, was introduced in
Alberta, a year or more ago, there were in the
neighbourhood of 1,000 applications that had
not been heard before the Board of Review
of the province. I asked one of the members
of the board how many of these applications
had been withdrawn in consequence of the
Alberta debt legislation. He told me-and
again I am not sure as to the figures, but
I think I am correct-that there were fewer
than a dozen cases in which farmers had asked
leave to withdraw their applications from
the Board of Review and come under the
legislation of the province. There is some
encouragement in that. Apparently farmers
who actually want to meet their obligations
and make a settlement with their creditors
feel that they should do so under legislation
that will stand up for a time, rather than
risk taking benefits that may be very enticing
at the moment, but may not be permanent.
In the discussion that has taken place the
right honourable the Leader of the Opposition made mention of voluntary adjustment
between the debtor and the creditor. That
is something that has been going on all
through the depression, and the people would
be amazed if they only knew the extent of
the concessions made by the loaning companies in the province of Alberta, and the
amount of money those companies have lost.
I know of one section of the province of
Alberta which, to a degree, was abandoned
some fifteen or twenty years ago: I know that
the loan companies had been generous in
making loans in that area, and that they lost
virtually every cent they loaned. The publie generally is not aware of that fact, and
if I had any criticism to make of the loan
companies it would be that they have failed
to inform the people as to the source from
which they obtained their money, and the
losses sustained by those who loaned it
throughout the country. I doubt whether
the people of the province of Alberta, where
there is so much fantastic legislation at the
present time, are aware that the money
loaned to them by the insurance and mortgage companies is the collection of the savings of many small people throughout Canada; and if the debtors will not get out

of their heads the idea that their debts can
be wiped out, so that they may live comfortably for the future, I do not know what we
are in for in this country.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Hear, hear.
Hon. CREELMAN MacARTHUR: Honourable members, I agree with everything
that has been said by the right honourable
leader on the other side in respect of this
vicious legislation, particularly bis reference
to conditions that obtain in my Ôwn province of Prince Edward Island. Last year I
had on the Order Paper a motion dealing
with this very subject, but illness prevented
me from taking it up. The occasion is not so
urgent now, because I am satisfied that the
Act will be terminated so far as some provinces are concerned; and I believe that Prince
Edward Island will be the first to receive the
proclamation.
My good friend and deskmate (Hon. Mr. Hughes) discussed this
matter last year and told something of our
experiences in Prince Edward Island.
In the first place, tlis legislation was never
intended to apply to a province like Prince
Edward Island.
It was intended for the
drouglt areas of the Western Provinces, but
when the people discovered that it was a
Santa Claus measure it became the subject of
a racket. The whole countryside in Prince
Edward Island lias been stampeded, the Act
is nothing but a joke, and the morale of the
farmer lias gone.
We had three men on the board down there,
one of whom was a judge. If you read the
discussion which toolk place in the other
House you will see that it is questionable
whether a judge should be a member of a
board of that kind. We cannot criticize
judges, but I may say that if we had had a
good business man of some fairness and sense
of equity on the board we never should have
experienced the trouble we had.
I have been in close touch with the
administration of this Act from its inception.
The administrator of the legislation is Mr.
Gordon, an expert financial man, who comes
from my province, and lie tells me that he
has ten times as many complaints from Prince
Edward Island as from all the other provinces
put together.
If I had dealt with this matter last year I
could have spoken for an hour and a half and
told you of things that you would find it hard
to believe; things contrary to common sense
that have been done in the making of
compositions. One of the three members of
our board was supposed to represent creditors,
but the three members were of one mindthey were all for the debtors, and the situation
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN.

became such that creditors never bothered to
appear to defend their cases, but let them go
by default. One member of the board, who
never had earned $5 a day, was paid $6,000.
He was in favour of the farmer in every case.
I am entirely in sympathy with farmers, and
I know that there were a few good decisions,
but I could show you twenty that were unfair
for every one that was fair.
Yet we hear of letters being received by
the administrator stating what a wonderful
piece of legislation this is, and that its operations should be expanded. Even now, in
another place, a private member is bringing in
a bill for amplifying this law rather than for
restricting it. As was said yesterday by the
right honourable leader on the other side
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), the whole status
of recipients of relief has been changed.
Farmers owing money feel that this law
entitles them to come and get relief. In my
younger days a man who owed money used to
be expected to pay it off. even if it took him
a very long time, and he had some satisfaction
in doing so; but now it is a common thing for
a man to say that ho is entitled to be relieved
of his debts. A big merchant who had some
106 cases adjusted. every one to bis detriment,
told me he had been speaking with a man
who was solvent and in good condition, but
who said he was going before the board. The
merchant said to him: "Why are you doing
that?
You are solvent."
And the man
replied, " Yes, but I have not made any money
on my farm this last year or two. The law
gives me the right to go before the board,
doesn't it?' That is the prevailing idea, that
there is a legal right.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES:

Yes, that is the idea.

Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: On the board in
Prince Edward Island there was no one representing creditors; so the administration became a racket, and the board was known
as "the Soviet Government." I can tell honourable members that unless this Act is made
inapplicable to our province by the first of
July there will be a great deal more said
about it. New Brunswick does not want this
Act and other provinces do not wan.t it. It
is emergency legislation, which bas outlived
its usefulness.
R.iglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Just compare the
situation in our province with that in Nova
Scotia. In that province the population is
six times as large, and yet there were not
nearly so many cases as in Prince Edward
Island.

MAY 18, 1938
Han. Mr. HUGHES: One-fifth of the number.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Apple growing,
for instance, is a branch of farming which
for sompe reason or other bas been suffering
bard times for some years in Nova Scotia,
yet we find tbat tbe cost to the country for
the operations of the Act in tha-t province
has been relatively very small. I asked the
administrator how this remarka-bly good showing of Nova Scotia, as com.pared with Prince
Edward Island, could be accounted for, and
hec said: "Well, part of tbe resuit is due to
Judge Hall, a member of the board. Many
a farmer who made application for a composition was spoken ta very plainly by tbe
Judge. He would say: 'Your fatber would
turn over in bis grave if hie knew you came
here and tried to get rid of liabilities for
your obligations. Cet rid of your car, instead,
and work as bard as you catu and pay off
your honest debts.'" Tbat is the kind of
attitude tbat should bave been dtisplayed&in
Prince Ed.ward Island, but it wau not. Tbe
three members of tbe board there would take
a stand for the farmer from tbe drop of the
hat every time. So, as I say, proceedings under
the Act became a racket. I want, to say
again that, if the Act is not made inapplicable
to Prince Edward Island very soon, a great
deal more will be heard from, representatives
aof tbat province.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable senators, as a resident of tbe province of Quebec
I wisb to add a few words in an effort ta
induce tbe honourable leader of the House
'(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) to impress upon the
Government the necessity of repealing -this
legislation as quickly as possible. In years
gone by we suffered from the activities of a
species of trustees or liquidators who called
upon merchants and induced themn ta abandon
tbeir praperty and settie their debts by paying
u,small proportion of the amounts they owed.
Tbat 'became a well recognized, pracedure in
aur cities. But our rural residents, tbe farmers, still commanded the respect of creditors.
I do not tbink there was any province in the
Dominion wbose farmiers, had a bigber re'putation for morale and for their attitude towards
financîal obligations than the farmers of the
province of Quebec. But what is happening taday? Everybody knows that the racket that
was played in the city has spread into the
country, and tbat certain people have gone
about industriously persuading farmers that
instead of paying their debts in fu11 they
sbould invoke this law and have a composition
:made.
And because many farmers have

responded to thîs appeal aur rural people bave
lost their credit.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: My bonourable
friend tbe leader of tbe Government (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) knows that. A few years
ago a farmer bad no difficulty in obtaining
credit fromn a loan company on the security
of bis farm. Indeed, it was not necessary
for bim ta go to a boan company; sîl be
bad ta do was to go te tbe nearest village,
wbere bie could borrow from. bis friends; and,
if unable ta pay bis interest at tbe agrced
time, bie could always arrange for an extension. The treatment meted out to him was
nlot barsb, because the creditors trusted him,
and rigbtly so.
But to-day tbe situation is cbanged. The
three members of the board under this Act
have often gone to seriaus excesses. In many
instances tbey have not respected mortgages
for instance: tbey bave treated mortgage
debts as tbey would any other, and reduced
tbemn ta fractions of the original sums. Wbat
is the result? Farmers no longer lend ta
one another, and they are unable ta get
credit from boan campanies. Let the honourable leader make an investigation into tbe
province af Quebec and find out how many
boan companies are ready to make boans ta
farmers now. As we know, the Provincial
Government bas bad ta enter the loan field,
ta make money available ta farmers, because
they could not get it froin any other source.
To my mind this is a disastrous law. Ita
application is very often iniquitous ta creditors, and, certainly bas been. most damaging
ta the farmers tbemselves. Not only are the
farmers of my province unable ta get credit,
but, I arn sorry ta say, their reputation in
financial matters bas suffered.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill
was read the second time.
Tbe Senate adjourned until to-morrow at

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. TANNER presented the report
of the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous
Private Bills on Bill 12, an Act to incorporate
The Roman Catholie Episcopal Corporation
of Hudson's Bay, and moved concurrence
therein.
He said: The amendment is merely a clerical
correction in clause 2, where, after the word
"now," the committee bas inserted the words
"or hereafter." The clause now reads:
All lands, tenements, hereditaments and
property, real and personal, now or hereafter

The motion was agreed to.
THIRD READING

On motion of Hon. Mr. Tanner, for Hon.
Mr. Côté, the Bill, as amended, was read the
third time, and passed.
PELAGIC SEALING (CONVENTION) BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 98. an Act respecting
the North Pacifie Pelagie Sealing Convention.
He said: I would direct the attention of
honourable senators to the explanatory note,
which reads:
This treaty was signed on July 7, 1911. Article
4 of the treaty provides that inians and other
aborigines dwelling on the coast of the waters
cvered by the tecatv may continue to carry
on pelagic sealing in canoes wiLhout the use

of firearns. The legisiation adopted at the
tinie-the Pelagie Sealing Act-contains no
provision whereby such Indian or other aborigine could be penalized for violating this provision of the treaty.

Also. the existing Act is

linked up with Imperial legislation, as, at the
time it was adopted. Caniada was not a treatymaking power. Canada is niow in facet responsible t for carrying out the provisions of the
trea y and it was consiilred best, instead of
ameningL the existin' Act, to replace it by ade-

quate

enabling legislation.
I should perhaps give a short statement of
what the treaty bas effected so far. The treaty
has already proved its efficiency. The purposes whichi it is intended to serve are being
achieved. There are three distinct bords of
fur seals in the northern Pacifie. By far the
largest is the North American herd, which
bas its breeding places on the Pribilof Islands
in Behring Sea, off the coast of Alaska. On
the Asiatic side was a hord which in years gone
bv was larger and which ahad its breeding
places on the Commander Islands in Behring
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

Sea, off the cost of Siberia. The third herd
is the Japanese herd, which has its breeding
place mainly on Robben Island, off the northern portion of Japan.
When the United States purchased Alaska,
in 1867, the American fur seal herd was estimated to contain between three and four
million animals. After the acquisition of
Alaska the United States leased the sealing
privileges to a company which for years took
100,000 seals per annum on the Islands, without detriment to the berd. As seals are highly
polygamous and as in a herd the number of
males and females born each year is about
equal, a large proportion of the young male
seals may be removed each year, not only
without detriment, but with distinct advantage
to the herd.
The seals leave the Islands in the fall of
each year and nake their way off the coast
southward until they reach a point about
opposite Southern California. They then turn
back towards the Islands, the major number
travelling distances from twenty to sixty
miles out from the coast, with a scattering
number nearer the shore.
W'len, in the early eighties, it became known
that tbere was money to be made out of fur
sealskins, pelagic sea.ling developed on the
United States and Canadian Pacific coast.
In pelagic sealing no selection of the animais
killed can ac muade, and as the mother seals
reurning to the Islands to have thcir young
travel mnore slowly and sleep more, they are
more easily captured. Hence in pelagic sealing
the large proportion of the seals taken were
females with young. This nethod of sealing
is destructive.
When it became intensive,
the seal herd began te diminish. Later on,
Japanese sealing vessels largely engaged in the
industry. The net result was that by the
time the treaty became effective the American
seal lierd had been reduced te about 135,000
Pelagie sealing had largely disapanimails.
peared, only a few of the original fleet of
sixty-four Canadian vess e ls b e ing left in the
industrv.

Under the protection afforded by the treaty,
the herd began rapidly to increase, and killing,
mainly of three-year-old males on the Islands,
was resimed in 1918. The number taken
each vear is increised in accordance with the
increase in tho berd. This herd now numbers
about 1,839,000. The number talken on the
Islands last year was about 60,000, Canada's
share being 8.277. The net amount in cash
received by Canada for the sale of its share
of skins since the treaty became effective,
up to the end of last December, was
$1,493,510.71, made up as follows:

In addition, the Indian coast catch in 1936
was 1,888, and in 1937 it was 2,671 skins.
The United States delivers Canada's share
of the skins at Seattle without charge. They,
for a number of years past, have been shipped
to London for dressing and dyeing. They are
sold there.
The Russian situation is really a matter of
External Affairs. It concerns us also. Briefly,
the situation is that until 1925 we were
receiving from Russia, from year to year,
fifteen per cent of the skins taken on its
islands, as provided for by the treaty. Since
that date Russia has not been co-operating.
There has been considerable correspondence
on the subject through the Department of
External Affairs. All we can say is that we do
not know what is being done on the Russian
islands. We are receiving no returns therefrom if a seal herd still exists there. Russia,
however, bas not been carrying on any pelagic
sealing.
With regard to any contention that the
growing seal herd is a menace to our salmon
fisheries, it is explained that for two years
investigations were carried on by both Canada
and the United States.
The Canadian
investigations were under the direction of
Dr. Clemens. who is in charge of the Biological
Station at Nanaimo, and consisted of examination of the stomach contents of fur seals
taken off the west coast of Vancouver Island
in April and May. 1935. This examination
showed that salmon forms only a small part
of the diet of fur seals during the time the
herd is migrating northward past the British
Columbia coast. In all, 593 stomachs were
secured for examination. One hundred and
ninety-three were found to contain food and
the remainder were empty. Only 14 contained
remnants of salmon and these were from
stomachs taken after the beginning of May,
by which time the major portion of the
migrating herd had passed by our coast.
Herring particles were present in the stomachs
far more often than any other kind of food,
and were found in 177 cases. Remnants of
crustacea occurred 147 times. Next in order
of frequency of occurrence came the oulachan,
found in 30 stomachs, squid in 21 stomachs,
salmon, as already stated, in 14 stomachs.
The result of the examination supports
the view that seals take as food whatever is
most readily available. For instance, salmon
51958-23J

are not in evidence in any appreciable quantity
in the early months of the year, and the
stomachs taken in April showed no evidence
of salmon. In May, although the bulk of
the seal herd has passed by, the salmon are
somewhat more plentiful and the seals remaining are apparently feeding to a small
extent upon them. By the first of June only
the odd straggler of the seal herd remains,
and it is not until then that the main salmon
runs are coming into evidence.
I do not know whether these explanations
are interesting to honourable members.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: I have
listened with deep interest to the honourable
leader's explanation, not so much of the Bill as
of the pelagic sealing industry. I was rather
disappointed, though, at the figures for the
American herd, the one with which we are really
concerned. I had understood that it had recovered almost to the dimensions which existed
before pelagic sealing commenced. In fact,
I think I gave information of that kind to
the House some four or five years ago. I
wonder if the fact is that there has been a
diminution lately. If that is so, I presume it
is due to lack of co-operation by Soviet
Russia, and it would seem unfortunate that
nothing can be done.
As regards the Bill, I have read it with
great care. It is an attempt to ratify now,
after twenty-seven years, a treaty made by
Great Britain, Japan, Russia and the United
States, governing the whole subject of pelagie
sealing in the Pacifie. In the meantime we
have got along with a very short measure
passed in 1913, implementing as respects
Canada the provisions of a British Order
in Council providing for the enforcement of
the treaty. Now we are establishing authority
for enforcement by Canada, and this is no
doubt what ought to be done.
Aside from the facts underlying the whole
industry of pelagic sealing, there are certain
features of the Bill which seem to me to require some attention, and they are of so detailed a character that I think they could be
better considered in committee. I hesitate
to suggest a reference to the committee on
Banking and Commerce, to which a similar
measure went some years ago, because a
number of members of that committee are also
on the Special Railway Committee. But we
could send it to another appropriate committee for consideration. The features I have
in mind are those upon which our Law Clerk
has made some comments, which I have read.
To some of'them he attaches importance, and
I think rightly so. In the light of his com-

SENATE

356

ments, the Bill probably could be improved by
that committee.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Our Law Clerk
studies all the measures that come before us.
I have examined his apt comments upon the
present Bill. As to its form, he bas made
little criticism, except with respect te section 6. He does criticize the definition of
"equipping" in section 2, but I believe that
this definition can stand as it is. I think the
Law Clerk would agree with me on that,
though I have net discussed it with him.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
criticism is as to clause 3.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

The main

Yes.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Very vigorous exception is taken to the importation
into this measure of a number of sections of
another Act, especially with the presence of
this phrase "in se far as applicable."
Yes. I was
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
just coming te that clause. The Law Clerk
bas expressed the opinion that if we desire
to apply sections of other statutes they should
be incorporated in the Bill itself. I appreciate the soundness of his view. I suggest that
we send the Bill te a committee for the
purpose of embodying therein whatever clauses
.of the Customs and Fisheries Protection Act
are deemed necessary.
Our attention bas been drawn to the fact
that in section 6 only the word "port" occurs,
whereas the convention says "port or harbour." I think we should add the words "or
Iarbour."
When the Bill is given second reading I
shall move that it be referred to a conmittee.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Will my honourable friend be kind enough to supplement the
very interesting information he gave us by
stating whether Canada shares only in the
Canadian berd, and how the division is made
under the present treaty?
We might go
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
into that when the Bill is in committee, or
on the motion for third reading.
Right.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There is
another point. It is not mentioned by the
Law Clerk, and I may be wrong in my
understanding of the Bill in this respect.
Section 6 provides that if any person, other
than an Indian-and his rights are abbreviated too-uses any port within Canada for
the purpose of equipping any vessel intended
to be operated or used for any purpose whatRigit Hon.

there is an international convention. I should
like te know whether there is an international
convention. Otherwise, I submit, our people
would not be subject to this law outside the
three-mile limit. There our nationals have
the same rights as the nationals of any other
country.

NORTHWEST TERRITORIES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 110, an Act ta amend
the Northwest Territories Act.
He said: Honourable senators will find
this explanatory note in the Bill:
By chapter 64 of the Statutes of Canada,
1926-27, the Northwest Territories Act was
amended so as to provide for the levying of a
tax upon furs to be taken from the Territories.
This tax was imposed by an ordinance of the
Commissioner of the Northwest Territories in
Council, ,assented to on 7th May, 1929, which
provides that "no person shall export, carry
or cause to be exported or carried out of the
Territories, any furs, without first having obtained a permit to do so." Such permits are
issued upon payment of the proper tax. There
appears to be reason to believe that furs are
being removed illegally from the Territories,
and to enable a closer check to be made by
those responsible for the collection of the tax
it is proposed to authorize judges of the Exchequer Court to issue writs of assistance that
will enable the persons named therein to search
premises and conveyances which are believed
to contain furs that have been or are being
taken from the Territories without authority.
The remedy suggested is similar to that provided by Parliament to facilitate the collection
of excise tax.
The amendment is as follows:
A judge of the Exchequer Court of Canada
shall grant a writ of assistance upon application
made to him for that purpose by His Majesty's
Attorney-General of Canada and such writ
shall remain in force so long as any person
named therein remains an officer, be the same
game oficer, game warden, constable or other
peace officer, whether in the same capacity
or not.
A writ of assistance is on a parity with a
search-warrant, but it issues from a civil court.
Under the Customs Act the same procedure
avails.
I have before me a long memorandum on
the trade in furs from the Territories, but
I doubt whether it would be worth while to
detain the House by reading it now.
I have under my hand the Customs Act,
clauses 155 and 156 of which are in these
termas:

A judge of the Exchequer Court of Canada,
or any judge of any of the superior courts in
any province of Canada, having jurisdiction in
the province or place where the application
is made, shall grant a writ of assistance upon
application made to him for that purpose by
His Majesty's Attorney-General of Canada or
by a collector or by any superior officer; and
such writ shall remain in force so long as any
person named therein remains an officer, whether
in the same capacity or not.
For the purposes of this section, any judge
of the Court of King's Bench, in the province
of Manitoba, shall have jurisdiction over that
part of Canada formerly known as the district
of Keewatin, and shall grant a writ of assistance for use therein, in like manner and with
like effect as he might grant such writ for
use in the province of Manitoba.
156. Every writ of assistance granted before
the coming into force of this Act, under the
authority of Acts relating to the Customs now
repealed, shall remain in force notwithstanding
such repeal.
Honourable members will appreciate that
a writ of assistance is essential within these
territories, for, as they cover so vast an area,
it would be impossible to rely on a searchwarrant. It is only by this preventive action
that culprits can be dealt with. The representatives of the department must have in
hand the authority to search all vehicles coming out, even aeroplanes, because that business is now largely carried on by that means.
The places where those aeroplanes can land
are limited in number, and it is there that
watch is kept and search made. The person
who makes the search does not know whether
any violation of the Act has occurred or
not, and he must have sufficient authority. It
is for this reason that the Bill resorts to what
is called a writ of assistance, a type of writ
used regularly under the Customs Act.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: What is the purpose? Is it to control the quantity of furs
taken out of the country?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is to see that
no person brings out furs unless he has a
licence to deal in furs or to bring them into
one of the provinces. There is a closed region
in which those furs can be secured, and a quite
profitable business is carried on. The Government is entitled to draw some profit froa
the business in order that it may be compensated for the administration of that territory.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Is there an excise
tax on the furs?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There is a
licensing system.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I see that the
Minister, the Hon. Mr. Crerar, gave the following explanation in the other House:
The purpose of the Bill is to enable the
Goserisnent, through the Council which administers the Northwest Territories, to exercise a
closer onitrol over the export or movement of
furs froi the Northwest Territories to any of
the provinces.
Abuses in this respect have
developed during the last few years on account
of the increasing number of people going into
the Territories and the augmaented use of aeroplanes for transportation both into and out of
the Territories. Trappers frequently are taken

to their trapping grousnds by aeroplane and are
brought out at the end oif the season by the
same nsethod.
In 1927 the Northwest Territories Act was
amsended ta provide that anyoe taking fors
out of the Territories must obtain a permit. A
year or two later regulations establishing the
charge that would be levied, was passed. This
terreIsionds to the royalties imposed by every
province in Canada on the taking of fors. This
nsethod workcdl very well, luit. as 1 said a
moment ago, the development in acropslane transportation lias led to evasions of the tax. It is
suspected tiat much of the fur is bcing taken
out withoiit the necessary fee being paid.
This Bill secks to overcorne thsis trouble by
applying the principle applied by the Department of National Revenue in connection with
excise collections. Tlere is being added to the
Act a, new section, the first clause of which

reads:

"A judge of the Exciequer Court of Canada
shall grant a writ of assistance tîpon applica-

tion made to hims for tiat purpose by His
Majesty's Attoriey-General of Canada."
That is sinilar to the powers granted in connection with the administration of the Excise
Act, only in that instance the writ of assistance

nay be seetrel from a judge other than a judge
of the Exiequier Court. Under authority of
this writ of assistance the baggage of a passenger w
is suspected of bringing out furs
illegally may be searched. Other provisions
in the ameniment leal with the disposal of the
furs and the vehicle by which they are being
transported. Subsecetion 4 provides that sections
171 to 184. inclusive, of the Customs Act shal
apply. These sections wiould provide for the
disposal of a vehsicle tiat may be impounded.
The necessity of this provision is emphasized by the fact that tiere are practically
only two aeroplane bases at which aeroplanes
from the Northwest Territories would land.
One is at Prince Albert in Saskatchewan and
the other is at Cooking Laite, about fifteen
or eigiteen miles from Calgary. When a
trapper is suspected of bringing out furs illegally, it is impossible to get a reguilar search
warrant to .authorize the search of his luggage
before lie gets away. Once lie gets away, it
is almost impossible to locate him again. Provisions of this Bill would enable prompt action
to be taken.
For the information of the House I nmight
say tiat the total value of the fur catch in
the Northwest Territories for 1935-36, the latest
figures obtainable, was $1.188.000 in round
f~iiies. In 1934-35 the value of the catch was
f1.678.000. At the present time the evele of
the fur catch is low. but several years ago
the valiue of the catch ran over 82000.000.
In 1926-27 the valie waes almost $3,000,000.
Riglt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

The revenue from this fur catch amounted to
$57,000 in 1938.
$105,000, and in

The revenue in 1936 was
1935 it reached the highest

point in any single year. $146,000.
This msatter ias been receiving the attention
of the Department of Justice, the Royal Canadian Mouiited Police

and the Northwest Ter-

ritnries Council, and they liave corne to the
coniiusion that the best method of dealing with

these abuses is by neans of the amendment
te the Act which I an iw asking the House
te adopt.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members. I confess myself confused
and mystified by long years of conflicting
vicarious interpretation and still more conflicting vicarious practices. Though I hesitate to make the suggestion, and I shudder at
the thought-for it is a terrible responsibility to name fraid-this Bill is against
the principles of Liberalism.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: We cean clear
it up this week.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
gentlemen have heard something about the
Padlock Law, and I have heard it mentioned
myself, but here is a padlock law that has all
iedals, belts and records. Under this law
one does not even have to lie accused. The
Governsent is going to authorize its own
servants, without any warrant from a judge,
without any allegation before any judicial
authority, to break into a man's property,
and seize if, under this alleged writ of
assistance, which is really a criminal writ.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Net seize it.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Why, of
course.
Search it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. I wonder
whether the leader of the Government does
not think this should be referred to the Association for the Protection of Civil Liberties
whieh has been organized in Toronto, and
ornamented by the presence of a number of
professors, to protect the people of Quebec
from the laws of their province.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think this
Bill mipht well be submitted to that association.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The association
should be extended to -protect my right
honourable friend and myself. When landing at Quebec I have seen representatives of
the Government demanding our keys for the
purpose of opening our trunks and seeing
what was in them.

359

MAY 19, 1938
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is a
long way from a writ of assistance. This is
just an exemplification of an attitude of
mind that always grows upon a public
officiai. He says: "Give me ahl sorts of
authority. Give me authority to get into
any man's bouse, to search any man's property.
I may not have the slighest reason for doing
so, but I want the authority anyway. And
I want to padlock his property afterwards,
and when the padlocking is ail done we shall
determine his rights." Really, this is a subject for the Association for the Protection of
Civil Liberties, and I invite the professors
to get to work on it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I hope my honourable friend will not sit down before giving
a better alternative for the protection of the
treasury.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
know that there is one here, or at Montreal
or Quebec, but I know the sort of conduct
is exactly the same in ail three cases.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
If my bonourable friend will allow me, I simply want
to draw his attention to a situation 2,000
miles away.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But liberty
is universal.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It is. But
on the wharves at our ports I see customs
agents examining down to the very bottoms
of our trunksRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -to find out
whether we have anything that should be declared. I am not severely shocked at the
thought of Government representatives on
the borders of the Northwest Territories having writs of assistance to enable them to
look into aeroplanes and other vehicles to
sec if there are furs there.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: On the same
principle, would the honourable gentleman
tell us his reaction to the padlock law?
Well, I will
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
not be drawn into that.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Do I understand that
these officials will have this permanent blanket
search warrant?
Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Hon. Mr. COTE: They cannot seize?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Of course
they can.

Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Hon. Mr. COTE: As I read the Bill, it
refers not only to furs, but to anything the
transportation of which is prohibited, and
subsection 3 covers not only the prohibited
article, but also the vehicle or conveyance.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. COTE: They can seize the
aeroplane. As the leader of the Government
explained a moment ago, there are only two
places for aeroplanes to land, and only two
lines operating. I suppose the amendment is
directed against them; and under the authority of this subsection, if passed, the officer,
as I said before, can seize not only furswhich are not mentioned in the Bill-but also
the aeroplane of the stranger.
Can they no,
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
do that now in the case of the customs? They
can seize an automobile or an aeroplane as
well as the things illegally brought into the
country.
Hon. Mr. COTE: I am not saying they
cannot. I had understood they could not.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Only the people who
own the conveyance know whether there are
smuggled goods on board.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable members, the principle in both cases, as I see
it, is exactly the same. Not very long ago
a member of Parliament told me of an incident that occurred in Great Britain. He
had been over in France. On his return he
was dropped at Dover and went through the
customs. He was asked if he had anything
dutiable. He said no. The official examined
his valise and found a bottle of cologne,
and the finding of that bottle of cologne delayed this gentleman to such an extent that
his arrival in London was retarded about six
hours. That officer had the right to search.
For what purpose? To collect duty. It is
the saine in Canada. Dutiable articles of
ail kinds come into Canada, and our officers
must necessarily have the right of search in
order to see that people are not contravening
the law.
Now, what is the situation so far as furs
are concerned? In the old days it was not
easy to bring furs south and dispose of them,
and it took a long time. But to-day trappers
in large sections of the Northwest Territories
are in touch with fur traders and can load
a cargo worth one or two thousand dollars
overnight, or in half an hour, and have it
swished away to an air-port. The whole thing
is done in almost no time.

360

SENATE

As I understand it, there is a royalty on
these furs. I think that a royalty is charged
in all the Western Provinces:
Manitoba,
Saskatchewan and Alberta. Men who trap
and sell furs have to make a report to the
Government of all the furs they handle, and
severe penalties are provided for failure to
do so. Exporting can be done only by persons
who have permits. Back of all this is protection of the fur business: that is the main
object, for the amount of revenue that the
Government can collect from this source is
very small. Naturally, some people endeavour
to escape paying the royalty. So it is desired
to provide means of making certain that the
royalty is paid, just as there are means of
making certain that customs duties are paid.
From what I can see, no more authority is
given to officers under this Bill than has for
many years been exercised by our customs
throughout Canada.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may say that
the three Western Provinces are welcoming
this measure as a protection for theinselves.
Hon. J. E. SINCLAIR: The matter of writs
of assistance has been a live one for many
years. Officers of the Department of National
Revenue are clothed with these writs. We
have had cases in the eastern provinces where
provincial officers wished to be clothed with
the same authority, but this was refused them,
and I think rightly so. Now, I should like
to ask the honourable leader if this measure
proposes the granting of writs of assistance
to others besides officers of a department of
the Federal Government.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: To officers under
the department's control, I understand.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Tiat would probably include officers of the Mounted Police?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: It seems to me that
when a judge of the Exchequer Court grants
a writ of assistance to an officer, under this
Bill, it may be used for other purposes than
checking up on the fur business.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I surmise that
these writs of assistance would be granted
simply for the protection of the federal
treasury; that they would be given only to
officers for the purpose of making searches
to find out if furs were being illegally exported
from the Northwest Territories.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not want
to belabour the thing further, except to say
that our Law Clerk draws a clear distinction
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

between this measure and what the honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) describes
as corresponding powers given to customs
officials. The Law Clerk has frequently made
an argument as to the hazard in importing
into one measure whole pages of another statute, mutatis mutandis, and in this instance
he has made that argument with more
emphasis than I have before noted.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am in agreement with him on that point.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think the
honourable leader would be well advised to
have this Bill referred to an appropriate conmittee, for the purpose of seeing whether it
cannot be put into such form as to remove
all ground for that criticism. Of course there
are bills into which provisions of other statutes can be imported mutatis mutandis, but
the practice of making applicable by mere
reference in one Act certain sections of another Act which is not at all akin is a very
bad one and we should reduce it to the minimum. Unless we do this our legislation will
fall into a chaotic state.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have already
suggested to the department that its legal
adviser get into contact with our Law Clerk,
with a view to curing that defect in this Bill.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable members,
in reading this proposed new subsection 2 of
section 39A, I find it refers not only to furs.
I imagine it would apply to liquor and all
kinds of things. Subsection 2 says:
Under authority of such a writ of assistance
the person named therein may enter . . . any
place . . . in which he lias reason to believe

there exists any thing tIe shipmenit or carriage
whereof from the Territories is prohîibited
conditionally or otherwise by any Act of Canada
or Ordinance of the Territories, and may search
for any such thing and may seize any such
thing there found.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My attention is
drawn to the fact that the explanatory note
refers to furs only. Those are what the department is concerned about.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That section could
apply to anything the export of which from
the Territories is prohibited. It does not apply
to imports.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

FARMERS' CREDITORS
ARRANGEMENT BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Farris, the Senate
went into Committee on Bill 25, an Act ta
amend The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement
Act.
Hon. Mr. Duif i the Chair.
On section 1, subsection 1-interpretatian,
"Creditor":
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourable senators,
I find it hard sometimes ta follow explanations
of statutes given hy honourable members who
are lawyers, but I make an exception as ta
the right honourable leader on the other side
(Right Hon. Mr, Meighen), whase 6tatements
are comparatively easy for me ta understand.
I wish ta ask some questions about this Bill,
but I cannot of course express thern in legal
terminolagy. If the right hanourable leader
opposite will give me the desired information,
I personally shaîl be deeply grateful ta him.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
gentleman can get information directly from
the honourable senator fram Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris), who is sponsoring the Bill.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I tried ta follow
the honourahle senator from Vancouver South
yesterday, but I could nat understand him
very well. That was my fault, af course.
As a rule, though, I can understand the
right hanourable leader on the other side.
It seems ta me that the amendment proposed in the first paragraph of this Bill
would place the creditor of a farmer in a
worse position than he is under the existing
law. 1 have read some of the comments made

in another place, and have gat the impression that honourahle members of that House
would like ta impraxe the present law; that
they consider it is pretty severe on the
creditor. as a rule, even when it is well administered. And when it is not well administered,

as is the case in some provinces, the injustice
is all the greater. I cannot imagine why the
Parliament of Canada, with ahl the knawledge

at its disposaI, should make the law warse
than it is already.
I shahl have ta oppose this proposed amendment with every means in my power. I
believe that if any changes at ail are made,
they should be with a view ta putting the
creditor in a far better position than he
stands now.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR:

Hear, hear. He

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I hope sa, but I
do flot understand this amendment ta have
that abject.
I thank
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
the hanourable member for his compliment.
Presumably the reasan that my law is maore
easily understaad is that there is less of it.
Han. Mr. HUGHES: It is simpler.
And then, my
Han. Mr. DANDURAND:
right honaurable friend (Right Han. Mr.
Meighen) was the ariginatar of the law.
Riglit Han. Mr. METOHEN: Yes. I arn
nlot trying ta shirk any responsibility in that
respect.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: And I myseif vated
for the law, thinking it was ail right.
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: The hanoui-able senatar fram King's (Han. Mr.
Hughes) is right in painting out that this
sectian daes strengthen the positian of the
debtar as against his creditors, for the reason
that creditors of one class wha hitherta have
nat corne within the provisions of the Act,
and therefare have had their former rights intact, are naw braught within these provisions. Sa their fate will henceforth be the
saine as that of other creditors. That is ta
say, a man wha lent money on the securîty
of a farm mortgage and holds that mortgage
after the origin~al martgagor has sold the
praperty ta another farmer. is placed in the
same position as if he had lent directly ta
this second farmer.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: He is compelled ta
be creditor ta a man whom he perhaps would
nat trust at ail.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. He
is brought within the ternis of the Act and
compelled ta take whatever disposition is
finally made of this second farmer's assets
by the Board of Review.
I have strong hopes that we can see the
end of the road for this legislation. I do not
know where in Canada, at least in Eastern
Canada. the Act has friends; and I do not
know why it should have friends. It is easy,
of course, ta, criticize the application of a
law with which one bas nothing ta do, and

the judges sitting in review do the best they

the security which they were shrewd enough
to insist upon getting is wrested from their
hands and divided up among a lot of other
people.
This all illustrates what seems to me now
a well establi-hed principle. although I certainly did not realize it years ago. It is that
you cannot treat with farmers under the
ordinary principles of bankruptcy the same
as you can treat with merchants.
The
merchant is usually a tenant; he is doing business. and his business is his all. The farmer
is an owner and a mortgagor. In his case
liens and all sorts of things exist. He is
engaged in an occupation which has its ups
and downs; which varies with the weather,
with the seasons and with the times; which
bas long depressions and sudden recoveries.
That state of affairs does not lend itself to
bankruptv disposition as between him and
his creditors.
I urge the Government to geit rid of this
Act as fast as possible. I am doing so merely
on ny own responsibility, not as leader on
this side of the House. nor in any other
capacity thant simply as a citizen who is interested in the welfarc of his country. I can
couple with that advice the suggestion that
there arc still possibly sorne cases in the
West where worthy application can be made
for assistance under this legislation, though
I doubt very much that there are. But just
imagine thousands of cases coming from a
province of the size of Prince Edward Island!
It is almost unbelievable.
Prince Edward
Islanders, of all people, know what a debt
means, and what it is to pay a debt.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: They did once.
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: But we have
set out to teach them that that doctrine is al]
wrong. Indeed, we have set out to teach the
whole of Canada that. And I beg that the
lesson be ended.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: I should like to ask
my right honourable friend a question. Does
he know how many farmers would have been
put off their land in Manitoba alone but for
this law? I can tell him that there would
have been a lot of them.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHIEN: Yes, but
probably better ones would have come on.
Land will not be worked if it cannot be made
to pay. No creditor, unless be be a madman,
would put an efficient farmer off the land.
His only interest is served by keeping an
efficient man on his land; it cannot be served
in any other way. The tendencv of this legislation has been to keep the inefficient maan on.,
and thereby prevent the efficient matn from

operation.

Such is my experience of its

Hon. Mr. SHARPE: It is not mine.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
doubt there are thousands of men who would
not be on the land but for the Farmers'
Creditors Arrangement Act. I do not go so
far as to say there are not worthy men on
the land who would be off it but for the Act,
but those are cases where the creditors would
be unwise-and creditors can be unwise just
the same as other persons. But, take it by
and large, I think the Act works out for the
protection of the inefficient, and particularly
for the protection of those whose chief interest is to find some method of getting away
from their obligations rather than adjusting
themselves to the task of meeting them.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Honourable members,
from mv experience of the operation of the
Act. I think I am safe in saying that from 80
to 90 per cent of the cases were settled before
they came to the Board of Review.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: With some hesitation
I venture to express the hope that honourable
members ran follow what I am saying.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: The present statute
has operated in fact as this Bill now proposes
that it shall operate in law, particularly in
Ontario and Manitoba.
The boards have
dealt with cases between mortgagor and
mortgagee where the land had been sold to
a third party, and the orders made in those
cases will be validated by this proposed
legislation. As soon as this Bill becomes law,
in all the provinces where the Act continues
to be operative, the boards may proceed as
most boards have in fact proceeded in the
past.
I may say the department bas furnished
me with the information that approximately
34,000 proposals have been submitted.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: When?

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Yes. Of those 34,000
proposals the boards of review have rejected
5.000. In 15.184 cases voluntary arrangements
have been made. The boards of review have
dealt with 28.000 cases. The department
estimates that the debts of those 34,000 farmers
aggregate $200.000.000 as against a total farm
value of $136.000.000. It is only fair to point

MAY 19, 1938
out that while the applications may strike
one as somewhat numerous, they involve only
2 per cent of the farmers of Canada.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I suppose the
valuation of the farms takes into account only
the real estate.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: It does not take
into account stock and implements, nor household furniture.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: That is true. The
information which I find on the file-I did
not have it in mind at the moment-shows
the total value of farms and stock, which
would include fixtures and everything, is less
by a considerable amount than the total debts.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Suppose the vendor
under agreement for sale sold his land to a
farmer at 75 bushels per acre, and then the
farmer sold the land for 85 bushels per acreAn Hon. SENATOR: Dollars?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: It does not matter
whether it is dollars or bushels. This happens
to be a case of land sale by bushels. Under
the law there is no privity of contract between
the second purchaser and the original vendor.
Under this definition would the second
purchaser be a debtor of the first vendor?
In other words, would there be privity of
contract between them?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Only for the purpose
of enabling the board to make an adjustment.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I take it, then, the
board could adjust the agreement for sale
between the second purchaser and his vendor,
and also on the same application could adjust
the agreement for sale between the first
purchaser and bis vendor?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I should not think so
as between the sales by A to B and B to C.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: By agreement for
sale?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: By agreement for sale.
C bas the property with a charge against it
for the money he owes to B. But I should
not think this section would confer any power
to deal with the contractual arrangements
between A and B.
Hon. CREELMAN MacARTHUR: Have
not some boards of review adjusted such cases
just as if there had been privity of contract?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Yes.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Then if this
amending legislation is not enacted there will
be a terrible mix-up. We do not want this

363

legislation, but I do not see how we can help
it if we are to put those cases on a legal
footing.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: That is one of the
purposes of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: But those boards
of review should not have taken that course.
There was no legal justification for it.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: It is easy to be wise
after the event. The Court of Appeal of
Ontario held that there was no such authority
as the boards of review assumed they had.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: The Act of 1934
was conceivedHon. Mr. HUGHES: In iniquity and
brought forth in sin.
Hon. Mr. M-acARTHUR: And shortsightedness. There has been no business
management in the administration of the
Act. The administrator should at least have
instructed the various boards of review so
as to secure uniformity of practice in all the
provinces. He could have done this by
circular letter or by arranging for a meeting
at some central point. He should have told
them to apply the Act only when there was
insolvency.
In Prince Edward Island, as the rig-ht honourable leader on the other side (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen) bas stated, many of our
farmers and other debtors have lived up to
their obligations. They have always recognized
that they have to pay their debts instead of
getting rid of them through legalized robbery.
I am glad to say we have many thrifty farmers on the Island. Naturally, the thriftless
ones took advantage of the Act and secured
relief. It is a wonder more did not do so,
for it was understood that they would get a
50 per cent reduction of their debts. As I
remarked yesterday, we had on the board a
farmer who was supposed to be a representative of the creditors, but he turned out to be
very much biased in favour of the debtor,
and the other two members were both for the
debtor every time. There were a few good
decisions; you might call them isolated
cases. The board even advertised that it
would 'hold sittings at various points to save
applicants travelling expenses. A member of
a very large firm in my home town bas had so
many cases adjusted to his detriment that
he refuses now to go before the board. And
other merchants have had good reason to
complain of their treatment, the chairman
having referred to them as selfish creditors.
A young advocate who came before the board
was admonished for looking after the interests

364

of bis "selfish clients." That is why it is
called the Soviet Board down there.
1 amrn ot worrying about the farmers in my
province, for I arn satisfied that inside of a
montb after this Bill is passed we shall have a
proclamation deelaring that this legisiation
shall no longer bc applicable to Prince Edward Island.
lion. J. J. DONNELLY: Like the honourable member from Manitou (lion. Mr.
Sharpe), I know of cases where the arrangements were very satisfactory and would, in a
measure, justify those who were instrumental
in bringing the Act into force. But, speaking for the farmers as a whole, not only in
0Ontario 'but ail over Canada, I believe the
iojury caused to their credit is mucb greater
than any possible iaenefit from the continued
operation of the Act.
I notice section 8 provides that after a date
to be fixed by proclamation no ncw applications shahl be considered in any province in
respect of which the proclamation is issued.
I should be pleased to see thc Act so amended
that af ter the passing of this Bill no new
applications shaîl be considered in any part
of Canada.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. DýONNELLY: 1 might say that
by reason of the injury to the credit of the
farmers of Canada the Act was amended about
two years ago so as not to apply to any debts
contracted after the lst of May, 1936.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: 0f 1935, except with
the consent of the creditors.
lion. Mr. DONNELLY: But that bas not
very rnuch helped the credit of our farmers.
Tlhere are, a large oumber of mortgages still
in Pe:.î-tene that w'ere enitered into previnus
te 1935. At tbe pre-ent time, with the threat
of the Act hianging over~ them, it is impossible
to dispose of such rnortgag-es exce.pt at a
very cornsidcrable discount. If it were known
that aIl far-m mortgages arc as secure as
thev were fif[cen or twenty years ago-and
as I hope tbcy will be again-it would bave a
gond effeot on the credit of the farmers of
Cana da.
But it is net only the debtor farmers who
should be cnnsidered. In Ontario we bave
in ur soahl communities careful people who
save their money and would like to find a
good investment, and thev prefer mortgages.
L'ndcr the operation of the Act that class of
business bias been discrrdited. Farmers who

their savings in farm mortgages, by reason
of the operation of the Act. In ry opinion
the continuance of the Act would be very
prejudicial nlot only to our farmers. but also
to thrifty persons who wish to invest their
savings in farm mortgage securities, but caoneot do so under present, conditions.
Hon. J. T. HAIG: lionourable senators,
frorn Prince Edward Islaod and from Ontario,
and Quebec have spoken of the operation
of the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act
in their respective provinces. I shahl now
describe its operation in Manitoba.
Two
years ago in my province there was a complete lack of nptimism amnng the farming
community. Last year we had a fine crop and
received a high price for it, and to-day you
do ot need to be told, you cao senýe, that
there is a spirit of optimisrn airnnng our
farmers. Tbey regard the future witb bigb
bopes. But I co'uld stand bere this afternoon
and tell vou by the hour of cases in Manitoba
wbere, if it had nt been for the Farmers'
Creditors Arrangement Act. many farmers
xvnrld have been driven off their land.
There is in Manitoba a coodition similar
te tlaat which the honourable senator from
South Bruce (Hon. Mr. Donnelly) mentions
as existing io Ontario, farmers baving lent
money to neigbhbouring- farmers, aod it was
the mortgagces in those cases who gave iqs
trouble. IÉ was nut the financial, rnurtgage,
life insurance or trust companies.
The successful operation of the Act depends
on one thing. the Board of Review, aod the
bonnurable senators from Prince
Edward
Island have revealed what may happen under
a weak board. Jo Maoitoba. we bave for the
most part been ver:v happy in having a very
able Board of Review.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: It bias donc a real service
for the province. I cao say quite ennfidently
tbat von cannot find more thao fifty cases in
the whole province where any boan, trust or
mortgage cernpany lias any complaint to make
at aIl. The complaints corne from another
class alto.-ether. I refer te the local merchaot,
the implement dealer, the garage man, the
doctor, and ail others whn supply the needs
of the farmers in our rural towns. Under
this Act thev have. withi very few exceptions. beeo wiped eut entirely. Their only
salvation bias been in the ruling- of the board
that the value of the hive stock and cattle
owned by the farmer should ho set aside to
s îtifv un..ecîîred
rehtr.To
that extent
there bas been anme relief.

MAY 19, 1938
But Manitoba does not need this law any
more. The trouble in Manitoba was caused
by the action of the Government. I am Dot
criticizing it for what it did, but I think it
made a serious mistake when, in trying to eut
down the cost of the administration, it placed
registrars, who under the previous Government
got $150 a month whether there was one application or a hundred, on the basis of $10 or
$15 per application.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Twenty dollars if a
settlement was made, and $15 if it was not.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: You refer to the
official receivers?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes. Well, what happened
in Manitoba? More official receivers were
appointed in certain districts, and they, directly
or indirectly, went out and canvassed other
people to come under the Act.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Sure.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: A client of mine at
Wadena, Saskatchewan, had sold his farm for
$6,000 under a crop payment plan in the focrm
of an option. The purchaser wanted the
amount cut down, and my client received - a
letter saying: "You have a claim against this
farm for $6,000. Unless you cut it down I will
go to the board." Fortunately my client had
only given an option; so I wrote to the
receiver, and the reply I received was, "I guess
the man who did the canvassing made a
mistake."
It is the system of receivers that has caused
the real trouble in Manitoba. The honourable
member from Manitou (Hon. Mr. Sharpe) was
quite correct in what he said. When the Act
first came into force it again created a spirit
of optimism in the province. If honourable
gentlemen had seen some of the incidents I
have seen, they would know what I mean by
that. I have had men from farms come into
my office and break down. When they do that,
you know their backbone is gone. That is
what happened in Manitoba.
If the honourable member from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) will look up the
records he will find that only during the last
two years have these matters been going to
the Board of Review; and in almost every
case there bas been no justification at all for
the application. During the first few years
there were many proposals and settlements
made in the province. In 1920 a farmer living
about 25 miles south of Winnipeg bought
two sections of land, 1,280 acres, for which
he agreed to pay $30 an acre, in all about
$40,000. He farmed that land with his sons.
In 1936 he still owed $35,000 on it, but the
land, with all the improvements which had

365

been made, was then worth, at best, only about
$20,000. So he made a proposal, and the creditor came in to me. I said, "What is the land
worth?" He said, "$20,000." I said, "Why do
you not settle on that basis?" That is what
he did, and now he is glad of it, and that farm
to-day is the home of the man who had
bought it, and of his boys.
As far as Manitoba is concerned, I wish a
date were set, say the lst of January next,
after which no more applications would be
received. Meantime the Government should
cut down the number of receivers, put them
on a monthly salary, and stop this payment
of $15 per application. If that were done it
would wipe out this abominable system of
canvassing.
My honourable friend from
Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) is familiar
with the racket that was carried on under the
Bankruptcy Act in Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba, and knows how men were sent out to get
people to make assignments. The same sort
of thing bas been occurring under this Act.
In Manitoba and Saskatchewan the canvassers
have gone to people to induce them to come
under it. For that reason I say a date should
be set after which no more applications would
be received, and I suggest the 1st of January,
1939. If that is done, the situation will be
automatically cleared up.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable members,
there is one other suggestion that I think
may be worth considering. I have always
been surprised that this law was made effective
in provinces like Nova Scotia, New Brunswick,
Prince Edward Island, Ontario and Quebec.
We all realize that conditions in those
provinces are entirely different from those
prevailing in the Prairie Provinces. The
Prairie Provinces have suffered from a great
calamity, which has extended over a long
period of years, and without this law the
situation would have been terrible.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Why should the law
be left in force in, say, Prince Edward Island?
My suggestion is that the Government of
Prince Edward Island, should be allowed to
decide whether the law is to remain in force
there. If it is decided that it should not, the
law could then be changed accordingly. The
same thing could be done in the other
provinces.
My honourable friend the junior member
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) has said
that this law is no longer required in
My recollection is that the
Manitoba.
province of Saskatchewan has a law-if I am
wrong I can be corrected by some of the

366

SENATE

members from that province-which very
largely takes the place of this measure.
Is that not so?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: No.
It is not
compulsory. There is what is called the Debt
Adjustment Act, which prevents creditors
from taking action against debtors, and there
is a voluntary debt adjustment plan, under
which government officials can say to the
creditor, "If you do not make an agreement
with the debtor you cannot foreclose your
mortgage."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It seems to me
that the province of Prince Edward Island,
with its limited representation in the House
of Commons and the Senate, could have its
members get together and go to the Minister
of Finance to ask that it be exempted from the
operation of this Act.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That is possible under
the law as it stands?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The last section
of the Bill says:
On and after a date to be fixed by proclaniation of the Governor in Council, no new
proposal shall be made or filed by any farmer
or accepted by any Official Receiver in any
provmce im respect of which the said proclamation is issued.
So applications in Prince Edward Island can
be done away with immediately, and I would
simply idvise our friends from that province
to miake their demand. I am quite sure they
would be well received. The sane thing could
be donc in the cases of Ontario and Quebec,
ani perhaps of New Brunswick and Nova
Scotia. The Minister of Finance has heard
the whole story in the House of Commons,
and he could gradually exempt the provinces
frem the operation of the Act.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I apologize. I did net
know that provision was in the Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: I do not sec
why Prince Edward Island should be favoured.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I mentioned
Prince Edward Island particularly because it
has so few members. Thcy could gather
together and speak for the whole Island.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I only want
to emphasize wbat was said by the honourable senator to my right (lion. Mr. Donnelly)
as to the harm that is being done and the
penalty that we are paying for this kind of
legislation.
Everyone is siffering unnecessarily. A man's reputation niay bc surh tat
hardly anything can destroy his cilit. bot
if he is in extremis it is gone. Surh mon
havc come to me and complained bitterly.
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

I was very glad to hear the figures given by
the honourable senator from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris). They are exceedingly
interesting. It is some relief to know that
only two per cent have applied.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I should have said
two and a half per cent.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But let us
keep this in mind. In Canada as a whole
the proportion of farmers who 'throughout the
years have had to make some compromise
with their creditors would be far greater.
In the West it would be many times that
figure. This all goes to show the great mass
of compositions took place without the Act.
What the honourable the junior senator from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) says is correct.
It is not the mortgage company, but the individual mortgagee, who is likely to insist
upon securing the pound of flesh, feeling
that ultimately his security may be good.
The mortgage company. which is more experienced, makes a settlement and makes it
quickly. The whole number of cases that
would net be settled but for this Act would
be small in comparison with the damage clone
to the credit of the farmers. and still smaller
in comparison with the damage done to thoir
morale.
I have not another word to say. I am
quite concerned to have the whole responsibility for the legislation rest on me. My
previous judgment was wrong.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I want to thank
the honourable the leader of the Government
for his suggestion as te a solution in Prince
Edward Island. If it is put into effect and
the members from that province in both
Houses, barring the Minister of Finance, form
a delegation. two will be against the Act and
the rest will be for it, notwithstanding all
the noise.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The proposed addition to the Act is this:
On and after a date to be fixed by proclamation of the Governor in Council, ononew
proposal shall be made or filed by any farmer
or accepted by an Official Receiver iu any
province in respect of which the said proclamation is issued.
That still leaves it in the hands of the
Governoment te issue tie pioclanation. It seems
to me that it should not be left ther; that
if a province is of the opinion the law should
cease to operaite within its houndaries. and the
necessary action is taken by the LieutenantGovernor in Coîncil of tliat province, the law
should automatCiclly
cnse there.
That
is. it should not be left to the officials of the
Frd:al tGovernment to say when the terminatibn of this law shall be brought about.

MAY 19, 1938
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I think that in Alberta we prefer to have the law as it is, for
obvious reasons.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I doubt very
much that what is proposed by my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Calder) would effect
his purpose, because it places the federal and
provincial authorities on a common ground,
and there might be some difficulty in getting
the provincial authorities to take a position
on this matter. This is essentially a federal
law, and it is for the representatives of the
provinces within the halls of Parliament to
take action.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That is quite possible.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Honourable senators,
after listening to the explanation given by the
honourable senator from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris) I have come to the conclusion that several of the judgments or decisions given by the boards of review were
faulty, contrary to justice and perhaps to common law. Yet this Parliament is now asked to
legislate to make such decisions valid.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Under these
judgments there has been a liquidation, a
settlement, which has established a new set
of conditions from which you cannot escape.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Besides validating
what has happened in the past, we are making
that kind of thing possible in the future.
In other words, we are making bad law good
law; we are justifying injustice. If we stopped
with the evil already done, it would not be
so bad. Surely Parliament will not pass
legislation of this kind. It is in the same
field as the legislation they have in Alberta.
The honourable senator who leads the House
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) made a suggestion,
and my honourable friend from Queen's (Hon.
Mr. Sinclair) said it would not work. No, it
will not work in that province because there
is a great deal of nepotism there in connection with this matter.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would draw
attention to the fact that the Minister of
Finance is from that province.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: But he has no relations there.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: He is a free
agent there.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: And some people
are doing well under this Act at the expense
of other people, particularly of the retail
country merchants, who have carried on under

367

distressing circumstances for many years and
have helped the farmer in every way possible.
Creditors are now haled before a board and
their assets are cut down and payment extended over a period of years. There is
really a great deal of hardship in connection
with this law. But what I wanted to bring
out was that if it were not for the family
compact which we have in Prince Edward
Island there would be some chance of carrying out the suggestion of the leader of the
Government.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: I notice that my
honourable friend from Queen's (Hon. Mr.
Sinclair) bas left his seat. I knew that his
opinion in this matter was contrary to my
own. I am satisfied, however, that I have
behind me all the best farmers as well as
practically all the creditors. The honourable
senator spoke about two making a noise. There
will be more noise made if the Minister of
Finance does not listen to the two members
rather than to the other four or five. If
we had here the other member from King's
county (Hon. John A. Macdonald, Cardigan),
I think he would make more noise than any
of us, for it was his questions which elicited
the information showing the cost of administration was so heavy, the administrator getting $1,800 or $2,000, and the man in charge
getting about $6,000 a year for driving around
the country and having a good time. It is no
wonder that some people want this law continued. They may have ulterior reasons.
It has been suggested that we should provide definitely for the termination of this
legislation on the lst of January next. I
say we should do no such thing. We all
know what happened when the honourable
senator from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Black)
brought up the question of the low rates
charged for Government annuities. The publicity given to the discussion of that question
caused a stampede. Because that procedure
was followed instead of a quiet and businesslike one, the Government lost money. The
fact that the rates charged for annùities were
too low was advertised all over the country,
with the result that the Annuities Branch
was flooded with applications from people
who wanted to take out policies before the
rates were raised. There was a loss to the
federal treasury because of too much talking
in the Senate. If the present Bill is amended so as to fix a definite date after which no
new proposals shall be filed or accepted, there
will be a rush of applications in the meantime. The Minister should have power to
withdraw the Act without any advance publicity; and the sooner it is withdrawn the
better it will be for the country.

368

SENATE

I have been for some time an observer of
what goes on in Parliament, and I must say
that I cannot understand why some things
are done as they are. This Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act is one of these things.
I have been in business a good many years,
but I have never tried to borrow money
without wanting to pay it back.
It may be asked why the Legislature of
Prince Edward Island bas not requested that
this legislation be made inapplicable to our
province. Well, that Legislature does not sit
very long, and it prorogued some weeks ago.
Jn any event, most of the members represent rural constituencies, and it would be
pretty awkward for any of them to vote
against the interests of farmers. Besides, the
Minister bas asked for power to terminate
the Act, and it would be useless to suggest
that the Legislature should do anything about
this. The Legislature did not demand the
law, nor even request it. It was brought in
by the Federal Government and made to
apply to every province, and then our farmers
took advantage of it. As has already been
pointed out. the effect is that thrifty farmers,
those wbo have enough independence and
self-respect not to ask for a composition, are
penalized, while the thriftless are bonused.
The Minister of Finance represents one of
the ridings in Prince Edward Island, and I
have spoken to him about this matter several
times. He knows all about it, and he says
it is a headache. It certainly is a headache
in my province.
The administrator of the
Act says there are ten times as many complaints about it from my province as from
all the rest of Canada. I hope we shall not
have to wait until the first of January, 1939,
to be relieved of this law, but that there
will be a proclamation early in the summer
making it inapplicable to Prince Edward
Island, at least.
Subsection 1 of section 1 was agreed to.
Subsections 2, 3 and 4 of section 1 were
agreed to.

PRIVATE BILLS
NIAGARA

FALLS OBSERVATION BRIDGE COMPANY-SEOOND READING

Hon. W. H. MeGUIRE moved the second
reading of Bill 15, an Act to incorporate
Niagara Falls Observation Bridge Company.
He said: Honourable members, this Bill
bas for its object the incorporation of a company, to be owned by the Province of Ontario,
for co-operating with a similar company to
be incorporated by the United States Congress, the purpose being that both companies
shall form a board to build and maintain a
bridge between Niagara Falls in Ontario and
Niagara Falls in New York State. The intention is to have the structure run from
virtually the centre of the river side of
each city. The measure is an important one.
To begin with, each of the cities is of considerable size, the one on the Canadian side
having a population of about 25,000, and the
other a population of about 60,000. At the
present time there is what is known as the
Lower Arch Bridge, which runs from the north
ends of the cities.
Motor traffic in this section is very heavy.
As honourable members know, Niagara Falls
is still the Mecca for tourists. The district
on the New York State side is controlled by
a park commission; and that on the Canadian side is under the jurisdiction of a similar
body, known as the Queen Victoria-Niagara
Falls Park Commission, which was created
long ago and 'has 'been a credit to Canada.
Incidentally, the Canadian commission owns
property to the value of about $5,000,000, as
is shown by its late reports. The larger falls
and, in my opinion, the finer park, are on the
Canadian side. These commissions estimate
that more than ten million persons visit
Niagara Falls every year. Most visitors want
to view the falls from both sides of the river,
and the only means of crossing the river there
is by a bridge, unless one takes an aeroplane.
I have referred to the heavy motor traffic
in the district. It presents a peculiar problem,
because most tourists drive around very
slowly or park their cars while taking in the
various sights. Besides, the great highways
of New York State and Ontario centre in that

MAY 19, 1938 district. A great deal of traffic from Toronto
to New York, Boston to Detroit, and so on,
passes through there. So the problem is one
that requires special consideration.
The board, which is to be composed of the
company appointed by the United States
Congress and the company incorporated here,
will be half Canadian and half American.
It will have the duty of deciding upon what
type of bridge shall be built. The structure
will be necessarily rather expensive. Bridges
are part of the highways system, as they
always have been, but this one will have
to accommodate very heavy traffic, as I have
intimated. Besides, as a bridge which provides a crossing over an international boundary, it will have some special features.
Accommodation must be provided on it for
customs and
countries.

immigration

officials

of both

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Space must be
provided on the bridge for them, but the
company does not supply the accommodation.
Hon. Mr. McGUIRE: The necessary space
has to be provided, as the honourable gentleman says. Besides, the matter of approaches
is a serious one, much more important than
it used to be prior to the tremendous increase
in motor traffic. The approaches to such a
bridge are of almost as much importance as
the bridge itself.
I wish to call attention of honourable
members to the fact that some years ago,
at the time AI. Smith came into power,
the State of New York adopted a policy of
public ownership of all highways, bridges,
water-powers, parks and so forth. That policy
has remained in effeet. The Province of
Ontario has now stated that its policy also is
the public ownership of bridges. Provision
is made in the Bill whereby the part of the
bridge located in the United States will be
conveyed to the State of New York, and the
part located in the Dominion of Canada will
be conveyed to the Province of Ontario,
without cost or expense, when the corporate
obligations of the two companies have been
retired. I think the only way to get the
bridge built is through the incorporation of
these companies and their working together
on the project. I know that written complaints have been made to Parliament by
the company which owned the bridge that
was destroyed by the ice last winter. One of
these complaints reached me, although it was
not addressed to me. But it is my belief that
the various problems connected with the whole
matter can be solved only by joint action of
the two corporations.

369

I notice that the application to the American
Congress is for incorporation of a company
for the purpose of building or purchasing a
bridge or bridges. The company that owned
the old bridge has another one, of a rather
light type, about eight miles further down
the river, at Lewiston and Queenston. As thw,
company has been for a number of years i.
bankruptcy, and still is, it appears to me that
possibly it might dispose of its assets to the
new corporations which are to be owned by
the State of New York and the Province of
Ontario, although, of course, I do not know
what the policy of the New York corporation
would be in this matter.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Has the old company
any vested rights there?
Hon. Mr. McGUIRE: I presume so.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask the
honourable senator a question? What about
the statement which appears in the press of
to-day, I think, that the company whose
bridge fell down last winter is going ahead,
without getting any permission, to build a
better and safer bridge?
Hon. Mr. McGUIRE: The problem of a
new bridge at Niagara Falls is a very important
one. The claim is made for Niagara Falls,
Ontario, that it is the front door of Canada,
and there is a good deal of truth in that.
More strangers come to see Canada for the
first time at Niagara Falls than at any other
place.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Can the honourable
gentleman hazard a guess by way of answer
to my question?
Hon. Mr. McGUIRE: I could answer the
honourable senator's question completely, I
think. I do not wish to go into the problems
of this other company, as it is not directly
before us. It is my intention to move that
this Bill be referred to the Railway Committee,
where I am sure there will be discussion of
the various details. I read an article about
the bridge in the press to-day. I may say
that I have received a letter from a member
of the Legislature of New York State, expressing anxiety of business men for a new bridge
to be erected at an early date. I have also
received to-day copy of a statement made
at Washington this week by Congressman
Andrews, of New York.
As I understand, the bridge that fell down
was built on a site selected about seventy

years ago. It is stated that the new bridge
will not be built just there, because in the

first place that is too close to the falls,

51958-24
REVISED EDITION

370

.SENATE

and, in the second place, the American end
of thtt site. is exactly where the discharge
of water from the Niagara Falls Power Company goes into the gorge. Some time age,
when the foundation on that side was being
repaired, the Niagara Falls Power Company
had to stop operations.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Should these
details as to location not be examined ie
cornrittee rather than in this House?
Hon. Mr. McGUIRE: Absolutely; but sorne
honourable rncmbers asked me for particulars.
The former bridge was erected right across
the gorge, and, as ail honourable senators
know. tHie riv er banks are rocky and precipitous. The aiîthority to build. on the Canadian side is vested in a company known as
the Clifton Bridge Company, incorporated in
1892 by the Parliament of Canada. That
company wvill have to corne back here to
secure approval for the building of any new
bridge.
I arn satisfied no bridge will be
erected on the old site. The abutments of
any non' bridge will have te be on the level
land above the gorge, and. it being a larger
and stronger bridge. greater space will be
needcd. The Clifton Bridge Company bas only
a sm-tii amouint, of property on the land above
the brink, of the precipice. It caninot acquire
any more on the Canadian side, because
îmrncdiatelv opposite is the station of the
Canadian National llailways, and also the
Oakes theatre, owned by the Niag-ara Falls
Park Commission.
The new~ bridge with the approaches I have
indicated will bave, te lie put up wbere there
is sufficient space for their erection. My own
vie.w is that when the two companies are
incorporated and gct together and appoint
their directors. hiaîf Canadians and baîf
Amnericans, thcey will deal fairly with everybody. At best. it will take them a long, time
te erect a nen' bridge, but there is very
great public necessity for it.
Hon. Mr. MULLINS:
I should like te
knon' wliother the superstructure is te be of
steel or cornent. and whether the material
and labour will be Canadian or American.
Hon. Mr. McGUIRE: I may say the Bill
requires that such material as can be shail
be purcbased in Canada, and that where
poz:ibJe Canadian labour shaîl be engaged.
As te the design cf the bridge, I have seen
varieus suggestions. In my opinion it ie the
greatest bridge site in the werld, bar none.
There is ne other bridge over wbich $0 many
rnotorists n'ill paýýs, and ne other place that

see whether the members of the Special Railway Committee are not public-spirited enough
to attend their committee on Tuesday morning. They were selected as members of that
committee because of their public spirit, and
I think they should live up to their reputation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We might try
that, but not next week.
Hon. Mr. GREEN: I submit, honourable
members, that the motion made by the acting chairman of the Banking and Commerce
Committee (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) should be
agreed to. The Bill has been considered in
the House and by the committee for weeks
together. All the objections raised have been
combated in the committee. The committee's
report is virtually unanimous. The Bill will
have to go back to the House of Commons,
and, as it is sponsored by a private member,
there will be but a limited time for it to be
dealt with there. I hope not only that the
motion will carry, but that honourable members will go further and give the Bill second
reading to-night.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Carried.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Has the honourable member from Edmonton leave to withdraw his motion?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I am not interested
in any way in the measure, but I happen to be
chairman of the committee bringing in the
report. The honourable gentleman from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) has made a reasonable request, and I have no objection to it.
However, if my seconder (Hon. Mr. Green)
does not approve, perhaps other honourable
members will express their views.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I desire to support
the request of the honourable gentleman from
Parkdale. I wish to look into the Bill myself.
I think there is no occasion for hurry. It might
well stand over for consideration at the next
sitting of the House.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Monday evening.
The motion stands.

FARMERS' CREDITORS
ARRANGEMENT BILL
MOTION FOR THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND, for Hon. Mr.
Farris, moved the third reading of Bill 25, an
Act to amend the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I would ask the
honourable leader of the House to allow this
motion to stand until Wednesday next. Several honourable senators are interested in the
Bill, and Mr. O'Connor, the Law Clerk of
the Senate, has been requested to examine it
to see whether it cannot be improved. I
need not enter into details at the present
time. The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement
Act is a very unpopular measure and has
caused considerable harm throughout the country. I know that is so in the province of
Quebec, and from what we have heard in this
House it is evident that its effect has been
very harmful in other provinces. I think the
prospect of improving the Bill justifies postponement of the present motion for fortyeight hours. I am making this request not
only for myself, but also on behalf of other
interested members.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have no objection to complying with the request of the
honourable gentleman. I may say that the
original Act which we are seeking to improve
by this amended Bill has been on the Statute
Book since 1934. Its operation will cease on
a certain date. Some ask that that date be
advanced, others that it be retarded. The Act
having already produced virtually all its effects,
good and bad, according to honourable members who have described its operation, is it
opportune for us now to try to amend it
radically?

SENATE

Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Honourable senators, I should like to support the suggestion
of the honourable senator froin Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien). The sponsor of this
Bill (Hon. Mr. Farris) is not present.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
to the suggestion.

I have agreed

Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: I know, but the
sponsor of the Bill tried to rush it through
last Thursday, and had it net been for the
honourable member from Montarville it would
have gone through. There are some very
pertinent questions to be asked of the honourable member from Vancouver South (Hon.
Mr. Farris) about his appearance before the
Privy Council and his contention that the
Act was ultra vires. He did not want it applied to the province of British Columbia. Now
he comes forward with a measure amplifying
the Act, and we desire to know where we
stand. I think the honourable member from
Montarville is perfectly right in asking to have
t his order deferred, and I may say it is likely
that on Wednesday the discussion will be postponied further. because we are not going to
let the third reading pass without understanding the exact situation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I take it that
the honourable gentleman has clear views as
to the manner in which the Bill should be
.amended. If he has, I hope he will comnunicate them to me before Wednesday, so
that I may be able to answer him.
On
Wednesday I shall take charge of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: I have been here
since Thursday last, and have been unable
to find either the honourable senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) or the
honourable leader on this side (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) in order to suggest a system of
compromise which would meet with the approval of the Minister of Finance and the
House of Commons. This Bill cannot go
through as it is.
The motion stands.

SHOP CARDS REGISTRATION BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 22, an Act respecting the
Registration of Shop Cards by Labour Unions.
He said: I presume that honourable senators have read this short Bill and the explanatory notes that appear therewith, but I desire
to make the following statement of the reasons
for the proposed legislation.
Htn. Mr. DANDURAND.

In 1927. by an amendment to the Trade
Mark and Design Act, provision was made for
the registration under that Act of union labels
by labour unions. By the Unfair Competition
Act. 1932 (22-23 George V.. c. 38), the sections
of the Trade Mark and Design Act relating
to trade marks and union labels were repealed.
The definition of "union label" which had
been inserted in the Act of 1927 was net inciuded in the definition section of the Unfair
Competition Act. The Unfair Compxetition Act
defines "trade mark" as follows:
"Trade mark" means a symbol whieh bas
become
adapted to distinguish particular
wares-I emphasize the expression "wares"-falling within a general category from other
wares falling within the same category, and
is used by any person in association with wares
entering into trade or commerce for the purpose of indieating to dealers in, and/or users
of such wares that they have been nuî factured, sold, leased or hired by him, or that
they are of a defined standard or have been
produced under defincd working conditions, by
a lefined class of persons, or in a dcfined
territorial area, and includes any distinguishing
guise ceapable of constituting a trade mark.
The terms of the Unfair Competition Act
deal with marks associated directly with
wares. Certain labour unions, the members of
which engage, net in the direct production
of wares, but in the performance of services,
have represented it to be desirable that they
should be afforded the privilege of registering
their distinctive designs, which are usually
known as "shop cards." This is desired in
order that business establishments which employ members of these unions for the performance of services may be enabled to use,
by arrangement with the unions, the union
shop cards, and also that provision may be
made to prevent unauthorized use of the
cards. Illustrations of unions affected are the
unions of workmen engaged in scene-shifting
in theatres, of operators of mxotion picture
machines, and of barbers. The number of
unions affected is not large.
The Unfair Competition Act was drawn to
deal with trade marks associated with wares as
defined in that Act, and in its drafting regard
was had to the terms of the international
convention relating to industrial property.
It was therefore deemed expedient not to
propose an amendment to that Act to deal
with this particular matter, but to set up a
separate system of registration.
It is not contemplated that the setting up
of the register will mean the employment of
any additional officers or clerks, since the
administration of the Act will be added to the

MAY 23, 1938

duties of one of the existing branches of the
Departmnent -of the Secretary of State.
A question having been raised as to the
constitutional validity of the Bill, an opinion
was obtained fromn the Department of Justice,
which approved the proposed Iegislation. It
was also approved by our Law Clerk.
The particular sections of the Bill were
based largely upon the oid provisions of the
Trade Mark and Design Act which were repealed in 1932, and upon the ternis of the
Unf air Competition Act relating to appeals.
cancellation of trade marks, and the expunging
or varying nf any entry in the register.
Though the Bill was introduced by the
Secretary of State and it is intended that the
Act shail ho administered by him, the Bill
was prepared after full consultation with
officers of the Department of La.bour, which
department had considered representations
from sanie of the labour unions.
Up to 1932 the privileges now granted
under this Bill to a certain number of unions
f or services they render were in existence
under the Trade Mark and Design Act, but by
the amendment made ini that year "trade
mark" was defined in such a way as to remove
tbe facilities which the unions had previously
possessed for registering their union labels.
It has been deemed opportune, therefore, to
bring in a separate measure to restore those
privileges.
I may say that these shop cards can ho
posted in certain shops oniy with the consent of the proprietor and, of course, of the
union. The purpose of the cards is to indicate to the people that the shop cornes under
certain union regulations.

Honourable
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE:
senators, 1 must confess at once that I have
had only a few minutes in whîch to give a
cursory glance at this Bill and the debates
on it in another place. 1 arn going to impose
upnn the good nature of the honourahie
leader of the Government by asking that
the second reading be postponed until tomorrow. This is a very tecbnical and involved Bill, and, notwithstanding the opinion
the honourable leader has just given us, I
have noticed in reading what took place in
the other bouse that the former Secretary of
State contended strongly that the Bill was flot
valid.
Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND: Who took that
ground?
The Hon.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
C. H. Cahan. Therefore 1 think it would
be only fair that so important a Bill should
stand until to-morrow; and I hope that when
it receives the second reading it will be
referred to the Commnittee on Banking and
Commerce. The Bill, besides being technical
and involved, is very far-reaching. 1 hope
the leader of the Government will agree to.
my suggestion.
I have no,
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
objection to the second reading of the Bill
being postponed until to-morrow. This will
gix e my honourable friend time to read the
whole of the debate which took place in the
other House. and in which he will find that
Righit Hon. R. B. Bennett was not of the
same opinion as Mr. Cahan. Not only did
the right honourable Leader of the Opposition
in the other House support the principle of
the Bill, but ho declared that it did flot

reported in the House of Commons Dehates
of February 24, at page 837:
The statute of 1932 was one dealing with
unfair conipetition, its purpose beiog to give
effect to the ternis of an international arrangement. I had not thought, until the Minister
said so, that the effeet of the passing of that
statute was to lessen the right to register
under the Trade Mark and Design Act. If
the Minister says he is advised that the effeet
of the passage of that Aet, based upon the
international arrangement, was to repeal the
right that had theretofore existed, obviously
it is the duty of this Parliament to reinstate
that right.
I *may say the Department of Justice bas
expressed a favourable opinion as to the
constitutionality of the measure; and our
Law Clerk, whose report I have before me,
concurs in that opinion. Still it will ho quite
agreeable to have the debate adjourned, if myr
honourable friend from Aima (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne) will make a motion to that
effect.

Hon. Mr. COTE: If the opinion from the
Department of Justice is not a long document, would the honourable leader of the

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. A. C. HARDY:
Honourable senators, I am not seeking to delay further the
progress of this Bill through the Senate, and
I am especially desirous not to hold up
concurrence in the Banking and Commerce
Committee's report. The measure bas been
before that committee for some weeks and
lias been the subject of consideration at
numerous sittings. I am sure the committee bas given it every possible thought,
except what I consider the right thought in
some directions. But I feel bound to refer
to one mistake that I think has been made
by the committee's introduction of a new
clause, No. 4, vhich providcs for adding a
new subsection, 6a, to section 10B of the
Act.
Before discussing that I want to make two
points, to prevent mistunderstanding of the
rest of my remarks. One is that I quite
realize thaf. as was stated in the committee,
a large part of the Act depends upon this
clause. But if the clause is an evil ene and
founded in iniquity, then. I think, the whole
Act would partake of the same fault. My
second point is that I am not going to dispute
in any way the riglts of the Canadian Perforinig Right Society to certain proprietorAhip in copyrights and its right to collect
fecs therefor.
There is in a good many
directions a feeling that this society is here
merely to exploit the public in connection
with production of musie. J have no brief
for the society and I am not going to discuss
its rights or wrongs, except to say that under
the Berne Convention and other copyright
conventions. as well as under our own laws,
it is entitled to ceollect fees. But I do object,
and very strongly, to section 4 of this Bill,
which reads in part as follows:
Section ten-B of The Copyright Amendment
Act, 1931, as amended by chapter twenty-eight
of the statutes of 1936, is amended by adding
thereto, as subsection 6a the following:
(6a) In respect of public performances by
means of any radio receiving set or gramophone
in any place other than a theatre which is
ordinarily and regularly used for entertainments
to which an admission charge is made, no fees,
charges or royalties shall be collectable from
the owner or user of the radio receiving set
or gramophone, but the Copyright Appeal Board
shall, so far as possible, provide for the collection in advance from radio broadcasting stations
or gramophone manufacturers, as the case may
be, of fees, charges and royalties appropriate
to the new conditions produced by the provisions
of this subsection and shall fix the amount of
the same.

Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH moved concurrence in the report of the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce on Bill 12,
an Act to amend the Copyright Amendment
Act, 1931, and the Copyright Act.

This simply means that certain classes of
business people, including the palace hotels
from coast to coast, great restaurants, beverage rooms. beer parleurs, barber shops and
even bootblack stands, which install radio

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is the opinion
of Mr. Edwards, Deputy Minister of Justice,
as expressed in a memorandum to the Minister. Mr. Edwards says:
Referring to the remarks of Hon. Mr. Caban
at page 887 of Hansard for 25th February, 1938,
to which you directed imy attentiôn, I have
examined the provisions of Bill 22, "An Act
respecting the Registration of Shop Cards by
Labour Unions," fron the standpoint of their
constitutional validity, and beg to advise you
as follows:
I am of opinion that the Bill is within the
legislative competence of Parliament. If the
Bill is regarded as dealing with trade marks,
which I think it does not, its validity is supported by the reasoning of Lord Atkin in
delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the recent
reference as to the validity of the Dominion
Trade and Industry Commission Act, 1935,
anti the more recent remarks of the Chief
Justice and Mr. Justice Davis in the reference
to the Supreie Court of Canada concerning the
validity of three bills passed by the Legislative
Assembly of Alberta.
I am of opinion that the purpose and effect
of the Bill is to vest in certain labour unions
a copyright which they do not now enjoy, and
that the validity of the Bill is supportable on
the ground that it is copyright legislation within
the meaning of section 91 (23) of the British
North America Act.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I am sure honcurable members have the greatest respect
for the extraordinary legal mind that the
former Secretary of State, Hon. Mr. Cahan,
always exhibits when be speaks on matters
coming before the other Horuse. From what
I have read, it appears that he holds strongly
to the view that this Bill does not come
within the competence of the federal authority;
on the contrary, be says that it deals with a
matter that is within provincial jurisdiction.
I am very much obliged to the honourable
leader of the Senate (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
for agreeing to have second reading stand over
until to-morrow. I move adjournment of the
debate.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Ballantyne, the
debate was adjourned.
COPYRIGHT BILL

Iwn. Mr. DANDURAND.

MAY 23, 1938
receiving sets or gramophones for the purpose
of attracting more customers, will be relieved
of paying a fee for the music they use. The
radio or gramophone, in every such case,
represents an investment by these business
people, which they have made with a view
to increasing their clientele or trade. I cann-ot understand, therefore, why they should
not pay a fee for the music. But, instead,
this Bill requires that the fee be paid by the
broadcasting stations-people or companies
with whom these hotels and other business
firms have no privity of contract and no
relation whatever. Indeed, the broadcasting
companies may be entirely unaware of the
existence of these other concerns.
I have said that the new section would exempt palace hotels from paying the fee. I
refer to such hotels as the Royal York, at
Toronto, and the Mount Royal, at Montreal,
each of which has hundreds of radio receiving
sets under its roof. The fees for the music
received over these sets would have to be paid
by the broadcasting stations. Even ships would
be exempt from the fee. For instance, large
ships of the Canada Steamship Lines are
equipped with radio receiving sets and gramophones for the amusement of their passengers.
Why should the broadcasting station have to
pay fees for the music which is used to build
up the steamship com-pany's business?
I should like to trace briefly the history
of a class of broadcasting which is done by
means of what is known as electrical transcription. For this purpose records are used,
similar in appearance to gramophone records,
though much larger, some of them running to
about two feet in diameter. These are leased
from operating companies, most of which I
think are established in the United States,
the trade in Canada not being large enough
to warrant the setting up of a factory here.
The leasing is expensive, an ordinary small
station being charged about $100 a month.
First of all, the manufacturers of these
records have to pay a copyright fee to the
Performing Right Society in the United
States; then, when the record is put on the
air, the broadcasting station has to pay a fee;
and, lastly, a fee is imposed upon those hotels,
saloons, barber shops or other places which
receive the music for their customers. This
last class the Bill would exempt from any
payment at all, the burden being transferred
to the broadcasting stations, which already
are saddled with two fees for the music they
use, for in addition to the fee they pay direct
there is another included in the price they
pay the manufacturers of the records.
I should like honourable senators to consider the injustice of assessing broadcasting
stations with fees for music received by busi-

37

ness firms through radio sets which they have
installed as commercial investments. It simply
means compelling certain parties to shoulder
the debts or obligations of others. I cannot
call to mind any bill that has ever gone
through this Senate, at least since I have been
here, which is at all parallel to this one. The
only measures in any way comparable with
it are some which have been passed by the
Province of Alberta. I have carefully compared the Home Owners' Securities Act, passed
by the Alberta Legislature, with this Bill,
and I think it is on absolutely parallel lines.
All I can say is, if this measure goes into
force, the Premier of Alberta will certainly
rejoice when he sees the Parliament of Canada
following so closely in his footsteps. I do not
suppose such action could come at a more
opportune time for him, when he is carrying
on a cmpaign in a neighbouring province and

trying to bolster it up with legislation just
like this. He will now be able to say that at
least the Senate of Canada is passing exactly
parallel legislation.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: My honourable
neighbour to my left (Hon. Mr. Hardy) says
he knows of no law like this Bill. That statement is candid, but not conclusive.
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable members,
I want to express my regret both to the
Banking and Commerce Committee and to
this House that I was not in my place to

hear the concluding discussion on this Bill.
I remember very distinctly the arguments
adduced a week ago, when the Banking and
Commerce Committee sat until midnight. I
recall particularly the brief read by Mr.
Gladstone Murray, which I thought was the
best presentation of that side of the case
referred to by my honourable friend from
Leeds (Hon. Mr. Hardy). As a member of
the committee I thought that he had a just
case and that his recommendations should
have been considered favourably. I am not
eriticizing the committee's decision, for I was
not present to hear what was said; but it does
seem to me to be entirely unjust to impose
on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation
the duty of collecting fees for the Performing
Right Society when that society can collect
them for itself. In my view there is no
valid reason why the broadcasting company
should collect those fees. It is true the Performing Right Society, if not directly, at least
by implication, stated that the fees collected
from the small performing houses, such as
shoe-shine parlours, small hotels and dance
halls, were so low that it did not pay the
society to collect them, but that is no reason
why it should ask that the C. B. C. be made a

37t5

SENATE

collecting agency. If the corporation is required to do collecting work, the probabilities
are that next year it will ask that the radio
licence fee be increased to $3 or even to $3.50.
The corporation must get money either by a
grant from Parliament or by fees from those
who own radios.
I have been referring solely to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation; but the small
broadcasting stations all over Canada will be
similarly affected. There are seven or eight
stations in the Maritime Provinces, and there
are several in Quebec and Ontario. They,
too, would have to collect fees for the Performing Right Society. That is wrong. The
society should collect its own fees. It is
entitled to a fee for the use of its property
just the same as any merchant is entitled
to charge and collect for the goods he sells,
or a railway company or steamship company
ta collect passenger fares and freight charges.
I should not desire to take anything away
from the society, but, I repeat, I think it is
unfair to put upon the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation and the small broadcasting stations all over the country the anus of collecting fecs. The society itself admits the
fecs are scarcely worth the cost of collecting;
but th at is by the way, and it does not
affect the principle involved here, for even if
the fees do not pay the cost of collection,
that is no reason why the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the other broadcasting stations should become collecting agencies
for the society.
I shall vote against the Bill while that provision remains in it.

(Hon. Mr. Black) and the honourable member from Leeds (Hon. Mr. Hardy), but I
must say I had the same understanding as the
latter gentleman of the remarks of the honourable senator from Westmorland. The broadcasting companies are in no sense collectors,
but in the end they are the goats. I should
have no objection to the small users being
exempt from payment of any licence fees,
but I agree with both honourable members
that it is very unfair, while exempting such
users, to place the burden of payment on the
broadcasting stations, which already are working under a heavy handicap.
Many strong protests have been received.
I do not know why the amendment was inserted in the committee and why my good
friend from Leeds did not get more support
when be brought the matter up there. I was
not on the committee. This Bill should not go
through in its preseot form. It is not fair to
the broadcasting stations to exempt the small
users from payment of nominal fees, multiply
those fees by the hundred and add the total
to the aiready very heavy fees which the
broadcasting stations are now paying.
In
most cases the broadcasting station is performing a community service. It gives the news
frce and co-operates with every local charitable
organization. Why this provision should be
inserted I cannot understand.

Hon. Mr. HARDY: May I correct my
honourable friend, if I understood him to say
that the broadcasting stations collect fees from
the users of copyright music. That is not
the point. I do not suppose the broadcasting
stations would object to that. They are not
required to collect from the small users, of
whom there are some 50,000; they must pay
those fees out of their own pocket, and
there is no possible way in which they can
reimburse themselves.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: It is exceedingly difficult for me to follow the discussion. In the
first place we are told the broadcasting station
is forced to collect; thon we have the statement that the broadcasting station does not
collect anything.

Hon. Mr. BLACK: I did not at all misunderstand my honourable friend. Instead
of collecting the fees from those who should
pay them, the Performing Right Society
collects them direct from the broadcasting
conpanies. I may not have expressed my
ideas in precise terms. but my honourable
friend and I are in agreement.
Hon. CREELMAN MacARTHUR: Honourable members, I am in perfect agreement with
the honourable member from Westmorland
Hon. Mr. BLACK.

Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable senators,
I must confess I do not understand the matter
at all.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. HARDY: They cannot collect it.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Now we get a further
statement that the small fellows are exempt.
So we have three statements before us at the
present time.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Under this Bill they are
exempt.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: My difficulty is this.
Here is a barber shop, we will say, down town,
with a gramophone in it. Four or five fellows
drop in for a shave, and one of them turns
on the gramophone, and it happens to bc a
piece of copyright music. Some person has a
right to be paid for the use of that music. But
how in the world are you going to get that

MAY 23, 1938

377

a certain copyright tune, every radio that
puts on that tune has to pay a fee. Is that
correct?
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Only if it is what is
called a public performance. It might be in
a barber shop or in a big theatre.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Must there be an
entrance fee?
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Not necessarily. Under
the law it is called a public performance.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Suppose a man invites a dozen persons into his home to listen
to his radio.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: That is a private
performance; but in the barber shop the performance is public. I may say that the
Canadian Performing Right Society is very
efficiently managed, and if there is a radio
in a store, a barber shop or a big hotel, the
society knows it and collects its fees.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: How can you as
the owner of a broadcasting station ascertain
what you have to pay?
Hon. Mr. HARDY: We cannot. It will
be ascertained by some persons here in Ottawa, who will act on representations from
the Canadian Performing Right Society. How
they are going to get at it God only knows.
It will be the wildest kind of guess, but it
will represent a good deal of money.
Hon. J. T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
maybe I can help some of my honourable
friends to get at the facts.
Cannot
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
the bootblack shut off the broadcasting
station?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Certainly. Let us get at
the facts; then I think we shall be in a better
position to reach a decision. The Bill as it
came to us from the House of Commons
provided for a catalogue registration of all
copyright pieces owned by the Performing
Right Society. The society said this was
an impossibility. It is already obliged to file
a memorandum of ownership. For instance,
it may say, "The Society owns the Canadian
copyright of the Pirates of Penzance," and
so on. It asserts it has done so in regard to
150,000 pieces that it owns or controls. All
the societies with which the Canadian Performing Right Society is affiliated own or
control about two and a half million pieces.
They come into Canada under the copyright
amendments put through in 1931. In the

have to do so in Canada. We require them
has a broadcasting station and he puts on

barber to pay for having the machine turned
on for a few minutes, or, at most, half an
hour?
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Why is the gramophone
there?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: To amuse people, I
suppose.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: That is it exactly.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: But how in the world
are you going to collect a fee? There are
thousands of barber shops throughout Canada.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Right along they have
been paying a small fee, collected by the Performing Right Society.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The gramophone is
there; you can see it.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Does not the barber, when
he buys the record, pay for the right to play
that tune?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I cannot admit that.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Why not?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The record man paid
for the right to put it on his gramophone.
But we will take the case of radio. I have a
radio broadcasting station, and I broadcastHon. Mr. HARDY: Where is it?
. Hon. Mr. CALDER: I am assuming. Then
there is some little fellow away out hundreds
of miles in the wilds who happens to have a
radio. Because he uses that radio to amuse
some of his friends in the evenings, someone
is going to collect a fee from him.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Not from the
private individual.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Then in the little
store in the village.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is a public
performance.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Now you say the
broadcasting station has to pay on how
many? One hundred, five hundred, a thousand?
Hon. Mr. HARDY: It is fifteen thousand.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: How do they estimate it?
The arbitral

Hon. Mr. CALDER: It decides?

just to file this memorandum, which secures
them their copyright.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The honourable gentleman should explain that the United
States are not under the Berne Convention.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I am coming to that.
Great Britain, Germahy, Italy, France and
Canada-there are other countries, but I
cannot recall them at the moment-do not
require any of these copyright pieces to be
re'gistered.
Great Britain requires certain
formalities. such as filing two copies of the
copyright, one for preservation in the British
Museum.
In France there is a similar requirenent in regard to depositing a copy in
the Louvre, and so on.
The sponsor of the Bill in the House of
Commons suggested that the Performing
Right Society file a catalogue of all the
pieces of which it owns and controls the
copyright. The broadcasting stations have
to pay the Performing Right Society so much,
and the amount is fixed by a board composed
of three men, Mr. Justice MacLean of the
Exchequer Court, Mr. E. H. Coleman, UnderSecretary of State, and Mr. Justice Parker.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: When the broadeasting stations pay, do they pool their payments?
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Yes.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes. It is worked out at
eight cents for each radio in Canada. For
1938 it will amount to about $83,000. I
speak subject to correction.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
the broadcasting corporation pays?

That is,

Hon. Mr. HAIG: The broadcasting stations
all together pay that money to the Performing Right Society.
Hon. Mr. :ROBINSON: That does not include the B. B. C.?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No; that includes only
Canadian stations. My honourable friend
says there are eight in the Maritime Provinces. They are
apportioned
a certain
amount of that 83,000. Under the board's
decision the Performing Right Society is
allowed eight cents for every radio in Canada.
The society asked for fourteen cents. The
Bill as it came from the Commons did not
provide for any charges like this at all. The
society was to file a catalogue of all the copyright pieces it owned or claimed to own.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
good would that do to us?
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

What

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I shall come to that in
a minute. If I am a small restauranteur and
pay $2.50 for a radio in my restaurant, and
I happen to tune in on a piece of music the
copyright of which is owned by the Performing Right Society, under the present law the
society can make me pay another fee for that
broadcast.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
should the society net do so?

Why

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Because it has already
been paid once. I have to pay for that
broadcast in my restaurant, but not for the
same broadcast in my house.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: That is ridiculous.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I know it is ridiculous.
In accordance with the Berne Convention, if
there is any fee for that extra broadcasting to
the restauranteur, and if it is of any value to
the Performing Right Society, then the society
can collect it. Here is what Judge Parker said
in his report of March, 1935, with regard to
these small users:
This Commission agrees with Mr. Mills when
referring to such small users of music, that the
use has no commercial value. Generally speaking, where the cost of selling a licence is $29.60,
which is the cost given by the society, no return
to the author, composer and publisher can ever
be derived from this source. When it becomes
necessary to impose a minimum fee, it is an
admission that the licence has little commercial
value, and the Commission is of opinion that
the society, from the standpoint of the interest
of the members of its parent societies, should
take this into consideration. As long as the
microscope is used te locate the small user, so
long will the society's cost of operation be
unduly high.
When *ve say in this Bill that the fee of the
Performing Right Society to the small owners
is to be fixed by the commission on the basis
of value, the cost of collecting the money
should be taken into account. Judge Parker
says that the use by small users has no
commercial value. I should have liked the
clause to stop at line 31, so as to allow the
collection of the fee from nobody. But the
Law Clerk of the Senate and the Department
of Justice say that unless we put in the
clause which follows, the section will conflict
with the Berne Convention. I have had the
help of Mr. O'Connor in going over the Bill,
and it appears to me that the clause would be
safer if we struck out the last part of it.
My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton) asks why cards should be filed.
I am a lawyer and if a client came in to me
and said, "I should like to know whether I
am liable to pay a fee to the Performing Right
Society when I turn on the radio in my

MAY 23, 1938
restaurant," I should be unable to tell him.
Why? Because there are only 150,000 works
registered here at Ottawa, and the organizatiens with which the society is affil.jated own
2,500,000.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: A great
proportion of them are neyer used.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I do flot know whethe'r a
particular composition is theirs or rlot4 s0 1
cannot tell my client. Then, if the society
takes him into court, the onus is on him to
prove that it does not own the composition.
That is the present law, and it is not right.
I arn pointing that eut te show the difficulty
that exi.sts in this ceuntry with respect te this
law. As Judg-e Parker says, it is the small
user, whose licence has ne commercial value,
who bas caused the uproar ail over Canada.
At the present time the commission fixes the
ameunt the broadeasters must pay at eight
cents per station. This year the Performing
Right Society will get a very much larger fee,
because the Government has said that if you
have two or three or four radios in your house
you must pay $2.50 for each one of them,
and the Performing Right Society will receive
eight cents for every receiving set.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: For a
year?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: For a year.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: As I understand the
honourable gentleman*6 statement, the proposed law leaves the situation as it was before.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Legally, yes.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The broadcasting
cempanies will still pay the eight cents unless
the board increases the amount.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: If it is found that to the
Performing Right Society there is any value in
the small users, that is, if the society could
colleet fees from them to a greater amount
than the cost of collection, the broadeasters
will have to pay for that value.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: How will they ever
get it?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I arn telling you they will
never get it. The Performing Right Society
makes them pay.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH.-STAUNTON: How?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I will tell you. Net
long ago a Chinaman in Winnipeg turned on
some music, and the society said hie should
pay a $25 licence fee. It took him into court
and won its case and got costs against him.
During the last election I went into a hotel
in Miami, Manitoba, with a friand, and I
said te him, "Let us turn on the radio and get

the news." The hotel preprietor had te psy
a fee of $30 te get that radio program,
and it bas been said that if cest $29.60 te
collect it.
I pay
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
$2.50 for my radio. If I happened te turn
on something or other that was copyrighted,
should I have te psy for doing se?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No. Your radie is in
a private house.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Well,
if I were a bootblack?
Hon. Mr. HAIG:- You would pay a

unless the board says if can, and we say the
board must first take into considerafion the

I do not think there is much occasion for the

Leeds (Hon. Mr. Hardy).
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Why, in
your opinion, should he pay at all?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I do not say he should,
but in order to comply with the Berne Convention we have to provide machinery so
that the fees may be paid, if there is anything to pay.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:

is no conflict, and I would ask the House
to consider the amendments of the committee
and let the Bill go back to the other House
for consideration.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable senators, I had intended, until this discussion
started. te offer an amendment to clause 1 of
the Bill; but now I do not think I shall do so.
TIe question of wha t constitutes a list has
causcd a great deal of discussion. I have
bore evidence to show what, for the purpose
of filing with the board here in Ottawa, constitutes a list. Subsection 1 of section 10
says:
Each society, association or company which
carries on in Canada the business of acquiring
copyrights of dramatico-musical or musical works
or of performing riglts therein, and which deals
with or in the issue or grant of licences for the
performance in Canada of dramatico-musical
or musical works in which copyright subsists, shall, from time to tiin. file with the
Minister at the Copyright Office lists of all
dramatico-musical and musical work s, in curront
use in respect of which such societ, assioiation

or company has authority to issue <r graut
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

performing licences or to collect fees, charges
or royalties for or in respect of the performance
of its works in Canada.
The report that we have before us for
consideration recommends the continuation of
that subsection just as I have read it. Although
I was not a member of the Banking and
Commerce Committee. I have been of the
opinion al through the discussion that the
list heretofore filed was simply a farce, and
I have here a letter which I want to place
on record te show members of the Senate
what constitutes this list. I have heard,
and I think it has been repeated here tonight, that the Performing Right Society
had saved $2,000,000 by not filing certain
works and paying the fee of $1 for each
copyrighted work filed.
Hon. Mr. COTE:
in Canada.

The fee is two dollars

which speaks for itself:

Here is a letter

I said wben I started ta speak, I had intended ta mnove an amendment ta put some
words in front of the word "lists" in order
ta make it more definite than it is.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Are you attaching some significance ta the absence of the
name of the authur, for instance?
I amn attaching
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
significance ta the fact that this appears ta
be a very peculiar list. I realize tbat in some
cases the Performing Right Society may be
representing the author.
Hon. Mr. GiRIESBACH: The words "composer" is used as weli as "author." The composer writes the music, and if there are no
words attacbed ta it there is no author.
I know. The

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: 1 sbauld like ta

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The amendment I
intended ta move was ta insert the twa words
"duly certified."

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
whom?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: By the Canadian
Performing Right Society, I presume, because
it is the concern that is doing the business,
and that is being relieved of the payment of

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: On the bottom of
the cards in 1935 and 1936 are the words,

presume it would be said those words were
tantamaunt ta a signature after 1935. But the
point is this: Are these certified iists from

It looks more

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Presumably it was
satisf:actory to the committee. Ail right, let
it go at that.
In regard to the proposed section 4, which
has been discissed. I think no harm would
havc been donc if the actual meaning of this
amendment had been placed on the record.
It secms to me that the discussion shows
some misunderstanding.
This section proposes that the following be added to the
Act as subsection 6a of section 1OB:
In respect of public performances by means
of any radio receiving set or gramophone in
any place other than a theatre which is
ordimarily and regularly used for entertainments
to which au admission charge is made, no fees,
charges or royalties shall be collectable from
the owner or user of the radio receiving set or
gramophone, but the Copyright Appeal Board
shall, so far as possible, provide for the collection in advance from radio broadcasting stations
or gramophone manufacturers, as the case may
be, of fees, charges and royalties appropriate
to the new conditions produced by the provisions
of this subsection and shall fix the amount of
the sane. In so doing the Board shall take into
account ail expenses of collection and other outlays, if any, saved or saveable by, for or on
behalf of the owner of the copyright or performing right concerned or bis agents, in
consequence of the provisions of this subsection.
Now, that applies only to what? It applies
to "public performances by means of any
radio receiving set or gramophone in any
place other than a theatre which is ordinarily
and regularly used for entertainments to
which an admission charge is made," and it
provides that in such cases "no fees, charges
or royalties shall be collectable from the
owner or u-ar of the radio receiving set or
Hion.

Mr. GRIESBACH.

gramophone." In the discussion there seemed
to be a marked difference of opinion as to
whether or not this section would make
owners of radio sets and gramophones in
private homes liable for these fees. This section relieves places of the kinds therein mentioned from payment of fees, just as new section 2 relieves "any agricultural or agricultural-industrial exhibition or fair which receives a grant from or is held under Dominion,
provincial or municipal authority, by the directors thereof."
Some Hon. SENATORS: Question.
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators,
may I just say a word? When I first spoke
I did not go into much detail, because I supposed everyone was fairly familiar with the
provisions of the Bill. I felt so myself, except
as to these new amendments, which I had not
known of before to-day. I am sorry to say
that the remarks of the honourable junior
member from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig)
did not make these amendments clear to me,
nor have the remarks of the honourable
senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock)
changed the view that I had. For, after ail,
what these amendments do is to place upon
the shoulders of the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation's stations and other broadcasting
stations throughout Canada the onus of
collecting copyright fees from aIl small entertainment places, small hotels, barber shops,
bootblack stands, and so on, where radio
sets are installed.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Will the honourable
gentleman pardon me? Surely that does not
apply to the bootblack stand or the barber
shop. No admission fee is charged at such
places.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: To whom
does it a.pply?
Right Hon. Mr.
bootblack stands.

GRAHAM:

Owners

of

Hon. Mr. BLACK: AIl these places may
have to pay, under that section. It is trua
that appeals may be made to the Copyright
Appeal Board, but why should the board not
say that the Performing Right Society is
entitled to certain fees, and that broadcasting
stations must collect them from ail these
small users? That would be the logical result
of the section, it seems to me. We can pass
the section and rely upon the benevolence of
the board, but we cannot get rid of the fact
that the board would have power to impose
upon broadcasting stations the collection of
these fees for the society. That would be
quite unjust; and besides it would work a

MAY 23. 1938
hardship, for many broadcasting companies
in Canada are to-day scarcely able to make
ends meet. Indeed, some of them are not
able to do this. I submit that Parliament
should not impose this injustice upon them.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Honourable senators,
may I be allowed a few moments to draw
attention to something that was said by my
honourable friend the junior senator from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig)? I read Judge
Parker's report, and I noted his statement
that radio sets in small shops and so on
have no business value. But I want to point
out that these receiving sets are used, for purposes of attracting business, in great hotels,
on board large steamships, and so on, as I
have already mentioned. In any event, the
department has set a minimum fee of $10, I
think it is, to be imposed against these people
whose places of business are open to the public.
There are between fourteen and fifteen thousand such places; so the total fees receivable
amount to between $140,000 and $150,000. It
is truc the Parker report says the cost of
collection is $29, but that is a mere guess, and
without doubt it includes all kinds of administration and head office expenses. I would
remind honourable senators that the day after
this section was inserted in the Bill Mr.
Jamieson, president of the society, stated that
the costs of collection were not so great. I
have no doubt that a year from now he will
say there are no collection costs at all and
never were any. If this section goes through,
the broadcasting stations, which are already
paying $83,000 in fees, will have to be responsible for a large part of this $140,000 in
addition. That means for a station now paying fees of $1,000 an assessment of something
like $2,500, or more. That will be a very
serious increase in its expenses.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Honourable senators, I must confess that I do not
understand what this is all about.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: The last
speaker has said that the broadcasting stations might, under this new section, become
liable for a large amount of fees, but the
honourable junior senator from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. Haig) estimated that the fees would
not average more than $10 to $30 for each
station. I certainly do not like to vote for a
Bill which I believe is not understood by half
the honourable members of this House.
Section 4 might place an enormous responsibility on the broadcasting stations. If what
the honourable member from Leeds (Hon. Mr.
Hardy) says is true, the section would be

383

tyranny and oppression. I think we should
be better informed before we pass something
which might inflict a calamity upon broadcasters.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: My honourable
friend from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) is a high-class lawyer. I would suggest
that if he read the language of the section
he would change his view entirely.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: It is all
Greek to me.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: This section applies
only to publie performances in any place
other than a theatre to which an admission
charge is made.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: No.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
senators, I think we all realize that this is a
highly technical measure, which affects the
copyright conventions of Berne and Rome. I
venture to affirm that there are not five
honourable members around me who have

read those conventions.
gentleman from Hamilton (Hon. Mr. LynchStaunton) says the Bill is "all Greek" to him.
This is a measure upon which I think few
honourable members, despite our long debate,
can pass competent judgment unless they have
read the necessary legislation bearing upon
the Berne and Rome conventions.
I desire simply to remind honourable
members that this is not a Government Bill.
It has been sponsored by a private member
in each House of Parliament. But I have
had to keep watch over it, in attempting to
see that it did not infringe upon the obligations of the Dominion towards other countries
who have jointly signed the Berne and Rome
conventions. In addition, of course, as a
member of the committee, I had to take a
stand and decide what I deemed best in the
interests of the parties concerned. The parties
primarily concerned are the authors and
composers of music. These people are entitled
to have their works protected. I am sure
that my honourable friend from Parkdale
(Hon. Mr. Murdock), who is an ex-Minister
of Labour, would agree that the labour of
authors and composers is not of the lowest
class, and that these people, who are working
in their various countries towards a higher
civilization, are entitled to some return for
their industry and ability. Existing copyright
law is based upon the necessity of protecting
these works in every country. The other day
we had at the Banking and Commerce
Committee a representative of the Performing
Right Society of France. He told us that
while copyright law had been enacted for the

384

SENATE

protection of authors, sculptors and various
other workers in art, musical composers had
not been included. One day two composers
happened to go into a restaurant, and while
they were having their meal someone was
singing some of their songs. The composers
enjoyed this singing very much, but when
thev had finished eating they refused to pay
unless they received compensation for their
music which had been used during the
luncheon. They were brought before the
courts, and there it was held that they were
quite right in refusing to pay for their meal
in the circumstances. They had happened to
come along at the opportune moment when
their own music was being performed. Hence
it was that legislation was enacted to protect
the works of musical composers as well as
those of other artists.
I will now revert to the section to which
allusion has been made by my honourable
friend from Leeds (Hon. Mr. Hardy). He
thinks it would be particularly harmful to
broadcasting stations. When the committee
came to consider this matter, it was interesting, just as it had been in another place,
to notice that nearly everybody was desirous
of protecting the small restaurant keeper.
the booiblackc, and proprietors of other places
where five, trn or fifteen persons might
frequently congregate.

Mr.

LYNCH-STAUNTON:

The

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In a moment of
natural sentiment it was decided to exempt
these small business people from the copyright
fee. Then this sentiment was carried further.
It was said, "Well, why not exempt the
hotels?" I thought a line would be drawn
between small hotels and big ones of, say,
three hundred rooms and more. But no.
They were all exempted. It was interesting
to see the play of private interest at the
committee. Shipping companies were represented officially by their lawyers. They said,
"Why not exempt us?" And so it came
about that the largest steamship companies,
whose ships ride the ocean waves, were
exempted, just as were those whose boats sail
only on our lakes. I boast that I voted against
exempting the ship owners. I was wondering
what would remain by way of protection for
the authors and composers when we were
through. These exemptions were a trespass
upon the conventions which declare that
everyone is entitled to receive payment for
his work.
It was siggested then that the Canadian
Broadeasting Corporation should foot the bill;
that is to say. the music should be paid for
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

at the source. There were two reasons for
this. First, it brought this clause into conformity with the Berne Convention, in that
we were transferring payments from the
small users to the broadcasting stations. There
was the other reason, that probably the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the
other broadcasting stations would not have
to pay so much, since it appeared that the
Performing Right Society was paying nearly
as much for collection as it was receiving in
fees from the smnall users. It was felt that
the arbitral board would sec that ample compensation was established. As a matter of
fact the Bill provides:
In respect of public performances by means
of any radio receiving set or gramophone in
any place other than a theatre which is
ordinarily and regularly used for entertainments
to which an admission charge is made, no fees,
charges or royalties shall be collectable from
the owner or user of the radio receiving set
or gramophone, but the Copyright Appeal Board
shall. so far as possible, provide for the collection in advance from radio broadcasting stations
or gramophone manufacturers, as the case may
be, of fees, charges aind royalties appropriate
to the new conditions produced by the provisions
of this subsection and shall fix the amouut of
the saine.
Now I ask honourable members to pay attention to this proviso:
In so doing the Board shall take into account
all expenses of collection and othter outlays, if
any, saved or saveable by, for or on behalf of
the owner of the copyright or performing right
concerned or his agents, in consequence of the
provisions of this subsection.
In other words, if it is found that the
Performing Right Society has made out a
case of what it had a right to collect and
did in the past collect from those smatl users,
there shall be deducted from the total amount
whatever appears to have been the cost of
collection.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
from the decision?

There is no appeal

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I do not think
se. Once every year it can be called upon
to revise the amount.
I appreciate the
danger of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation being mulcted in a larger sum, and
thereby the country at large being obliged to
foot the bill, because the broadcasting corporation must have its deficit paid either by
appealing to the treasury or by being allowed
to charge a higher licence fee to radio users;
and the other broadcasting stations may be
called upon to pay something more. But
you are facing this situation, that if you do
not throw upon somebody the obligation to
compensate the Performing Right Societythat is, largely, the author and the composer

MAY 23, 1938
-you violate the Berne Convention. So,
in order to meet the desire of the majority
of the committee to exempt the small users,
contrary to the convention, it was feit that
we should save our faces by tbrowing the
payment upon some other body.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Very easy.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is what
actuated the committee. I was surprised to
find that the steamship companies were making a dead set at this clause in order to
save themselves. I turned to the representative of the Performing Right Society and
asked him, "How much were you collecting
fromn those steamship companies?" I feit that
if the amount was large it would be burdensome on the broadcasting corporation. He
answered, "About $1,000?" It struck me there
was a good deal of noise for the sake of
saving a total of $1,000. We were concerned
flot for the big users, but for the small users,
and I feit that $1,000 was a small saving ta
the stearnship companies. But I was reminded
that what was worse than to place a burden
of $1,000 on other shoulders was to violate
the very principle underlying the Copyright
Act.
I think I have fairly stated the situation.
I realize that if we strike out -that clause
there will be very little substance in the
Bill for those who have been trying to. free
the small users from the obligation of paying
fees.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Will flot
the larger proportion of tbe payments come
out of the broadcasting stations controlied
by the Government?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No; there are
private broadcasting stations also.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: But Mr.
Murray was objecting strenuously ta this.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: He was speaking
for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-S TAUNTON:ý That is
the Governmexit?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. LYNOH-STAUNTON: Will the
Governmcnt not have ta pay ail this money?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The moiney is
collected by the $2.50 licence fee. If that fee
does not suffice, then the country makes good
the deficit.
Hon. Mr. BLACK. There were other representatives there-

385

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Honourable senators, the discussion has fully justified me in
having endorsed the request of the honourable member from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) last Thursday that the Bill should be
given further consideration. I do flot think
this is good legislation, nor legisiation that
the Senate, should be proud of.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: It is Aberhart legislation..
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: If you like to eall
it such. 1 do not think we can rely on the
argument that there will be very little additional expense to the broadcasting stations
because the cost of collection in the past
has been almost equal to the value of the
fees. We do flot know what the future expense will be, and I should not like to trust
too much to that argument. I am afraid this
provision will cost flot only the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation but also the private
broadcasgting stations ail over the Dominion
a good deal of maney. Many of the small
broadcasting stations are flot making money.
They are performing a very useful public
service, and I do not think we should place
any greater burden upon them at the present
time.
Hon. R. F. GREEN: Honourable senators,
I have listened with interest to what has
been said bath for and against te amendments. It is true that when the Bill reached
us from the other House its purpose was ta
look after the littie users. However, I do flot
feel I arn in a -position ta deal with the
arguments, and therefore 1 move that the
order for consideration of these amendments
be discharged and placed on the Order Paper
for the next sitting of the House.

A message wvas received from the Huse of
Commons with Bill 122, an Act for granting
ta His Majesty crtain sunis of money for the
public serv ice of the finaneial year ending the
3lst March, 1939.
The Bill was read the first fimie.
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of the Bill.
H1e said: Honourable senators, this Bill bas
for its object the voting of another one-sixth
of the supply for the fiscal year 1938-1939.
It covers that proportion of the main estimates and also of the supplementary estimates
which wore tabled in bothi Houses of Parlianient laFt %veck. The amount requested under
the main estimates is $39,057,624.49, and
under the supplementaries $17,751,572.68. A
portion of the supplementaries is included
for the purpose of obtaining funds with which
to meet expenditures already authorized by
enabling legislation. Iast year funds were
voted earlier in the session. As we have advanced well into the spring, a number of
works shou]d be undertaken without further
delay; so the other House bas unanimously
.?xpressed its opinion that one-sixth of the
3Upplvinentaries sbould be voted now, reservmng the right, of course, as does the Senate, to
Hon.

Mr. MeMEANS.

discuss the advisability of any of these expendituies when the rest of the main and
supplementary estimates are being voted. I
am asking for leave to moxe second reading
of the Bill to-day, in view of the somewhat
pressing conditions.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGIIEN: If I
beard the figures correctly, one-sixth of the
main estimates is $39,000,000 odd, and onesixth of the supplementary estimates is $17,000.000 odd.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
The total amount of
flie supplementaries is $106,000,000.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEICHEN:
That is
:istonishing. It means that the supplementary estimates aie comparable to the main
estimates.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
As I stated
last wveek, estimates of money to be expended
as our share of relief, or to meet deficits of
the Canadian National, instead of being submitted specially, as they were last session,
are now comprised in the final supplementary
estimates for the current year. Last session
we hnd two supplementaries. but this tiie
we shahl have only the one which was tabled
in tlîe House of Coînmons a week ago. This
rxplains the large amount in the supplementary estiînates now before us.
Right Hon. Mr~. MEIGI-IEN:
But even
.so. tbe supplementary estimates are gigantic.
What is the icason for that? Wouhd it not
be better to hav e these amounts in the main
estimates?
The main estimates are becoming just n foretaste, a mere indication, an
opener.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The question
was discussed in the other House, and it
wa exphainedRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
supplementaries for new public
pump-priming expenditures?

Are these

Hor.. Mr. DANDURAND:
Wel]. soine
pecople may eall them sa, but the term is
ipplicable to only a very modest. degrce. Some
of the mnoneys for works ta be. carried on
are in the main estimiates, but most of them
are in these supplementaries. Not ail these
moncys are for relief works; a certain proportion will be spent. on works that will be
productive and will yield a return to the
coun try.
Rîght Hon. Mr. ME11GHEN: I am expressing just in general terms my own view. 1
have no objection to public works for relief;
that is to say, to anticipatory publie works,
the anticipatorv feiture being due to the

MAY 24, 1938

387

necessities of relief; but I have no faith
whatever in the policy of public works for
pump-priming. I can quite appreciate that
it might be wise to proceed now with the
construction of some useful public works, such
as roads, which are becoming more and more
a revenue-bearing asset. The first, and always
the first, consideration is that such works are
of use and bring returns; a purely secondary
consideration is that they 'provide some work.
But, to my mind, no policy can be more
unsound than that of seeking by the process
of increasing debt to bring about prosperity.
One cannot but look at the country ta the
south. If ever there was an example of a
Herculean effort along that lina, it was the
effort made in the United States in very
recent. times, with resuits as plain as anything in this world can, be. Immediately
after buge expenditures have had their affect,
a business turnover of somne 65 billion dollars
goes down in a short time ta 35 billions; and
now an attempt is being made, by the spending of 5 billions, ta rastore that turnover ta
its old lavai. The point is that the amount
of work taken up 'by public enterprise is sa
very small in relation ta what can be absorbed hy the freaing of individual initiative
and of business frein some measure of handicap, that instaad of going forward by publie
enterprise you go back. With every accretien of debt you necessarily press more heavily
on individual enterprise, with the consequence
that you put more -people out of work than
you put into employment. In one case you
get a revenue-bearing asset, and in the other
case you do not. I only hýope that such
expenditures as are made wîll be somewhat
modest, though I do nlot sea anything modest
about $106,000,000 as applied ta Canada.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But that is nat
aIl ta be spent on public works.

possibly ta pay a share of taxes, and make it
worth while for people to build. Just now
they are simply standing by, burning for the
chance ta do that. The trouble is, nat a
lack of mnoney, but a lack of prospect.
Therefore I urge upon tbe Government that
it confine its pump-priming ta very narrow
limits, and that within ýthose limits it get the
maximum productivity. I mean, nat maximum results in the way of construction, but
maximum results in the way of doing things.
that will yield a revenue. As I have said, roads.
are of such a nature. I also, urge that the.
Gavernment should direct its main effort tawards holding down taxation, so that enter*prising, courageaus people may be enabled ta
make some progress, or at least may -be left
free to proceed with their undertakings with
sama prospect of success.
Hon. Mr. DAND'URAND: My right hionourable friend ds pretty mucb of the saine
mind as the Minister of Finance.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I am glad ta
bear that. I suspeeted it.
Han. Mr. DANDURAND: The Minister
of Finance, standing very close to the
treasury, is most interested in seeing that aur
expenditures can be met with ordinary
revenues. This year and perhaps next it will
ba samewhat difficult to reach equilibrium,
becaiuse of the special expenditures that we
have ta face.
I imay inform the right 'honaurable gentleman that a number of items in the supplementary estimates relate ta production services or ta activities of the Department of
Agriculture directed towards anlarging aur
markets for agrioultural produets in Great
Britain.

Right Hon. Mr. MFIGHEN: No. I know
that includes relief and other things which
formerly were covared in separate astimates.
I hope the expenditures will ha conflned ta
works of such a nature that they are bound
ta return the maximum of productivity.
I amn only spaaking the resulta of my own
thinking. I have no faith in this governmental
bouse-building. Why, in avery eity of Canada
to-day fine residences and modest anas, as well
as business praperties, are being torn down
because thair owners are seeking relief from
taxes. Winnipeg is a conspicuous instance.
In the face of that, surely it is wrong, surely
it is diametrically opposed ta good acanamies,
for the Government ta saek ta replace private
enterprise in building. The- way ta get building operations going is ta lower taxes, or

Undar Fisheries I flnd the following items:
To provide for the replacement of fisheries
service vessais, $150,000.
To enable aiding fishermen, groupe of fishermen and others ta establish or better establish
themselves in the industry, $500,000.
To aid in expanding the sale of the products.
of the Canadian fishermen in fareign and

To provide for commitmnents and completion
of works in connection with federal contributions ta provincial and municipal relief projects

If my right honourable friand runs through
the items he will flnd a considerable number of
revotes, there being in some cases an unexpended balance, and in others a slightly increased amount. For instance:

SENATE

388

To provide for federal contributions to farm
employment and supplementary plans (revite
for cemmitments $870,000), $1,870,000.
To provide for development and training
projects for unemployed young people (revote
for commitments $290,000), $1,750,000.
I think that is a very laudable object.
To provide, in co-operation with the provinces, for rehabilitation of unemployed persons,
$500,000.
Amount required to provide for monthly
grants-in-aid to the provinces, $17,500,000.
These are obligations we cannot escape.
Under Mines and Reseurces there are a
number of large items, but I think that department needs to be fairly liberally assisted.
For example, I notice this item:
To assist in provision of transportation
facilities into mining areas and to authorize,
subject to the approval of the Governor in
Council, the appointmnent of such extra temporary officers, clerks and eniployees as may
be necessary to carry out the purpose of any
of the following items designated "Special"
under this department, $1,310,000.
Under the Lands, Parks and Forests Branch
there is this item:

For
$1,750,000.
As my right honourable friend will notice,
the wish he has cxprcssed is fairly well carricd
out in the supplementary estimates. Onesixth of the total is being asked for because
some of the expenses will have to be ineurred
forthwith.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIýGHEN: Is there anything for royal commissions?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There may be
something. We have had occasion te express
our views on that matter. and no doubt
shahl have an opportunity to do so again.
[For the present I should net like to take up
too much time for the purpose of justifying
the expenditures.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I have not

rcading.
The items I

have given are froma the supplcmentary estimates.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: They are not

be careful about enterprises under Mines and
Resources. The expenditures may be founded
on rather uncertain and peorly-based optimism.
I notice the Minister is stili vcry hopeful of

COPYRIGHT BILL
REPORT 0F COMMITTEE CONCURRED IN

Hon. R. F. GREEN: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are called, may
I say that whcen I moved adjournment of the
debate last niglit I assumed that further consideration of the amendmcnts te the Copyright Bill would be first on the Order Paper
for to-day. I see it is placed third. I would
ask that iA be taken as the first Order.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it your
pleasure, honourable senators, that Order No.
3 shall now have precedience?
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Carricd.

The House resumed consideration of the
amendments made by the Standing Cernmittee on Banking and Commerce te Bill 12,
an Act to amend the Copyright Amendment
Act, 1931, and the Copyright Act.
Hon. Mr. GREEN: Honourable senaters,
as I said last night, I moved adjournment
after listening to considerable discussion on
the report of the committec. That discussion
reveahed nothing new; it simply cevered al
the points whîch had already been discussed
before the committee and thoroughly threshed
eut. The cemmittec considered all the facts
and weighed aIl the arguments, and its decisions are te be found in the report now
before us.
The honourable leader on the other side of
the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) told us
last night that on behaIf cf thc Governent
he watched the pregress of this Bill threugh
the committee in erder te see that in the
amendznents there should net be an infringement of thc termas of the Berne and Raime
conventions. He added that he was quite
clear that the amcndmcnts had net that
effect.
Clause 4 clearly expresses the conclusion
arrived at by the cemmittee. It is net in any
way centrary te the conventions.
Let us sec who are opposcd te the report.
The honourable senater from Leeds (Hon. Mr.
Hardy) and some other honeurable gentlemen
arc opposing on the ground that the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation would have te pay
something more than it pays now. Welh, if

MAY 24, 1938
so, it will be a very small amount. The
independent broadcasting stations will have
to bear but a small proportion of the extra
amount, and, I submit, will not be injured.
Who else are opposing the report? The
Performing Right Society, whose representatives prate about the "poor authors and composers" being robbed of their pound of
flesh. Are you aware that 90 per cent of
what it collects in Canada is remitted to the
United States, and that about 70 per cent
of that sum goes, not to the authors and composers, but to the producers and publishers?
Those producers and publishers, of course,
claim to hold the copyright. In short, the
portion that goes to the actual author or
composer is small indeed.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: May I ask the honourable senator whether he is aware that the
publishers have to pay royalties to the authors,
unless they have bought the copyright?
Hon. Mr. GREEN: I do not desire to be
interrupted. I will say to the honourable
gentleman opposite that I am quite aware of
the position. I am also aware that the publishers state they hold the copyright in their
own hand. They do not state that Warner
Brothers and similar corporations are getting
about $200,000 a year in royalties. How much
of that money reaches the authors and composers? The Performing Right Society does
not tell you that the first charges against the
moneys it collects are the expenses of collection and office expenses, and the salaries of
the gentlemen who appear before us as representing the society. Nor does it tell you that,
as I said a moment ago, 90 per cent of the
money collected is sent to the United States,
which country is not a party to the Berne
Convention at all; nor that a large proportion
of that 90 per cent goes to the producers and
publishers.
Who are the gentlemen we see around the
corridors of this Chamber? They are the paid
officials of the Performing Right Society and
representatives of the publishers, and agents
paid by them. The paid lobbyists of those
two bodies are around this building day
in and day out, button-holing honourable
senators and urging them to vote against the
Bill. Why? For the reason for which my
honourable friend from Leeds asks us to
oppose the Bill? Not at all. It is because
they want to have control in their own
hands so they may be at liberty to milk the
public of Canada. Do you suppose for one
minute that if they did not want to retain
control, and if the broadcasting stations would
not have to pay large sums of money to the
society, these representatives would be lobby-

389

ing against our amendments? Not on your
life. They are here lobbying in opposition to
the Bill because they know the people of Canada, through the National Broadcasting Corporation, will not pay them any extravagant
sum, and, that being so, they want to retain
the advantage they now have under the
statute.
I do not think I need say anything more,
except this. Do not forget, when you are
voting upon these amendments, that if you
reject section 4 you might just as well kill
the Bill. The Bill would be no good without it.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: It is no good anyway.
Hon. Mr. GREEN: The honourable gentleman says it is no good anyway.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Absolutely.
Hon. Mr. GREEN: That may be his
opinion, but it is not mine, nor do I believe
it is the opinion of this House. The Bill is
good because it is going to protect the people
of Canada from an imposition. Broadcasting
stations now pay for the privilege of broadcasting everything that goes over the air.
Every owner of a receiving set pays a licence
fee of $2.50. And the Performing Right
Society wants a double fee from him if he
allows people to stand at his door and listen
to what is being broadcast.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE:

More than double.

Hon. Mr. GREEN: More than double.
If we throw out section 4 of the Bill as
reported from the committee, we shall be
placing the Bill back in the condition in
which it was when it came before this House.
And we are told by our Law Clerk, as well
as by our two leaders, that in that form
the measure was clearly an infringement
upon the copyright conventions.
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators, may I be allowed a few minutesHon. Mr. GREEN: Honourable members,
I rise to a point of order. The honourable
senator from Westmorland (Hon.. Mr. Black),
Chairman of the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce, sat through every
meeting at which this Bill was considered,
except the last one. The report of the committee was brought in by the acting chairman. Yesterday the chairman spoke on this
motion not merely once, but three times.
Now he wants to speak again.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I ask the privilege of
the House.

I would say
that discussion on this motion bas been more
or less out of order. A number of bonourable members have spoken more than once
on the question, and I think therefore it
would be rather unfair to deny the bonourable gentleman an opportunity of speaking
once more. 1 would ask him to make bis
rernarks> as brief as possible.
Hon. Mr.
Speaker.

BLACK:

Thank

you,

Mr.

Tbe Hon. the SPEAKER:
I would suggest tbat if, when the honourable senator
from Westmorland bas finisbed, the mover
of the motion (Hon. Mr. Griesbacb) were to
.speak, bis remarks would close the debate.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I could bave obtained
thie righit to speak by moving an amendment,
but I djd nlot wisb te do that. I want to
take an opportunity to explain sorne tbings
which. I do not think are quite clear. I
have no brief for the Performing Rigbt
Society, as honourabie members weli know.
I was quite in fax our and arn still in favour
of protccting as many as possible of the
small users from imposition, but I do tbink
that the Bihl as now before us is not a
measure of the kind that bas been passed hy
thîs Senate in days gene by. It is unjust.
1 do flot agree with thie bonourable senator
front Kootenay (Hon. Mr. Green) tbat if
weç fail to adopt the amendments made by
the committec we shall kili the Bill. I arn
satisfied that it can still ho amended so as
te rover the necessities of the situation.

but snay I eall attention tu the tact that xve
did net stop there?

will be -a pretty heavy additional tax. But
the small broadeasters, in the Maritimes and
the West cannot pass on their assessrnents.
The only revenue they have cornes from the
charges they make for -advertising. This new
section 4 might, and I think it would, place
such an additional heavy burden. on the smal
broadcasting stations that they would find it
impossible to carry on. I think that at least
three or four of themn in the Maritimes would
have to close up.
This is not an appeal for the, Perforrning
Right Society. Nor amn I objecting to ail
that was asked for by the- honourable senator
from Kootenýay (Hon. Mr. 'Green). It is
simply a plea on my part that this Chamber
act justly, as it b-as prided itscîf upon doing
in the past. Without rnoving any arnendment. I want to suggest that the best course
wouId be to refer the Bill back to the coinmittee, with a view to havîng the whole
measure straightened out. 1 believe that it
can be straightened out se that no injustice
would be done to anybody. Then the small
users, whom we are trying te protect, would
be in fact protected.
Hon.. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Honourable members, I just want toThe Hon. the SPEAKER: Has the honourable senator already spoken in this debate?
Somne Hon. SENATORS: Yes.
I just
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUTNTON:
want to make one point.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I arn afraid I
shall have to rule that the point of order
raised by -the honeurable senator frorn
Kootenay (Hon. Mr. Green) is well taken,
and that, from, now on, honourable senators
who have already participated in the debate
should not speak further.
Hon.. J. J. DONNELLY: Honourable senators, these are my first remarks in this debate.
I notice4 that the honourable senater from
Westmorland (Hon. .Mr. Black) referred to
the measure as an unjust one. Now, as a
member of the Banking and Commerce Cernmittee who voted for the Bill in its present
form, I do not like it said that the measure
is unjust.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Hear, he-ar.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: I do not think
there was any desire on the part of members
of the coormittee to deprive authors and coinposers of reasonable compensation for their
work, but there was a desire to prevent thern
fromn pyramiding their fees. They already
coileet from the broadcasting stations and frorn
mnanufacturers cf gramophone records.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: And from ail theatres
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: Yes. I contend
that broadcasting stations would have no
value at ail unless there were rcceiving sets.
And I do not tbink there ever was any
justification for enti-tling the Performing Right
Society to collect fees frorn owners of receiving
sets, even if their sets were înztalled in public
places. These people have no option as to
wbat cornes over the air; they do not order
the broadcastiog of any particular pieces of
music.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: May I ask if their
radio sets are not commercial investrnents?
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY:
line of argument.

That is a different

Hon. Mr. HARDY: That is the crux of the
whole matter.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: What I arn pointing eut is th-at they have no say in the mnatter
at all. They do not order the playing of any
particular music; they do flot know what is
going to be broadcast, and therefore I do not
think a fee should be irnposed upon, them.
Surely they are flot supposed to stand around
and turn off the receiving set every time
sorne music cornes over the air.
I want to repeat, as a member of the ceinrnittee, that I do not admit that the coinmittee regarded the Bill as an unjust one.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Griesbach for
concurrence in the report of the committee

of

privity of contract. The Bill would make
this principle applicable to many cases de-

cided by the board before the docision of
the Court of Appeal which held that there
was no privity of conbract between the
original mortgagee and a subsequent purchaser froin his rnortgagor. The application
of this principle would bring within the Act
some fifty-eight cases in Ontario alone. I
think one member said the Bill would open
up about 3,000 cases. In view of these circurnstýances and of tho opinion held by many
honourable members that the Act has outlived its usefulness, and that its operation
should bo restrictcd rather than enlarged, 1
should ho inelined te move a drastie amendment that no further appeals ho heard in any
province after July 1; but I hope the hionourable leader of the Covernment, in the
absence of the honourable senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris), will consent to the Bill being sent to the Banking
and Commerce Committee.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable members, I hiope the honourable leader of the
Hoiise will accept the suggestion. If not, I
shaîl have te move an ameodment. I am convinced that the amendment I have in mind
wuuld ho ini the public interest, but it
should ho movod in the Banking and Commerce Committee, s0 that aIl interested parties may be heard.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, I bad not followed the operation of
the Act very closcly, except te observe the
reaction to it in the various provinces as
stated 'by honotirable senators. Having four
or five other Bills te deal with, I thought the
honourable gentleman from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris) could holp me by presenting
this Bill, for ho had told me ho knew something about the application of the Act. Since
the discussions in this Chamber I have ex:îrnined into the operation of the Act and have
consulted the Minister who presentod the Bill
in the other House.
I unders'tand serieus difficulties have arisen

farm and had himself given a mortgage on it.
In many cases, as a resuit of adverse crop
conditions, the mortgage debt so assumed is
greatly in excess of the farmer's total assots,
inciuding ]and, stock and equipment.
It has been held by the Appeal Court of
Ontario that in these cases the board of review
may formulate a proposai with a view to
adjusting such farmer's debts, but that the
proposai is not effective oi, enforceable against
the mortgagoe.
It is true the proposed amendmont in some
degree widens the scope of the Act in doing
away with this legal technicality. As Supreme
Court judges diffor in their view of this question, and as it is possible that the Suprome
Court of Canada may differ froma the view of
the Appeal Court of Ontario on the subject,
it was deemed advisabio ta mako it clear,
through this amondment, that the Act doos
apply to cases of this type.
The number of these cases in Prince Edward
Island is very smaii indeed.
While 150,782 farmiers approached officiai
receivers with a view to submitting proposais,
oniy 33,640 proposals were actuaily accepted
by officiai receivers. 0f this number more
than 28,000 cases have been disposed of by
roceivers and boards of review in less than
four years. More than 5,000 cases have been
thrown ont by the boards, whileoaver 15,000
cases have heen settled 'by voiuntary and
amicable ar-rangement.
Thc total number af
unflnishied cases at present before boards of
review throughout Canada is 3,891.
In the province of Prince Edward Island
there are oniy 3 cases wbich the board of
review bas not yet deait with.
It appears to have been overiooked entireiy

the Quiebec Farm Loan Board ncarl 'v 1,200

FELICITATIONS ON COMPLETING TWENTY-FIVE
YEARS IN SENATE

Hon. Mr. TANNER presented the report
of the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous
Private Bills on Bill E, an Act respecting
the Restigouche Log Driving and Boom Company, and moved concurrence therein.
He said: Hýonoura:ble members, this Bill

passing this House, àt was sent to the House

amendment and returned the Bill to us. There
is only one section to the Bill, which -reads

whjch is a member of the Company.

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
sonators, with the kind permission of the
House 1 would caîl attention to the fact that
we have presont to-day two honourable colleagues who have been members of this
Chamber for the last twenty-five years.

To these words the bouse of Commons added,
"and of which he is a shareholder."
The Restigouche Log Driving and Boom
Company is composed not of individuals, but
of corporations, and t-here is no share capital.
Consoquently this amendment would seem to
be meaningless. At ail events the committee
came to the conclusion that it was a work of
supererogation. Ail the company desired was
that the corporations which composed the
Restigouche Log Driving and Boom Company should be at liberty to nominate one of
their people to act as a director at its
meetings.
The committee is recommending that the
said amendment bo not concurred in, for the
following reasons:
i. Ail persons who now act as directors of
the central corporation are necessarily individuals who act vicariously, qua the central
corporation, for component corporations, ail
whereof are members of the central corporation.
Ail that the Bill asks for is an enlargement of
the field from whieh a component corporation
may select an agent to execute the duties of
a director.
Hon. Mr. GREEN-

Somo Hon. SENATORS: Hear. hear.
bon. Mr. DANDURAND: I refcr to the
honourable senator from Wentworth (Hon.
E.* D. Smith) and the honourable sonator
from South Bruce (bon. Mr. Donnelly). As
I have had occasion to state in the past, the
Sonate constitutes what is virtually a family,
ail its members working together, year after
year, in the execution of their parliamentary
duties. The atmosphere here is congenial. We
feel that we are membors of the Sonate
pormanently, although wo know we have not
immortality. To work with one's colleagues
for t.weniy-five years in this bouse, wbere we
are free from political and eloctoral turmoil,
is, I think, a great priviloge. I am one of
those who have enjoyed the company of these
two honourable gentlemen during that quarter
of a century. Nover during those twenty-five
years have I had occasion to differ with them
excopt in vory special circumstances, and
always I admired and respocted their sincerity
and sound judgment.
The honourable member from Wentwortb
(Hon. Mr. Smith), the senior of our two colleagues, cornes from the vcry interesting
Niagara district, wbich may ho doscribed as
the gardon of Ontario-thougb 1 may ho
told there are other similarly favoured parts
in that groat province. Ho bas brought to us
bis experience and bis intimate knowledge of
the business community whicb surrounds him,
and we have always listened, with great advantage to ourselves, when ho bas discussed
matters affecting bis district.
Similar remarks apply to the bonourable
sonator from South Bruce (Hon. Mr. Donnelly). Like the honourable gentleman fromn
Wentworth, ho bas given us the benefit of

business interests, and of conclusions based on

for the country at large.
I thank Providence that I have had the

t.he past twenty-five years, and I feel I arn
speaking for ail their colleagues-and I know
rny riglit honourable friend (Right Han. M.r.
Meighen) will join rne-when I say that we
have enjoyed the cornpany of these two
honourable gentlemen every day they have
been in this House. I hope they may remain
here another twenty-five years as an inspiration ta those who are to corne after us.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Rear, hear.
Right Hon. ARTHUIR MEI'GHEN: Honourable members, it is toa often aur lot ta
be called on to. express aur appreciation
of aur colleagues after they have passed from
our midst. It is a rare privilege, tho.ugh, ta
say sarnething for thern while they are still
with us. Twenty-five years-a quarter of a
century-is a great space in the life of man,
but I well recaîl the occasion when the honourable gentlemen fromn Wentworth (Han. E. D.
Smith) and South Bruce (Hon. Mr. Donnelly) were elevated ta this Chamber. The
bonourable gentleman frorn South Bruce was
elected to the other House in the samne year
in which I had the honour of becorning a
member. The honourahie gentleman frorn

for the soundest of common sense, as most
problems in this life do, I know of na counsellor ta wham I should go more con.fidently
than ta either of these gentlemen.

of the House aur felicitations ta theni bath,
and our sincere appreciation of what bas been
said by the honourable leader of the House
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) in directing our
thoughts ta this happy event.
Hon. E. D. SMITH: Ho-nourable rnerbers, I find myseif much embarrassed in
attempting ta express my deep appreciation
of the kindly remarks of the two leaders
of this House. It is no great event at ai
ta complete twenty-five years of membership
in the Senate. The uniqueness of the occasion is in the fact that we- bath became senstors on the samne day. There are only five
mernbers now in this Chamber who were
here when we werc introduced. It is no0 wonder
we bave remained here for twentyfive years:
the atmosphere of this Chamber is s0 agreeable that it is an inducement ta peaple ta

Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: The presentation of
these lovely flowers, and the remarks that
have been made, are ta me a surprise equalled
only by the surprise I gat twenty-five years
ago ta-day when, sitting at my desk, very
tired, I received a telegrarn frorn the Right
Honourable Mr: Borden, later Sir Robert
Borden, asking me ta take a seat in the
Senate. 0f course nobody will believe me,
I presume, when I say that it was a surprise
and I hesitatedSome Hon. SENATORS:

imagine, after giving the matter due consideration I sent an affirmative reply.

Oh, oh.

The only ather remnaining senator is my
desk-mate (Mon. Mr. Gordon). Hie brauglit
ta this Chamber a very ripe business experience as a successful business mnan. I have
always had a great deal of respect for him,
and as a resuit of thirty years of close association with him, bath ini the House of
Commons and in the Senate, that respect is
caupled with a considerable amount of personal affection.
Looking back twenty-five years, I remember that there were ini this Chamber many
men who had been very active in the
political if e of Canada. 1 recall Sir James
Lougheed, Sir Mackenzie Bowell, Sir George
Ross, Sir Richard Cartwright, Senator Bolduc,
Senlator Boucherville, Senator Mackay, whose
daughter is naw the senator from Rockcliffe
(flan. Mrs. Wilson); and there are many
others I could mention with whom I had
the privilege of associating during my early
experience in the Senate.
During that time many pramninent men Who
we.re appointed ta the Senate and served faithfully have passed on. These include Sir George
Foster, Sir Edward Kemp, Senator Murphy,
Senator Reid, Senator Béland, Senator
Lemieux and many -others. It was a great
privilege ta have been assaciated with them.
Speaking of senators, while I was a member of the flouse of Gommons I had the
privilege cd attending a reception given by
the lato Senator Wark, fromn New Brunswick,
who was borci in 1804, and who gave a little
reception on his one hundredth birthday.
I consider it a great privilege to. have been
present on that occasion.
Now, just a word ici regard to the work of
the Sonate. If there are senators present
who become alarmed when they hear people
talk about reforming or abolishing the Senate,
I can toil them that long beo re I became à
-member of the Senate I heard similar suggestions in the flouse of Gommons. But they
neyer took effect.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Probably yau were not
favourâble ta thom.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: Perhaps not. The
Sonate, in spite of criticism, ha carried on
the work: which. the framers of Confederation
desired it ta carry on. It is cbarged, because
we are flot elected, that this is an irrospan-

sible body. I do nat think there is anything
in that charge. 1 think every hanourable
memfber of this flouse feels, as I do myseif,
that aur appaintment has placed upon us a
very great responsibility, and that we are
bound at ail times, if we wish to> retain aur
self-respect, ta perform aur duties in such a
manner as to serve the best interests cf the
country at large.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: I think I may
say that at no time during the past twentyfive years thas the Senate stood higher in the
estimation of the people of this country than
it stands at the present time. Ini my opinion
one of the reasons for that, ta some extent at
ail events, is the -presence here of the right

attention of the Government ta a series of
press dispatches wbicb deal with the construction of a highway tbroughouit the province of
British Columbia into Alaska. These dispatches set out that negotiations have been
canducted directly between the Premier of
British Columbia and the United States Government, and the basis of the negotiations is
that the United States Government will advanoe the money necessary for the construction of the highway through the province of
British Columbia.
I desire ta, ask the Government wbether

RAILWAY WAGES
INQUIRY

On the notice of inquiry by Hon. Mr.
Casgrain:
That he will inquire of the Government:
1. What was the total amount paid for wages
by all the railways operating in Canada in the
year 1914?
2. What was the total amount paid for wages
by all railways operating in Canada in the
year 1917?
3. What was the total amount paid for
wages by all railways operating in Canada in
the year 1937?
4. That he will call the attention of the
Senate to those figures.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

Mr.

DANDURAND:

When

the

honourable senator from Alma (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne) moved adjournment of the debate
he did not intend to speak himself, but thought
the right honourable leader on the other side
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), who was then
absent, would like to take part. The right
honourable gentleman, who is absent to-day
also, has not expressed any such desire to me.
It may be that ho wanted to speak on the
constitutionality of the measure, though he
bas not so suggested. We have the opinion
of the Department of Justice that the measure
is within the competence of the Federal
Government, and this opinion is concurred in
by the Law Clerk of the Senate. I would
suggest that the Bill be given second reading

and referred to a committee. If that is done,
the right honourable leader on the other side
may speak on the motion for third reading
should he so desire.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: We reserve the
right to speak on the principle of the Bill,
of course.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Very well.
The motion for second reading of the Bill
was agreed to, and the Bill was read the

RAILWAY WAGES
DISCUSSION

On the motion to adjourn:
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable senators,
may I be pardoned if I refer, particularly for
the -benefit of my honourajble friend who is
leading the other side this afternoon (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien), to the answers which were
given a few moments ago to the questions
asked 'by the honourable senator from De
These
Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain).
figures show that the wages paid to men on
the railways of Canada in 1914 were, in round
figures, $111,000,000; in 1917, 8129,000,000, and
Now, it looks as if
in 1937, $193,000,000.
there was, and of course there was, a remarkable increase between 1917 and 1937. If the
honourable senator had asked with reference
to the year 1918 or 1919 instead of 1917, the
answer would have been materially different,
because the McAdoo award went into effect
on the railways of Canada as of July, 1918.
In other words, the figures would have shown
a much greater incresse between 1914 and
1918 than between 1914 and 1917.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There should be
an explanation of the large increase from
1917 to 1937. I cannot supply it. The extent
of the increase has surprised me. I do not

401

know whether or not there was a greater
number of employees in 1937 than Viwenty
years before. It would be interesting to learn
the reason for the step up in wages, and we
may dibtain this in the Special Railway
Committee.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Honourable senators,
I trust the Special Railway Committee will
ask for full information as to the wages of
railway employees. There is no doubt that
a great many people in this country attach
deep importance to that subject. I do not
want to enter into it now-indeed, I do flot
think I am qualified to enter into it now-but
I may say that I received a few days ago a
letter calling attention to the increase in
railway wages over the la.st twenty years.
Numerous people consider that the deficits on
our railways are due largely to the fact that
members of railway labour unions receive very
high wages in comparison with what is paid
to persons in similar occupations in other
industries.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: In the textile
industry, for instance?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I do not want to
go into details, but I think that a great many
people feel that our rail-ways have been brought
to their present condition chiefly because
railway labour unions, through their political
strength, have obtained special treatment for
their members. I am not qualified to say
whether that is true or not; I simply refer to
it as a point that is often raised. It is also,
stated that railway wages have been tremendously increased by the regulations which
govern the working day. For instance, I have
been told that for an engineer on a freight
train 100 miles of travel constitute one day.
I do not think I am makîng a mistake in this,
but if I am there is someone present who will
correct me, just as surely as the sun is shining.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: More surely
than that.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: And I understand
that for an engineer on a passenger train,
125 miles, or perhaps 150, make a day. I will
say 150 miles, to, be on the safe side.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: For coeiduc tors,
baggagemen and 'brakemen on passenger
trains, 150 miles make a day; 'but engineers
on passenger trains have practically the same
length of day as engineers on freight trains.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: As I
do not want to go into details.

ways. Many of them are travelling a very
difficult road, undergoing a great deal of
misery, and they wonder why a conductor is
paid such wages. The work of a conductor is
not very difficult. He is on a route from
Montreal to Toronto, let us say, a distance of
about 325 miles-

may very well save Canada more than that
amount every year for a great many years
to come.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: It will succeed.
The Senate adjourned until Monday, May
30, at 8 p.m.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: It is 334.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: We will say 325.
That is not very difficult. He walks quietly
through his train. He smiles at his passengers,
helps them with their parcels, takes their
tickets and sometimes sells them tickets and
makes an entry in a little book. He is not
much thinner at the end of his day's work
than when he began. When he has completed
the 325 miles, as he does in six and a half
hours, it is computed as two day's work.
Compare his position with that of the man
in our province, at any rate, who tills the soil.
He is working from the moment the sun rises
until it goes down, and he gets but a miserable
living. Do you wonder that sometimes
people think that the conductor's wages are
excessive? I do not pronounce any opinion
in that respect. No doubt the question of
responsibility enters into his remuneration.
A great many people depend upon his judgment, upon his familiarity with his run. But
I do say that this is a very serious question,
and I trust the committee will go deeply into
it. If it does not, the majority of our people
will some day insist that it be dealt with,
because, after all, the opinion prevails from
one end of the country to the other that railway men are a privileged class. Now, is that
view justified or not?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask the
honourable gentleman one question?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I am not qualified
to speak on it at al]. We shall find out.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: This is the thirtyninth sitting of the Senate. We have received two days' pay for every day we have
sat. Is that just?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
we postpone the discussion.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I am not prepared
to estimate the value of what the Senate

honourable House did save the country more
than $30,000,000. If it succeeds in finding
a solution for the problem which the Special
Railway Committee is now investigating, it

setting forth the report of the Department of
Finance on the operation of the Farmers'
Creditors Arrangement Act since its inception
to March 31, 1938.
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourable senators,
may I remind the honourable junior member
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) that in the
early part of this session a report was made
to the flouse of Commons showing the
operation of the Act from its inception to
March 31, 1937. I suggest to him that he
divide his motion into two parts, the first to
cover the period included in tbat report, and
the second to cover the operations from
March 31, 1937, to March 31, 1938.
The
second part might involve some clerical work,
but in the meantime we could have the
part covered in the first report, which is very
informative.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
If the report
whicb my honourable friend speaks of bas
been printed and distributed, then his suggestion may very well be adopted. Otherwise I think the notice of motion should
stand.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: The report to which
I refer bas been printed. I have seen it.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:

Is it a separate

report?

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: It is a distinct report showing the operation of the Act from
its inception to March 31, 1937. I applied
for a copy at the Distribution Office, but
could not get any, there being no more copies
available.

Honourable senators,
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
if the honourable leader of the buse finds
there is such a report to the end of the
fiscal year 1936-37, hie can bring it down,
and Inter on supply the further information
to the end of Iast March.
That is wbat I
Hon. Mr. HUGHES:
suggest. In the meantirne we shall bave the
first report, whieh contains a great deal of
information.
RAILWAY WAGES
ACCURACY 0F BROADCAST

QUESTIONED

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK:
Honourable
senators, on Friday evening last the Canadian Press in its il o'clock broadcast gave out
this piece of information:
A request for inquiry into the wages received
by Canadian railway workers on the ground
that they are excessive was made before a
Senate committee at Ottawa to-day.
Senator Charles Beaubien, of Montreal, said
that people throughout the country have the
impression railwaymen are a privile-ged class
in the matter of wages. and that their labour
unions exercise political power to get special
treatrnent.
The committee was informed that wages
received by ail workers on Canadian railways
jurnped from almost $112,000,000 in 1917 to
$193,000,000 in 1937, an increase of approximately $81,000,000 in twenty years. Senator
Beaubien referred to farmers who work long
and arduous hours, and asked that the coinmittee consider the question.
On Saturday morning I got ini toucb with
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and
took exception to two or three of these sbatements, which in my opinion are entirely in
error. On Saturday evening, May 28, the
Canadian Press undertook to correct the statement wbich had been made on Friday evening, and in so doing were once more in rather
serious error if we can regard a mistake of
forty odd millions in a total as being rather
serious.
The Canadian Press, on Saturday evening,
stated that the wages received by all workers
on Canadian railways in 1937 were $139,000,000. While I have not, received frorn the
Dominion Bureau of Statistics the figures
showing the actual payments made to Canadian, railway employees in 1937, 1 arn quite
sure that the statement is in serions error
from the fact that Mr. Coats, of the Dominion
Bureau o.f Statisties, on March 5 last advised

that in 1936 there were on. Canadian railways 132,781 employees whose total earnings
were $182,638,365. It is qiîite obvious, I think,
that, $182,000,000 in 1936 had flot been reduced to $139,000,000 in 1937.

POST OFFICE BILL (NEWSPAPER
OWNERSHIP)
SECOND READING

Hon. JAMES MURDOCK moved the
second reading of Bill 20, an Act to amend
the Post Office Act (Newspaper Ownership).
He said: Honourable senators, this Bill came
to the Senate from another place on March
17, and for more than two months, although
apparently the Bill passed unanimously in that
other placeHon. Mr. DANDURAND:

In the House

nf Communs. It could corne only from there.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Apparently it was
unanimously passcd in the House of Commons,
but when it came here nohody stood sponsor
for it. It was suggested to me that it would
seem discourteous to the House of Commons
if a Bill passed ýby that House were not given
an opportunity to run the gauntlet of the
Senate of Canada. I a;m aware tbat this
particular Bill bas been before tbe Senate on
several occasions in past years and bas been
defeated. I bave no special remarks to make
as to tbe propriety or necessity of the Bill, and
I arn not sure bow it, would be worked out
for the benefit of the Canadian people if it
were passcd; but I sponsor it and bring it
before the Senate for the reasons wbicb I
have stated.
I move tbe second reading of thbe Bill.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, the Senate has had this measure
before it for consideration four or five sessions,
I believe. I hope I arn not exaggeratingRight Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: You neyer do.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The measure
bas corne to us fromn tbe other House. I do
not know wbether on every previous occasion
it received general approval in that House,
but I understand that this session, and perhaps

104

SENATE

last session as well, it was adopted there
unanimously. I take it for granted that the
other Chamber, after careful study and consideration, found the Bill contained sufficient
menit to justify its adoption.

Bill, for the reasons givon last session, but I
am wholly in accord with its boing givon
second reading and reforrod te the Committoe
on Private Buis, by wbem aIl parties can
ho hoard.

Riglit Hon. Mr. MEJOHEN: It is now that
the honourable gentleman is exaggerating.

Hon. Mr. COTE: Last year the Biii was
referred te the Cemmittoo on Banking and
Commerce, and the members ef that cernmitteo are fully awaro of wbat then took
place. I amn wondering wbether it would net
be advisable te sond the Biii te the same
committoe new. After ail, it is a public Bill.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Well, I take it
for granted that the Bill was given due consideration hy the other Huse. This Chamber
cannot do othorwise than treat it from that
point of view. My suggestion would be that
without binding ourselves to accept the principle of the measure we should give it second
reading and send it to one of our standing
eommittees-the Committee on Miscellaneous
Private Bis would perhaps be the appropriate
one-wbere the prometers of the proposed
legislation could teli us ivbat they consider
the need for it is, and what effect it would
have on the parties concerned. I make that
suggestion because I do not believe it would
ho good form for the Senate to divide on a
Bill that hias corne to us from the bouse of
Comniions for tho fourth or fifth consecutive
ycar. until we have studied it carefully. We
should expeet as much of the Commons with
respect to any bill originating bore.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I would suggest that
the mover of the second reading (Hîon. Mr.
Murdock) sbould givo somo explanation of
the Bill. R1e says that hie hias sponsorod it
here more or less as a matter of courtesy.
The practice is for an honourable membor
who moves second reading to toil what the
rîleasure is about. I tbink thc House is entitled te that information.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Why pick on me?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:

the

Riglit Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: I think
the lionourable senator from Parkdale (Hon.
Mr. Murdonk) acted properly in sponsoring the
measure. It would be unfortunate if a measuro
of this kind ceuld net find a sponsor here.
Tbeugh intreducod in another place by a
private member, it is net in any sense liko a
private bill promoted on bohaîf of a person
or cempany. This would affect the public as
à wboe.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It is a public
Biii spünsored by a privato member.
Right Hon. Mr. MEJOHEN: Yes. On that
accounit it secins te me quite proper thero
should ho a sponsor fer it bore, even in the
unlikely event of thiere bcing ne sincere supporter. I arn epposed te the princîple of the
lon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hen. Mr. HARDY: The Dill, I tbink, was
referred te the Banking and Commerce Ceinmittee at a time whoen virtually every measure
wvas being suhmitted te that cemmittee; even
the Pure Foed Bill. I bieard the right hionourable gentleman meve that the Bill ho referred te the Banking and Commerce Cernmittee, and only after a protost wvas it sent
te another place. I think the Danking and
Commerce Cemmittee lias quito enough work
te do this year without having te consider
this Bill, wbich bias nothing wbatever te do
with cither banking or cemmerce,
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: In doference te,
my bonourable fricnd the senier senater from
Winnipeg (Hen. Mr. MeMeans), rnay I state
that the objeet of tbis Bili is te require in
the public interest that the narnes and addi-esse o'cf the ownni.s, pditnrs, publishers and
stockbholdcrs cf newspapers and periedicais

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: It is tbe only class

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Could that net

MAY 30, 1938
Hon. Mr. COTE: Subsection 2 would require that paid editorials or other reading
inatter be marked "advertisement," and failure to comply with this requirement would
render the editor or publisher liable 'te a penalty. This strictly would be criminal law,
and if such a provision were passed it should
be embodied in the Criminal Code, flot inserted in a Bill under the pretence of amending the Post Office Act.

Thot he will draw the attention of the

building of a military strategie rossi through

the United States in time of war?

3. What is the attitude of the Federal Government wîth respect thereto?

Edmonton <Hon. Mr. Griesbach) intends to
draw the attention of the Senate to press
despatches regarding the construction of a

SENATE

Columbia into Alaska.
The notice also
contains three questions. I have answers to
these, and if the honourable gentleman is
agreeable I will give them now.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Give them now.
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND:

The answers

are as follows:

1. There have been no negotiations concerning the building of a military strategic road
through the province of British Columbia.
2. Various proposals relating to the possibility of constructing a highway from British

Columbia through the Yukon Territory to
Alaska have been advanced during the last
few years. In 1930 the United States Government appointed a commission to discuss, in
co-operation with the Canadian authorities,
the feasibility of constructing such a road.

On the understanding that the discussions
were to be of a purely fact-flnding nature, the
Canadian Government agreed to participate
and the meeting was held in Victoria, British
Columbia, in October, 1931. At this conference it was decided that the construction of
such a highway would be feasible from an
engineering standpoint. The attitude of the
Dominion Government and of the Government of the Province of British Columbia was
made clear later in the same month. The two
governments agreed that the cost of construction made any further action under existing
conditions quite impracticable.
Some time ago the United States Government approached the Canadian Government
with a suggestion that a further joint study
of the project be undertaken. Within the
last ten days legislation has been passed by
the United States Congress authorizing the
President to appoint an Alaskan International
Highway Commission to meet with any
similar body which may be nominated in the
Dominion of Canada, for the purpose of
studying the location, construction, and plans
for the financing and maintenance, of such a
highway. The Commission is to report to the
President within two years.
No official
proposals resulting from this legislation have
yet been received by the Canadian Government.
This matter bas also been a subject of
informal discussion between the Prime Minister of Canada and the Premier of the
Province of British Columbia.
3. The matter is still under consideration.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

FARMERS'

ARRANGE-

NOTICE OF MOTION

On the notice of motion by Hon. Mr. Haig:
That an order do issue for a statement setting
forth the report of the Department of Finance
on the operation of the Farmers' Creditors
Arrangement Act since its inception to March
31, 1938.
I understand
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
that the report on the Farmers' Creditors
Arrangement Act for the year ended March 31,
1938, will be laid on the Table in both Houses
some time this week; perhaps to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That will be entirely
satisfactory. Would the honourable leader
procure at the same time a copy of the report or return-I think it is No. 82-filed in
the other House on January 18, 1938? It contains the information I really wanted.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Does it deal

Act? I may say that the new report will
contain a complete statement covering the
period from the inception of the Act in 1934
to March 31, 1938.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: There is something which
will not be covered in that report, but which
is in the return tabled in the other House.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If my honourable friend will give me a sufficiently clear
description of the document, I will procure it.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Honourable senators,
with regard to the suggestion of the honourable junior senator from Winnipeg (Hon.

think the number is 82.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: The return covered
the period from the inception of the Act
to the 31st March, 1937.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I know. It was asked for
in January of this year. It gives certain facts
about the operation of the Act since its in.ception.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The number is 98
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Yes, House of Commons sessional paper 98. The honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) stated that
if the honourable junior senator from Winnipeg would define what he wanted, a copy
would be obtained. Now, I am defining it as
House of Commons sessional paper No. 98,
and I also should like to have a copy.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: We all should like to
get copies.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should like
to know if it is a report on the Farmers'

Act for 1937-1938 will be laid on the Table
of this House and the other House to-day or
to-morrow, and that it will contain the
whole of the information that was in the
document laid on the Table of the other
House last year and is now asked for by my
honourable friends from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Haig) and King's (Hon. Mr. Hughes).
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: No; it was in January of this year.
All right. If
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the 1938 report does not contain all the information, then I shall try to get a copy of
the earlier document. In fact, there is a copy
on the table in my room just now. But if
its contents are in the 1938 report, the House
will not have to consider reprinting that
earlier document.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Will the honourable
gentleman give me a copy of the complete
report?
ST. LAWRENCE SHIP CANAL

Orders of the Day.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Then, that gives
me a chance to speak. I am not going to
make a speech, though. I read in the Montreal
Gazette this morning that some people want
to resurrect that old corpse known as the St.
Lawrence Ship Canal. I think the new proposition is that the United States should go
ahead with the building of the canal. Now,
the spending of money here by the United
States would mean giving certain rights to
that country. Any honourable member who
is interested in this matter can look back
in Hansard and find out all about it, for I
dealt with it many years ago. The Americans
want to be granted a licence over a strip
five or ten miles wide, on both sides of the
St. Lawrence, from Ontario to the Atlantic,
and over that strip the Stars and Stripes
would flySome Hon. SENATORS: No, no.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I have a right to

will mean more time f aken up.
I refer
honourable members to Hansard, where they
will find ail this set out. The Americans
wanted a strip five or ten miles wide, extending from Ontario to the AtlanticHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Who wanted
Lt?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The United States.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Who said so?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The United States.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I beg your pardon.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: Whien?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Read Hansard. I
will hring it to you.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Who said it?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Now, nine-tenths
of that canal would be in my province. We
do not want the Stars and Stripes flying over
our province. It would flot be the first time
that we objected. In 1775 every Englishspeaking North American colony turned
traitor to the Empire. la that right?
Some Hon. SEN_'ATORS: -No.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The only colonists
who remained faithful were the French
Canadians.
Why?
Because the Catholic
clergy of Montreal would flot join the rebellinus colonists. The clergy feit that those
coionists would not respect the grant made
by Louis XIV in 1660 to the gentlemen of
St. Sulpice. whereby they were given the Island
of Montreal on condition that there should be
no tithes levied and no church fees. Nobody
can contradict that. It is history. If anybody
doubts my statement, hie can go to the Parliamentary Library and study the history of that
t' me.
To-day we have the UJnited States requesting Canada to join them in building the St.
Lawrence Ship Canal. That is a proposition
that should be debated in an insane asylum.
I challenge any honourable senator to bring
forward one sea-going captain to state that
ships of 8,000 or 10,000 tons can be navigated
economically in restricted waters. If any
honourable member eau bring forward two
sea-faring captains, or even one, to say that it
can be done, I wilI how rny head and neyer
say another word in opposition to the projeet.
I have entertained sea-faring captains, and
Bion

Mr. CASGRAIN.

they have told me that if the canal were built
and they were asked to take a ship to Port
Arthur or Fort William, they would say:
"Here is my resignation. Appoint another
captain." It would take considerably longer
te, go fromn Montreal to Fort William than
fromn Montreal to Liv erpool.
This canal
scheme is crazy. It lias no right to exist. It
ivas rejected by the Senate of the United
States. In the official report of the dehate
in the Sonate at Washington, which I read, I
found whole paragraphs taken word for word
from my speech in this flouse as recorded in
our ilansard. My namne is neyer mentioned,
but, thank God, somebody saw to it that my
speech got to those United States senators.
They made good use of Lt: they knocked out
the Bill.
Before I die I want to see this project dead.
Ail I ask is that in reply to any request from
the Government of the United States for
permission to huild things in Canada and to
hring in their troops to proteet their interests,
Canada should say, "No." And she should
say so now; not wait until the situation has
become involved. Our Government should
say right now, "We do not want you to corne
to Canada." Honourable members know very
well what would happen if the United States
insisted. In this connection let me quote
what Sir Rodolphe Forget used to say s0
often: "The only thing we could do if the
United States wanted to march into Canada
would be to telephone to them, 'Corne in,
but don't break anything.'
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
Honourable senators will realize that my honourable
friend from De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) has disrcgarded both the procedure and
the ethics of this Chamber in raising an
international question. Such an important
question should not be treated so lightly as
the honourable gentleman has treated it.
I told him that hie was out of order, but I
did not insist upon a decision fromn the
Chair. I desire to register a strong protest
against the wild statements made touching
a document which has not yet reached us
except through the press. I do so because
I feel that I should protect the reputation
of our Parliament in any matter of international import, and particularly when it concerns our neighbours to the south.

FARMERS' CREDITOIIS ARRANGEMENT ACT
INCOMPLETE RETURN

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourable senators,
referring to the report tabled yesterday with
respect to the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, I would point out that there is a
schedule missing which was contained in the
report submitted to the Commons last January. The honourable leader of the Senate,
if I mistake net, stated that the report to be
submitted to us would include a summary
of the proceedings from the inception of the
Act to Mareh 31, 1938. Some of the sehedules
in the report tabled yesterday do contain
such a summary, but others do not. In
order te understand the question it is necessary that we have also the report submitted
to the Commons last January. This later
report, for instance, omits a sehedule showing the expenses of the head office at Ottawa
for the fiscal year 1937-38.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Do you want
that?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I want that. In addition, I want the report which was tabled
in the Commons hast January.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 0f which yeu
have a copy.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I had, but, as it was
lent t.ome, I bad to ratura.it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will lend you
My copy.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Thanks. In my opinion
the inembers ef this House cannot understand the question properly unless they have
both reports before them. I wouhd suggest,
therefore, that we have a siifficient nuimber
of copies of both reports printed.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Carried.

we compared together lately. and the director

of the board.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
May 1 suggest
to my honourable friend that if he dioes not
wish to get the report printcd he could perhapýs have four or five copies made available
to us? It is fot possible during the sitting
of a committee to take a report of forty
or fifty pages and find out, right on the spur
of the moment, what you want to get out
of it. If there were even one copy available, anyone who studied it couid obtain what
is ess;-ential and could then pass the report
over to soiebody else w-ho is interested.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will get fromn
the Departmnent of Fioaoýce ail the copies it
has. The honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr.
Hughes) state-. there is onlv one sheet missmgý

thousands of dollars, and most of them we
throw into the waste-paper basket; but when
we ask for copies of a report in which we

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: There is really more

froma those of the report tahled in the Gemmons last January.
It takes a little time

growing old frorn the lack of air ini that

obtainable except frorn the courtyard. In
the winter tirne this may be ail right, but
when the season changes and the hot weather
cornes it is almost impossible to sit in that
room for any length of time without being
seriously affected. The Senate at the present
time is considering an expenditure for the
further dissemination of wbat might be
termed "hot air," and I should like to ask the
leader of the Government if he will flot take
up with the Departrnent of Publie Works
the question of conditioning the air in the
railway cornmittee roorn of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I shall see the
Minister of Public Works on this matter. The
atmosphere of that cornrittee room has been
improved during the winter, but I understand
that when the windows are open the conditioning mechanisrn is of no avail. I shall bring
to the attention of the Department of Public
Works the fact that the atmosphere in that

over tbe composition of that committee I
find that there is no representative from the

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would draw
the attention of honourable members to the
fact that quite a numnber of bills, some public
and some private, have been referred to
various committees. I should expect persons
interested in those bills to communicate witb
Mr. Hinds, Chief Clerk of Committees, and
be ready to proceed next week, preferably
Tuesday and Wednesday. 0f course, if it is
necessary to extend sittings of the committees
to Tbursday, we shall do so. I wish to remind
honourable members that next week we shail

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Early next week.
The Senate adjourned until Monday, June 6,
at 8 p.m.

The supply in French is etill ample. I bave
conferred with the leader of the House, and
it bas been suggested that instead of waîting
for the cornmittee to pass a resolution to be
presented to the House, I might venture to
move, seconded by the joint chairman of the
committee (Hon. Mr. Be'aubien), that 200
extra copies in Englisb be printed. I may
say that, as the type is all standing, the
prin-ting -will be only a smaîl matter. I therefore moye, seconded by Hon. Mr. Beaubien,
witb the leave of the Senate:
That the Special Committee on the Railway
Condition in Canada be authorized to print
200 additional copies of its day-to-day proceedings, and that rule 100 be suspended in s0 far

The motion was agreed to.
CANADA

SHIIPPING BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bi-I 9, an Act to amend the
Canada Shipping Act, 1934.
He said: Honourable senators, tbe purpose

THE SENATE

of this Bill is to en-able the Government of
Canada to control the carrying of munitions

Monday, June 6, 1938.
The Senate met et 8 p.m., the Speaker in
the Chair.
Prayers and routine proceedings.

by ships registered in Canada, to countries
that are engaged in war or civil confliet. It
is complementary to an Act which we passed
lest year.
This Bill was prepared for the last session,
but, as that session was sbortened on account

412

SENATE

of the Coronation and Imperial Conference
proceedings, it became impracticable to introduce it then.
It will be recalled that during last session
Parliament amended section 290 of the Customs Act in order, among other things, to
modernize and make more effective the longstanding power to control the export from
Canada of arms and munitions of war, including articles capable of being converted, thereinto or made useful in the production thereof.
That amendment was the result of careful
inquiries conducted by the Government into
the proceedings of the committee of the
Geneva Disarmament Conference which had
studied the international traffic in arms and
munitions. The actual practice of other countries in the same field was also considered.
Last year's legislation, so far as the control
of exports is concerned, placed Canada in line
with many other countries throughout the
world, including Great Britain and the United
States and the western European countries.
In pursuance of that legislation the Government, also in line with the practice of the
countries mentioned, has established a licensing system covering a specified list of arms,
ammunition and implements of war. This
list is in general conformity with a list which
was compiled by the committee of the Disarmament Conference and with similar lists
adopted by other countries. The result is
that none of the arms or other articles specified
in the list can be exported from Canada
without a licence issued by the Department
of National Revenue. The applicant for such
a licence is required to give full information
regarding the proposed export, and upon his
furnishing this information the licence is issued,
except in cases where a duly authorized restriction has been placed upon exports to the
proposed destination. The result of such
licensing systems established by various countries is that information becomes readily available as to the extent and character of the
trade in arms.
In further pursuance of last year's amendment of the Customs Act, an Order in Council
was passed at the end of July, 1937, specifically
prohibiting the export to Spain of this list of
arms, munitions and imiplements of war; so
that no licences can be granted for such
export to Spanish territory. As is well known,
twenty-seven European countries were engaged
in an effort to carry out a non-intervention
agreement respecting the Spanish conflict. Most
honourable members know also that the effort
of the non-intervention committee has to a
large extent met with failure. The agreement, whatever may be said as to evasions
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

of it, contemplated that the countries concerned should refrain from supplying arms
and implements of war to either side of that
conflict. It is understood that the broad aim
of the agreement is to prevent other countries
from becoming embroiled, and thus to prevent
the conflict from spreading. It was also hoped
to shorten the conflict. Canada is not a party
to the non-intervention agreement; but it is
no part of Canadian policy to intervene in the
Spanish conflict, and it was undesirable to
leave Canada in the position of seeming to
sanction activities which might to some extent
defeat or run counter to the purposes of the
agreement and to the general policy of neutrality. Accordingly, the Order in Council of
last July was passed. It will be recalled that
earlier in the year the United States Government had also prohibited the export of a
similar list of arms and implements of war
to Spain or Spanish territory. The United
States are not a party to the non-intervention
agreement.
The expediency of the present Bill aiso
arises from the general situation as already
explained. More immediately its preparation
was suggested by various incidents affecting
shipping which have occurred from time to
time since the beginning of the Spanish conflict.
When the Bill is carefully examined, however, in relation to our existing law and to
the actual state of Canadian shipping, it will
be found that its practical effect has only a
narrow scope. The Bill gives power to exercise a certain control over the activities of
Canadian ships-that is to say, ships on Canadian registry-that might get involved in
some incident of an international conflict.
Two situations have to be considered in this
connection. The first situation is where a ship
carries arms or munitions of war shipped from
a Canadian port and destined for countries
or regions which are in a state of war or
conflict. Practically speaking, that situation
can already be completely controlled under
section 290 of the Customs Act as amended
last session; because whenever a proper case
arises shipments of such goods from Canadian ports, whether by ships on Canadian
registry or on any other registry, can be prevented under the power to prohibit exporta
from Canada. The second situation is where
a Canadian ship trading abroad might, at
some foreign port, accept a cargo of such
warlike articles for carriage to some other
foreign country or region then engaged in
war or conflict. That is a situation which
it is possible for Canada 'to control, since
Canada possesses jurisdiction over the activities of her own merchant ships wherever they

JUNE 6, 1938
may be. It is that situation which the Bill
therefore is primarily intended to cover, though
incidentally, to be consistent, it includes a like
power over Canadian ships trading from Canadian ports. It may further be noted that in
actual fact Canada has no great merchant
marine engaged in trade between foreign ports
and aither foreign ports.
But while, as I have stated, the Bill may
have only a narrow practical effect, it is
considered useful to have this precautionary
power on the Statute Book in case necessity
arises and in order to be able to ensure, if
desirable, that Canada may not run counter
to some international policy adopted by
other countries with which Canada may agree.
The broad object might be regarded as twofold: to be able in appropriate cases to
avoid what might be taken as a Canadian
public policy of intervention in some conflict, and to be able to prevent Canadian
registered ships, for their own sake, from
getting into difficult situations.
It may be noted that this proposal is in
line with measures taken by other countries.
In December, 1936, the Parliament of the
United Kingdom adopted similar legislation,
known as the Merchant Shipping (Carriage
of Munitions to Spain) Act, 1936. The scheme
of the present Bill gives a general power of
control in such situations, rather than a power
confined to one particular situation. Under
the neutrality legislation of the United States
a similar kind of control over United States
shipping is provided.
The Bill provides for a new section, No.
703A, to be inserted in our basic shipping
legislation, that is, the Canada Shipping Act,
1934. Under subsections 1, 2 and 3 the Governor in Council may by regulation designate
the territory in a state of war or armed conflict to which the section is to apply, and
the arms, ammunition or other materials
which are ýto be affected, and thereupon it will
be unlawful for a Canadian ship to carry such
articles from a foreign port to the area of
conflict, or from a Canadian port either. Subsections 4, 5, 6 and 7, together with other
penalty sections of the basic Canada Shipping
Act, provide for such matters as the definition of the indictable offence, the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court and certain other
courts, the powers of certain officers, and,
generally speaking, the means for enforcing the purposes of the proposed new section.
After a perusal of the discussion which
took place in the Commons, it is evident
that the purpose of the Bill is to prevent
Canadian ships on the high seas from transhipping munitions destined to a country en-

413

gaged in war or civil conflict, or from carrying such goods from a foreign port to prohibited zones. It may be said that we have
very few ships engaged in such trade, for
instance, in the Mediterranean or in the Far
East; but it is weli to deter our shipping
companies from violating the law. True,
Canadian ships could not be proceeded against
while in-a foreign port, but on their return
to Canada .they would be amenable to our
law.
The Bill is limited in its scope because we
have already amended our Customs Act along
these lines. It is desirable to preserve the
good narne of Canada in carrying out our
international obligations in respect to matters
of this kind.
With these explanations I move the second
reading of this Bill, seconded by the Right
Hon. Mr. Graham.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGIIEN: Honourable members. the leader of the House
has made clear the general purpose of this
proposed legislation. As I have just arrived,
I have had neither time nor opportunity to
read the Bill. The question in my mind is
this. I notice from explanations given that
the Bill provides for control of the conduct
of vessels not only when they are trading into
a country designated by the Government of
Canada as being at war, or in which a state
of war exists, but when they are in any zone
designated by our Government. I wonder
whether such a zone impliedly includes the
shores of countries other than the country at
war or in whose territory war is being carried
on. Under this legislation, because Spain,
say, is at war, is the Government of Canada
to have power virtually to take control of
shipping in any zone denominated or delimited by our Government, including, of
course, the territory and shores of Spain?
If so, it is a prodigious power.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The question
was put to the Minister, and the example
given was that of Portugal.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What about
France?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The answer was
that if it appeared that there was a regular
channel of communication for the export of
goods from Portugal to Spain, it could well
be prohibited as one of the war zones. The
further question was put: What about Italy,
which is supposed to be somewhat friendly to
one of the contesting parties in Spain?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: An avowed
participant.

414

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The answer was
not as clear. All I can give is the answer
that was made as to the example of Portugal.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think this
Bill will be somewhat like the sanction clauses
of the Covenant of the League of Nations,
in the Treaty of Versailles, which were never
given practical effect.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I pointed out to
the Senate that in the course of time, under
conditions of which we 'are aware. there might
arise, either on the Atlantic or the Pacific
situations in which it would be well for
Canada to make use of this measure for the
control of ships of Canadian registry. These
ships are not numerous, but the time may
come when Canada will desire to protect its
neutrality and to see that nothing is done
which is not in conformity with international
law.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: As far as I
know-and if I am wrong the honourable leader
of the Government can correct me-the Canadian Government has no ships of any kind
on any of the seas except those ships that
run to the West Indies or probably to Newfoundland.
I take it, therefore, that this
legislation will apply more particularly to
privately owned ships under Canadian register.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My answer is
twofold. We have under Canadian register,
Canadian Government ships plying to the
West Indies, and Canadian Pacific steamships
operating on the Pacifie. It is possible that
under certain conditions foreign ships may
wish to come under Canadian register for
just such a purpose as is referred to. I am
speaking not of conditions of to-day, but of
those that may exist to-morrow. This legislation is a provident act for the future. It has
often been said that to govern is to foresee,
and perhaps this legislation would come within that definition.
Hon. L. COTE: May I ask the honourable
leader of the Government a question with
reference to subsection 3 of section 703A of
this Bill? It reads:
Subject to the provisions of subsection two
of this section, the articles to which this section
applies are arms, ammunition, implements or
munitions of war, military, naval or air stores,
or any articles deemed capable of being converted thereinto or made useful in the production thereof.
Do these include nickel and steel?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: And wheat?
Hon. Mr. COTE: And copper?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I think that
a list bas been prepared, taken from theDisarmament Conference studies, and that
the articles in it have been included in the
prohibition under the Customs Act.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Let us assume that subsection 3 does cover nickel, steel and copper
-as I think it obviously would, because they
are capable of being made use of in the production of arms and munitions. Is there
any authority now in the Governor in Council
to prevent the loading of these materials on
ships other than those of Canadian registry?
If I understand this section correctly, it applies only to Canadian ships.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Subject to correction, I would answer in the affirmative.
Authority is conferred by the Customs Act.
Hon. WILLIAM DUFF: I should like to
ask the honourable leader a question or two.
The first part of subsection 1 of section 703A
says:
No article to which this section applies shall
be discharged at any port or place in any
territory designated by the Governor in Council
for the purposes of this section or within the
territorial waters adjacent to such territory
from a ship registered in Canada.
The first question I would put is whether
other nations are passing a similar law. If
they are not, this provision would impose a
hardship on privately owned Canadian vessels
which loaded a cargo in, say, Buenos Aires, in
not allowing thein to land it in Great Britain
or any part of Europe. It seems to me that
before Canada takes any step of this kind there
should be an international agreement.
The section continues:
-and no such article shall be transbipped on
the higli seas fron any such ship into any
vessel bound for any such port or place.
I take exception to that provision. I do not
tahink this Parliament has any right to prevent a vessel from going on the high seas
and taking on boai
a cargo from another
ship, unless, as I have said, there is an international agreement in this respect.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may inform
my honourable friend that under the Statute
off Westminster Canada has the full right to
reach its own nationals anywhere in the world.
Of course it reaches them only when they
return home. The Government can establish
regulations and prohibitions which must be
obeyed by vessels which are under Canadian
register. I think that is admitted.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I think my honourable
friend is right up to a certain point. There

JUNE 6, 1938
are certain provisions of international law
whereby the nations agree that their ships
shall come under certain rules and regulations. But if a French ship can load certain
cargoes in Buenos Aires or Rio de Janiero
and carry them to another country, why
should not a Canadian ship be allowed to
do so? I say that unless there is international agreement to a clause of this kind
Parliament should not pass such a provision
and deprive Canadian ships of the right to
carry these goods.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It is my idea
that the Canadian Government would act
only in conjunction with other seafaring nations, and in accordance with a decision
arrived at by means of conference or communication. Just now we are following other
nations in our dealings with Spain, and I do
not believe we would think of establishing a
prohibited zone except in conjunction with
other seafaring nations.
I move the second reading of the Bill, and
in order that the members of the Senate may
have further information on this subject, I
shall move that the Bill be referred to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have no
objection to the motion, but I think there
must be something wrong with the explanation
given. The explanation referred not only
to the place where war was being carried
on, but also to a zone-to some territory included in a zone. The Bill does not go so
far. Since I was last on my feet I have
had time to read the Bill, and I see it provides:
The Governor in Council may from time to
time by regulation
(a) designate any territory or territories in
which there is a state of war or armed conflict,
civil or otherwise, in respect of which the
provisions of this section shall apply;
(b) prescribe the time or times during which
such provisions shall so apply.
(c) exempt in the case of any territory so
designated any article or class of articles referred to in the next following subsection from
the application of the provisions of this section;
(d) provide otherwise for the carrying out
of the intent of this section.
I shall not
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
go into a minute discussion of the various
clauses of the Bill, as we generally do that
in Committee of the Whole or in a standing
committee. I had the impression, after reading the discussion which took place in the
other House and the memorandum handed
me, that the reference was to ports of a
country where a war was going on.

703A. (1) No article to which this section
applies shall be discharged at any port or
place in any territory designated by the Governor in Council for the purposes of this section
or within the territorial waters adjacent to
such territory from a ship registered in Canada,
and no such article shall be transhipped on the
high seas from any such ship into any vessel
bound for any such port or place, and no such
article consigned to or destined for any such
port or place shall be taken on board or
carried in any such ship.
My right honourable friend may be correct
in the point he raises, but we can look into
that in committee.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: All right.
Hon. WILLIAM DUFF: Honourable senators, I should like to ask a question of the
honourable leader of the House (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand). Is it not a fact that ships owned
in the British Isles now load munitions of war
and other goods and endeavour to get them
into Spain? Surely, if the British Government permits this, our Parliament should not
forbid ships of Canadian registration from
doing the same business if they can. When
those British ships arrive in Spanish waters
they are liable to be sunk, and some of them
have been sunk. They take that chance.
It seems to me that it will be time for us to
move when the British Government moves
to prevent ships owned by its own people
from carrying war supplies to Spain, China,
or any other country engaged in war.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Bill was referred to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce.
NATURAL RESOURCES TRANSFER
(AMENDMENT) BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 106, an Act to amend
The Manitoba Natural Resources Act, The
Alberta Natural Resources Acts, and the
Saskatchewan Natural Resources Acts.
He said: Honourable senators, this Bill has
for its object the confirmation of agreements
transferring the natural resources to the three
Western Provinces. The transfers were made
under agreements which mentioned that all
lands, mines and minerals in the right of the
Crown were to be transferred to the respective
provinces. There has been doubt as to whether
those terms included waters and water-powers,

416

SENATE

and in order to remove the doubt an additional agreement has been signed with each of
the three provinces, transferring to them waters
and water-powers as *well. It was always the
intention that such transfer should be made.
The additional agreements with the respective provinces are set out as a schedule to this
Bill. It will be noticed that the one with
Alberta contaîns an amendment to the original
transfer agreement, relating to conservation
of the oil and gas resources which are found
in the Turner Valley.
The Bill itself is vory brief. lIs two provisions are:
This Act, and the Manitoba Natural Resources Act, chapter twenty-îîine of the
statutes of 1930 (flrst session), and the Alberta
Natural Resources Acte, chapter three of the
statutes of 1930 (first session) and chapter
fifteen of the statutes of 1931, and the Saskatchewan Natural Resources Acte, chapter
forty-one of the statutes of 1930 (first session)
and chapter fifty-one of the statutes of 1931,
respectively, shall ho construed together.
The agreemnents set ont in the schedule to
this Act are hereby confirmed and shall have
and takze effect according bo their respective
terme.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Why is it that
there N no. explanatory note with this Bill?
If cx or there wa3 a. case where a short note
would make cc
the purposes of a meacure,
this Ns one, but no person has gone to the
trouble of inserting eDven a sentence.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Perhaps that wac
becaus'e the Bill contains nothing but the
two sections which I have read and the agreements with the three provinces. I confess that
I had! fot. ob'rerved the absence of any explanatorv note.
Right. Hon. Mr. M-/EICHEN: The sections
of the Bill do nlot mean anything. A person
iiht read themn fiftv times and not bc a
bit the wiser. The wbole rneaning us emhodiod
in the agrecntns, whose purpose could have
beeu explaiucd by a short note.
Hon. Mr. DANDTTRAND: The objeet of
the Bill is simply to give force and effeet to
the three agreements, which amend the original agreements with the three provinces in
the way I have already intimated.
Ribht Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I shahl have
time to read thýese new agreements before we
get to committee. I presume it is the intention to send the Bill there, for I sc that our
Law Clerk bas suggested an ýamendment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I thought. that
if second reading were given now, the Bih]
coxîhd ho taken up un Cornmittee of the Wbole
to-rnorrow.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: Ail right.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

I shah] then ask

someone to move the amendment that bas
been suggested by our Law Cherk.

Yes, that

Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN:
Honourable
cenators, I have been told corne things which,
to me at ]east, are alarming, with regard to
the administration of natural resources hy
Alberta cince they were taken over by that
province. I arn wondering whether the placing
of natural resources under the control of
Alberta is in, the best intereet of that province
and the neighbouring
province of Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But I would remmid my honourable friend that the transfers
hîave taken place.
Hon. Mr. BUJCHANAN: I know. 1 merely
want to hcing out une or two facts concerning
protection of timber on the eastern clope of
the Rocky Mountainsý, which bas a considerahie bearing on the watcr supphy of Alherta
mid Sask,ýatchewan. I realize that the present
Bill cannot affect the situation at ahI. Information which lias corne te, me fromn rehiahie
sources shows that in the six years prier to
the tr'insfer of the resources from the Dominion
58.530 acres were burned over in that part of
the forcst reserve on the eastern clope of
the Rocky Mouîntains, or wîthîn the province
of Alberta, witb a loss of somewbere around
S20.000. The province ho.gan administering the
resources in 1931, I think, and in the six years
from then until 1936 there were destroyed by
lire in the came area more than 235,000 acres,
with a hoýss of $1,600,000. The reason is that
theýse forests ire nlot bcing properhy protected.
TIISis assoeiate(l witb tho water supp]y. If
ive are going to hoso lar'gc areas of timber
on the cea:4tcfrn siope of the Rocky Mountains
t.hroughI negict to carry on proper lire preveDntion methods, the water resourcos of Alherta
um Snd thea
will ho interfereil witb.
These water rosources have been improved in
rocent years more than, at. any previoue time
in the histocy of the We.it, because of the
program for rehabilitation and for the conservatioýn of water in those two provinces,
which was introduced by the hate Goveroment
and -carried out by tho present one.
This
scemed to me an opportune time to bcing
tliee facts to the attention of Parliament.
Further, I understand that the province of
Alherta is asking that the Dominion Goverument should take back the foreets and administer and protect them. In fact. it bas been
stated in the press several times within the hast
few months that such a request bas actualhy

JUNE 6, 1938
been presented to the Government.
This
would indicate that the province feels it cannot properly protect these forests. And I
repeat that since protection of these limits is
closely associated with water conservation, I
am wondering whether the placing of the
water-powers under the control of the Government of Alberta will be to the advantage of
that province and its neighbour, Saskatchewan.
It seems to me that unless some arrangement
is made to restore the forests to the Dominion,
the situation will become more dangerous year
by year.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may inform
my honourable friend that in the original
agreement between the Dominion and the
province of Alberta the intention was-as it
was in the agreements with the other Western
Provinces-to transfer all the natural resources.
This implied the inclusion of waters and waterpowers, but, as some question has arisen concerning the interpretation of the agreements,
this Bill is presented for the purpose of doing
away with any doubt. In other words, the
Bill is merely a declaration of the meaning of
the original agreements. I say this in order
that my honourable friend may realize that
even if the Bill were not passed the three
Western Provinces would still claim control
over the waters.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: I am fully aware
of the purpose of the Bill. I merely wanted
to bring the facts to the attention of the
Senate.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: I am
very glad the honourable senator from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan) has spoken as
he has. I remember well that when I was in
the other House and had charge of the department in which the forests were administered I strongly urged that in the event of
transfer of resources to the Western Provinces
there should be reservation of forests and of
parks, and I believe I included water-powers.
However, the Dominion went anywhere but
along the path of reason when making these
transfers. Common sense would show anyone
that the federal authority would surely be
able to give more economical and efficient fire
protection to forests than would separate provinces, which have to delimit their powers to
their boundaries and establish a multiplication of machinery. I do not know why forests
and parks were transferred, but the transfer
was made, and I do not suppose it can now
be reversed.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

NATIONAL HARBOURS BOARD BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 108, an Act to amend
The National Harbours Board Act, 1936.
He said: Honourable senators, I would
direct attention to the explanatory note, which
reads:
The purpose of this amendment is to provide
that a person who bas a claim against the
National Harbours Board arising out of any
contract with the board or arising out of the
death or injury to the person or property
resulting from the negligence of any officer or
servant of the board while acting within the
scope of his employment, may be proceeded
with in any court of competent jurisdiction
having jurisdiction in like claims between subjects; to provide upon whom process may be
served in the event of such action, suit or
proceeding being instituted, and to provide
the manner in which a judgment obtained
against the board may be paid.
The Government bas submitted this Bill to
Parliament at the request of the Minister of
Justice. I think it will be generally accepted
as desirable.
Indeed it may well be that
similar legislation should be extended in other
directions, since the Government is expanding its activities. I believe this Bill is a first
step in the right direction.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am wondering who prepared the explanatory note. I
know from it the purpose of the Bill, but that
is badly expressed; in fact the English is
positively poor. I direct honourable members'
attention to this language:
The purpose of this amendment is to provide
that a person who bas a claimand so forth-may be proceeded with in any court.
Why would you "proceed with" a person?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: You want him
as a witness.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable leader comments that the Bill is a step
in the right direction. Well, possibly it is al]
right on the assumption that the National
Harbours Board is in the nature of the Canadian National Railways. He suggests that
similar legislation should be extended to other
Government activities because they are expanding so much. The remedy, I suggest,
would be to restrict Government activities
rather than extend the privilege of suing the
Government. This restriction would be much
better for the taxpayers of Canada.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Honourable
senators, this is not the beginning.

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: A good many
years ago the employees of the Prince Edward
Island Railway and the Intercolonial Railway
found it very exasperating that they could
not take legal proceedings against the Government without first obtaining a fiat under the
Exchequer Court Act. I succeeded in getting
the law changed, and since that time persons
in the employ of the Government railways
can proceed in the courts against those railways as thougb they were suing a private
citizen.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: What is the position
so far as the Civil Service is concerned? Suppose

elevator in a Government building, and he
claims two or three thousand dollars' damages.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: He must get

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As I said, tbis is
the first step to free citizens from the obligation of securing a fiat to sue His Majesty's
Government.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I think it is right.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am not sure
that the principle should be extended blindly
to all Government employees. There might
be cases wlhere it would not be advisable to
extend it. I <lo not express a definite opinion,

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

EXCHEQUER COURT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 109, an Act to amend
the Exchequer Court Act.
Honourable senators will obHe said:
serve the explanatory note:
1. The repealed paragraph and the introductory wording of section 19 read as follows:
"19. The Exchequer Court shall also have
exclusive original jurisdiction to lear and
determine the following matters:
"(e) Every claim against the Crown arising
ont of any death or injury te the person or
to property resulting from the negligence of
any officer or servant of the Crown while acting
within the scope of his duties or employment
upon any public work;"
The purpose of this amendment is to extend
the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court in
cases where claims are made against the Crown
arising out of any death or injury to person
or property resulting from the negligence of
any officer or servant of the Crown wbile actimg
within the scope of his duties or employment.
Under the present law the Crown is only liable
in such cases if the death or injury occurred
uipon " any public work."

This Bil is complementary to Bill 108,

lon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second

gist of the Bill in these words:

area now lying between the harbour

Westminster and

the North

of New

Fraser harbour,

The Bill is divided into two sections. The
first is to include in the boundaries of New
Westminster harbour a small area lying between the present jurisdiction of New Westminster Harbour Commission and the jurisdiction of North Fraser Harbour Commission.
This area results frein a change in the boundaries of the North Fraser Harbour Commission. and it is desirable that either one
commission or the other should have jurisdiction over it.

JUNE 6, 1938
The second part provides that the Governor in Council may set up such remuneration for the New Westminster Harbour Commission as the Government may determine.
The present situation is somewhat unsatisfactory. No provision is made for paying
the commissioners; so the remuneration is
obtained through the appointment of the
chairman to the position of port manager.
In that capacity *he draws a substantial salary, part of which, I believe, is paid by him
to his two fellow commissioners. It is not
considered desirable to do indirectly a thing
which is not provided for in the Act. Harbour commissioners throughout Canada are
paid small salaries for their services, and the
Government believes that the request of
the city of New Westminster should be
granted, and that provision should be made
for the remuneration of these harbour commissioners.
May I add that this port bas been built
up mainly by the city of New Westminster,
which has a large interest in its administration. I understand that the port is doing a
thriving business and bas been well administered.
It may be asked how the small piece of
land has stood between these two jurisdictions. I find from the discussion which took
place in the other House that the land really
belonged to the Government of Canada. It
is now being added to the harbour of New
Westminster in order that it may be administered by the harbour commissioners.

419

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Would the
honourable leader of the Government kindly
inform the House what salary has been voted
to one of the commissioners who, if I understood my honourable friend correctly, was
named general manager and draws a substantial salary, which he divides with the
other commissioners? I notice
the Minister said in another place that the remuneration is very small. How much is to be paid
by way of remuneration to the commissioners?

instead of paying a salary of that kind to a
commissioner as port manager it is proposed
to pay each of the three commissioners a small
salary. Perhaps the expenses of the port
under this arrangement will not be larger than
they are at the present time.
The Minister was asked:
There will be no port manager appointed to
replace the presumed retiring official?
In reply the Minister stated:
I cannot say as to that. Whether a manager
will be appointed is a matter for the commission to decide. It is my understanding that
it is not the intention to have a port manager
appointed. However, I am not promising that
for the future.
This other question was asked:
Would the Minister care to comment on the
principle involved in this measure, of paying
harbour commissioners to look after the interests
of a harbour, rather than having three coimissioners on a voluntary basis, for the honour
that goes with a position of that kind and
the opportunity of service to their city?
To which he replied:
It is the practice in almost all harbours of
this class to pay the commissioners. The work
is exacting. New Westminster harbour is one
of the very large and busy harbours of Canada.
A great deal of time is required by the commissioners to handle their work as harbour
commissioners.
They are also the pilotage
authority there. They have the jurisdiction
of the river for, I believe, somè twenty miles.
To do their work properly requires a great deal
of time. In my opinion it is entirely proper
that these commissioners should be paid small
salaries, not large salaries, for the time they
give.
I think that is as far as the Minister went
in stating what would be the commissioners'
remuneration.
From the discussion which
occurred I am convinced that the city of New
Westminster will take very good care that
the moneys derived from the activities of the
port are not spent unwisely. I think the
honourable member for that division is a
canny Scotchman, and I rely on the Scots of
New Westminster to see that their port is
well administered. As a matter of fact, it has
received considerable commendation in that
respect.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The Minister
was asked if there were three commissioners
at the present time, and he answered:
Yes. The late chairman, who is the appointee
of the city, died recently; but the city has made
a nomination to replace him, and the nominee
bas been approved by the Government; so there
are three harbour commissioners. It is the
practice, and bas been for some time, to pay
the chairman of the harbour commission a
salary as port manager. Of course it is somewhat irregular to have a member of a commission also an employee of the commission, which
be is in fact under this arrangement; and

Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, the responsibility does not rest on
the honoura)ble member for New Westminster,
no matter whether he is a Scot or belongs to
some other nationality; neither does it rest
on the Council of New Westminster. It rests
on the Federal Government, especially on the
Minister of Transport.
We have been told over and over again
to-night what a thriving port this is, and I am
quite sure it is; but we have no idea what its
re-enues amount to. If the Bill contained a

51958-274

SENATE

420

provision to the effect that the commissioners
should be paid out of the revenue a sum not
excceding a certain amount, that would, I
think, be in the interest of economy; but as
the Bill is drafted nobody knows how much
the commissioners are going to draw out of
the jack-pot at the end of the year.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have here the
financial statement for the year ending
December, 1937. It is as follows:
Revenues:
Water lot rental charges for 1937. $ 5,885 46
Hlarbour dues, net.. .. .. .. .. 34,404 10
517 27

Ordinary revenue surplus. .....
Deduct:
Loss on grain elevator operations.

12,408 07

Net surplus.. ..............

4,043 16
$ 8,364 91

Thesea ports belong to the towns or cities
whcre thev are located, and are somewhat
indepandent, and I doub't that we can place
a limit on the remuneration to be paid the
conmmissioners. Furthermore, I question the
advisability of establishing such a precedent,
because the conditions existing to-day may not
be those which will prevail to-morrow.
J see that the Minister was asked:
Has the Government considered the wisdom
or the feasibility of having this harbour operated, as other harbours are, under the National
Harbours Board? Tbat is the plan which lias
been adopted; it is an attractive proposal, and
I do not know whether the experience of the
Minister would enable him to express an opinion
on the advisability of having this harbour
operated in that manner. We are told that it
is an important harbour with a great deal of
business, and possibly it mighît come under the
jurisdiction of the National Harbours Board.
His answer was:
The position of New Westminster harbour
and of a number of others, such as the harbours
at Hamilton, Toronto and three or four other
places that I could mention, is somewhat
different from the position of the eight harbours
that have been brought under the National
Harbours Board. Whereas in the case of the
eight harbours that are under the National
Harbours Board the larger part of the investment is federal, in the case of New Westminster, Toronto and Hamilton the larger part of
the investment is municipal. Under the Act
the municipality is entitled to representation
on the board, and the funds of the harbour in
of those required to operate or improve
the port revert to the city. In the case of

excess
Uon.

Mr. BALLANTYNE.

tiese harbours the city has a much larger
equity than the Federal Government.
We
looked into the question when the Harbour
Board Act was passed. and consideration was
given the position of these harbours. It was
thought then, and I have no reason to change
my opinion. that harbours of that type where
the investnent is largely municipal should
not be brouglit under the board.
From this I should draw the conclusion
that the city, having the larger equity, and
being on the ground to supervise the administration of the port for its own advantage,
would see that there was no undue expenditure which would impair the income. I believe, therefore. we may well trust to supervision by the city of New Westminster.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
TIHRD READING POSTPONED

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: With the leave
of the House. I would move -the third reading
now.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I would suggest that the third reading be taken tomorrow. There is one thing which has been
asked for, and which I think the Minister
should give, namely, the amount that bas
been paid. There is no reason why that should
not be given.
There is no
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
reason whaltever. I thought I could find it
in the statements. Third reading to-morrow.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: I must say that I
am somewhat confused with reference to this
whole harbour question. I do not understand
it. We had another Harbour Commissioners
Bill before us early in the session, and I
was absolutely astray.
Righ't Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That was in
relation to Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Tes. What is not
clear in ny mind is the relationship of these
various types of harbours to the Government.
In the case of Winnipeg we eventually found
that the harbour was purely local and that
the Government had nothing at all to (o
with it. It is truc the Government made
expenditures running to some two or three million dollars on the Red River, but the appointment of the members of the board, the fixing
of fees or wharfage charges. and the payment
of the commissioners were all done locally.
I have tried to follow the explanation of
this Bill, but I am still at sea. As I understand it, the city has an equity in the harbour. What is meant by that? Does it
mean that the city advances certain moneys
to be spenot on certain public works, and that

JUNE 6,1938
the Government advances certain rnoneys?
In the case of Winnipeg the Governrnent
spent two or three millions, and stili had
nothing to do with the harbour commissioners.
Hon. Mr. DPiNDURAND: It was on the
dredgîng.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: There are the St.
Andrew's locks, which cost a large surn of
money.
When you say the city bas an equity and
the Government has an equity, does that
mean they both appoint members to this
board?
Sorne Hon. SENATORS: No.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Does the Government
have anything to say with regard to the
salaries to be paid, or is that a matter which
is attended to entirely by local people elected
by the rnunicipality of New Westminster? I
ask this because I arn absolutely at sea as
to ýhow these harbours are rnanagcd, and as to
who is responsible for them.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: So far as I
know, the only harbour in Canada that is
exclusively owned by the Government is the
harbour of Montreal. At the poit of Vancouver, for instance, the Governrnent has
spent millions of dollars and owns many
docks, sheds, etc., but private interests own
the elevators. These ports corne under the
Federal Governrnent regardîcas of what the
private intereats may be.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I should think the
Government would own aIl ports in Canada
-Halifax, Queben, New Wrestrninster, Vancouver and Victoria. It is true that concessions rnay be granted, that the lands may
'be sold to certain individuals, but surely
Canada owns the harbours.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: They corne
under the Government.
Mr. CALDER: What I cannot understand
is this. Here is a harbour, a real harbour,
virtually on the ocean, and ocean vessels
run up to it. Why has not the Government
full control? Why does the Government not
operate it instead of leaving it to individuals
elected by a local body?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Minister
bas given a clear answer. The port bas been
built up with New Westminster rnoney, and
we have a jurisdiction, which we cannot
escape. There are such ports as this at
Hamilton and Toronto. They have been
developed with the rnoney of the municipalidies. and it bas been felt that we should not

make them part of our property. They are
the property of the city of Toronto or the
city of Harnilton. In the case immediately
before us the property is the preperty of the
city of New Westminster; the investrnent is
the investment of New Westminster. The
remarks of the Minister would imply that
the Federal Government may have advanced
assistance in some forrn or other. The reason
these ports have flot been taken over and
administered directly by the Federal Governrnent is that a situation developed which
allowed us to respect the ownership of these
ports by the various municipalities.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Then this port is on
the sarne footing as the one at Winnipeg-?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Right Hion. Mr. MEICHEN: I think the
explanation mnust be this. There is no question of the federal .iurisdiction in respect cf
harbours. That jurisdliction is ample under
the British North America Act. It is ours,
and we cannot dive-it ourselves of it. It
exists, ne matter what may 'be the rights cf a
city in. its own investment. In Toronto, for
instance, an immense amount of work bas been
done, larg-ely at the expense cf the city. A
vast area bas heen reclaimed. That bas become
part of the city, and probably by virtue cf
a contract between the city and the Government cf Canada. Although harbours corne
under Dominion jurisdiction, the city, because
cf the money it bas invested, bas certain
private riglits, and a certain share of harbour
dues and se forth. All these have a contractual
basis and do net affect jurîsdiction at alI.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And that is the
reason why the net revenue cf the port goes
to the city.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes. It is
a contract.
The motion for third reading was postponed.
RADIO BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading cf Bill 52, an Act respecting
radio in Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, the explanatien cf this Bill ia quite simple, though in t1ae
discussion cf the various clauses furthcr explanations may be sought. The proposed
measure is a revision of the Radiotelegraph
Act, Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, Chapter 195. The Act is revised at this time
primarily hecause those sections referring to

ships have been transferred to the Canada
Shipping Act, 1934. The revision has provided
an opportunity to clarify and somewhat
strengthen somne of the remaining sections of
the Act, particularly with regard to the licensing, of radio receiving sets used for broadcast
reception.
The Bill caused considerable discussion in
another place. Its terms arc largely those of
the Radiotelegraph Act which i.s f0 be found
in the Revised Statutes of 1927, thoughi I
think the legisiation dates from 1913. Sometirnes we havle occasion to compiain of the

NATURAL RESOURCES TRANSFER

CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Sanate want into Committee on Bill 106,' an
Act to amand The Manitoba Natural Resourcas Act. The Alberta Natural Resources
Acts, and The Saskatchewan Natural Resources Acts.
Hon. Mr. Copp in the Chair.
On section 1-short title and construction:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would suggest
that this section ha amended by striking out
the second paragraph.
The amendmant was agread to, and section

Section 2 was agreed to.
It is suggested

report

the

Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: Before you leave
tha Chair, I should like to ask the honourable
leader of tha Governmant what authority the
province of Albarta would have ovar waters
in that province which are in effect international streams. Three or four rivers of considerabla extent rise in tha Stata of Montana and flow into soiithern Alberta, and
they are the source of our water supply.
Othar straams rise in Alberta and flow into
the province of Saskatchewan. If the province of Albarta undertook a large irrigation
scheme in connaction with those straams, what
would be the position of the province of
Saskatchewan in respect of that undertaking?
All the waters
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
that flow into the province of Alberta are
the property of the province, and are under
its control. All the waters that flow from
Alberta into Saskatchewan are, while runnrng through Alberta, under the control of
that province. The question which would
arise would be to what axtent the province
of Albarta could divert those waters from
the province of Saskatchawan. I take it for
granted that, according to principles which
I have always understood, Alberta must not
lessen tha quantity of water that flows into
Saskatchewan.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEIÇ: Tha point
raised by the honourabla gentleman from
Letlibridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan) illustrates
what I have always regarded as the folly of
the transfer of these natural resources. The
whola irrigation territory of Alberta is irrngatad by water divarted from rivers, and it
neyer gats back. It does not gat to Saskatchewan. It could ha got back if the waters
were under faderai jurisdiction. but I do not
know how it can be done when the waters
are transfarred. Nor do I know what value
there was in the transfer for the provinces.
or why thay wantad it. If the Act is such
that the transfer bas not actually been made,
I should think thesa provinces would ba glad
to have the waters under Dominion jurisdictien. What the hurry was to take thein
under provincial control, I do not know.
Water used for irrigation in Alberta as providad for in our irrigation law is watar which
in the judgment of the Parliament of Canada
is used to the hast possible advantage for

the situation at the present time? The water
does not get to Saskatchewan. But I presume Saskatchewan people vill say to AIberta: "You have no right to use this water
in Alberta in any way that would diminish
the flow into our province. We may need it
too." If that position is taken, what is going
to happen?
Will the honourable leader of
the Government say what is going to happen?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The former
question that was put to me I answered on
general principles, but when my right honourable friend intervenes and asks me to place
dots on the i's, I must ask for twenty-four
hours' time before answering him.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable gentleman was in the Government which
transferred these resources. I was not.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: J am not sure
that it was not my right honourable friend's
Government that transferred the resources.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
done in 1929.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
action was taken after 1929.

No; it was

I think some

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: This Bill recites that the agreement with Manitoba was
made in 1929, that the amendment to the
British North America Act took effect on
the 10th of July, 1930. and the natural resources transfer agreement came into effect
on the 15th of July tîat year. Sinilar dates
are given with respect to the agreements
with the other provinces. This was all very
well for the purpose of getting votes in the
West, but it had net much value as a business method of administering resources.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should not be
surprised to find that the legislation was
agreed to unanimously in the other House,
and perhaps in this House too.
. Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: My understanding
is that international streams are controlled by
the International Joint Commission. It decides what flow is permissible from the stream
within the State of Montana, and how much
Alberta may use from the same international
stream. The point I want to make certain
of is how much authority the province of
Alberta would have over a stream of that
nature.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Or one flowing into Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN:
Would Alberta
net have to respect the decisions of the
International Joint Commission with respect
to the distribution of the flow of water?
Righit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The honourable gentleman is quite right as to streams
with international features. In such cases the
disposition of water would come under the
International Joint Commission. And there
is a sub-commission in respect of the Lake
of the Woods, where the larger areas of international water are. But the point which is
in my mind and is, I think, in the mind of
the honourable member also, is this. The
International Joint Commission bas no jurisdiction in respect of the use of water as
between Alberta on the one hand and Saskatchewan on the other. What is going to be
done when a dispute arises-and it seems to
me one necessarily must-as to whether AIberta can divert water in such a way that it
will never reach Saskatchewan along the
course that it previously took?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Such a dispute is
quite possible, I understand. Take the case
of the South Saskatchewan river for example.
It rises in the Rocky Mountains, does not go
anywhere near the United States, and after
passing through Saskatchewan enters through
Lake Winnipeg into Manitoba. Now, what
will happen if the province of Alberta is
given full jurisdiction over the water of that
river? It is quite conceivable that very
large irrigation works nay be constructed in
that province. As my right honourable friend
has said, once water is diverted for irrigation
it

never

gets back

to

the river from which

it was taken; it cannot be used a second
time, as water-powers can. In central and
south-western Saskatchewan there is a large
section which for the last twenty-five yearsI think even for as long as thirty-five or
forty years-people have had it in mind to
irrigate some day. In Alberta there are two
large irrigation schemes, taken from the South
Saskatchewan river. net from the rivers in
the southern part of Alberta. One is at Gleichen and the other is down east of tha t . towards Medicine Hat. So far as my knowledge goes, these are still in operation. It is
quite conceivable
that similar irrigation
schemes may be carried out on waters that
flow into the South Saskatchewan, north and
south-the Red Deer river, for example-and
further large irrigation districts may be established along the main branch of the Saskatchewan river between Calgary and the eastern boundary of Alberta. If that happened,
the likelihood of the people of Saskatchewan
ever getting any use from the waters of that
river for irrigation purposes would be ended.
Hon. Mr. RILEY: Honourable senators,
I shiould like to point out that unless some
steps are taken to conserve the freshet water
on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains,

425

JUNE 7, 1938
no water from the rivera that originate there
will be running down into Saskatchewan if the
dry seasons continue. I have always wondered
what is the most important rahabilitation work
that the Government can undertake. The work
of that kind that has bean done is all right
so far as it gues, but it was sta.rted at the
wrong end. My belief is, and bas been for
many years, that dams should ha placed
on those rivers to conserve the spring freshets.
La.st fail several of the rivers were almost
dry, but they have been known to be even
lowar. The farther east they go the smaller
they get, because evaporation takes up much
of the water. Old Indians have told me thýey
remember whan thay could cross the Bow
river on stones, without watting& their moccasins. And that is one of our big rivers.
To-day wa have the prospect of wet seasons
for a while. But they will last for onl.y a
short terni of years. and than thare will be
dry seasons again. This bas been my experience ever since I have been in that country.
I have sean thase changes from a period of wet
to a pariod of dry saasons three timas.
I think the Govarnmant should build huge
dams where those rivers coma out of the
mountains, and make big re-servoirs. One old
land survayor, a min who knew the country
wt'll and had taken leveis on the mountains,
told me that one of those rivers, the Old
Man's river, which breaks through a huge
wall of rock in tha mounitains, could be
dammed there and the water backed up for
thirty miles. In dry seasons not only do the
stream levels faîl, but watar supply ail over
the couâtry is affected. Wells go dry. Last
fall people ware hauling water for milas and
miles.
The building of dams and rasarvoirs is
ona way in which money could ha axpanded
well to give employment to paopla, and whan
the work was completed it would ha an assat
to tha country for ail tima. A statamant
was mada in this Housa soma time ago that
the Western country neyer was any good and
neyer would ha any good. Well, I got from
the Department of Agricultura the figures
showing tha quantity of wheat raised in Canada
from 1932 to 1937 and it-q valua. As honourable members know, the larga bulk of the
whaat is raisad in Western Canada. Tha
total valua of the whaat raised in thosa years
-and thosa wera lean years, whan crops wera
poor-xcaadad ona billion dollars. Now, a
country which can produce that much whaat
is suraly worth consarving.
Tha Bill was reportad, as amended.

from Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham)
asked for 200 additional copies of the English
version. It would be fair to one-third of the
population of this Dominion to have this
evidence in French, if only for educational
purposes.
Right Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM: I am
surprised at the statement of the honourable
senator from Kennebec. The evidence has
already been printed in French.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: I am informed to the
contrary.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I was told
yesterday there were sufficient copies in French
to meet the demand, but that the Distribution Office had run out of copies in English.
The English like to dabble in these things
more than do our contented French compatriots.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: I might supplement the remarks of my right honourable
friend from Eganville by stating that three
numbers of the evidence have already been
translated into French. All the translation
staff is engaged on the work now and the
other numbers are coming through very fast.
Hon. Mr. PARENT: For the information
of my honourable friends, I may say that I
sent a page for a French copy and he has
just informed me that there is none available
at the Distribution Office. If I am wrong I
shall be perfectly willing to withdraw my
remarks.

I tLought su.

JUNE 8,1938

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Therefore if we assume that the average
term of the loans made under this Act will be
twenty years, and that the Dominion could
borrow for that period on an average of three
and one-eighth per cent, each half-yearly payment would be $1,014,000 and there would be
a loss to the Dominion of $100,000 a half year
or a total during the twenty-year period oi
$4,000,000, plus the cost of administration. If
the average term of the loans were thirty years,
and if we assume that for such a period the
Dominion could borrow on a three and a quarter
per cent basis, each half-yearly payment of
$786,000 would show a loss to the Dominion of
$119,000, or a total during the thirty-year period
of approximately $7,150,000, plus the cost of
administration.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Those calculations are pretty much on the basis of ifs and
ands being pots and pans. The honourable
gentleman opposite read, whether correctly or
not, that the cost of the recent twenty-year
loan was 3.07, and then he added, "If in future
it is 31, we shall be out so much." If the
Minister anticipates a lower rate for Dominion twenty-year loans in the future than
prevails to-day, he is exceedingly optimistic
as to the loan market. I should like to see
it from one point of view; but from another
I fear it would not be a good thing for Canada.
The reason money is so cheap is that people
are afraid to invest and they run to Government loans for cover.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: They are all
running for cover, and while to-day we pay
3.07 per cent on twenty-year loans, I earnestly
hope the demand for capital for business will
soon be so great that we shall have to pay
more. This would be better for the whole
country. If the rate of interest goes down
further, it will simply mean the race for
security is paralysing private enterprise more
and more. However, that is aside from the
main point before us.
The contribution is never going to be based
on anything like the calculations stated. The
calculations are not right. These projects will
be liquidating for more than twenty years. We
will presume there is need for waterworks and
other civic services, with a field there for
enterprise and employment. The loans will
be amortized over twenty years. Except in
very few cases, I do not think the period will
be shorter. Where the loans are large in
relation to the resources of the town or municipality they will take long periods to
amortize, and this will mean large borrowings
by the Dominion.
However, the unemployment situation is
indeed grave. The Minister uses the least
shocking language that he can; he says,

429

"There is unemployment still with us." Yes,
it is with us with a vengeance. It is with us
everywhere. For example, it is with us in
Vancouver-very closely with us. The unemployed have taken forcible possession of
federal property there. And the Government
is bending its neck and yielding to a sitdown strike at the hands of the unemployed,
and bas been for days, if not weeks. I suppose
that if unemployed took possession of this
building the Government would take the
stand it is taking in Vancouver-that it is for
the municipal authority to clear the Government's property. That, I suppose, would be
the measure of its masculinity and of its
fidelity to its sacred trust of administration.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think my right
honourable friend is exaggerating.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Not when I
say our property is being occupied by force,
against our will. Is that an exaggeration?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not know
exactly what is occurring in Vancouver, but it
is some distance from this Chamber.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But it is our
property. I do not know that we can ignore
the city of Vancouver because it is thousands
of miles away. British Columbia is just as
much a part of Canada as Ontario. The post
office at Vancouver is a post office of the
people of Canada, and the Government is the
trustee of that buildingSome Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: -yet it sits
outside while the post office is occupied by
the unemployed, whom the leader of the
Government tells us are still with us. They
are with us, and amongst us, and they are
ejecting us w-hile we have a supine Government in office. The situation is humiliating.
We have sympathy with -the unemployed, but
if there is one thing we cannot tolerate it is
sit-down practices anywhere in Canada.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Such a thing
as defiance of the Government of Canada
in the property of the Government of Canada
is something awful for Canadians to contemplate.
An Hon. SENATOR: A digression.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: It may be a
digression, but it is important to note that
the honourable leader of the Government
in this House can regard Vancouver as an
outcast colony or British Columbia as foreign
to us. British Columibia is a part of this
country, and forcible occupation of the post

430

SENATE

office building in Vancouver is just as serious
a thing as forcible occupation of this
Chamber.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But I was
simply answering my right honourable friend,
who asked what would occur here if this
Chamber were invaded. I answered that we
should be much nearer the illegal action to
be repressed here than we are in relation to
Vancouver.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Not a bit.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not know
what the municipal authorities, the provincial
authorities, or this Government are actually
doing at Vancouver. I do know what we
would be doing if we were thus invaded here.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
I do not
know why one policy should apply to British
Columbia and another to Ontario.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not suggest
there should be two policies.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I know the
policy that is being applied there, and I am
sure I read correctly the words of the responsible Minister, wio said it was a municipal responibility, then provincial, and then
federal. The property is ours.
Unemploynent is indeed serious. and I
fear it is growing more serious. For my
part, I hold the Government responsible in
this degree, and virtually only in this degree.
I know an increasing measure of unemployment is due in no small part to the toýtal
collapse of various artificial and fantastic
sclemues in the United States, and the very
serious recession they have suffered there.
For that this Government is not responsible.
The main responsibility of the Government
is for policies and practices entailing taxation.
The level of taxation is such that we have
stifled the enterprise of the country to a very
considerable degree,Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: -and
we
have to direct our primary and our greatest
efforts against tremendous waste and tremendous deficits. We must strive to reduce
that burden and get into a sounder federal
financial position, in order to give confidence
to finance and enterprise. One who says
anything like this is always met with the
remark, "Oh, you are looking out for the
employers." Of course I am. It is only
througl employers that we can set emploees
to work. There is no other way. We cannot

confidence and are ready to take risks and go

ahead. It is in relation to those matters, I
hold, that the Government is responsible. I
think fthere is a great deal more it could do.

I do n'ot say it is the only Government which
bas erred in that sphere, but its erring today is mainly there, and that is what I want
to impress strongly upon the Administration.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

But my right

honourable friend does not indicate what is
the immediate or mediate policy which would
bring about greater employment
and greater
activity on the part of employers.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Less expenditure. Why, we had estimates bere the other
day, supplementary
estimates-they were
supplementary, all right, with emphasis on
the first syllable--3,500,000 here, 3500,000
there, $100,000 in three or four places. Extravagance was writton over every phase of
them. You could almost read the words
"1938 election" across the top of the page.
That indicates the direction in which we are
going, and the main responsibility of the
Administration is to curb instead of leading
the parade. That is wiere to look. This
policy of drift will not result in improved
employment in Canada, and I do not think we
are going to get it in any satisfactory measure
until we wiole-eiiartedtly and uitedly set out
along the course I have suggested.
I am going to support the Bill. I state
frankly and definitely that I cannot think of
any better nethod by which a substantial
ainount of noney can b invested, with a
fair assurance of safety, to the end of relieving unemiployment.
But the very conditions which give rise to
the necessity of the Bill are due to the
causes I have naied, and if we are going to
keep on acting on the effect and ignoring
the cause, we shall have to apply these artificial remsedies year after year, with very
smnail and only teniporary results. The only
renedy is to open our eyes to the real cause
anid be have in the liglt of eur limes.
The honourable Icader of the Governmient

buisiness everywhere lie cannot fail to knowthat flie contraction of enterprise is due to

carry lis convictions into the affairs of the

if ho could, is strengtiened, and the depredatory hands of others are ield back.

That condition had to be met. The expenditure was justified. I venture to think that

admit that it sometimes looks as though certain expenditures could well be dispensed with,

eighteen years, from 1878 to 1896, the party

MOTION

FOR SEOOND

READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable senators, I would
ask leave to move the second reading now, in
order that the Bill may be sent to our Railway Committee and subjected to that detailed examination which we are wont to
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

give measures in our committees. If this is
acceptable to the Senate, I will give a short
explanation of the measure now.
The object of this Bill is to promote the
stabilization of the transport industry in Canada, in the public interest as well as in the
interests of all those engaged in transportation. The Bill extends regulation of rates to
inland shipping and to commercial air transport.
No one questions the benefit of Government regulation as applied to the railways;
least of all the railways themselves.
The
Government believes that the extension of rate
regulation to our inland waterways and to our
commercial airways will carry with it similar
benefits. It should be made clear from the
first that there is no intention to limit development on sound economie lines of any
form of transport, for the benefit of any other.
Inevitably the development of newer forms of
transport will be accompanied by some loss of
business from older forms, and it is net the
purpose of this Bill to interfere with that
process, so long as the same rules of competition apply to all.
The purpose of the Government is to bring
about a situation where competition may make
for the benefit of the public and for health
within the industry. We all recognize that
Canada must have an adequate railway service, since without it, for climatic and geographie reasons, it would be impossible to
conduct the business of the nation. We also
recognize that our great inland waterways
muist be served by transportation agencies
conducted on a sound economic basis, so that
these waterways may continue to provide
those low-cost transportation facilities that
make it possible for our Western farmers to
compete in the markets of the world.
Transportation by air is still in its infancy,
and it is logical that the development of this
industry should be conducted along sound
lines, under Government regulation. It is a
matter of public interest that transportation
rates be reasonably stable, and applied without discrimination. Experience has shown that
publicity is essential to prevent discrimination.
Therefore the publicity of rates is a fundamental requirement in this Bill.
We also appreciate that our transportation
rate structure may break down completely
unless some relation is maintained between
transportation charges and the abilities of
various commodities to stand those charges.
There is also the problem of conditions of
employment in transportation industries. It
will not be questioned that it is the duty and
interest of all employers to endeavour to

JUNE 8, 1938
maintain reasonable standards of conditions
and rewards of employment. Absence of
regulation and resulting uneconomical competition must inevitably bear heavily on
the workers, since labour costs comprise such a
large proportion of operating expenses. The
wide difference in working conditions, as
between regulated transportation and unregulated transportation, must be apparent to
all. Apart from the effect on labour, the
interest of public safety is also involved.
Canada is practically the last country to
apply state regulation to carriers other than
railways. The United States extended the
authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission to all railway operations, pipe lines
and motor vehicles operating across state
boundaries. Its Motor Carrier Act of 1935
has done much to regulate commercial
vehicles on the highways and to co-ordinate
highway rates with railway rates. Similarly,
United States coastwise ocean traffic is regulated, as well as coastal carriers operating
between ports on the Atlantic and ports on
the Pacifie through the Panama canal. Regulation has not as yet been applied to inland
waterways, such as the Great Lakes and the
Mississippi river; but there bas been introduced in the Senate by ýthe Chairman of the
Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce a
Bill which will provide, through the Interstate Commerce Commission, perhaps even
more extensive regulation of shipping on the
Great Lakes than we propose under this Bill.
In Great Britain, state regulation is exercised
over the railway carrier, the highway carrier
and the water carrier. A similar situation
exists in northern Ireland. In New Zealand
and Australia, the regulating bodies have
control over all forms of transportation, and a
certificate of convenience and necessity is
required before any new carrier can operate.
Et will thus be observed that Canada has
been slow to accept a situation that most
other countries have dealt with.
This Bill applies regulation to shipping
other than for bulk cargoes, such as wheat,
iron ore and raw materials, which are handled
in bulk, without packaging. The reason for
excluding bulk cargoes is that these are not
oompetitive, being carried at rates so low
as not to be attractive to rail carriers. Regulation of shipping applies only to rates, as
safety features are now regulated by the
Shipping Act.
Transportation by air is a comparatively
new industry and, therefore, regulation can be
applied without any serious dislocation. It is
believed that regulation is generally acceptable,
both to the operators and to the public.

43

Regulation under this Bill applies only to aircraft operaiting on regular schedules, over
regular routes. It does not apply to carriers
engaged in pioneer work or on casual services.
Provision for agreed charges extends to the
railways a privilege that is now enjoyed by
highway carriers, water carriers and aircraft,
that of contracting with a shipper to handle
his shipments exclusively at a rate which may
be lower than the tariff rate. Agreed charges
are now a well-established feature of British
transportation and have proved beneficial both
to the carriers and to the shipper. The
principle has also been generally adopted in
France. In short, the principle of agreed
charges permits a carrier to give to a shipper
who gives all his business to the carrier a
lower rate than may be offered to a shipper
who prefers to pick and choose from various
types of carriers.
The Bill provides for full publicity of rates
granted under agreed charges, and provides
against discrimination as between shippers
who wish to obtain the benefit of agreed
charges. There can be no discrimination as
between the large shipper and the small
shipper. In fact, the principle of the agreed
charges works to the benefit of the small
shipper, who cannot always obtain as low
a rate for highway transportation as can his
larger competitor.
The fairness of a low rate for all-year-round
shippers is obvious. In many sections of
Canada, where the highways cannot be kept
open the year round, everyone must use the
railway for winter shipments. The agreed
charge simply provides that in such cases,
those shippers who agree to ship all year by
railway will get an all-year-round rate, but
those who elect te use the railway in winter
and trucks in summer will not get the same
treatment. It is a realistic treatment of a
new development. There can be no harmful
discrimination when it is provided that any
shipper, big or small, who is willing to
conform to the same terms, shall get the
same treatment.
In the opinion of the Government the
agreed charge presents a greater chance of
preserving the low rate on long distance and
bulk commodities, so essential to our national
economy, and of putting a stop to the gradual
withering of our rail service on many branch
lines, the loss of which is an economic loss
to the country, than any other measure of
which I have knowledge. It is well worth a
trial. It will tend to curb the uneconomic
expansion of highway traffic and, by doing so,
will afford an opportunity for the sound
co-ordination of the two types of transportation, each within its own economie sphere.

51958-28
EDITION
REVISED

SENATE
With these general explanations, which give
a broad view of what is to be effected under
this Bill, I would move second reading,
seconded by my right honourable friend from
Eganville (Right Hon. Mr. Graham). I will
add that I am not ignorant of the fact that
a Transport Bill was before us last session,
and that after it was studied by our Railway
Committee for a number of weeks it was rejected by the Senate. I admit that so many
sections had been deleted in committee that
the measure had very little virtue left in
it, but still I felt that even in that form it
should have been returned to the House of
Commons. However, the Senate in its wisdom
decided to the contrary. The Minister of
Transport is perhaps convinced that some experience has been gained by our treatment of
the question. He presents the Bill with due
knowledge of the state of mind of the Senate,
and in the hope that the measure in its present
form provides for virtually what was admitted
to be in the interest of the country. I trust
tiat the motion will be adopted and the Bill
sent to our Railway Committee for study.
I know it will be given due attention there.
It is of very great importance to Canada.

the legislation, and got my honourable friend
to introduce it here, was the protection of
certain interests on the Great ,Lakes in which
he was interested.

Hon. WILLIAM DUFF: Honourable senators, I regret I did net catch the eye of His
Honour the Speaker before he put this motion,
because I intended to ask the honourable
leader of the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
if he would defer the motion for second reading until we had a chance te study the Bill.
So far as I am concerned, judging by evidence
that has been taken in a committee of another
place this session, I am as unalterably opposed
to this kind of legislation as I was last year.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I want to put myself on
record now as being opposed to the principle
of this Bill. In my opinion it is wrong. I
am more convinced than ever of that since
listening to the honourable leader, who has
pointed out that the measure introduced by
the Minister of Transport last session was
net this one at all. This is an emasculated
copy of the Bill that was before us last session.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have just said

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Does the honourable member object te the second reading
now?

se.

Hon. Mr. DUFF: I know. I am glad the
honourable leader agrees with me. I am
repeating what he said, for I want honourable
members to realize the situation. Much worse
than the Chinese who are retreating day by
day from the Japanese, much worse than the
Spaniards who are retreating from the insurgents, the Minister of Transport retreated all
along the line this year and last year, because all ho had in mind when ho introduced
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: He does net care anything
about aeroplanes, buses, or anything else. It
was purely a matter of trying to arrange to
have bankrupt shipping concerns on the Great
Lakes come under the proposed legislation,
and te have higher rates paid by the people
of this country.
It should be noted that this is not even
the same measure as was introduced in the
other House this session, for that was.amended perhaps fifty times in committee over
there, just as the one sent over to us last
year was amended in our committee.
So
I urge that before we are asked to give
second reading to this measure we should be
allowed a little time to study it. Then honourable senators would have an opportunity
of objecting to either the principle or the
form of the measure. I therefore would ask
the honourable leader not to press the motion
for second reading now.

Hon. Mr. DUFF:

Yes.

Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN:
Honourable
senators, of course I take a back seat to our
honourable friend who in another place was
called Admiral (Hon. Mr. Duii). He knew
more about navigation than any other member of that House, even than the former Prime
Minister, who was the son of a sea captain,
but who said he never had been acquainted
with anyone so well posted on navigation as
our honourable friend. However, the chief
reason I rose was. net to say this. I have a
very friendly feeling for my leader in this
House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) and for the
present Government, but I want to remind
them that for more than thirty-five years I
have been connected with navigation on the
Great Lakes and that for much of that time
I have been a public benefactor, in being
associated with the carrying of grain of the
Northwest at a loss. I should be ashamed to
own up to the total that I have spent on
this account. I want to remind the Government in the most friendly way that it
can regulate the railroads as much as it likes,
for they have to stay where they are built, but
on the Great Lakes and on the St. Lawrence
ships can be disposed of,Hon. Mr. DUFF:

Hear, hear.

JUNE 8,1938
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: -and if there is
any more interference wjth our shipping we
shall very soon have no Canadian ships plying
in those waters. Persons buy slips at scrap
prices, and any profit they make while they can
keep those ships in service is so mucli found
money. And they are nlot likcly to lose anything by nlot selling the boats for scrap this
year, since the price of scrap is steadily
rising and they are vcry likely to get a higher
price next ycar,
Canadian shipping bas flot been treated
fairly, and what I arn about to complain of
was, I regret to say, donc by a Government
of my own party. At the close of navigation
there is always a certain quantity of wheat
lef t over, which is stored cither in the hulîs
or in the elevators at Port Arthur and Fort
William. When navigation opens in May that
wheat comes down by watcr at rates that
do not pay operating expenses, but shipowncrs work on the principle that it is better
to get low rates than nothing at ail. By the
middle of June ail that storage wbcat bas
been brought down.
Then the shipping
companies have to tic up their ships, pay
off their men, and wait for the new crop,
which they may also have to carry at a loss.
XVhat did aur Government do? Although our
Canadian bottoms had been idle ail last
summer, our Governrnent allowcd American
ships to carry whcat from Port Arthur and
Fort William to Port Coîborne, and there
wcre so rnany American ships waiting to be
unloaded there that our Canadian ships were
blocked completely. I think the Government
should nlot interfere in this manner. If it
continues to do so there will soon be no
Canadian ships on the Great Lakes and the
St. Lawrence, and once you are lef t to the
tender mercies of our good friends south of
the forty-fifth parallel of latitude, you will
sec what shipping rates you will have to pay.
What happened last year did not cnrich the
sharcholders of my company; and I am quite
willing to name that company-Canada Steamship Lines-of which I have been a director
for twenty years; longer than any other
director living today. I am not spcaking for my
awn interest in that company. I do not think
it amounts to vcry rnuch just now, for after
being a public benefactor for twenty-five
years one cannot have rnuch Icft.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, it mnust have been a terrible
disappointment to the honourable leader of
the Huse that the reading of such a seductive
and all-comprehensive brief should evoke this
measure of opposition.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There is no
opposition to my left. The carrying of wheat
iésnot aff ected by this Bill.
51558--28J

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Then I take it al
hack, I listcned carefully and thought the
purpose of the Bill was to fix shipping rates
on whcat.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: As he proceeded sentence by sentence, painting the
glanies to come, with ahl our troubles ended
and nothing more to be suffercd, according
to the terras of his brief, I thought the House
could not do otherwise than say unanimously,
"That is ail .we have been awaiting for
decades."
Hon. Mr. DUFF: The Millennium is here.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I asked only
that the Bill ho sent to committee.
Right Hlon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Certainly.
One wouid think that once we passed this
measure we could don our Miamni suits and
start for the races, for the Millennium was
here alrcady.
This Bill is, in the main, a reproduction of
the measure which hast year was brought
before this bouse, thoroughly reviewed, and
flnally rejcctcd. The rejectian brought from
the Minister af Transport, who now addresses
these sweet, seductive words to us, an attack
on this bouse, so provocative and so unjust
that it aroused thc resentment of everyone
loyal to the institutions of our country.
The Bill cornes to us now in a cansiderably
rnodified form and with oCher fruits meet for
repentance, and it should receive st our hands
an unbiascd and thorougb review. I am not
at aIl convinccd, t>hough, that the Bihl offers
anything like the prospect which has been
painted. We are told Canada is the last
country in the world to regulate these forms
of transportation. Great Britain is cited.
Why, of course Great Britain is doing it.
Great Britain has a Parliament with phcnary
and cornplete jurisdiction. Nor.thcrn Ircland
is cited; a similar condition exists there.
We have a Parliament with limited jurisdiction, under a federal system. Our commit tee
of hast year neyer had before it any evidence
which wouhd show the character and consequences of state regulation in those two
countries. Now we are inforrned such regulation was some little time ago put into
effect in the United States. There is acon
try carresponding to our own, and I 'loubt
not that the rnagnificent efflorescence of
prosperity in that country has induced this
Government to folhow in its footsteps. The
grand measure of happiness and wealth which
bas overwhelmed the Repubhie is presumably
due in part ta the mnerits of its rcgulating
policy. I think the truth is, that country is

SENATE
regulated to death. It is regulated and overregulated until the people who want to do
something do not know where to turn.
Hon. Mr. DUFF:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I hope the
Government is not bringing forward something that would so multiply regulations as
to stifle industry. I know there is a handicap on the railways. In the matter of contract the railways are not on a parity with
their competitors who have entered the
transportation field only recently. There
must be some way of overcoming the handicap, but I am afraid myself, in advance of
evidence which may be adduced, and which
may quite rightly change my mind, that
there is grave danger in trying to overcome it
by means of agreed charges.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The principle
of agreed charges, we have to keep in mind,
is against the cardinal principle of our railway
policy as embodied in the Railway Act-a
policy which has worked well. It was put
into effect by a Government with whicb I
of
have little sympathy. The principle
agreed charges is a blow in the face of that
polic'. and would even take the vitais out
of if, and we ought to be very careful about
approving of such a principle.

As honourable

memrobris will recall, the Bill of last session
was opposed by every province.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: I do not
know wheother the provinces are opposing this
Bill. I know the Western Provinces wiii feel
somewhat different when .they find wheat and
coarse grains are left out. I am advised
grain products are not left out. The inclusion of grain products andHon. Mr. HAIG: They have been left out.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is pretty
hard to find any justification for regulating
rates on such traffic on the Great Lakes as
is known as L.C.L. traffic on the railways.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Package traffic.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is pretty
hard to find any principle upon wbich vou
can justify regulating package traffic while
not regulating the gigantic traffic in grain.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I fear we are
getting our regulation into such a complicated
state that the goal we are seeking to reach
mav he furthier and further lost from view
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

and that our citizens who are still struggling
against adverse conditions and endeavouring
to do something for labour and for themselves
may become more and more depressed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would direct
my right honourable friend's attention to the
great handicap under which the two railway
systems labour to-day. I believe that when
this Bill is before the Railxvay Committee
it will be shown that agreed charges would
help the railways considerably, and would
not bring about unfair conditions. I admit
that when rate regulation was set up under
the Railway Act it was based on a different
principle, but I think it will be shown that
this proposal is to meet a dire necessity.
However, I am not a rate specialist and will
not press the matter.
I have asked that we hasten reference of
the Bill to the Railway Committee because
I have some responsibility for our legislation
reaching a certain goal. This week we should
try to dispose of as many as possible of
Government bills, te be free next Tuesday to
resume our inquiry into the railway situation,
which. as bonourable members are aware, is a
very important matter.
I draw the attention of myv honourable
friend from Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duff) to
the fact that we can give the Bill second
reading without binding ourselves to its
principle. As a matter of fact it contains
several principles.
The Bill can then be
referred to committee. I believe it is the
fair way to proceed with such an important
piece of legislation; important because parties
will appear before us representing substantial
interests. I think we should first of all deal
with the Bill in committee and see what
justification there is for each of the clauses,
and then on the motion for third reading we
shall be in a far better position to express an
opinion on the merits.
With these remarks I move second reading
of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Honourable senators,
I certainly dIo not like to oppose anything
which the honourable leader of the House
may suggest. In fact, in the words of Scripture, he "almost persuadeth me" by the able
mainner in which be bas placed before us the
vicws of his colleagues in the Government.
However, I feel very strongly on this Bill,
and J intend, as soon as I have had an
opportunity of studying it. to place my views
before the House in opposition to the measure.
There are a number of matters which I desire
to discuss, and J shall have no opportunity
of doing so once the Bill bas been given

Bis on behaif of persons to whom other

The Senate, therefore, should divest itse]f
of ail such special obligations incidentaI to
private Bis of divorce as, in the past, it bas
assurncd, and in furtberance of sncb purpose
and to make possible its achievement in consonance xvitb the first paragrapb of this resolution, tbe Senate should promete and support
legisiation so providing.
He said: Honourable senators, it will take
but a few minutes to explain my motion and
gîve you my reasons for introducing it at this
time.
You are ail familiar with divorce as deait
xvith by the Senate to-day. It is apparent to
me and, I suppose, to many others here,
that our divorce procednre is rapidly developing into a ridiculous business which is nlot in
kooping witb the dignity of the Senate and
does nlot add anything to the credit of
Parliamont. In view of the many serions
issucs bofore us, this daily grinding ont of
divorces must appear to the public as rather
abuid. The stranger who sits in the gallery
and listons f0 our daily proceedings-the
rcading and adoption of reports of the Divorce
Committce, the presentation of divorce bis
and their passage through their varions stages,
and the final report of the adoption of such
bis hy the other Huse, ail rocorded in
detail in our Minutes-migbt very well come
to the conclusion that the principal business
of this honourabie House is divorce.
The time whic.h is given by hoth Huses
of Parliament to the subjeet of divorce might,
I suggest, be mnch better devotcd to the important national issues which are pressing
for solution. The honourable members of the
Senate Standing Committee on Divorce, who
work se bard and so diligcntly in dealing
with the applications that como before them,
could rîndoubtodly empiey thcir time to
greater national advantage by serving on
other standing committees, somo of which at
the moment are loadod with work.
I suggest we have neither the time ner
the machineiry to make a careful judicial inquiry into these family squabbles. That. I
submit, is more properly the function of a
court of law. As an indication of this, may
I point to the fact that we make no provision for alimony; nor do we concern aurselves about the future of the children, the
innocent viýctims of divorce, who altogether
too frequently are the ones most affected by it.
In 1930, when we passed the Act to provide
for the dissolution and annuiment of marriage
in the province of Ontario, we hoped that
divorce by Parliament was at an end. The
province of Quehcc, whose people are overwhclmingiy opposcd to divorce, did flot

tien. The resuit is that we are to-day burdenod with divorce cases, aIl of which, except
for a fow from Prince Edward Island, come
from Quober; in fact, almost entirely from
the city of Montreal.
ln the yoar 1930, prier te the establishment of dix orco courts in Ontario, Parliament
passed 247 divorce buis, of which 206 came
froin Ontario and 41 from Qucbec. After the
law was changod in 1930 the numbor dropped
to 37 in 1931, te 27 in 1932, and to only 24
in 1933. Thon an increase began. Last year
we grantcd 42 divorces. In the present session xvc have alroady hcaid 79 cases, and a
numbor of potitions stili romain to bo (leait
wvith. 0f the 79 divorces dealt with se far this
session, 68 came from the city of Montreai.
If tho increase in the last two years continues, we shaîl seon be back where we were
in 1930. It would appear that then we shall
have te enlarge our Divorce Committee and
divido it inte different sections, so that this
part of our work may ho satisfactorily discharged. This increase is ail the more certain
if the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Bill
reccntly passed by this honourable bouse, incroasing the grounds for divorce, should become
the lawv of the land.
In dix orcing porsoas cîomiciled in the provin c of Qîîohoc we find ourselves in the incongruous position of granting divorces in a
province whorc div orce is net approved. 0f
the 89 înemîbers reprosenting the province of
Quchoc in the two Houses of Parliament. at
least 90 per cent vote against ail divorce bis.
So xxe arc also forcing the province te accept
divorces xvhich it doos not xvant. This is not
a comifortahle situation. Wo have givon the
prov inces the right te handie their ewn diverce
problenis. but Quebec does net choose te grant
any divorces.
In my opinion. that is its
affair. People who resido in that province
must expeet te abide by its Iaws. As matters
stand te-day, that means ne divorce. Personally, I should like te leave ail divorces te the
provinces and net interfere with t hem.
Our recent logîsiation, incîeasing the causes
for divo rce, is limited te, the provinces which
maintain divorce courts. If exempts Quehec. If this precedure is legal, I suggest that
we go a stop furthcr and include aduiiory
wvith dosertion, insanity, cruolty, and se forth.
This wouid limait divorce on the ground of
adultery, as well as divorce for other causes, te
the provinces which maintain divorce courts,
and would, of course. except Quebec. By our
se doing, divorces in this Parliament would
ho at an end.
I know there are some people who feel
deeply concerned about minerify rights Ii the
province of Quehec. That dees net werry

JUNE 9, 1938
me vcry much. That province bas long had a
record for equitable and fair treatmnent of
minorities, with respect to issues more important than the one under discussion. I personally
sbould be prepared to leave thîs in the bande
of the province.
Refcrring to the increasing applications for
divorce wbich continue to corne before us, I
feel that the situation is rapidly becoming
intolerable. If we are to judge by the
evidence given before our Divorce Committee, this divorce business has now become
highly standardized. The evidence in practically every divorce case bas a similarity
that is most monotonous-the saine violation
of tbe marriage vow, the saine metbod pursued, the saine lawyers, altogether too irequently tbe saine witnesscs, so-called private
detectives, and, not to be overlooked, the
professional co-respondents who it is said are
always available in Montreal.
The honourable senator from King's (Hon.
Mr. Hughes) bas frequently called the attention of the House to bais conviction that
there is collusion in most of our divorce cases.
I fear that hie is correct and that collusion
lies at the root of more than half of the
divorces granted by the Senate.
The whole business is ddsgusting, and the
procedure, as I bave said, is not in kee.ping
with the dignity of Parliament. That, tersely,
is my justification for tbe first paragrapb of
my motion.
Tbe second paragrapb is an effort to aneticipate any objection on constitutional
grounds. There are sonne whio still feel we
cannot.deny the right of a citizen to appeal
to the King-in thîs case Parliament. Personally I would put -an end to divorce originating in the Senate by simply discontinuing
our Standing Committee on Divorce and requiring petitions for divorce to be presented
to our Private Bills Com.mittee, wbich could
tbrow tbem out. However, in view of the constitutional question, I bave added tbe second
paragrapb to provide for sucb legislation
as this honourable Huse might deem necessary i order to attain the objective I have
in mimd.
I bave been unable to discover how the
Senate of Canada became the forum to deal
with divorce. Apparently it just drifted into
that rcsponsibility. In Gemmil's book on
Parliamen-tary Divorce, page 63, will be found
the f ollowing:
Divorce lu a legisiative act originating in the
Senate, but there le no reason why it should
not originate in the House of Commons.
This may indicate one way out for the Senate.
For niy part, I tbink this honourable House
sbould take steps now te get rid of divorce

439U

applications in the future. For this reason
1 present this motion, which I hope will bring
the situatiion to a bead, and se relieve thie
bonourable House frein a grave tbreat by
freeing it from the divorce business, which I
feel is verging on the scandalous.
Hon. L. MeMEANS: Honourable meinhers,
I arn supporting this motion in the hope that
a full discussion will bring about a cessation
of parliamentary divorce. The Standing Coinmittee on Divorce is composed of nine members, five of vçlbom are professional men. Last
week during a sitting of the committee a
justice of the Supreme Court of Ontario wae
presiding in the local court-house and disposed
of fifteen divorce cases at the rate of one case
every fifteen minutes.
I feel a great deal of sympathy for the unfortunate persons who feel obliged to resort to
Parliam-ent for a divorce. Wbat does it involve? In the first place the petitioner bas
to file a petition in triplicate. and pay fees
to the clerk of the committee to the amounit
of $210. The petition, must be advertised
in the Gazette and also in the local papers.
The applicant must retain counsel in Montreal
cases originate-and that
-where most of %the
counsel has to bave an agent bore. Then
the witnesses must be brought here. After
the case bas been beard by our committee
a report is made to the Senate, and the
evidence is printed and distributed, among the
members of bcsth Houses. In my opinion,
tbe eviden-ce in undefended caises should not
hie printted at ail unless there is a request
for -it.
In 1930 the sumn of $34,077 was collected
in fees from these unfortunýate applicants for
d.ivorce, and -the balance remaining ai ter allowance bad been made for remissions and cost
of printing was so much net revenue to the
Governmenit. I tbink it is cruel to require
tbese f ces from persons of slender means.
At the present time there are 88 cases on
our list, of which 86 are from Montreal or
the province of Quebec. Last year there were
42 cases from. Quebcc; so this year the cases
originating thece have more than doubled.
Forty-one of the ftpplicants were ini such
straitened circumstances that they could not
pay the required fees. There were cases in
which the wif e, having been deserted, had
to get a position as stenographer or bookkeeper or waitress and was earnàng from $5
to $15 a week. Out of that slender income
she had to incur beavy expenses to obtain
a parliamentary divorce.. This year the proceeds tbat bave accrued to the Government
by way of divorce fees amnunt to, $9,5W0 odd.
That le te say, the country received a revenue

440

SENATE

of $9,500 which came out of the pockets of
these unfortunate people. I do not think
the Govcrnmen. should derive a revenue from
any such source. The lix-es of these people
are miserable, and they are lcft in a pitiable
condition. Their only remedy is to secure a
divorce so that they may start anew. Yet,
according to the ruies of Parliament, they have
to pay a huge fee in order to get a divorce.
After a bill of divorce is passed here, what
becomes of it? It is sent ito the House of
Commons, where it bias to pass another cornmittee; and I do not hesitate to say that in
the past in many cases, of which I have
known personally, there bias been a lobby
against the bill, and sometimes the lobby bias
been successful, the resuit being that the bill
passcd by this House hias been finaily rejected.
Under these circumstances I think there
should be some remedy provided if possible.
I quite agree with what lhas been said by
the proposer of the resolution as to other
grounds, but what appeals to me even more
is the fact that these unfortunate people who
apply for the remedy of divorce shýould Dlot
be mult-ted in hieaxy fee&. and should not bc
compelled to corne to Parliarnent at ail.
I did not quite catch what the honourable
gentleman said as to why these divorces were
solely within the juris-diction of the
Domnimon."
My recollection as to the reason is that a
provision was inserted in the British North
America Act, at the instance of Sir George
Etienne Cartier, for the protection of the
minority. It is my understanding from some
books I have read on the subjeet that this
is the reason why exclusive jurisdiction was
given to the Dominion under the British
North America Act.
I do not think I have anything further to
say. I hope some method will he suggested
by which these divorces can be deait'with
without coming ýbefore this House at ail.
I express this hope on behaif of the unfortunate people I have referred to. My
sympathy goes out to th.em, and I feel that
they should have a less etpensive remedy.
Hon. Mr. MURDOýCK: What would be
the status of people in Quebec if there were
no divorces granted here?
Hon. Mr. ýMcMEANS: They wouid do as
others have donc in other parts of the
country; they would move out of their
province.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Would that not
involve a larger measure of expense?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Oh, no; I do not
think so. Besides, it must be remembered
that Parliament meets oniy once a year,
lon. Mr. MeIMEANS.

whereas the courts are sitting daily. In
Ontario there are circuit judges who go from
town to town and try the cases, including
divorce cases, set down on the list, and
if a divorce application is flot contested it is
disposed of in fifteen minutes. Furthermore, one can go to Michigan and get a
divorce very quickly. I arn told that at one
time there were in the state of Michigan
more divorces granted to Canadianis than to
any others.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Is it flot a violation of the ýlaw for a citizen of Canada to go
to Michigan or to Reno to get a divorce?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: It is no violation
of the law to go there. The divorce, of
course, would not be good unless both parties
went there and said they were content to
hav e the case tricd there and that they were
residents of the state. Is it a charge of
bigairîy the honourable gentleman refers to?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: If my honourable
friend were familiar with the circumstances
hie would know that rnany people in Canada
are living in a bigamous condition. I think
there are hundrcds and thousands in cities
ail over this country. Perhaps even one's
next door neighhoum is one of thern. There
are many cases in which a woman or girl is
deserted. She cannot prove the offence whi'ch
is the ground for a divorce. What is the
result? I need not go into that, for the
House bias already decided against my contention in regard to desertion. But what is
going to happen? Is she not driven to another
xuethod of life? Soiieone cornes along, andi
ýsle bccoines fond of 1dm, and she goes and
]iveos with him. I think the ex-il ;vouid hc

to me that we bave also the right to widen

from the province of Quebec, for instancecould apply to any court in the country for

AIl that is asked in this resolution is that

He said: Honourable senators, the committee recommends that the Senate do insist
on its amendment, for the following reasons:
1. The corporation, being the person guilty

of the offence and the only one to be possibly
benefited by the offence, is the only person
that should be penalized. To penalize officers,
directors or employees is unjust, and is especially unjust in the case of officers or employees
whose position may depend on obedience to
company policy.
2. The amendment does provide an increase
in the minimum penalty in the case of a third
or subsequent offence. There are many very
small companies, such, for example, as small
canneries, in respect of whom a fine necessarily
greater than fifty dollars might be unduly
severe and resuit in reluctance to convict.
3. There can be no reason why the imposition
of fines if appropriately heavyof a progressively heavy amount-should have less effect ini the case of offences
against the Lord's 'Day Act than in the case
of offences against any other Act.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable members,
before the motion is put, may I say that 1
have been requested 'by the honourable senator
from Shawinigan (Hon. Mr. Bourgeois) to
ask that this matter stand until Tuesday of
next week. He was here until the Order was
reached and passed. Now we are taking it up
again. He would like to be here to have an
opportunity of discussing the report.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: 1 feel quite sure
the honourabie senator from Shawinigan
would be entirely satisfied with the action
which it is now proposed to take.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: He asked me less than
haîf an hour ago to make this request on
his behaif. He said, "I am afraid that report
is going to come up again, and I wish you
would ask that consideration of it be adjourned
until I am here."
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I sponsored the Bill,
though somewhat unwillingly. I conferred
with the honourable senator from Shawinigan,
and I arn pretty certain that the action I now
intend to suggest, if the report is adopted,
will be quite satisfactory to him. By considering the report now we shaîl get some action
on the question he is interested in.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I can only repeat, that

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, I arn not interested in whether this
Order is postponed or not, but I think some
person with a fine Italian hand has been, as
hie conceived, improving the reasons drafted
by the committee.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: It was not I.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I had no
thought of the senator at ail. I do flot think
any honourable member had to do with it.
There is another particular in which. I know
the report does flot follow the terms as written
out in the committee, but 1 do flot think it is
important except as to one paragraph, which
the House of Commons may find it difficuit
to understand in its present form. The third
paragraph, as read by the chairman of the
committee, stated that in cases of offences
against the Lord's Day Act there was no
reason why fines, if "progressive," should have
less effect. "Progressive" I dislike in many
respects, and certainly in this setting.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I now have
the report before me. I find the wording of
the paragraph is ail right, but it was flot so,

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable members, if
my request is not granted, I shall move adjournment of the debate.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The motion
before the House, honourable members, is,
that this report be considered forthwith. The
motion can pass only with unanimous consent.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Then the report

The Hon. the SPEAKER: I know hie did.
It is moved, and seconded, that this report

FARMERS'

CREDITORS ARRANGEMENT BILL
THIRD

READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
third reading of Bill 25, an Act to amend the
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934,
as amended.
He said: There is an error in the Bill, which
does not at all affect any of the clauses.
In order to have it rectified the honourable
senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) will move an amendment to the
motion.
Hon. J. W. deB. FARRIS: Honourable
senators, in the Bill as now printed clause 1
has three subelauses, and they are not arranged
in proper sequence. The first subelause defines
" creditor."
Then, without any apparent
connection. follow the second and third subelauses, which deal with procedure in cases
that have been partly heard. The Law Clerk
of the Senate suggests that subsections 2, 3
and 4 of seetion 1 be taken out of the definitions. of which they should really form no
part, and he put together as a separate group.
No change in meaning is involved. It is
simply a rearrangement in more orderly form.
I move therefore:
That Bill No. 25 be not now real a third
time, but that it be amended by leaving out
subelauses 2, 3 and 4 of clause 1 thereof and
substituting the following:
(2) Section 12 of the said Act is amended
by adding thereto as subsections 12, 13 and 14
the following:
(12) If, in the case of a proposal fled prior
to the coming into force of this subsection, a
debt secured by mnortgage, hypothee, pledge,
charge, lien or privilege on or against any
property of the farmer (hereinafter referred
to as the secured debt) bas not, by reason of
the absence of privity of contract between the
farmer and a secured creditor as herein defined,
been dealt with by way of a composition, extension of time or scheme of arrangement, the
farmer shall be entitled to have the proposal
proceeded witb or to file a new proposa], in
either case, for the purpose of baving the
secured debt dealt with by way of composition,
extension of time or sceeie of arrangement in
the like manner and witb the like results as
if this subsection had been in force at the
date of the filing of the original proposaI.
Hion. Mr. MeMEANS.

(13) In the case of a proposal formnulated by
a Board of Review prior to the conming into
force of this subsection whereby a secured debt
was dealt with, the fariner shal, notwithstanding the absence of privity of contract between
himself and a secured creditor as herein defined,
be entitled to have such proposal confirmed by
the Board of Review in the like manner and
with the like results as if this subsection had
been in force at the date of the filing of his
proposal by the farmer, or if such proposal was
confirmed prior to the coming into force of this
subsection it shall be binding as if it hiad been
confirmed after the coning into force of this
subsection.
(14) The provisions of the two next preceding
suibsections of this section shall not apply in
any case where by an order or judgmient of a
court of competent jurisdiction the title Of any
farmer to any lands or chattels bas been
extinguished prior to the coming into force of
such subsections.
The Law Clerk has also made one or two
slight verbal changes to improve the wording
of the Bill without affecting its meaning.
The amendment was agreed te.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Shall the motion
for third reading of the Bill, as amended,
carry?
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourable senators,
I have an amendment. I understand the law
of contract goes back to the beginning of
civiliza:tion. and that in every civilized country
in the world it bas been recognized that privity
of contract is the very foundation of justice.
As I understand, this Bih is departing from
that principle. I am loath indeed to speak
on any subject, particularly on one involving
legal questions. because I know noithing about
the law and am sure te make some mistakes
in phrascology. I do not think the Farmers'
Creditors Act was good law, but it was much
better as it stood than it will bc as now
amended. This Bill takes away privity of
contract and compels a creditor to accept a
debtor whom he would not accept at all if
he had the right of contract.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

To accept a re-

duction.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: No; it is worse than
accepting a reduction. This Bill. as I understand, enables a man who, we will say, bought
a farm subject to a mortgage 'to go before a
board of review and get that mortgage reduced1, and then compel the mortgagee te
accept the reduction so made. The debtor
bought the property with full knowledge of
the encumbrance, and he may be a man wbom
,the creditor would net want to have any
business dealings witJh. That procedure appears to me te be fundamentally wrong. It
is of the nature of Aberhart legislation-not
so bad perhaps, but the principle is the same.

JUNE 9, 1938

When the Bill was before the Senate on a
previous occasion the honourable leader of the
House said the reason for this provision was
that in some of the provinces the boards of
review made certain decisions which the Court
of Appeal in Ontario held to be wrong in law.
The honourable member from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) said that under what
I may call these improper rulings given inHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
cases.

In thousands of

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Yes-certain conditions became established which, if these improper rulings were not validated, would be
prejudicial to the public interest. I am not
competent to express an opinion in regard to
that state of affairs, but if it be the case, why
in the name of goodness should we extend
these improper rulings into (the future?
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: That seems to me to
be fundamentally wrong. If we validate these
improperHon. Mr. MacARTHUR:

Illegitimate.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: -if we validate these
improper rulings, then let us stop right here
and now and require that for the future only
proper decisions shall be made. This is the
amendmient which I now move:
That the Bill be not now read a third time,
but that it be amended as follows:
1. Page 1, lines 8 to 10: strike out the
following words: "and, notwithstanding the
absence of privity of contract between the
debtor and any of the persons hereinafter
mentioned,"
2. Page 1, lines 18 to 31: strike out subclause 2 of clause 1.
3. Page 2, lines 1 to 11: strike out subclause
3 of clause 1 and substitute the following:
"(2) The said Act is further amended by
inserting immediately after subsection 6 of
section 12 thereof the following subsection:
"(6A) In the case of a proposal formulated
and confirmed by a Board of Review prior
to the coming into force of this subsection,
whereby a secured debt was dealt with notwithstanding the absence of privity of contract
between the former and another person treated
as or held by the board to be a secured creditor,
such proposai shall nevertheless be binding upon
all concerned."
4. Page 2, lines 12 to 16: strike out subclause 4 of clause 1.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Honourable senators,
I think I should make some explanations in
regard to this matter.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Judging from the statements that have just been made, I think there
has been some misconception with regard
to. first. the meaning of this section, and,

44ô

second, its effect. The purpose of this section is not to change the relationships of
debtor and creditor, but only to extend the
jurisdiction of the board.
Let me give an illustration. I mortgage my
property to A. If I become insolvent and unable to carry on, I can go to the board and
get relief. But suppose my honourable friend
at my right (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) mortgages
his property to A and then sells it meHon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I would not.
I become inHon. Mr. FARRIS: -and
solvent and am unable to meet my obligations,
and I go to the board. They will say that as
the mortgage was put on by someone else in
the first place, they have no jurisdiction. There
is no sense in that from a practical standpoint.
In one case the board could act, but in the
other it could not. So far as practical effect
is concerned, if I am a farmer and there is a
mortgage against my property, it does not
make any difference whether I made the mortgage in the first place or bought the land
with the mortgage on it. The result will be
the same in either case. This measure undertakes not to change the relationships, but only
to give the board power in each case to make
the adjustments.
My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Hughes)
says that the orders previously made have been
illegal, and that the illegality should not be
perpetuated. But there was nothing of impropriety in the illegality itself; it was merely
a misapprehension of the powers under the
Act. What Parliament now proposes to do is
to cure that irregularity and validly confer
on the boards the power to do the things they
thought they had the power to do in the first
place. The board should have power to deal
with a mortgage on my property, whether I
put it on or it was there when I bought the
property. There should be no distinction; and
if Parliament confers the power there should
be no difference in the results.
There is another statement the lawyers will
appreciate at once, as to the sanctity of
privity of contract. If I owe a debt to my
honourable friend to my right, and I assign
that debt to BRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: You cannot
assign it.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: -and my honourable
friend assigns it to B, and B gives me
written notice of the situation, there is a
change in privity of contract, under statute, I
think, in every province. So it is well understood that in virtue of statute law you can
change the relationship of debtors in this
way. But this Bill does not go so far. All
it does is to say that for the purposes of this

44b

SENATE

Act the creditor of A shall be regarded as
the creditor of B, merely for the purpose of
giving jurisdiction to the board. That is all.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR:
Honourable
senators, I should like to say a few words.
Take a hypothetical case. I have $5,000
lying around loose and I want to get 6 per
cent interest on it. I am A, the mortgagee.
I take a mortgage from B, my desk-mate. I
am willing to run the risk on the security for
that $5,000. B goes to C and sells him the
property. I may not want to recognize C
at all. There is where I come in, as the
mortgagee. I look to B because I made the
contract with him; I am not looking to C
because B sold the farm subject to a
mortgage. I am looking to the original
nortgagor, not the second nortgagor. Under
this amendment you are increasing the number of creditors.
Furthermore, I believe there is some question as to whether or not this legislation is
intra vires. The objection has been raised
that it interferes with provincial legislation.
I do not understand this law business very
well, but I know there is going to be confusion worse confounded before we are
through with this legislation. If the Government wants to put it through, all right.
The legislation is not going to last long in
my province anyway, and I am not very
much interested in it. But we have 30 or 40
lawyers here, and we ought to know where
we stand on this privity of contract. I do
say, however, that if I were lending money
to one man on a farm loan, and took a
rnortgage, I should not be forced to accept
another man.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: My honourable friend
does not need to accept the other man at all.
If ho wants to rely on the personal credit of
the original debtor he can pursue him on
that; but if he insists on enforcing the
mortgage against the new holder of the
mortgage, then the board should step in.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, my first comment is this. In its
present form the amendment proposed by the
honourable senator from King's (Hon. Mr.
Hughes) could not, of course, apply to the
Bill as just amended, because the portions
now proposed to be amended, although described correctly at the time this amendment
was prepared, become incorrectly described
when the Bill is changed in accordance with
the amendment moved by the honourable
senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) and already passed. That difficulty,
of course, could be removed. Very little work
Hon. Mr. FARRIS.

would be required in order to make the
amendment of the honourable senator from
King's (Hon. Mr. Hughes) applicable to the
Bill as it now stands.
I followed the honourable member from
Vancouver South, and while I agree with him
in his reasoning, I cannot say that my mind
is clear as to the propriety of passing the Bill
in its present form. I know the proper time
te bring this up was when the Bill was in
committee, but I cannot recall this particular
clause or this point being immediately under
debate there. If it was, it must have been
wrhen I was out for a moment. I am disposed
to agree with the honourable senator from
King's (Hon. Mr. Hughes) that we might do
better to amend the Bill so as to cure, if we
can, the settlements already in effect. which
may be impeached as invalid because of a
recent decision, probably a correct one, unless
they are validated by such legislation as this.
I am inelined to think we shall avoid trouble
by endeavouring to validate them. but I
should not want the Senate to go any further
than is necessary. We should avoid, if possible,
any attempt to reach out the arm and bring
in as a creditor within the neaning of this
Act the mortgagee who took his mortgage
from an owner who was prier to the farmer in
distress.
I am going to confine my argument to one
ground.
I very mueh fear the constitutionality of the effort we are making. The
honourable senator from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris), I am quite sure, has had
more practice in these matters than I have
had, and he may have studied the constitutional phase more than I. However, I put
this submission to the House. We are legislating in bankruptcy. That is our only basis
of jurisdiction to support this w'hole Farmers'
Creditors Arrangement Law. In the exercise
of this jurisdiction which we assume, and which
we have, we certainly can deal with creditors;
we can deal with the debtor, and we can do
things incidental to enable settlement of the
debtor's affairs in bankruptcy and the distribution of his assets. But when we seek some
man who is not a creditor of the debtor at
all, and make him a creditor, are we net really
doing soenthing beyond the incidental?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: How can you distribute the assets without bringing him in?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: You cannot
distribute his security until you have taken
care of him. I am net saying finally that you
cannot bring him in, but I question very much
that you can. What I should like to ask of
some lawyer who has had more experience in
bankruptcy matters than myself is this. In

447

JUNE 9, 1938
tbe case of a merchant, is sucb a man made
a creditor in tbe event of bankruptcy? I do
flot tbink we are entitled to read into the list
of creditors tbe naine of someone wbo is not
a creditor. He may bave security against the
property, but tbe debtor does not owe him.
If be wisbes to assert bis rigbt and bas an
assignment from a creditor, be may be in a
different position. But that is not the point.
The farmer, in justice, does not owe that
man. That man bas security on tbe property,
and he rnay came in and make a composition
witb tbe creditor; but if he cornes before tbe
Officiai Receiver and says, "I will agree to take
so mucb as againat that land," be cannot
recover against the debtor.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: In bankruptcy he is requested to value bis securîty, and can dlaim
for tbe balance.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But be is not
made a creditor and is flot treated as such,
and 1 think it is stretching tbe law of incidental
autbority too far to atternpt to do that or
to say tbat we can do it.
Now, if I arn right in even raising a serious
doubt, would it not be 'better just to validate
wbat is done-"ht may be impeached, it is
true, but there are only a iimited number
of cases and tbere may neyer be impeacbment-than to pass a measure wbich is almost
certain to be cballenged, for attention is
now drawn in a very empbatic way to this.
point? Would it not be better to confine
our effort to validating wbat is done now?
The validating of this is not likely to be
impeaobed at ail, for those men wborn these
boards of review have taken in and calied
creditors wben tbey were not creditors have
,proba;bly estopped thernselves from taking
any proceeding. In most cases they have
iikely accepted, and tbe iaw of estoppel will
appiy. But if we deal with the future and
endeavour ta assert our autbority in oases
in time to corne, and say that certain persons
shaîl be called creditors when they are flot
sucb, and that tbey shall be treated just like
real creditors, I think -we shall get ita the
position described by the bonourable senator
from Prince (Han. Mr. MacArthur) and
there will be confusion worse confounded.
1 suggest to the honourable senatar frorn
Vancouver Soutb (Hon. M.r. Farris) that be
seriously consider an appropriate arnendment
wbich will confine our effort ta valid-ating what
bas been done, and leave the future ta tak
care of itself in tbe way in w.hich tbe past in
the great mai ority of cases bas been taken
care of, witbout regarding this security-holder
as a creditor witbin the purview of the
bankruptcy law.

Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: The right bonourable gentleman, as usual, has made the
matter clear and lucid, He bas exactly expressed my opinion of this situation. We
now have 58 illegitimate cbildren, so to speak.
We have power to make them legitimate.
But on the very same ground there are
some tbree tbousand other persons whose
cases are questionable and who are ready to
corne -along and ask to be made legitimate;
and their number may increase to six, eight
or ten thousand before we are tbrough. The
question is whetber we want to legitimize
only the 58 illegitimate children or the six
or eight th-ousand questionable ones.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Would the right honourable gentleman (Right Hon. Mr. Meigben)
permit me? I do not tbink he has given
enough consideration to the fundamentals of
this thing. The distinction sbould flot be
between the creditors. The point to be
eruphasized is this. You have two farmers
living side by side on farrns of the same size,
each with a $5,000 mortgage on bis property.
Eaob works bard and is competent, but conditions are sucb that neither of tbem is able
to psy bis debt, and botb are threatened
witb dispossession. It so happens that the
rnortgage on one of these farms was put on
by the farmer bimself, but tbat the rnortgage
on the other farm was put on by someone
else before the farm was sold to the present
occupant. So the aspect is identical.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I agree witb
that.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: There is no logic, no
justice, in permitting the board to relieve
one of the farmers while the other one is put
c&it of his property rnerely because a tbird
person says, "I did not make the mortgage
witb tbat man." The point is that this third
person pursues bis remedy, not azainst the
man who made the mortgage, but against the
farmer on the land, He bas eleted to foreclose, and because of that election he sbould
be in exactly the saine position as tbe other
creditor. The theoretical position of the
creditor cannot -make any difference at ail in
practice.
So far as the constitutional question is concerned, that is a very different miatter.
Rigbt Hon.
aIl I raised.

Mr. MEIGHEN:

Tbat is

My rigbt bonourHon. Mr. FARRIS:
able friend bas accepted the principle that
the legislation is valid by supporting tbe
validity of tbe legislation in tbe cases tbat
already bave been decided.

SENATE
If this Parliament is going to refuse to
pass legislation in every case where a doubt
may be expressed as to its constitutional
validity, there will be virtuallv no legislation passed. I wish to refer my right honourable friend to the Privy Counncil decision in
1937 Appeal Cases, to which I made some
reference in committee the other day. If he
will look at the beginning of this report he
will see the argument which I presented on
behalf of the province of British Columbia,
against the validity of the Act as a wholeRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
was that?

Which Act

Hon. Mr. FARRIS:
The original Act,
the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act of
1934. Under instructions of the province of
British Columbia an appeal was taken, and
the validity of the whole Act was challenged,
on the ground that it was not legitimate
bankruptcy legislation. My right honourable
friend will find there twelve reasons why I
considered it was not legitinate bankruptcy
legislation, but was colourable.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR:
Is my honourable friend still of that opinion?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS:
I must accept the
judgment of the Privy Council. In my opinion that judgment, in supporting the validity
of that legislation, applies to all ancillary
powers necessary to give full effect to the
Act. If honourable members are interested
enough to look up that case they will see
how strong were the reasons presented against
the validity of the original Act. I should say
that they were certainly as strong as any
reasons that could be advanced against this
amendment to-day. Yet they were all set
aside by the Privy Council.
I submit this thought for consideration by
honourable members. If every time we came
into any conflict with the provinces on the
question of property and civil rights we refused to pass legislation lest it might be determined ultra vires. there would be virtually no
Dominion legislation at all in many important
fields over which we have jurisdiction. The
so-called Lemieux Act was mentioned in committee the other day. That was in operation
for, I think, about twenty years, and finally
it was declared ultra vires. On the other
hand, I believe that two Combines Investigation Acts were held to be ultra vires, but
Parliament persisted and finally got througb
one that was declared valid.
When we were discussing the Divorce and
Matrimonial Causes Bill the other day I
suggested an amendment because I thought
a measure of doubtful validity could be conHon. Mr. FARRIS.

verted into one about which there should be
no doubt. Now, if an alternative amendment
could be offered here, one about which there
iras no doubt, I should be in favour of it.
But I do not believe it is possible to improve on the present amendment in that
respect. It seems to me that the form of this
one is as sound as we can make it, and that
the prospects of its being held valid are as
good as were the prospects with respect to
the original Act of 1934. I feel that my right
honourable friend is giving undue consideration to the risk of invalidity, when there is
every reasonable hope, in view of the previous decision. that the measure in its present
form would be leld intra vires.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Would the
honourable gentleman permit me? Aside from
the point of constitutionality, I am in agreement with him. I understood, from a citation be made in his address before the committee. that Lord Thankerton held that this
Act did not-and I think he said it could not
-interfere with the security in any way held
by a mortgagee against the ]and. And I
apprehended that these words were expressed
by Lord Thankerton by way of showing that
be considered the Act was valid. I do not
know whether the honourable gentleman bas
that quotation in front of him now, but it
struck nie at the time pretty much as declaring that we cannot do what we are trying to
do. In respect of most of our legislation we
have no doubt at all as to its validity, but
a number of other measures are in a field
about whichi we never can be absolutely certain. In such cases ire must try to walk as
warily as we can. I rose only to ask the
honourable senator if be understood that citation from Lord Thankerton's judgment in
the same way as I did. I freely confess that
perhaps I should not have raised the question at this time, and might not have done
so if I had had an opportunity of reading the
judgment and getting that full knowledge
which one ought always to have before discussing a question such as this.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: We all know that
this Act bas been administered by rie of
thumb. No instructions were issued in the
matter, and there bas been no uniformity. It
seems that in eight provinces the judge held
that absence of privity of contract in any
case was a bar to the operation of the Act,
but one judge held that it was not. That
judge was in Ontario, where there were 58
cases involving this point. Well, what the
amendment proposes is to give effect to the
opinion of that one judge and disregard the
opinions of the eight others. This Act has

JUNE 9,1938
cost the country something over $3,000,000
already. I am not much interested in the
matter personally, because I am satisfied that
my province of Prince Edward Island will be
the first one exempted by proclamation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think my
honourable friend is in error. I read some
time ago the discussion which occurred in the
other House, and, as I recall, it was stated
that thousands of cases had been settled in
the West and other parts of the country on
the basis of the link existing between the
original lender and the debtor. In cases that
are pending I do not know whether the presiding judges will act in accordance with the
decision of the judge in Ontario to whom my
honourable friend has referred. But, as I
say, settlements have been accepted in thousands of cases, and in each case an entirely
new situation has been created as between
the debtor and his creditors. Well, surely we
must recognize that situation and validate
what has been done. I wonder if the situation will not become very much more involved if we limit this validity to the past and
provide that a mortgagee shall not be obliged
to appear before the board when the property
upon which he holds his mortgage has passed
to another purchaser. These new situations
between debtors and creditors have been
created throughout the West, in Manitoba,
Saskatchewan and Alberta, and a considerable
number in the eastern provinces.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Do I understand
the honourable leader to say that there
were thousands of cases, outside Ontario, in
which the absence of privity of contract was
dealt with?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am not speaking of Ontario; I am speaking of the West.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Cases in which
the absence of privity of contract was dealt
with?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: There must have been.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I have before me the
House of Commons Hansard and I see at
page 1600 iat the Minister of Finance
stated that in Ontario alone some 400 cases
had been dealt with notwithstanding lack of
privity of contract.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: There must have been
hundreds of cases in the West.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: In answer to the
right honourable leader on the other aide
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen), may I say that
it was argued before the Privy Council that

the original Act as a whole was not bona fide
bankruptcy legislation; that the whole import of the measure was the very opposite
of bankruptcy legislation. Bankruptcy involves a distribution of the debtor's assets
for the benefit of his creditors. The principle
of this Act, in its recita4, is to prevent the
distribution, not for the benefit of the
creditors, but for the benefit of the public,
and possibly at the expense of the creditors,
by keeping the farmer on the land. That was
the trend of the argument. As an incident to
this argument it was contended that another
reason why this was not bankruptcy legislation was that it interfered with the security
of a secured creditor. In writing the judgment, Lord Thankerton dealt with the latter
point first, and said the Act did not interfere with the security of the secured creditor; it interfered only with the debt. Now
that the Privy Council have declared the Act
to be bankruptcy legislation, I should not
think there was one chance in a thousand
that they would say the whole Act had
become invalid because of the incorporation
of an amendment dealing in the way here
proposed with those who were not primarily
creditors.
Again I want to remind my right honourable
friend that this measure does not say that
a new relation as between debtor and creditor
is in fact created; all it says is that the
board may deal with the case as if such a
relation did exist. That is a very different
thing.
And may I say this, that the change is made
for one purpose onily, namely, as a necessary
incident in order that all such cases may be
dealt with. As I understood the decision of
the Privy Council, when the Parliament of
Canada is seized with jurisdiction over a
general subject-matter, such as bankruptcy,
all legislation that is necessary to deal with
all the various phases of the subject-matter
becomes necessarily ancillary and incidental.
Now, there is no question that these two
farmers, side by side, are in exactly the same
position, so far as bankruptcy is concerned,
and so far as the necessity of making the
distribution or arrangement is concerned.
Therefore it is necessarily incidental that
both be dealt with in the same way.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Hear, hear.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Hughes was
negatived.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The question,
honourable members, is now on the motion
for third reading of the Bill, as amended.

EDITION

SENATE

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Honourable members,
I wish to offer an amendment, that the Bill
as amended be not now read a third time,
but that section 9, added by the committee,
be struck out. That is the section limiting the
operation of the Act to the end of this year
except in the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
senators, I stated yesterday that I miglt ask
the opinion of the House on this section 9,
which my honourable friend from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) has just moved to
have stricken out.
Section 8 of the Bill reads as follows:
On and after a date to be fixed by proclamation of the Governor in Council, no new
proposal shall be made or filed by any farmer
or accepted by any official receiver in any
province in respect of whieh the said proclanation is issued.
The Minister of Finance, who is responsible
for the administration of this Act, has asked
that the Governor in Council be clothed with
the power to put an end to this Act by proclamation, setting a date after which no official
recciver in any province to whichs the proclanation applies would have the right to
receive new proposals.
The Minister felt
that the Governor in Council would act somewhat prudently in terminating operation of
the Act in the provinces, probably being
influenced by indications from the provinces
as to when the Act shouild come to an end
within their respective territories. He desired
to assume responsibility for fixing that date.
Now, the committec has approved of a section
which would authorize the Governor in Cousncil
to put an end to the receipt of proposals in
certain provinces at any time between the
passing of the Bill and the 31st of December
of this year, and would also prohibit any
proposal frorn being received in any of the
provinces, except Saskatchewan and Alberta,
later than that date. Now, in support of the
amendmentHon. L. COTE: Honourable members, I
rise to a point of order. Section 9 was recommended by the committee and it was included
in the committee's report to the flouse. That
report was considered and adopted. Now, on
the motion for third reading of the Bill, an
amendment is made to strike out section 9,
the very section which was adopted in committee and later in the House. I may be
entirely wrong in my point of order. However,
I recollect very clearly that on the motion
for third reading of the Lord's Day Bill, after
it had been amended in committee and the
report of the committee had been adopted by
The Hon. the SPEAKER.

this House, the honourable member from
Shawinigan (Hon. Mr. Bourgeois) offered an
amendment. A point of order was raised by,
I think, the right honourable leader on this
side of the House (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen).
His Honour the Speaker ruled that it was
well taken, and that the member from
Shawinigan could not in the circumstances
move his amendment; that is, that words
which had been included in the Bill and voted
on by acceptance of the committee's report,
as in this case, could not be struck out on
third reading.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My honourable
friend's statement is according to the facts,
but I would draw the attention of the Senate
to this situation, which is somewhat different
from the one he bas referred to. Yesterday
when the motion for concurrence was moved
I rose and said:
The amendment proposed by the Banking and
Commerce Committee varies to a certain extent
the policy contained in the last clause of the
Bill.
I cited the clause.
The suggested amendment is in thîese terms:
"No proposal shall be reeeived in any province
later than the 31st Decemsber, 1938, except in
the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta."
And I added:
I may ask the opinion of the House with
respect to this amendmient on the motion for
third reading.
No one took exception to the reservation I
then made. I ai not ready to say that that
reservation should now be accepted by the
Senate, but if my honourable friend will allow
me to state why I think it is important we
should have the opinion of the House as a
whole on this amendment, ho may not insist
upon his point of order.
The Bill will be returned to the Commons,
and I feel that the honourable Minister of
Finance, who is responsible for the administration of the Act and bas requested tihat
he be given discretion to fix the date when no
more proposals shall be received in any province, would be very much interested in knowing
the opinions of honourable senators, wiio as
a matter of fact represent all the provinces.
So far we have the statement of the ionourable junior member from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Haig). He moved this amendment, which was
supported by my honourable friend from
Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien), and by the
honourable senator from Prince Edward Island.
We have Lad no clear expression of opinion
from the other provinces. My right honourable friend (Rigit Hon. Mr. Meighen) sponsored this statute when it came before us
in 1934, but he now states he somewhat regrets
his action. I feel that if there is a consensus

JUNE 9, 1938
of opinion in this Chamber in favour of discontinuing the Act it may have some bearing
on the attitude of the other House towards
this amendment. That is my sole reason for
suggesting this expression of opinion.
Hon. Mr. COTE: I think my point of order
is well taken, but I will not press it if the
honourable gentleman, instead of having the
amendment made here, will consent to have
the Bill referred back to the committee.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Because I know it is
in the minds of members of that committee
to insert another amendment if this one is
struck out. The honourable gentleman will
recall that the committee intended to introduce an amendment regarding the right of
appeal in certain circumstances, but it was not
pressed in view of the fact that a dead line
was set. I am not ready to move that amendment with respect to the right of appeal before
giving it further consideration, but I think
it would be satisfactory to all concerned to
recommit the Bill. Consideration should then
be given to the recommendations of the honourable leader of the House and to the amendment which would be revived in the event of
the committee striking out the first amendment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I admit the
importance of the point raised by my honourable friend, for I had been notified that if
this amendment did not carry in the Senate,
an amendment would be made to include the
right of appeal from decisions of boards of
review.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I hope the honourable
senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Coté) will
not press his point of order. I think it is
well taken, but I agree with the honourable
leader of the Government that the House
ought to vote on whether it wishes the Act
to end on December 31 this year in all the
provinces except Alberta and Saskatchewan.
I urge honourable members to vote down the
amendment now moved and leave in the Bill
section 9 as inserted by the committee.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Why should those two
provinces be excepted?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: In those provinces there
has been a crop failure for eight successive
years. The farmers there have been so discouraged that they have not taken advantage
of the Act to the same extent as have farmers
in the provinces where such a condition does
not exist. Let me cite Manitoba. Two years
ago I would not have advocated the discontinuance of the Act in that province, but
I do now because conditions there are normal
once more.
51958-29J

I would again urge the House to allow the
committee's amendment to stand. I know the
Act is very difficult for secondary creditors, thesmall business people in rural towns. They
are fundamentally affected. The Act baswiped out all their security. Six months issufficient time to allow everyone who so desires to invoke the Act. That is why I urgehonourable senators to vote down the amendment proposed by the honourable senator fromý
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) and leavethe amendment as put in by the committee.
Other honourable members did have amendments to make, but they said, "If the Act is
to disappear in all the provinces except Alberta and Saskatchewan, we are satisfied, for
it is only a matter of time when conditions will,
have improved in those provinces to the point
where the Government can deolare the Actto be inoperative."
I am persuaded that, apart probably fromPrince Edward Island and Nova Scotia, it
would be very difficult for the Government
to pass an Order in Council discontinuing the.
Act. I think the legislation has fulfilled its
purpose, which was to keep the farmers of
the three Prairie Provinces on the land.
While it applies to all the provinces, the
stories we have heard about its operation in
Prince Edward Island are sufficient to show
how the Act can be abused. I would ask the
House to retain clause 9.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Does clause 9 prevent
the Minister of Finance from terminating the
Act in any province at any time he sees fit?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No.
Hon. JAMES A. CALDER: A similar
point of order was decided by His Honour
the Speaker earlier this session. From what
occurred on that occasion I gather that theSenate at this stage of a Bill can do almost
anything it likes, so long as there is as
majority to sustain the proposed action.
If the point of the honourable member from
Ottawa is well taken, let us see where we
stand. A committee considers a Bill and
makes a report on it, and the report is presented to the House and concurred in. Does
that mean the House cannot amend that report after it has concurred in it?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Amend tie,
Bill.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes, the Bill. We
concur only in the report, but when we reach
the third reading stage we can surely amend
the Bill in any way we please. We are dealing at that stage, not with the report, but
with the Bill. That is the stage we are at

SENATE
mow. I commend the decision given by His
flonour the Speaker at that time, that on
third reading any member lias a perfect right
to move any amendment lie may choose, and
it is for the House to decide whether or net
the amendment shall be accepted.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: We all agree in
that.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The point of order
has been raised, and I am speaking simply
for the purpose of trying to ascertain what
our powers are in this respect.
Hon. Mr. COTE: What the honourable
gentleman bas said is all very well so far
as it goes, but as a matter of fact His
Honour the Speaker ruled, not that we could
not amend other features of the Bill, but
that we had no right to return to any clause
contained in a committee report approved
by the House and get rid of that clause.
That was the ruling.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I doubt that.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: My recollection May be wrong, but I am afraid I do not
recall matters as does the honourable senator
from Ottawa. I recall the honouralble senator
from Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner) urged that
we could not do just what the senator frem
,Ottawa says we cannot do; that, having once
decided that a certain clause was proper and
right, we could not change that decision. I
took the opposite stand, that at every stage
of the Bill we could come to any conclusion
we liked on any part of the Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That is what
the stages are for.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: And I was
upheld by the Chair. Rule 65 seens to settle
the matter:
A senator may, at any time before a Bill is
passed, niove for the reconsideration of any
clause thereof, already passed.
But I am going to vote against the amend.ment.
Hon. Mr. COTE: I do not want to bc out
Qo order by speaking too often on this point,
but I should like to state what happened at
the last stage in connection with the Lord's
Day Bill. The Bill contained a clause providing for imprisonment of directors who
might transgress the Act. The committee
struck out that clause and substituted an
amendment increasing the maximum fine. The
report was adopted by this House, and then on
third reading the honourable member fron
Shawinigan (Hon. Mr. Bourgeois) moved that
the original clause of the Bill as if came from
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

the Commons be inserted in lieu of the clause
which the committee had adopted and reported
to this House.
Rigit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But when did
lie move it?
Hon. Mr. COTE: On third reading-just as
we are doing to-day. Thereupon objection
was taken te his riglit to move the amendment.
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: I did
object.

not

Hon. Mr. COTE: Someone objected, and
the honourable the Speaker sustained the
objection. If the ruling on that occasion was
not right, it is no fault of mine. The facts are
as I have stated thein.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: I desire to say
a few words against the adoption of the
amendment. I had intended to move in the
comittee an amendment for the purpose of
having all litigation under the Act submitted
to the jurisdiction of the court that exists for
all litigants under the Bankruptey Act. My
honourable friend the junior member froin
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. laig) moved a much
more drastie amendmnent. With the end of the
year it puts an end to the application of this
law in all tie provinces ex<pt hvo. I am certainly satisfied with ithat. Really that is more
tlan I asked. I may state very briefly my
rcasons for suppoirting the Bill as it now
stands.
I admit this law was enacted for the purpose
of meeting desperate conditions prevailing
among our farmers, particularly in the West.
A short-cut was taken for their relief. That
short-eut was to open te them the bankruptcy law; but, strange to say, in most cases
it also closed to tlem access to the courts.
What is the position of the debtor farmer and
his creditors, unless they agree? If they agree
thbere is, of course, no difficulty. If they do not
agree they go, not before the usual tribunal
created for bankruptcy cases, but before a
board of commissioners composed of one
lawyer, who is the chief commissioner, and
two other men, neither of whom has lad
legal training. I am certainly not desirous
of speaking on behalf of my own profession,
but I do think you would not attempt to make
a general out of a man who was not a soldier,
and to me it seems foolish to attempt to
make judges out of men who are not lawyers.
We have been very careful to appoint to our
courts only men of high character and high
mental quality, and in most cases they have
been men of great experience.
Now, what happons on these boards? Leaving aside the judge, the other two commissioners hear a case; they give their decision;

JUNE 9, 1938

they bring it to the court and file it, and
it becomes law. It is law, not as between one
litigant and another, but between one debtor
and fifteen, twenty, or maybe fifty creditors.
And it is a most extraordinary law. Where
would you find a community which would
agree to be judged by such rules? Where
would you find a community which would
agree to be judged by men who have no legal
training and no particular qualifications, and
whose judgment is subject to no appeal? In
an ordinary bankruptcy case, if the amount is
sufficient, the judgment is subject to appeal
and rectification. After all, that is only just.
Human error may occur anywhere, and it
should be corrected. But in this case there
is no correction; the judgment is simply filed
in the court.
What have been the consequences of this?
They have been most iniquitous. I ask you
to go into the country to ascertain what bas
happened to the credit of the farmers. It has
completely disappeared. Why? Because the
decisions under this legislation have been such
that not a lender is to be found anywhere. Is
not that sufficient to justify me in rising on
behalf not only of those who have been maltreated by the board, but of the farmers as
well? This law bas been directly applied to 21
per cent of the farmers throughout the
Dominion, but as a result the other 97i per
cent now have no credit at all. This law has
killed their credit. Where is the man who will
contradict this statement? I know that in my
province you will no longer find anyone who
will lend money to the farmers. They have all
been deprived of the facilities of credit. Think
of the plight of the farmer under these circumstances. If he cannot borrow on his farm he
has absolutely no means of obtaining loans.
Therefore I say, in the name of justice, in
the name of those who are interested as
creditors or debtors, and in the name of the
97½ per cent of our farmers throughout the
land who, although they have had nothing
to do with this law, have been deprived by it
of their credit, we cannot too quickly get rid
of it.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: I do not exactly
agree with the honourable gentleman who
bas just taken his seat that this particular
Act has deprived the farmer of his credit.
The fact that he had no credit was what inade
the law necessary. Yet as one of those who were
very enthusiastic in support of the legislation.
I want to say that had I known it would extend
so far as it has extended, even in my own
province, or would be used as it has been, I
would have done everything in my power to
prevent it from becoming law. And if it is
to continue to be managed as it is at present,

I should like to see the amendment altered
so as to exclude Saskatchewan from the operation of the Act. At present the judge administering the Act seems to regard it as bis
duty to make a reduction in every case that
comes before him, regardless of the financial
standing of the parties and of whether the
man who seeks relief is in better circumstances,
than the one from whom the money is being:
taken. Great dissatisfaction bas been causedby this Act. It bas extended its operation
far into the north country, and bas been used
by people whom it was never intended should
be able to use it. So far as Saskatchewan is
concerned, I should like to sec the Act discontinued to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I think I should address
myself to the discussion, though it is a
little hard to say whether it is on the point
of order or on the amendment. On the
assumption that my honourable friend is not
pressing bis point of order, I will proceed te
discuss the amendment.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Has the honourable
leader of the House come to the conclusion
that the Bill is to go back to committee, or
are we to have the discussion now? I asked
the honourable leader whether he would consent to the compromise of recommitting the
Bill. I said that if bis answer was in the
affirmative I would not press my point of
order.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: What I would'
suggest in this. If the amendment proposed'
by the honourable senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) is rejected, then
there will be no call for reference of the
Bill to the committee; but if it is adopted I
will certainly agree to either an amendment
regarding the right of appeal being put
immediately, or the Bill being returned to the
committee for further consideration.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Honourable senators;
I was not a member of the committee before
which this Bill was discussed, but I was
present at the discussion and was permitted
to take part. It seems to me that the position we now occupy with respect to this Bill is
a very peculiar one. The Bill, before it went
to the committee, 'had two distinct features.
The first related to the improvement of the
Bill itself in certain particulars.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The extension of
its application.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: The extension of its
application. The other was that the Governor in Council would have power progress-

454

SENATE

ively, or step by step, at his discretion, to
terminate the application of the law in any
province. The issue before this House today is a very simple one. The members of
the committee decided that that discretion
should not be left to the Governor in Council, except in a very restricted way; that outside of Alberta and Saskatchewan there
should be no discretion after the end of this
year. In other words, the committee declared: "Regardless of what the House of
Commons bas to say, regardless of what is
the policy of the Government, we are conpetent to decide that the Act shall terminate
at the end of this year."
What evidence was there before the conmittee to support that decision? Nobody
appeared before the committee and asked
for it. The loan companies and the insurance companies of the country, in their
organized form, appeared by counsel, and so
far as I recall there was net a suggestion from
them before that committee or in the House
of Comonins that the Act should be termiiated
at any definite date. I asked Mr. Leonard
particularly if he had any criticisms of the
Bill, and he did not offer any, and so far
as I an aware no outside parties nia(le any
representations as te termination at the end
of the year.
Now, what is the situation? The committee
had no reports before it on tliat question. It
had discussed the local affairs of the province
of Prince Edward Island, and the clause
inserted by the comnmittce was net drawn
until nearly 6 o'clock and was net afterwards
discussed. I was sorry to hear m'
right
honourable friend opposite (Right Hon. Mr.
Meigln) state that he would vote against
the present amendment, because there lias
been no discussion on it, and I know my right
honourable friend is always open to argument.
It seens to me that there are strong reasons
why discretion should be left to the Governor
in Ceunoil at this time. Mr. Leonard, who
represented the mortgage and loan companies,
asked for an appeal, but he asked for it on
certain limited grounds. So far as I was able
te follow, that was the only position taken by
anyone, even those vitally affected, outside of
the members of the committee.
My honourable friend from Winnipeg SouthCentre (Hon. Mr. Haig), who drafted the
amendment we are now discussing, is conplaining of the very opposite of what Mr.
Leonard was complaining about. Mr. Leonard
said that priorities were affected; that those
who have a mortgage sufficient to take care of
the indebtedness on the land have had their
security reduced for the benefit of unsecured
creditors.
If that is sound, the reasons
Hon. Mr. FARRIS.

advanced by my honourable friend are incorrect. As far as I could follow Mr. Leonard,
the cases he mentioned were not very numerous. He was asked if the mortgage companies
ever challenged in the courts the power of
these boards to interfere with the security of
mortgages for the benefit of unsecured creditors. To grant such power is not the purpose of
the Act at all. It starts out with the proposition that it is for the benefit of the farmers,
and that it is in the public interest to keep
them on the land. I do net want to be too free
with opinions, but it does seein to me that the
reduction of a soeured claim for the benefit of
an unsecured creditor does not help the farmer
at all. He is no better off in paying an unsecured claim than in paying a secured claim.
So the distinction between the secured and
the unsecured creditor is in principle one
relating to the affairs of the farmer and his
ability te carry on, and is net for the purpose
of giving a preference to the unsecured at
the expense of the secured creditor. That is
my opinion, and I doubt very much the legality
of an' orders to the contrarv. Whether or
not that is so, the fact is that a creditor bas
the right te appeal at an' time lie feels that
the board is exceeding its powers. He can
proceed by writ of certiorari, for instance, or
in an' one of several ways to prevent such a
tribunal from going beyond the jurisdiction
conferred upon it by Parliament.
The only other complaint by these men
from outside was that the valuations by the
tribinals were unfair. It appears tiat these
tribunals have utilized the valuators of the
Soldier Settlement Board, and the complaint
is that there is no opportunity for crossexamination of them. Well, I do not know,
but I feel that that situation was greatly
exaggerated. In any event, I doubt if there
would be much advantage in going through
all the formality that is involved in an appeal.
It would mean the taking of evidence and
very heavy additional expense. Those of us
vho have practised law have had experience
with regard to arbitration. Where a number
of valuators are hired on each side, and testify
against one another, it is sometimes almost
incredible how far apart their figures will be.
I suggest that an independent board of
valuators, who have no interest other than
to do justice, who are not at the beck and
call of either side, will in 99 out of 100 cases
make a better valuation than could be arrived
at by a body depending upon conflicting evidence given by experts for each side.
That is the sum total of the information
that was given to this committee in regard
to administration of the Act. All other information the committee obtained itself.

JUNE 9, 1938
And after we had got through with Prince
Edward Island, how much information was
there? I come from the province of British
Columbia. The amendment, section 9, proposes that the Act shall become inoperative
there after the 31st of December of this year.
I would ask the honourable gentlemen responsible for that motion, and the right honourable leader on the other side, and all
other honourable members of the committee,
what information they have from that province which justifies them in believing they
know more about conditions there than is
known to the Governor in Council. What
information is there that would justify the
Senate in taking the responsibility of saying
that the Act shall not be enforced in British
Columbia after the end of this year? I have
carefully read what Hon. Mr. Duning said
in the other House. He and the department
have received comments pro and con as to
the working of this Act from all over Canada.
They have an expert and inside knowledge
of it, and I do not think they are in a
prejudiced position. It is said that conditions in Manitoba have improved. But is
anyone sure that they will continue to improve? How are we to know that before the
end of this year conditions may not have
changed for the worse? We from the West
are optimistic, but we know that things do not
always go the way we want them.
Statements were made to contrast the
operations of the Act in Prince Edward Island with those in Nova Scotia. But I want
to ask honourable members of the Banking
and Commerce Committee if a single word of
information was obained from the province
of Nova Scotia that would justify them in
recommending that the Act be made noneffective in Nova Scotia. As to the province
of New Brunswick, I never heard any information at all. I do not see any of my
colleagues from British Columbia in the
House at the moment, but I should like to
ask if any one of them feels he can stand. up
and say that he knows more about the
operations of this Act than the Minister of
Finance and his organization do.
Mark you this, honourable senators, that
there was a unanimous vote in the House of
Commons in faveur of placing responsibility
for terminating this Act on the Governor in
Council. Not a single elected representative in
Parliament stood up in his place and demanded
that the statute should cease to have effect
after this year. We are here as part of our
system of responsible and representative government. The primary function of this body,
I often think, is to sec that representative gov-

455

ernment is carried out. In these circumstances,
can we say that we know more about this
legislation than the elected representatives in
Parliament, and than the responsible Government of the country? Are we prepared to
stand up and tell the House of Commons what
should be done with this legislation? In the
end, what would happen? There is not a
chance in a thousand of such a recommendation as is here proposed being accepted by
the other House at this stage.
The honourable senator from King's (Hon.
Mr. Hughes) asked if this amendment would
interfere with the power of the Government to terminate the legislation before December 31. Technically, the answer that it
would not interfere was right. But I want to
sound a warning to my honourable friend.
I know what I should do if I were the Minister. If Parliament said, "We are going to
tie up your hands so that you will have to
terminate the Act by the end of the year,"
I should say, "Well, I shall let it go to the
end of the year." It seems to me that that
would be the logical and practical view for
any Government to take in these circumstances. If this amendment were adopted by
both Houses, I cannot conceive that any Government would take the responsibility of
cancelling the legislation before the year
ended. So I predict that the passing of this
amendment oould be regarded as a practical
guarantee that the statute would continue in
force in Prince Edward Island until the end
of this year.
For these reasons I respectfully suggest to
the right honourable leader opposite and
all honourable members of this House that
it is not in the interest of the country at
this time for us to place ourselves in the
position of the judges of what should be
donc in these circumstances. Everybody
knows how this Act came into force. We
have heard from the right honourable leader
opposite that he has changed his views. But
the fact is that the operation of the Act is
continuing. What would happen if this
amendment were passed? There would be a
bargain-counter rush in every eastern province and in British Columbia to get in under
the Act before the end of the year. That is
what would be substituted for progressive and
sane handling of the whole matter by an
organization responsible to Parliament, an
organization which has the necessary equipment for obtaining information as to when
it wo-uld be in the best interest of various
parts of the country to terminate the Act.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
think the honourable senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) needed to have

456

SENATE

risen to such heights of eloquence and indignation in the treatment of this simple
question.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Excuse me; I was not
indignant.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Most of what
he said did not impress me in the way that
his speeches usually do. When I express my
opinion in the Senate I do not assume that
I know more than anybody else about the
subject under discussion; I express only what
I think.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Will my right bonourable friend permit me to interrupt him?
I did not wish to suggest that any senator
took the view he knew more about this
matter than anyone else did. The point I
was trying to impress upon the House was
this, that I thought the Government bad
bet!ter

natter than we had.

this

Rlight Hon. M\ir. MEIGIHEN: I uîndeir0(ood
the honourable gentleman to suggest, if not
to state definitely, that in inserting the
amendment we assumed we knew more about
the operations of the Act than the Governor
in Council did. I do not assume that at all.
I am guided by my own opinion. Further,
when I am a member of a committee, I do
not regard myself as a juror who must give
a verdict in accordance with evidence submitted. No. I am still a member of the
Senate when I am on a committee. I listen
to the views of other people and give them
full consideration. But thouglh those views
may be 100 per cent opposed to mine, I am
not called upon to surrender iiiy Opinion, as a
juryman would be. I am often influenced
by wvhat I lear. But it is mv duty to express
my opinion at any given time.
Now, what should we do with this amendment? Is it a wise clause or is it not? I do
not know that the institutions of the country will tremble in the balance, whether we
decide yen or nay to tiis amendiment. For
myself, I bave already said candidly that I
was wrong with respect to this Act. I do
not believe we ever should have passed it in
the form we adopted. There was an emergent
condition in only one part of Canada, and
it would have been wise to confine the
operations of this Act to that part.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:

Hear, bear.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
We did
not. In that we were wrong. Whby an I so
convinced? Well. I have been living in Canada ever since the Act was put into force.
Wight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

I am in receipt of communications fron all
parts of the country. I believe I am as
closely in touch with Western conditions as
anyone living in the East is. I ought to be.
My chief interests are still in the province
of Manitoba, and in the agricultural sections.
I have visitors from different parts of Ontario.
I have received communications from farmers,
from creditors, from land companies and I
know not whomî. I am thoroughly convinced
that the general operation of the Act is deletecriou froin every standpoint, and it is partieular]y deleterious fron the standpoint of
the farmer himself.
It is true we passed the Act to try to
impirove the position of the farmer who needcd to be helped, the man who was down
and out and in danger of being treated with
undue severity by his creditors. We passed
i with the best intentions.
I think, though, that in many instances
the morale of men of that type has been
injured by this legislation. The man whose
credit is injured is the good farmer, and
specially tie young farmer who is just setting out, for iiiiself. This Act is a threat
to his credit every lour of the day.

Nobody

knows when lie nay msake application to
come under the Act, and, when he seeks to
get credit, tliat is held against himi. He may
be as honest and as efficient a farmer as
ever breathed, but all about himn are the
provisions of this law, and it is known that
lie can at any minute put his band on the
erank of that law and bring it into operation
on his bohalf. So his credit is irpaired and
undermined because of tbe very existence of
the statute.
That is the main reason why I am opposed
to the law and why I want it got rid of just
as rapidly as possible.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Not one of
the farmers with whom I am connected bas
invoked the law. I have dealt withi these men
myself; and I venture to say that the same
course has been taken in a score of cases for
every single case in which the law has been
invoked. Now, having bad that experienceand every other senator bas had pretty much
the same-I am not so sure that we ought on
bended knees to crawl in the cust before the
Governor in Council and say, "Thy will be
donc." That is not my attitude. I am not
so sure that I do not know just as much as
the inembers of Couneil do. I have seen
many of the sources from which they get
tlheir information, and I must say I have not
been impressed to the point of deification.
I do not think the sources are very impressive.

457

JUNE 9, 1938

Furthermore, I do not think the Act has
been well administered. To be convinced of
this fact one has only to look at the grotesque
disparity in point of magnitude between the
operations in Prince Edward Island and those
in the two other Maritime Provinces. Reading the figures, one would think that the poor
little island was just a home of poverty where
everybody was " broke," whereas Nova Scotia
was a centre of immense wealth where hardly
anybody need resort to bankruptcy at all.
Everybody knows that is far from the case.
Prince Edward Island, man for man and all
in all, is in just as happy a condition as
Nova Scotia. But look at the resultsl Can
anybody who compares those figures tell us
the Act is well administered? It is not. The
Governor in Council bas witnessed the administration of the Act, and bas done nothing.
We have, let me admit, just this advantage
over Council. Though just as wise as we are,
they may not have as close contact with the
working of this law. But they have to take
into account other things, which fortunately,
under the scheme of Confederation, we do
not have to consider. I am afraid they are
taking more account of those things than they
are of the essential, solid things that go to
the making of this Canada.
I shall be very brief in my further remarks,
for I think we have already over-discussed
the matter.
I adhere to the view which I held when
I entered the committee. With that view,
though it was not expressed by the representatives of the mortgage companies, I do not
think there is the slightest disagreement on
their part, and I have pretty good reason for
saying so. It is true they do not want to
come asking for certain things. If they can
avoid doing so, they will. But does anybody
suggest they would not have come to us and
said, "For goodness' sake do not repeal this
Act in all the rest of Canada on January
next," if that were the way they felt? They
do not feel that way at all. However, we are
not governed by their view. We are being
guided by the application of all the intelligence,
endorsed and supported by all the experience,
we have. And, so endorsed and supported
and guided, I am going to support the Bill as
it is and vote against the amendment now
proposed.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Question!

Hon. JOHN A. MACDONALD: Honourable
members, I have a few remarks to make,
especially in view of the statement regarding
the ability of this House to have a proper
point of view on a matter of this kind.
I am one of those who assisted in putting the

original Act through Parliament in the hope
that it would benefit our farmers. One of the
arguments then used was that business men
can invoke the Bankruptcy Act to get their
obligations adjusted; the farmers have no such
recourse. This Act was passed to provide a
means of adjustment for bankrupt farmers.
I know of cases where farmers with $2 of assets
to $1 of liabilities have applied to a board of
review, and their case has been considered
and an adjustment made. Was that carrying
out the purpose of the Act?
At the outset my idea was that if you give
a farmer in financial difficulties a chance to
recover by having his position reviewed as
provided under the Act, you are going to give
him fresh courage and ambition and so keep
him on bis farm. But the Act bas not worked
out that way.
It has been stated that this brandi of
Parliament cannot possibly have a proper view
of the matter as compared with the honourable Minister of Finance and the Governor
in Council. What did we get in this House
a few days ago? On May 25 the honourable
leader of the Senate read a memorandum
which, amongst other things, described debt
conditions in Prince Edward Island. This is
the part to which I refer:
Now as to Prince Edward Island. The debt
situation of farmers in Prince Edward Island
differs from that in almost every other province,
in that the great proportion of these farniers'
debts is to local merchants, who have taken
mortgages on the farmers' property.
I have been in that line of business for fortyfive years, and in all my experience I do not
know of a single case where our firm or any
other firm took a mortgage as security for a
farmer's debt.
Many of these mortgages have been in existence for several generations, the farmer turning
bis produce over to the merchants, who, in
turn, sold him bis supplies. These merchants
are violently opposed to any change in an
arrangement whic, for many generations, bas
been extremely satisfactory to themselves, but
not so satisfactory to the farmer.
Many cases of hardship have been reported
The following are two
in this connection.
sample cases:
The creditor had been charging his debtors
10 per cent interest on bis bills, taking cattle,
grain or other produce, whetber the debtor
farmer could spare it or not, and is reported
to have allowed these farmers only one-half of
the value of such stock and produce as a credit
on bis bill.
Honourable members, in all my public life I
have never heard a more ridiculous statement,
nor one so utterly false.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. MACDONALD:
It has no foundation whatever in fart. I do flot blame the
honourable leader on tEe other side (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) for tint false and ridiculous

this is the sort of so-cailed information which
the honourable Minister of Finance and the
Governor in Council wiil depend upon when
they corne to decide whether this Act shahl
be terminated or not.
What are the facts in titat connectien? At
tho }rescnt, time 90 per cent of the farmers'
produce is not sold to the merchants at ail.
The farmers need flot seli $1 worth of their

JUNE 9, 1938
and also in the committee, reference was made
by different honourable senators to the number of applications ta the official receivers and
the boards of review in Prince Edward Island. It is possible that similar statements
could have been made with respect to the
other provinces.
When the Act was introduced in Parliament it was presented as a companion Act to
the Farm Loan Act. Perbaps I shall be permitted to quote from Hansard of the House
of Commons what the Prime Minister of the
day, Mr. Bennett, said in introducing the
measure. This will be found on page 3640
of Hansard of 1934. I shall read, not the
whole of what he said on that occasion, but
only that part which refers to the point I
have brought up. It is as follows:
Now, supplementary to the legislation which
I have mentioned-

That is the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement
Act.
-there is provided a Farm Loan Act, that is,
an amendment to the existing legislation which,
while it has not been accepted by ail the provinces, is in force in many of them. We propose
to make some necessary administrative amendments which our experience has taught should
be made, and further to authorize the loan of
a somewhat larger sum than that provided for
by the Act, the limit being $7,500, and instead
of fixing the amount of the mortgage at fifty
per cent to provide for a lesser margin of
safety and increase the amount of the mortgage
to sixty per cent.
In addition to that it will be observed by
many of those honourable members now listening
to me that after we have done ail these things
it is quite obvious that the unfortunate insolvent might not then be in any position to
go forward, because he would have no money
with which to undertake his work. We therefore propose that the Farm Loan Board shall
be authorized, by way of what would amount
to a second mortgage, to advance a limited sum,
which is mentioned in the Act-and a matter
which may be considered in committee-fto
enable a person to provide himself with seed,
implements or whatever may be neressarv ta
enable him once more to engage successfully in
his vocation. And he may make a charge on
his personal property, also, as additional security, if so desired.
Roughly, therefore, with the amendments proposed to the Farm Loan Act supplementing the
provisions of the legislation which we suggest,
we believe that we shall have provided at least
some measure of relief to those who are the
mainstay and the backbone of any country such
as ours.

That was the statement of the Prime Minister when he introduced this legislation in the
other House, and it was carried throughout
the country in the press, and appeared in the
newspaper headlines. I could read other
extracts from speeches made in the other

House by the Prime Minister, but I think
that what I have read is sufficient to convey
the information that I now wish to give to
the House. It was with that explanation
that the Act was brought into force, and
when the first official receivers were appointed
in our province they were of the opinion, and
actually advised applicants who came before
them, that those were the conditions under
which the Act was operating. With that
groundwork, and with the official receivers
acting on such an understanding-I would
not say on instructions-it is not surprising
that in the first year of the operation of the
Act a very large number of applicants came
before the official receivers.
I think the records show that from the
time the Act came into force up to the end
of the last fiscal year about 4,400 applications had been made in the province of
Prince Edward Island, and of those only
about 1,100 had been acted upon by the
officers administering the law. Honourable
members who have been surprised at the
number of applications can readily see that
there was a misunderstanding on the part of

the press, of the people and of the official
receivers, as a result of which encouragement was given to farmers to take advantage
of the Act. In many cases their only desire
was to reduce interest on their mortgages or
loans, and after they found out the intent
of the legislation they went no further. Our
people were encouraged to look upon this
statute as a sort of stepping-stone to the
Farm Loan Act. But it did not work out
that

way.

There is another point that I wish to make
clear. Some honourable members stated in
committee a day or so ago that a farmer
whose assets were greater than his liabilities
could not be considered insolvent, that he
had no right to come under the Act, and that
the official receivers and board of review
should not accept him as an applicant. Well,
I should like to quote from a statement made
by the then Prime Minister when he introduced the Bill in another place. This is what
he said on June 11, 1934, as reported at page
3850 of the House of Commons Hansard:

Hen. Mr. MacARTHUR:

ilear. hear.

JUNE 9,1938
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: In the whole of
Canada 150.782 farmers had interviewed
official receivers up to March 31 of this year.
Of that number, 33,640 submitted proposals
and 28,565 settlements were effected. I have
before me a compilation made by officials
of the Department of Finance, which shows
that up to December 1, 1937, 26,365 settlements had been effected. Of these, 10,707
settlements were effected by official receivers
and 15,658 by boards of review. The average debt per case was $6,004.60. The average
reduction was $1,903.64, or 31-69 per cent.
A distinction is made as to secured debts and
unsecured debts.

The average reduction of

secured debts was 29.93 per cent, and of unsecured debts 44-55 per cent.

In the fiscal year ending March 31, 1937,
the number of farmers who approached official
receivers for arrangement of their debts was
23,118. Of this number, 8,180 had their cases
heard and disposed of: 2,404 by voluntary
settlements effected by official receivers, and
5,776 by boards of review. In the last fiscal
year 19,272 farmers approached official receivers for an arrangement. Of these, 9,374
had their cases heard and disposed of: 4,017
by voluntary settlements effected by official
receivers, and 5,357 by boards of review.
Now let me give the figures for Prince

Edward Island. I think that when these are
made clear honourable members will agree
that there is no justification for the extreme
statements that have been made by representatives of that province. From the inception of the Act to March 31, 1938, the number
of requests forwarded to the board of review
in Prince Edward Island was 727. Of these,
720 were dealt with, leaving 7 still to be
heard. In the last fiscal year 154 requests
were forwarded to the board of review and
158 cases were dealt with by that board. From
the time the Act came into force until March
31 of this year official receivers in Prince
Edward Island were approached for arrange-

ment of debts by 4,426 farmers. The number of proposals submitted was only 1,154.
Settlements effected under the Act were 399,

while 197 settlements were made by compromise between the parties through intercession of official receivers, for which intercession they received no fee.
To show the progress made under this Act
in Prince Edward Island for the last two full.
years-in the year ending March 31, 1937,

650 farmers interviewed official receivers, and
in consequence 397 proposals were submitted.
Seventy-nine settlements were effected by
official receivers, the remaining 318 going to
the board of review. In the fiscal year
ending March 31, 1938, only 399 farmers

461

interviewed the official receivers (or a decrease of 38 per cent from 1937), and as a
result 211 proposals were submitted.
One
hundred and sixty-three of these were settled
by official receivers and the remaining 48
were referred to the board of review. These
figures show that in the year 1937 20 per cent
of the proposals submitted were settled by
official receivers, while , in 1938 there were
thus settled 76 per cent of the proposals submitted, the cost of administration being
greatly lessened.
When the official receiver settles a case
without a proposal being made he gets no fee.
If he has to call a meeting of the creditors
to submit a proposal and so bring about a
settlement he gets $30. If he has to pass the
proposal on to a board of review he gets only
$15.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: He gets $20.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: If he is able to
settle a case at a cost of $30, that means a
saving in the adminis'tration of the Act of
between $35 and $40 per case. With the development of the work during the past year
the official receivers, on a percentage basis,
were able to settle in our province nearly
three times as many cases as they did the
preceding year.
Now I want to make a comparison with the
other provinces. From the beginning of the
operation of this Act to December 1, 1937,
the last date for which tables have been
compiled by the Government, in Prince
Edward Island 384 cases have been disposed
of by official receivers and 692 by the board
of review. Comparing this with the other
provinces, we find that from the inception of
the Act to December 31, 1937, which, as I
have already mentioned, is the latest date
for which these tables have been compiled, in
the province of Manitoba 3,157 cases were
disposed of, with an average debt per case of
$7,089.27 and a total debt reduction of 42-28
per cent. In Alberta 3,297 cases were disposed
of, with an average debt per case of $8,949.15
and a total debt reduction of 35-12 per cent.
In Nova Scotia-we have heard a lot about
Nova Scotia both in the committee and in
the HouseHon. Mr. MacARTHUR: You may hear
still more.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: In Nova Scotia 148
cases were disposed of, with an average debt
per case of $5,394.45 and a total debt reduction
of 34-09 per cent; in Saskatchewan 4,659 cases
with an average debt per case of $9,281.79 and
a total debt reduction of 33-68 per cent; in
New Brunswick 939 cases with an average

462

SENATE

debt per case of $1,679.44 and a total debt
reduction of 30-42 per cent; in Ontario 7,372
cases with an average debt per case of $4,742.35
and a total debt reduction of 26-51 per cent;
in Prince Edward Island 1,076 cases with an
average debt per case of $2,774.20 and a total
debt reduction of 24.61 per cent; in Quebec
5,094 cases with an average debt per case of
$3,775.06 and a total debt reduction 16-24
per cent.
It is intercsting to note in the debt reductions in the different provinces that, apart
from Quebec, Prince Edward Island lias the
lowest debt reduction of any province in the
Dominion.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Small farms.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR:
My honourable
friend says "small farms." If he will look at
the average debt per case he will find that for
New Brunswick it is SI,600 odd and for Prince
Edward Island $2,700 odd. So if our farms
are snaller they must be worth a great deal
more.
There is good reason why the debt reduction
in the province of Quebec should be lower
There the
than in any otier province.
Provincial Covernment has established a
Farni Loan Board, and the representative of
that board sits in at the meetings of the
board of review, and wlien an amicable adjustment is arrived at lie advances to the farmer
sufficient money to pay his liability, which,
I am informed, in many instances exceeds
75 per cent of the value of the property.
They give him that money at 2ý per cent.
I should say the loan is amortized on a
39-year plan at 4 per cent per annum. The
Quebec Farm Loan Board bas paid out
$3,000,000 of provincial funds to the farmers
under that plan, in co-operation with the
board of review under this Act. I think
honourable members who were in close touch
with conditions when this Act was first introduced will remember that at the outset it was
contended that the same principle which is
now in force in the province of Quebec would
be applied by a Farm Loan Board in all the
provinces.
I would point out further that in making
the reductions the board of review in Prince
Edward Island has in no case reduced the
principal money on any secured debt without
the consent of the creditor, except where the
secured debt has been obtained by a merchant
selling goods to a farmer over a period of
years without an accounting, charging 8 to 10
per cent interest, compounded annually, and
then getting a mortgage to cover the debt.
In that case, I understand. the board did take
the liberty of reducing the overdue mortgage
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR.

interest.
Almost invariably it bas reduced
the mortgage interest to 5 per cent, and in
many cases extended the time, to the benefit
perhaps of the unsecured creditors; that is,
by requiring the applicant to pay his interest
on his secured loan and a portion on the unsecured loans each year for a period of years
before having to pay the principal on his
secured loan.
As a result of that policy in Prince Edward
Island the reduction of secured loans has been
1 15 per cent; in Nova Scotia 29-40 per cent;
in New Brunswick 28-25 per cent; in Quebec
13.38 per cent; in Ontario 24-13 per cent; in
Manitoba 38-57 per cent; in Saskatchewan
33-11 per cent; in Alberta 36 per cent; in
British Columbia 35-29 per cent; or an average for all of Canada of 29-93 per cent.
I think it can be fairly said that the administration of the Act in Prince Edward
Island has been carried on with fairness to
secured creditors and as far as possible also
to the farmer debtors.
Seveoral honourable senators have severely
criticized the cost of administration of the
Act in Prince Edward Island. The explanatien is that the condition in Prince Edward
Island is different from what it is in almost
all the other provinces. We have, as well as
secured loans against farmers who have taken
advantage of the Act, many small creditorsmerchants, dealers of all kinds, men who
have advanced money on notes and such like
and it is net uncommon to have from
five to ten unsecured creditors attend each
meeting of the board of review. Some of
these creditors have a lawyer to represent
thei, and where the board sits down to hear
representations from one secured creditor and
ten or eleven unsecured creditors, the case
cannot be disposed of in a few minutes.
Very rarely are there fewer than six unsecured
creditors to each debtor, and in some cases
they number from twelve to fifteen. In those
circumstances the board of review must consider the position of every creditor, and it does
well if it disposes of six or seven cases each
day. I am told by the administrator of the
Act that in the other provinces there are not so
many unsecured creditors in each case, and that
usually the principal creditor is a secured one.
Statistics show that for Canada generally the
average amount of unsecured debt per loan is
less than $200, while in Prince Edward Island
it amounts to $700. That is one reason why it
takes more time to review cases and adds
considerably to the cost there.
I may remind honourable members that
when this Act was introduced the Prime
Minister stated the intention was to have

JTJNE 9, 1938
adjustments made without expense to the
farmer. Up to the present time in Prince
Edward Island the total expense has been
$82,354. Nearly 1,100 cases were deait with.
Anyone who is conversant with the costs of
foreclosure proceedings knows that they are
charged against the land, -and that the farmer
will in the end have to bear the expense. In
Prince Edward Island the costs of foreclosure
run to about $250. If there were foreclosure
in only haif the cases, honourable members
can readily sec how mucli it would cost the
farmers. It would be greater than one-half the
amount of reduction made in the case of unsecured creditors. Furthermore, in the event of
foreclosure the unsecured creditors would get
littie or nothing from the estate. I arn sure
that so far as Prince Edward Island is concerned the Act has been a greater benefit ta
unsecured creditors than to any other class
of creditors. Under the operation of the Act
they have received payment on accounts that
otherwise would have been absolutely valueless. I could quote many creditors who
have appeared before the board time and
again and expressed themselves as well satisfled with the Act.
Individual cases have been referred ta, both
this year and last, in the discussion of the
Act. I do flot think that we can get very far
by basing our opinions on certain cases. I
could read affidavits that I have under my
hand to show that many of the statements
made ini this Chamber have not been based
on the facts put on record by applicants
before the board of review. I think it is
unfair to make those references. I do not
think we shall improve the situation by going
into them. I did ask some honourable nierabers before the committee to give us their
authority for the statements they were
making, but they declined. The statements
were not threshed out there, and I think very
littie benefit would accrue from bringing them
up here. In a statement made before the
committee the Director of the Farmprs'
Creditors Arrangement Act was accused of
making a f aise return; and I think that statement was repeated by the honourable member
from King's (Hon. Mr. Hughes) this afternoon. Now I want to say to the House, ini
fairness to the Department of Finance and
the officers of that department, that the returu
which was made stated clearly that certain
cases mentioned were simply examples, and
that there were .many others of the same
kind in the, province of Prince Edward Island.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: What senator is the
honourable member referring to? There
happen to be two of us.

463

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Does the honourable gentleman refer to wbat was said ini
the House or in the committee?
Hon. Mr. HUJGHES. I arn referring to
what you are saying.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I may say ta the
honourable gentleman that two senators made
the statement, one in the committee and the
other in the House.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: What statement was
it?
Hon. Mr~. SINCLAIR: I thînk it is unfair to
go into individual cases, but I want to Qay
that the Director's statement was correct. If
the honourable senators who have been branding it as incorrect bad desired when the committee was sitting, they could have had information from the Director. In dec]aring in
the flouse afterwards that the statement was
false, without having taken the opportunity of
securing the information, the honourable
gentlemen were goin-g entirely too far. From
the information I have had, both in Prinice
Edward Island and here, I am quite justified
in saying that the statement of the Director of
the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act is a
fair and true statement, and representative of
the cases hie mentioned.
Hon. 'Mr. HUGHES: Does the honourable
gentleman refer to the memorandum read
by the honourable leader on this sîde of the
House?
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I arn referring to, the
quotation made in the committee.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Are you referring to
the memorandum? I want ta get dlown. to
particulars.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I have the statement here, if the honourable gentleman is
anxious for it. I arn glad indeed that fie
wants ta get down ta the papers. I have the
exact statement here.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: I will give it ta
you.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: The statement read
as follows:
Many cases of hardship have been reported
in this connection. The following are two
sample cases.
Then the cases were mentioned. That is the
statement I refer ta. If I understand aright,
it, is in connection with the sample cases
rnentioned that the veracity of the Direetor
was questioned. If I arn not correct, I shall
be glad to be contradicted.

464

SENATE

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Do you endorse that
statement?
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Do I endorse the
statement made in regard to the two cases?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: The statement referring to Prince Edward Island which was
prepared by the Director in Ottawa and read
by the honourable the leader of the House.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I do endorse it,
and I know it is correct. If the honourable
gentleman wishes to know what cases were
referred to, I can tell him. He knows the
people. They live in his own locality. The
name of one applicant is Mrs. Bridget Courts,
of Cardigan Head, and the other is Walter
Sullivan, of Greenfield.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES:

Are they merchants

or farmers?

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: They are applicants
under the Act, and if my honourable friend
wants to know who the trader is thatHon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Gave half price?
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: -that

mortgage, it was Michael J. Power.
My
honourable friend knows him quite well; and
if he
ad wished to get that information
before the committee prior to accusing the
Director of falsehood, he had an opportunity
to do so. I can go further than that if my
honourable friend is still anxious for accuracy.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I know Michael.
do not know the others at all.

I

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Now, just let us
examine the statements of those who are so
reatdy to impeach the accuracy of others. My
honourable friend who has interrupted me,
and who was one who threw out this unfair
challenge te the committee, made a statement
in this House last year, which I quote from
Hansard of 1937. There are several cases cited
here. but it does not matter very much which
I take. I do net think I will bother the House
with all of them. First I will take a case in
the summer of 1935:
In the sommer of 1935, Peter D. Peters, of
Rollo Bay, made application to the Farci Loan
Board for a loan. His application was turnedl
dotin. No reason was given, se far as I know.
I knew a mistake Lad been made, and 1 se
informed Mr. J. D. MacLean, the comissioner
in Ottawa. He admitted they were net mi-take
proof, and said lie -wouldhave another appraisal
made in the summer of 1936 by one of his best
men. This was doue and Mr. Peters was offered
a loan of $2,500.
This together with what he
could easily sell of his farm last fall w ould
more than pay all his bills in full.
In the
sommer of 1936 the new board of review, being
keen for business, and hearing by seme neans
or other that Mr. Peters wanted a loan, or
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR.

wanted te have his obligations adjusted, cited
him and bis creditors before thei.
I was one
of the creditors and I appeared and asked the
board w-hother Mr. Peters had made any application to thent. Their registrar ntot being with

then that day, they could not tell, but thought
they would iear the case anyhow . I then told
thei

that Mr. Peters was both able and willing

to pay his creditors in full, and did not w ant
their interference at all. The cliairman, Judge
Saunders, asked Mr. Peters what he had to say.

He declared ie was able to pay lis bills in full
all right, but stated that if ererybody else -as
getting a cut ie thoughit lie should get one
too. Jutdge Sauniders seened inclined te agree
with me, but Mr. Harding, the comniussioner
who represented the creditors on the board,
strongly dissented, saying that inasmuch as they
had cone to Souris to hear this case ther were
going to iear it. Fittally Judge Sauniters agreed

with Harding, and their decision was that Mr.

Peters should sell $200 w ortih of produce off
tis fari, not more, and that the creditors
-wouldhave to accept this amount together with
the $2,450, or thereabouts, whiclh the Loan
Board would provide as payment in full. And
-would
you believe it?-the board of review
made this finding without ascertaining what
Mr. Peters' liabilities then amtounted to.
Take notice of that.
After thinking the matter over, and talking
it over w ith Lis creditors, Mr. Peters decided to
disregard the board of review altogether and
pay its obligations in full; which le did.
That is the statement, honourable gentlemen,
made in this House last year about that case.
Now, I have in my hand a memorandum of
tle Department of Finance which was sent

to the honourable

member in charge of the

Bill (Hon. Mr. Farris). This is wh-at it says:
I need ontly quote from Judge Sainders' report on the Peter D. Peters case to indicate
where the tmisrepresentation
that
Setator
Hughes charges lies:
"Peter 1). Peters' story lt
the board ias
that Senator Hughes w-%aspressing hii for payment and while lie was both anxious and w illiitg
to do se, lhe was unable to pay iim.
Senator
Hughes' statement that the board made its
findings vithout ascertaining what Mr. Peters'
liabilities amounted te is untrue."
The quotation is from the report of the
chairman of the board of review.
Now I quote from a memorandum of the
Director, signed by H. F. Gordon:
Wietier subsequent te the submnission of Lis
proposal Peters made preferential payments to
certain of his creditors is aside froi the issue.
He would be naturally instrucî-tedi by the board
that such payments siould not be made during
the stay of proceedings. The honourable senator misled the Senate with regard to tiis case.
Now, I

could take up further cases.

Hon. Mr.
slatement?

HUGHES:

Who

made

that

TLat statement
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR:
is made over the signature of the Director
of the

Farnmers'

Creditors Arrangement Act,

JUNE 9, 1938

and refers to the statement made by the
honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Hughes)
in the Senate last year.
Now, there are other cases here, but I will
not weary the House by going over them.
I will say this, however, that I am informed
by the Director that before those statements
were put on Hansard last year by the honourable senator from King's (Hon. Mr.
Hughes), the honourable senator met the
Director in the office of the Minister of Finance; that the Minister instructed the Director
to take the senator to his office and go into
these cases and point out the facts in regard
to them. I am informed also that he did so,
and that after having done so the honourable
gentleman expressed his satisfaction and said
that he had been misinformed. The Director then asked the honourable gentleman
to say so to the Deputy Minister, and in the
presence of the Deputy Minister and the
Director the statement was repeated after
the cases bad been gone into fully, and after
the honourable gentleman had seen the affidavits, the statement of liabilities of the debt,
the conditions, and the proposals made under
them. The honourable gentleman came into
this House the next day, or the day after,
and repeated the statements that appear on
Hansard, although these matters had been
explained to him in the department and he
had admitted in the presence of those two
men that his informant was wrong and that
he regretted having brought the matter up.
An Hon. SENATOR:

Question!

Now, honourable
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR:
gentlemen, I say it is unfair to our province and to Canada to go to such lengths
in order to try to discredit an Act. To know
that men will so use their position in Parliament to further selfish ends-Hon. Mr. HUGHES:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I will not go further
than that. That is far enough, honourable
gentlemen. I just want to say in conclusion
that I feel and believe that the Act is
administered in Prince Edward Island as well
as' in any other province.
In regard to the discussion this afternoon
on privity of contract, the chairman of the
board in Prince Edward Island took the view
that, on account of there not being privity of
contract, the Act did not give the board
power to do what was done by many other
boards of review, namely, to take a third
While proposals were formulated,
person.
they have not been confirmed by the board.
and are yet standing. If this Bill goes through

the proposals may be confirmed. That is
a matter for the board to decide. Now I
think I have said enough.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Too much.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I know the learned
judge who administers the Act. I do not
think you could get a man on the Bench or at
the Bar in Prince Edward Island who would
give as freely of his time and ability as Mr.
Justice Saunders has done, or who would be
more careful to do justice to everybody than
the present chairman of the board of review in
that province.
I really feel, honourable senators, that it is
unfortunate that so much time has been
taken with these details.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Had it not been that
honourable members from other provinces
were citing Prince Edward Island as an
example of maladministration, I should not
have spoken at all. I say to my honourable
friends with all frankness that the storm they
are making in this House is simply a tempest
in a teapot, and that it really bas little or no
effect within the confines of the Island. I do
not know that I need say anything more.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. DONALD SUTHERLAND: Honourable senators, it was not my intention to take
part in this debate, but in view of the day
and of the celebration which is going on outside this building, I am afraid that if it were
known by the people of Canada that we are
here to-night debating such a subject as this, it
would not raise us in their estimation.
This Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act,
which was passed some four years ago, could
have been dealt with prior to this. It was
well known from the outset that it was not
doing what the movers of it had in view.
I believe that their intentions were good, and
that they were seeking to provide a remedy
for a trouble which existed in this country.
But it bas not come up to their expectations.
It has absolutely failed. Furthermore, it has
injured the people much more than it has
benefited them.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. SUTHERLAND:
We have
listened for a considerable period to the
honourable member from Prince Edward
Island who has just resumed his seat. I know
that the trouble that bas been referred to as
prevailing in Prince Edward Island prevails in
other provinces also.

REVISED EDITION

There was some cause for this legisiation.
Something w~as wrong. I do not wish ta
blame the Goveroment for having made an
error. We ail make mistakes. But I believe
that instead of assisting the farmers or improving their credit, the Act bias had the
v ery opposite effect. I know that it is very
difficuit for a farmer in the province of Ontario to obtain a mortgage on land to-day.
Farm lands are at lcast 50O
per cont Iower in
value than they wvere thirty-five or forty years
ago. Thiat is a strange condition of affairs.
Tbe malady lias been in existence for some
time. The Gox ernment says it bias been endeax oiuig to prox ide a remedy, but what it
bas donc bias had a most disastrous effeet.
Wc have in years gone by passed legisiation
of varions kinds with a view to improving the
condition of certain classes. For twcnty-five
years or more we have had in this country
class legisiation, which bias created difficulties
that people outside the classes find it almost
impossible to overcome. I beliex e that nothing bias contributed more towards the distress
now prevailiug in our agricultural districts
than the fixing of hours oi labour and minimum xvages in towns and cities.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. SUTHERLAND: Under present
conditions it, is absolutely impossible for
farmers to carry on their business at a profit.
It is true that there are many well-to-do
farmers, men wbo have accumulated considerable property. But they are fixtures;
they cannot dispose of what they have, and
týhey are simply carrying an. We have tens
of tbousands of people on relief, who could
be employcd on the land if it were not for
the restrictions that have been placed upon
tbem by the Goverament of this country.
We may as well face the situation as it is.
You reduce the liability of the mortgagar,
but you destroy bis credit. There used ta
be many people in this country who were
glad to lend money on the security ai farms.
I am speaking not ai the big boan corporations, but ai private individuals with
means. This is no longer the case. Farmers
are in distress, and their credit is at; a lower
ebb than it ever xvas before. Yet we continue ta pass legislation fixing minimumi- ýwages
and maximumiii bours ai labour, and we spcnd
a lot af time talking about amalgamation or unification ai tbe railway s that, bave
becoine a burden on tbe country, The' iact is
that we do nat know tbe way ont af the present
situation. Jr is indeed a serions situation. I
think, honourable members, that the sooner
this Act passes into oblivian the better it wili
be for ail concerned.
Hon. Mr. MýacARTHTJR:
Hon. Mr. SUTHERLAND.

Hear, hear.

Hon. ýMr. SUTHERLAND: It is a handicap
on agriculture in this country. It has entirely destroyed the credit ai many worthy
and weIl-deserving people.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. SUTHERLAND: It is time
that we awoke ta the seriausaess of passing
lcgislation giving certain classes preferences
wbich react. against the industrial workers.
I use tbat termi "industrial workers" advisedly,
for if ever tbere was a class in this country
entitlcd ta be called industrialists, it is the
agricultural class. There are no people in
Canada to-day who are working langer bours
and for less remuncratian than thase who are
engaged in agriculture.
I did nat intend ta take any part in this
debate.
But I feed rpentful tbat we are
confined in here to-nigbt when we ougbt ta

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If the discus.sion
on this matter is ta continue, I suggest that
it go on now.

Han.
Mr. HUCHES:
The bonourabie
senaLor fi-uni Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair)
stated, as I -understoad him, that in Prince
Edward Island the greatest rush of business
unîler this Act aecurred in the first year or
twa that tbe Act was in operation.
The
reports submitted by the administrator at
Ottawa, and laid on the tables af bath Houses
of Parliament, do not bear out that statement.
My bonnonrl
friend's remarks qemed to
be contradictory in some respects. He stated
tliat the secured creditors in Prince Edward
Island suffered very smail reductions, and
that the law bad operated ta tbe benefit af
unsecured creditors as weli. 1 am reiying for
n-iy information upon the officiai reports made
by the administrator of the Act, rather than
upon liearsay.
Very iew copies af those
reports were distributed; sa I think it wouid
be wortb wbile ta quate same figures from
them.
They are very illuminating.
The
hanourabie senator frorn Queen's said that
the administration of the Act in Prince
Edward Island had been satisfactory. XVeII,
I will leave that point ta bonaurable members
for decision.

JUNE 9, 1938
T will quote figures to show a comparison
between Prince Edward Island and the other
Maritime Provinces, because among the three
there is much in common. I have before me
schedule 9 of the report that was given to
the other House in January last. The heading is: "The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement
Act, 1934.
Summary of Expenditures for
Fiscal Year-April 1, 1936, to March 31, 1937."
The total expenditure in Prince Edward Island
was $37,192.58; in Nova Scotia $4,958.76.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Is that the amount paid
to officials?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: To officials, for administration of the Act.
The figure for New
Brunswick was $26,164.22. In Prince Edward
Island there are 12,055 farmers, in Nova Scotia
31,835 farmers, and in New Brunswick 37,037
farmers.
Now I come to the travelling
expenses. For Prince Edward Island they
were, in that fiscal year, $1,325.23; for Nova
Scotia $462.96, and for New Brunswick
$1,373.69.
The next column is headed " Hotels."
lon. Mr. MacARTHUR: They bought the
hotels.
Hon. Mr. HUCHES: I do not suppose these
men bought the hotels, but for their hotel
expenses in Prince Edward Island that year
they were paid $3,530. This compares with
$379.10 for Nova Scotia and $3,213.05 for
New Brunswick. Now, I suppose these officials
did not visit all the hotels in Prince Edward
Island; it is likely that they patronized only
three or four. I know it will be news to the
managers of those hotels that the officials
administering this Act paid them in that year
$3.530.
Now, what do honourable members think
was the amount spent for postage that year
in Prince Edward Island?
It was no less
than $1.496.24. In Nova Scotia the amount
was $232.96, and in New Brunswick $1,195.68.
Then we come to telephones and telegraphs.
Under this heading the amount spent in Prince
Edward Island was $72.54, as compared with
$9.18 in Nova Scotia and $57.15 in New
Brunswick.
Under "Miscellaneous"-whatever that was
-there
was spent in Prince Edward Island
$6, in Nova Seotia 40 cents, and in New
Brunswick $10.60.
The heaviest expenditure was for salaries
and fees. For Prince Edward Island this
figure was $30,189.35, for Nova Scotia, $3,755,
and for New Brunswick $19,993.40.
The next column is headed "Rent."
I do
not know what that covers.
51958-30*

Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR:
there be?

467
What rent would

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: In any event, the sum
spent for rent in Prince Edward Island that
year was $277.50, while in Nova Scotia the
expenditure was only $10, and in New Brunswick $120.
Apparently the very best of stationery was
used. In Prince Edward Island $253.97 was
spent on this item; in Nova Scotia $77.69,
and in New Brunswick $81.08.
Then, under the heading of "Legal and
Filing" the expenditures were: in Prince
Edward Island $41.75, in Nova Scotia $31.47,
and in New Brunswick $119.57.
The next schedule, No. 10, contains a breakdown of these figures. This statement is also
interesting. For that fiscal year the allowance of the chairman in Prince Edward Island
was $4,368.75-I ask honourable members to
remember that this was for only one year,
from April 1, 1936, to March 31, 1937-whereas
the allowance paid to the chairman in Nova
Scotia was only $437.50, and to the chairman
in New Brunswick $2,918.75.
Then the commissioners' fees-these, I presume, would be fees to the two assistant commissioners-were as follows: in Prince Edward
Island $12,787.50, in Nova Seotia $1,072.50,
and in New Brunswick $6,737.50. New Brunswick has three times as many farmers as
Prince Edward Island, but only half the expenditure for commissioners' fees.
The salaries-this is under the heading of
"Registrars"--were: in Prince Edward Island
$2,400, in Nova Scotia $1,200, and in New
Brunswick $2,400.
The Registrar's staff cost $1,750 in Prince
Edward, but only $5 in Nova Scotia, and
$1,051.42 in New Brunswick.
The fees paid to official receivers that year
were: in Prince Edward Island $8,883.10, in
Nova Scotia $1,040, and in New Brunswick

$6,885.73.
There are a few more figures, but before r
take them up I must not forget to refer to
a letter from Judge Saunders, which was read'
in the Banking and Commerce Committee.
The Judge accused the honourable senator
from Prince (Hon. Mr. MacArthur) and myself of being actuated by personal spite. I
want to say here and now I have no personal
spite towards any man on earth.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: I second that.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I try to do my duty
aside from personal consideration, and I repeat that I have not the slightest spite towards
Judge Saunders or any other man.

inception of the Act, and the figures are

JUNE 9, 1938
We have in these two or three short paragraphs which I have quoted several allegations,
nearly all of which are notoriously exaggerated or stupidly false. To begin with, I
shall state in a general way that the merchants
and traders on Prince Edward Island, like
those in every other agricultural community,
must, under ordinary conditions, have the confidence and goodwill of their customers, the
farmers, or they-the merchants-could not
continue in business. Now, everyone with as
much mentality as a fourteen-year-old boy will
agree with me when I say that in order to get
and maintain that confidence and goodwill the
merchants and traders would have to treat the
farmers fairly and honestly. This memorandum which the honourable leader on this side
of the House read, put on the records of Parliament, and thereby endorsed, presents the
farmers of Prince Edward Island as a hopeless, helpless, spineless, debt-ridden class, and
the merchants and traders of the province as
unconscionable Shylocks grinding the very life
and soul out of their victims till the bunch
who administer the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act on the Island came to their
rescue. I shall here relate some facts whieh
everybody on Prince Edward Island knows to
be facts, but of which the Government here
appears to be either oblivious or badly informed.
First as to grain, there is no grain sold by
the farmers of Prince Edward Island except
small quantities of oats. Nearly all that grain,
and all the other grains grown, are used on
the farms. In some years small quantities of
oats are shipped to Newfoundland, Nova Scotia
and New Brunswick, where they compete with
the oats from the Prairies. The competition
among the traders on Prince Edward Island
who handle oats assures the farmers the highest
market price.
Then as to the other products which the
farmers sell, such as cattle, hogs, sheep, lambs,
poultry and eggs, they are practically all
bought and sold by farmers' clubs, assisted by
the officials of the provincial Department of
Agriculture and in some instances by the officials of the federal department as well. From
this it will be seen that any merchant who
handles any of these products must pay the
market price.
Next, as to potatoes and turnips, the crop is
largely exported. These vegetables are largely
handled by a province-wide organization of
the farmers themselves, of which till a few
years ago the Deputy Minister of Agriculture
was manager. Since he retired as Deputy
Minister, a member of the local Government
has been on the. board of directors. The
Government gives some financial assistance.

469

From this it will be seen that anybody else
who handles potatoes and turnips must compete with this organization and pay the highest market price. We were told to-day by
the honourable senator from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris) that the Government was
aware of the conditions on Prince Edward
Island better than was anybody else. Yet
we know what a Government employee wrote
in the memorandum which has been read in
this House. When the writer of this precious
memorandum stated that the merchants of
Prince Edward Island obliged the farmers to
sell their products at only one-half their value,
he wrote a greater untruth than was ever
penned by any other man in Canada. And
remember, this man is a Government cmployee in a highly responsible executive position. Moreover, a cruel hoax was perpetrated
on the honourable leader on this side of the
House when he was induced to read, and thus
put on the records of Parliament, this slanderous document.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend must remember that I receive reports
from fifteen departments, and these reports
I must bring to this Chamber. In this case
I knew the honourable gentleman would have
full time to cross-examine the person who
had signed that report, and he did so before
the committee.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR:
members, if I may say a wordHon. Mr. HUGHES: I want to proceed.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: I should like ta
say a word on that point.

Hon. Mr. GORDON: Whom do you refer
to in connection with a memorandum?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: The Director of the
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act in Ottawa.
On the 19th ultimo, when the senator from
Prince and myself were trying to stop, or at
Least to minimize, this raid on the publie
general imtreasury and bring about some
provement so far as Prince Edward Island was
concerned, the senator from Queen's (Hon.
Mr. Sinclair) told us we were powerless; that
all we could do was to make a noise. And
perhaps he was right. Time will tell. In
other words, be told us that he was in such
close contact with his relatives and friends,
the administrators of the Act on Prince Edward Island, and in such close contact with
the head office officials and the Government
here, that the racket on Prince Edward Island
would go on, much to our discomfiture and te
the possible amusement of the beneficiaries.
This Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act is
certainly a great game wliere it is well worked,
and Prince Edward Island is the best field yet
discovered.
May I ask the
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
honourable gentleman a question right there?
I have been earnestly trying to follow what,
apparently, he is trying te prove, that under
the administration of the Act there is a larger
percentage of grafters in Prince Edward Island
than in any other province of Canada. Is
that it?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I have given the
figures. I think my honourable friend is
quite capable of drawing his own conclusions.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR:

That is it.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Why, even the beneficiaries of the legislation write to the Charlottetown press, over fictitious names, praising
the Act and its administration, and saying
that no termination of the manna-producing
scheme for the few should be contemplated.
The honourable senator from Queen's says it
should net be ended at all; it is too good a
thing.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR:

Keep it going.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: On one occasion I
characterized the Act and its administration
at Ottawa and in some provinces as agreeing

in principle with Aberhart's ideas of justice.
and I find I am net alone in that belief. On
the 27th ultimo The Evening Telegram, Toronto, published this editorial, headed " Aberhart may have borrowed idea from Dominion
legislation ":
There las been wide condemnation of Preimier Aberhart's latest confiscatory

legislation.

It lias led Riglit Hou. Arthur Meighen to ask,
"Woild anybody from Ontario or Quebee or
anywhere on carth, except a madhouse, ]end
uouey on real estate tliere?"
The honourable member who preceded me
pointed out what this Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act lias donc to the credit of
farmers, and it has had that effect in Prince
Edward Island. To-day a young man tliere
who wants te buy a farm or stock simply caunet get credit, because of the operation of
this Act. The editorial continues:
Yet the sane question imight be asked with
equal force with regard to lending money on
farm property anywhere in Canada.
While
the Dominion Government is considering the
disallowance of the Alberta legislation, it might
appropriately take into consideration the remîîoval of esome of the defects from the Farmers' Creditors Arrangemient Act.
The boards which make adjustinents under
this Act do inot operate a.s courts except in the
binding character of their finding, they are not
bound by any principles of equity, and from
their decision there is no appeal, hoiwever seriously

are serious defects to which the Government of
Canada should give its attention. They should
remove the mote from tleir own eye at the
samue tîime that they are operating on the beani

Then it goes on te give a number of cases.
I will not read the decisions.
Now, I have given the facts in regard te
the administration in Prince Edward Island.
Do you wonder that we are trying to get
this Act rescinded? The beneficiaries do net
want it rescinded, for men who probably
never before got a salary of more than $600
or $700 a year are now getting $6,000 or
$7,000 under this Act as administrators.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Is that not the
tendency of the day-shorter hours and
bigger pay?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: But it is all done in
the pretence that they are benefiting the
farmer.
Well, I think I will stop and leave it with
the Senate.

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, Bill 143,
an Act to assist Municipalities in making selfliquidating Impravements, was read thse 'third
time, and passed.
INDIfAN BIL
SECOND READING

MANDURAND maved the
Han. RAOUL
138, an Act to amend
second reading of Bih
tlie Indian Act.
He saîd: HonCurable senatars, this Bull contains but two clauses. It will Se notai thýat
tliey cover two matters of certain importance.
The first is the making oS regulations relating
to the disposai of minerais whicli may be
faun~d on Indian reserves. At present tihe Act
givea power to the Governor in Council to
make regulations governing the disposai of
what migtn fe termed surface rights on the
reserves; that is ta say, regulations relating
to te disposai of timber, hay and grazing

any suc disposaican le made tie consent
of tie Indians or the Indian band interested

471

has to be secured, but once the consent of
the Indian band is secured then the administration falls within the framework of
the regulations provided in the Indian Act.
At the time the regulations were passed, or
indeed at the time the provision was inserted
in the Indian Act, it was not expected that
developments of minerals or coal or of oil
so far as Alberta is concerned would take
place on Indian reserves, located, as they were,
mostly in the northern part of the province.
The opinion of the Department of Justice is
that the power of the Governor in Council to
make these regulations does not extend to
the sub-surface rights. The proposal now is
simply to give the Governor in Council power
to do with the sub-surface rights what he
already has the power to do with the surface
rights. The consent of the Indians concerned
will still have to be first had and secured.
The second point involved is really a new
departure in Indian administration. It is the
creation of what is popularly called a revolving fund. Under the proposed provisions
the Minister of Finance will have authority
to advance, as specified in the Bill, sums of
money up to a total of $350,000 for the purpose of making loans either to individual
Indians or to Indian reserves, or in relation
to other matters connected with Indian welfare work. The Indians are at present, and of
course will remain, even under this legislation,
the wards of the Government. At present Parliament appropriates certain moneys year by
year for Indian welfare work. But these votes
of money are expended like any other vote,
and consequently are looked upon more in the
way of grants or gifts to the Indians who are
the beneficiaries of aid given in welfare
matters.
This fund is created for the purpose of
lending money either to individual Indians or
to bands of Indians for productive purposes,
or perhaps in certain cases to residential
schools for the purpose of developing handicraft arts, with the understanding that these
loans must be paid back into the fund to the
credit of the Minister of Finance, or rather
to the credit of the Receiver General to be
administered by the Minister of Finance.
This is a new departure, I think, and, a wise
move. It will help to develop a spirit of
self-reliance, and will gradually prepare the
Indians for full citizenship.
Several years ago-indeed, not so many
years ago-the Government of the United
States adopted this policy. In the United
States, roughly speaking, there is about twice
the Indian population that we have in Canada.
They provided, since they had the means to
do so, a very much larger fund than we sug-

72

SENATE

gest here. but if this works out as anticipated,
it should become necessary later on to increase
the amount in the fund.
May I give a few illustrations of how the
fund may be used to assist in various ways?
On a certain reserve an Indian may have
been allotted a certain portion of land.
He bas not the means to buy stock or to
obtain farm implements. Advances can be
made under this fund, with the understanding that they must be repaid in whatever
period of time is fixed. Again, we fhave reserves that are communal in their character.
Another purpose for which this fund could
be drawn upon would be to place cattle on a
reserve, with the understanding that the
amount of the loan creating the capital in
the live stock would be repaid to the fund.
Of course all these reserves are under supervision. Another illustration might be given in
connection with work in residential schools.
I think our system of Indian education left
something to be desired. I am glad to note that
within more recent years, particularly within
the last few years, more emphasis bas been
placed upon the need of vocational training
in t]cse Indian schools. The Minister who
presentcl this Bill to the other House says:
I have seen samples of Indian liandicraft
work produced at points reinote from civilization, such as beaded work of various kinds
and other similar articles, which would find a
ready market in the developrment of the tourist trade of this countryand he expresses the hope in this regard that
we niay be able to go te the authorities of
an Indian school and say: "If you wish to
teach the girls in this school handicraft arks;
if you wish to teach them weaving or leather
working or any other art, we shall be in a
position to supply the necessary amount of
money, by way of a loan, to purchase the
materials with which this work may be carried
on."
Generally speaking, these are the purposes of
this Bill, which I commend to this Chamber.
I move the second reading of the Bill, seconded
by Right Hon. Mr. Graham.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: The
first part of the Bill lias for its purpose an
amendment of the Indian Act te bring about a
condition of affairs which I thought already
existed. I certainly always have felt, and
acted upon the belief, that regulations could be
provided with respect to the disposal of
mineral rights on Indian lands after the surrender. If there is any defect in the law in
this respect, of course it should be remedied.
I want to say a few words, though, about
the second clause of the Bill, which provides
that the Crown may lend more money.
Under it the credit of Canada may be again
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

resorted te, this time for producing a revolving fund from which to make loans to Indians
as individuals, and in the communal state,
and also to Indian schools for the education
of Indian children in handicrafts. I will state
the one single and indispensable condition te
the making of such loans, namely, that it be
under the superintendence of a man who is
thoroughly and extraordinarily competent for
the work. I do net know the official who
would be responsible for this. I am net sure
who is the Deputy Minister in charge of
Indian Affairs at the present time, but this
is information that I should like to have
before I vote for such a revolving fund.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The Deputy
Minister of the department is Dr. Camsell.
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: He is the
Deputy Minister of the Department of Mines
and Resources. If there is as good a man as
Dr. Camsell in charge of this work, all right.
Hon. Mr. COTE: It is Dr. McGill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do net know
him, and I do not know how competent he
is. But I shall be amazed. and shall take off
my hat to him, if he is able te make a
success of this revolving fund. Until recent
ycars there was a man in the department
who was the only official I ever knew of,
connected with Indian affairs, who could make
a real success of farming by individual Indians.
He did that in the File Hills Reserve. Lately,
in the prime of life, bie was superannuated,
and so is net now in the service of the State.
I should put a big question mark in front
of the name of any man who was given the
task of administering a revolving fund such
as is proposed here, where the debtors were
te be individual whites; I should make the
question mark considerably larger where the
debtors were to be individual Indians; and
very much larger where the obligation to
return the money was te rest upon Indians
in a communal sense. My guess is that the
fund provided for by this Bill will revolve
until the fund is exhausted, when the revolving will coase and the State will bear the
loss of the whole amount.
Unless a very
extraordinary man is placed in charge of the
fund, and unless he stays in charge of it for
years te come, we may as well kiss good-bye
te all the money right now. It will never
come back. Government loans te white people,
where the individual obligation always obtains,
are net often repaid. How much slimmer are
the prospects for repayment of money placed
in a revolving fund for Indians, who are net
individualists and who as a rule do not understand the meaning of an obligation!
And
those prospects are still slimmer when the

JUNE 9, 1938
loan is made to a group or tribe, and the
obligation is a communal one, whatever that
may mean. Surely the Government does not
think that in these circumstances Indians will
understand there is a real obligation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I wonder if their
general fund would not be security for
advances made under this Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Oh, no.
Deductions could of course be made from
But all that they are

getting now is subsistence, and they cannot
be allowed to starve.
No. I meant
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
their general fund, which accumulates.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What I am
trying to emphasize is that there is only one
condition under which this revolving fund
can succeed,, and that is that it be superintended by a man who has extraordinary
qualifications for the work. Dr. McGill may
be such a man; I do not know. But I know
that in my day there was only one man in
the Department of Indian Affairs who could
have convinced me that he was capable of
making a success of this fund.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Who was the
Superintendent then?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Superintendent of Indian Affairs at that time was
Dr. Scott. The man to whom I refer as having practical knowledge of farm operations,
an understanding of what a return of the
dollar meant, and the necessary contact with
the Indians, was Mr. Graham.
As to loans to Indian schools for the education of children in handicrafts, the objective
is a very fine one, but who is going to return
that money? We support the schools; they
are Government institutions. I think it costs
the country about six times as much te
educate an Indian child as te educate a white
one. I do not believe the results in the cases
of Indians are six times as good; I am inclined to think the ratio is just the reverse.
Nevertheless, we have to do our best. But
I do not know where the repayment of that
money is going to come from. Are the
children who get the education to repay the
money? If so, we are relying upon a fantasy. The Minister stated in the House that
this was to be a loan. Well, it will be like
a lot of other loans. I would recommend the
honourable leader of the House (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) to advise the Minister of Finance, Hon. Mr. Dunning, not te count on
the return of 100 per cent of that money.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Cast your bread upon
the waters.
•

473

Hon. Mr. COTE: I do not know about
the capacity of Indians to repay their loans,
but, if it is permissible for me to say so, I
happen to be acquainted with the Director of
the Indian Affairs Branch. Dr. McGill succeeded Dr. Duncan Campbell Scott as head
of this branch. I consider Dr. McGill to
be a very able and competent official.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I shall make it
my duty to draw the attention of the Minister to the remarks of the right honourable
leader opposite.
I may say that during my long experience
and contact with the various departments of
Government I have for the most part met
officials of a very high order. This certainly
applies to the former Department of the
Interior and its various branches. Some years
ago we had an inquiry to determine whether
there was any foundation for the statement
that the departments were overmanned. We
called before a committee all the deputy
ministers and their chiefs of branches, and I
think the members of that committee came to
the conclusion that the Government of Canada
was served by a really high-class staff of
officials. I recall that representatives of the
Department of the Interior, the Department
of Agriculture and other departments really
surprised us by the extent of their technical
information and their general ability and
character.
Righ Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I would not
for a minute question the technical knowledge
and high character of departmental officers,
and the generally favourable impression that
they will make on any person. But these
things are entirely different from business
capacity, which is needed to enable a man
to make a success of a loan of $350,000 on
Indian farming. A man needs to be able to
do a lot more than to make a fine impression
and to talk ably if he is to get loans of this
kind repaid.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable members,
I wish te add a few words. I have lived in
the West a long time, and though I do not say
I have had a thorough knowledge of the
Indian situation, I have come into contact
with it in a great many ways. I have been
acquainted with many of the officials who were
in charge of administering the Indian Act.
What surprises me in connection with this
Bill is why these loans are thought of at this
late date. The Indian problem has been with
us ever since Canada has been Canada, and
for all those years we have done without a
revolving fund to take care of the duties that
the State owes to Indians. I cannot help
thinking that there is around the department
somebody, perhaps more than one person,

474

SENATE

desirous of creating new jobs, of extending the
activities of the department.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Those who have been
connected with the administration of affairs,
provincial as well as federal, know that such
a desire nearly always exists in what we call
the Civil Service. There is the tendency
to increase or intensify the importance of a
department or branch, and to enlarge the
expenditure of money, because these things
bring certain other things with them.
I agree absolutely with everything that bas
been said by the right honourable leader on
this side (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen). I doubt
very much that any useful purpose will eyer
be served by the expenditure of this money,
unless the strictest precautions are taken, and I
further doubt that any large portion of it will
ever be returned. If it is possible to attach
some strings to this Bill so as to make certain
that the expenditures under it will be properly
controlled, I think we should do so. Those of
us who have lived in the West know that on
many occasions large sums of money have been
squandered in the Indian service at various
times, and that there bas been very little in
the shape of results to show.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not know
whether the honourable gentleman bas noticed
the Minister's general statement of what he bas
in mind. I may say that the Minister bas
travelled widely throughout the West.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:

He knows the W est.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
He has been
most painstaking in trying to find out what
can be donc to inerease the returns of soine of
his branches and to attend te the needs of the
persons who come under the Indian Affairs
Branch.
Hoin. Mr. CALDER: But the present conditions have existed for many years. Farning
operations have been carried on in these reserves for at least twenty-five or thirty years.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Longer than
that.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: For probably forty
years. And during all that time the department bas had to get its necessary funds by
some means. So I cannot understand w'hy it
is necessary to have new legislation now,
except for providing for handicraft work in
some of the schools.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But the department apparently bas not the money for the
objects which I have mentioned.
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Why is money net
voted as required for these purposes, as always bas been done?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The Government has decided te have a revolving fund.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That may be all
right in theory, but it will never work out
in practice, in my opinion.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The last clause
of the Bill provides:
The Superintendent General shall annually
prepare a report with regard to loans made
under the provisions of subsection one of this
section, during the preceding calendar year,
and such report shall be laid before Parliamient within fifteen days or, if Parliament is
not then sitting, within fifteen days after the
beginning of the next session.
So that at the opening of every session we
shall have a full statement of the operations
of this revolving fund.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It will be a
statement of expenditures, not of receipis. I
can remember being told by Mr. Gralham
about advances to Indians for cattle. It was
no time at all before there were no cattle;
they were eaten up.
The chief requisite is a man upon whom
we can depend, a man who has lived all
his life with the Indians and who bas an
extraordinary knowledge of their affairs. We
used to have fine visions of Elysian fields, in
the old days, under the Government that I
supported, and we started spending money
for distributing thoroughbred bulls among
white people throughout the country. We
soon found that a good many of these bulls
were used as oxen, and, a little later, they
were eaten. If that was the experience with
whites, what will be the fate of a revolving
fund for Indians?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: May I ask the honourable leader whether ho intends to refer this
Bill to a standing committee?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I had not intended to. The whole Bill is expressed in
two sections, and the explanatory notes are
complete.
I doubt that we could get in
committee more information than I have
read from the Minister's statement.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Would the
honourable leader not have the Bill referred
to some committee where we could hear
the Director of the Branch? I should like to
hear what he as to say. The first section
of the Bill is all right; I am ready te let that
pass at any time. But this revolving fund,
for the purpose of placing the Indians in the
cattle business, does niot appeal to me at

475

JUNE 9, 1938
aIl. If my own money were involved-the
widow's mite that it is-I would not put it
into such a venture. I would Iust as soon
drop it into the Ottawa river and say "FarewellI!"
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We are more or
less carrying on a conversation, which rnay
be out of order, strictly spcaking.
Behind section 2 is the idea of developing
a sense of initiative and self-reliance on the
part of the Indians, with a vicw to bringing
them up to such a level that they may ne
absarbed into our Canadian citizenship. Towards that end the Minister seeks to help
them to become self-sufficient in the administration of their own land, in the management
of cattie and the proper use of appropriate
implements.
But I shahl be glad to refer this Bill to a
committee after it bas received second reading.
Shahl it be the Committee on Agriculture and
Forestry?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Ail right.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Honourable members, I amn surprised at anyone who knows
where the boans will go regarding them as
revolving loans. Is not that termi a misnomer?
The more appropriate term would be "dissolving." I have had a little experience of
where these so-called "boans" go, and I say
advisedly that no business man wlouid make
loans in that quarter with the expectation of
ever getting them repaid.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I think it would be a
distinct advantage to send the Bill to coinmittee in order that some senators, particularly the right honourable leader on this side,
who has had a very large experience in connection with Indian aiffairs, might question
and advise the man who would be responsible
for the administration of the Act. In addition, I think we should require a report on
every boan made, and the purpose for which
it was made, the information to be laid before
Parliament.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: When this Bill
goes to that committee I wiil see that the
chairman notifies my right honourable fricnd
to be there, and as wehl the Minister and the
deputy in charge of that branch.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bihl was
read the second time.

might be doing useful work to-morrow in toe
Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs
and Harbours, to which this Bill will be sent.
I thought the speeches might be somewhat
shortened in view of the fact that the Bill
will be dealt with very thoroughly in that
committee. I doubt very much whether any
members desire to prevent this proposed legislation from being studied in committee, whera
we shall get much more illumination than by
debating it in this Chamber. Then on tho
motion for third reading, with full knowledge
of the principles, the Bill could be discussed
on its merits. If my honourable friend does
not want to burden his mind with his principal
arguments, he can very well discuss the Bill
for an hour now, and so allow us to advance it
to the second reading stage.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: With all respect, I think the honourable leader of the
House is making a mistake. I have never seen
a debate forced or even urged on at Il o'clock
at night. There is never anything approaching
obstruction in this House. I doubt that the
committee would accomplish very much tomorrow, anyway. The committee will have to
Hon. Mr. DUFF.

hear delegates for and against the Bill, and I
fancy the principal ones cannot be here tomorrow. I am sure we shall finish just as soon
on Monday night as if we resumed debate
on the Bill to-night. I should not think of
asking anyone to restrict his remarks. We
shall get through our work all right.
The Order was discharged.

THE

MINISTER

OF TRANSPORT

QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
senators, I rise to a question of privilege.
When on Wednesday last I moved the second
reading of Bill 31, the Transport Bill, the
honourable senator from Lunenburg (Hon.
Mr. Duff) objected to the making of the
motion at that time and made some disparaging remarks concerning the honourable
Minister of Transport. Among them I may
cite the following:

JUNE 13, 1938
Much worse than the Chinese who are retreating day by day from the Japanese, much
worse than the Spaniards who are retreating
from the insurgents, the Minister of Transport
retreated all along the line this year and last
year, because all he had in mind when he
introduced the legislation, and got my honourable friend to introduce it here, was the
protection of certain interests on the Great
Lakes in which he was interested.
It was my duty to draw the attention of
ny colleague the honourable Minister of
Transport to these utterances, and their somewhat aggressive tone. I have received the fol-owing answer from the Minister, Hon. Mr.
Howe:
My dear Colleague,
I have your memo calling my attention to
the remarks of Senator Duff as reported in
Senate Hansard of Wednesday, June 8, and
their aggressiveness.
In the course of his remarks, Senator Duff
made the following statement:
"All be (the Minister of Transport) had in
mind when ho introduced the legislation, and
got my honourable friend to introduce it here,
was the protection of certain interests on the
Great Lakes in which he was interested."
This could but mean that I am financially
interested in certain ships. For your information, I may say that I am not now and
never have been at any time interested financially in any way whatever, directly or indirectly, in any ships or in any other meaus of
transportation.
As to the animus shown by the honourable
gentleman, I may say that this is no surprise
to me, as in my ministerial capacity I have
bad occasion to differ with him in matters in
which it was my duty to defend the publie
interest confided to my charge.
Yours very truly,
C. D. Howe.
Hon. J. P.

B. CASGRAIN:

Honourable

Hon. Mr. DUFF: Honourable senators, in
one way I am pleased, indeed, that the
honourable leader of the House (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand)Would you
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
allow me a moment first, please?
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Yes, with pleasure.
HONOURABLE SENATOR DANDURAND
FELICITATIONS ON ELECTION
TO L'INSTITUT DE FRANCE

Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, before the honourable senator from
Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duff) proceeds to make
any reply, I crave the indulgence of the
Senate for a few minutes to refer to a very
pleasing announcement that has appeared in
the press since we last met. The highly
distinguished leader of this House (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) has had a very rare and

477

signal honour conferred upon him in his having been elected, by unanimous vote, a
member of l'Institut de France.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I desire to
press to the honourable leader not only
own sincere congratulations, but those, I
sure, of every honourable member of
House.

exmy
am
this

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: As we all know,
the honourable gentleman has had a very
distinguished public career, extending over
forty years, in his own country. In addition,
he has performed very valuable and noteworthy services abroad for Canada on niore
than one occasion, especially at the League
of Nations; and indeed for three years he
occupied the position of President of the Assembly of that great body, his election to
which office was indeed a high honour. More
recently he represented Canada, in his usually
able and eloquent way, at the Nine-Power
Conference.
I am sure that the young men of Canada
could find inspiration in no better way than
by familiarizing themsèlves with the life and
very distinguished career of the honourable
leader of this House, and no finer advice could
be given them than to emulate him.
I will conclude by expressing the hope, in
which I am sure all my colleagues join, that
the honourable leader of the Government may
maintain his usually good health and vigour
for many years to come, and enjoy the honours
that he has so well merited.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: Honourable
senators, I was going to ask leave of the
House to make a short announcement which
I was sure would cause every honourable
member to rejoice, but somebody must have
been indiscreet enough to tell the honourable
acting leader of the other side (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne). However, I just want to add a
few words by way of emphasizing the very
great honour that the honourable leader of
the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) has received. Lord Brougham, who had been appointed to many high offices, including the
chancellorship of the Exchequer, and who had
inherited and acquired many great titles, discarded all other titles, not only his English
ones, but also those he had received from
many foreign coun.tries, upon his election to
l'Institut de France. Thereafter he always
signed himself simply, "Brougham, membre

178

SENATE

de l'Institut." He was prouder of that distinction than of any that he had inherited
or any other that he had acquired.
I an very glad tliat this matter was brought
up by the acting leader opposite, and it gives
me much pleasure to join with him in his
congratulations te the leader of the House
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) on the honour he
has received. It reflects credit on every member of this Chamber. I do net think there
are nmany political bodies in the world who
would not be very preud to have among
tieir own members a membre de l'Institut.
Hon. WILLIAM DUFF: Hçnourable senators,-

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: I am sorry
for-any interruption to the remarks of my
honourable friend from Lunenburg (Hon.
Mr. Duff). I desire to thank the honourable
acting leader on the other side (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne) and my old friend te my left
(Hoin. Mr. Casgrain) for the kind remarks
they have just uttered with respect to myself.
I may say that I realize the importance of
my election to l'Institut de France and to
l'Academie des Sciences Morales et Politiques.
I know full well that this honour, which can
e bestowed upon only a very few persons
outside of nationals of France, is more
especially meant to honour the country of its
recipient. It is to Canada as a whole that
I transfer the honour of my election to
nembership. It is. I am sure, not my personality which lias been specially thought of
by the iembers of l'Institut, but rather is it
the great Dominion of Canada, whicih is very
near the hcart of the Republic of France.
Seme Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT
QUESTION

OF PRIVILEGE

Hon. Mr. DUFF: Honourable senators,
I join with my honourable friend the acting
leader of the other side (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne)
and
the honourable
senator
from
De
Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) in complimentng the ritinguished gentleman who
leads the Government in this House (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand). The fact that my honourable friend from Alma (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne)
introduced this important subject at the time
he did, shows conclusively to me that, after
all, the small matter which was brought up
by the 'honourable leader of the Government as a question of privilege does not
mean nearly so much as perhaps might be
inferred from his remarks. There is no gentleman in this honourable House, or perhaps
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

in this country, who holds the admiration of
the people more than does the honourable
leader of the Government in the Senate.
But may I say to him that I was a member
of the other House for twenty-one sessions,
and I have been in the Senate for three
sessions, and during all that time the practice
has always been that an honourable member
intending to rise te a question of privilege
and reflect on remarks made by a colleague
would pay his colleague the courtesy of
notifying him in advance, so that he would
know what to expect. I cannot understand,
honourable members, why the honourable
leader of the House did not accord that
courtesy to me.
However, I should like to say that I can
understand the position of the leader of the
Government with regard to this matter. I
can assure him that during my forty years of
public life, twenty-four years of which I have
been supporting one of the great parties of
this country as a member of Parliament, I
have always voted and wo.rked for that party,
whether it was in a civic, municipal, provincial
or federal election, and when election day
came I never ran away from that party, as
did in 1934 the gentleman who wrote the
letter which was read a minute ago by my
honourable friend. In the 1934 election in
the prooince ef Ontario that gentleman did.
not vote for the Liberal party.
N ow-, what does my honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) say? That I made some
disparaging remarks aiout the 1Minister of
Tran-port. May I say, honouralle senators,
tlat that would be absouitelv impossible. The
Minister of Transport in his letter states that
I said ie was financially interested in steamship companies on the Great Lakes. That is
net correct. I will be sufficiently courteous not
to say it is not true, or to use even stronger
language, but I say there is not one word in
Hansard to show 1 said the honourable Minister was financially interested in those companies. J an surprised tiat the honourable
leader of the Governnment did not peruse my
remnarks before he read the Minister's letter,
whiclh niakes such an incorrect statement.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I interrupt?
Some of us can read and understand the Englisi language.
At page 434 of the Senate
Hansard of last Wednesday I find the followmg:
Hon. Mr. Duff: I know. I am glad the
lronourable leader agiees withi me. J am repeating wiat ie said, for J want honourable
mienbers to realize the situation. Muei worse
than the Chinrese who are retreating day by
rday ftmin the Japanese, mihie worse thai the
Spaniards wio are retreating fromi the insurgents, the Minister of Transport retreated

JUNE 13, 1938
all along the line this year and last year,
because all he had in mind when he introduced
the legislation, and got rny honourable friend
to introduce it here, was the protection of
certain interests on the Great Lakes in which
he was interested.
What else are we to understand? Then he
continues:
He does not care anything about aeroplanes,
buses, or anything else. It was purely a matter
of trying to arrange to have bankrupt shipping
concerns on the Great Lakes come under the
proposed legislation, and to have higher rates
paid by tie people of this country.
It should be noted that this is not even the
same measure as was introduced in the other
House this session.
Some of us have a little understanding, and
we all understoodSome Hon. SENATORS: Order! Order!
Hon. Mr. DUFF: If my honourable friend
wants to follow me he can do so, but he has
no right to interrupt my speech. I do not
take back one word of what my honourable
friend has quoted. I said the Minister of
Transport was interested in this Bill because it
would affect and help certain interests on the
Great Lakes. I repeat, I do not take that
back. As to what I said about the Spaniards
retreating in Spain and the Chinese in China,
my honourable friend knows the Minister
retreated, for the honourable senator was himself a member of the committee before which
the Minister practically withdrew half of the
clauses of the Bill. I am going to prove that
when I speak on the motion for second reading of this Bill. But that has nothing to do
with the statement contained in the letter
read by the honourable leader, that I said the
Minister of Transport was financially interested.
No.
The
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable Minister of Transport concludes
that the honourable senator's statement of last
Wednesday could only mean that he, the Minister, would be financially interested in those
ships.
Hon. Mr..DUFF: Of course, the honourable
gentleman can draw the long bow if he likes,
but what I am talking about is what I said
last week. It seems to me the statement in
the Minister's letter was rather out of place,
that I made those remarks not because I
thought it my duty to do so as a public
man opposing the Bill, but because of a difference between him and me on a public
question. In other words, he insinuated that
I made those remarks the other night because
of some matter with respect to which I tried
to get the Minister to agree, but he would
not. Well, if the Minister had any common
sense he would keep quiet about that. A

479

Privy Councillor should be -a man of probity
and honour. A Minister of the Crown should
not go around the corridors of this building
calling a senator a "damn big windbag." That
is what the Minister of Transport did. He said
I took my stand against the Bill because I
did not get my own way. It was not my
own way I wanted to get at all. I was asked
by a certain person to go to the Minister
with regard to a ship which the department
was selling. The Minister of Transport sold
that ship to the man I was acting for; that is,
he gave me his word that the ship was sold
to that man. Inside of twenty-four hours he
sold the ship to somebody else, and so assured
the man who was acting for another party.
And after all that, he placed the ship in the
hands of the salvage committee. So the less
the Minister says about me with regard to
any dealings I had with him in that connection, the better for himself. That is the last
dealing I had with him, and it is the last dealing I am ever going to have with him, because
he is not a man to be trusted. I say a man
who is a Privy Councillor should be distinguished for probity and honour; he should
be a man whose word you can trust when he
comes to you and says that a certain thing
will be done.
Now, honourable senators, it seems to me
this is a tempest in a teapot. I have certain
views on the Transport Bill. I expressed those
views not only last year, but also this year,
and I intend to express them again to-night on
the second reading of the present Bill.
The Minister in charge of the Department
of Transport is the man who two years ago
moved an amendment declaring that Lake
Ontario, Lake Huron, Lake Erie and Lake
The only
Superior were salt-water lakes.
reason I can give for his doing so is that
while on bis verandah at Port Arthur he
wishes to think he is down at St. Andrew's by
the Sea.
If there is any apology to be made, let me
say the first person to make apology will not
be I. Throughout my publie life I have always
tried to be fair, and I am astonished that a
man in the high position of a Minister would
dare say of a member of the Senate of Canada
that he was a "damn big windbag."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not know
when a question of privilege ends, but since
my honourable friend has spoken of the real
cause of his separation from the Minister of
TransportHon. Mr. DUFF: I did not talk about it.
You started it. But go ahead.

Manseau Shipyards Limited, Sorel, $40,100.
Maritime Navigation Co., Ltd., Liverpool,
N.S., $41,000.
A. E. March, Montreal, $41,000.
An Order in Council, signed jointly by the
Minister of Finance and myself, was passed on
the 15th April, 1937, stating, among other things,
as follows:
"That the three best offers were investigated,
and that A. E. March intimated by telegram
be was not further interested. Manseau Shipyards, Ltd., made a new offer of $42,000 under
certain conditions, and the Maritime Navigation Co., Ltd., made a new offer of $50,000.
Under the circumstances, the Ministers recommended that all tenders received on March 30
that the icebreaker
be rejected, and (2)
'Mikula' be sold to the Maritime Navigation
Co., Ltd., Liverpool, N.S., for $50,000."
The "Mikula" was duly sold to the Maritime
Navigation Co., Ltd., "as and where is," and
certified cheque for $44,900, $4,100 and $1,000
were received and passed by the Director of
Marine Services to the treasury.
In a shipping publication, "Siren and Shipping," published in London, England, under
date of February 24, 1937, the following item
appeared.
That is, three months before the sale by the
Government to the tenderer.
"'Mikula,' steam driven icebreaker, 3,575 tons
gross, 2,042 tons net, built Canadian Vickers,
Montreal, 1916, owned by the Canadian Government, has, we understand, been sold to the
Arnott Young Company, shipbrokers, Glasgow,
for £14,000 delivered Clyde."
From the above it would appear that the
Captain Ogilvie interests had sold the "Mikula"
some four months before its purchase froin the
Government was arranged, for approximately
$70,000, delivered on the Clyde. A conversation
with Captain Ogilvie at the time of purchase
from the Government led me to infer that Duff
had represented that he could deliver the boat
for $30,000, which may explain the anger of
Senator Duff displayed at my last interview
with him.
This covers all my relations with Senator
Duff, and is the only explanation I can give
of his present attitude toward myself.
Yours faithfully,
(Signed) C. D. Howe.
Hon. WILLIAM
DUFF:
Honourable
senators, I am sure you must be weary of
all this, but in view of certain statements
submitted by the Minister of Transport, I
have one or two remarks to make. I shall
be as brief as possible.
Captain Ogilvie advised me to offer the
Minister $17,000 for the Mikula. This I did.
In that interview the Minister told me he
had been offered $30,000 for the ship. I can
give the name of the gentleman in Montreal
from whom he said he had received the offer.
This gentleman has a large contract and large
dealings with the Marine Department. I will
not mention his name. I said to Mr. Howe, "It
51958-31

481

seems to me that gentleman is getting sufficient money for the work he does for this
country, and therefore I think that if Captain
Ogilvie will raise his price from $17,000 to
$30,000 he should get the ship." Mr. Howe,
in his office in the West Block, on a Saturday morning-I remember it well-said, "He
can have the boat if he will pay $30,000." I
said, "Will you give me forty-eight hours to
communicate with Captain Ogilvie?" He said,
"Yes."
I came back later and said: "He
will take the ship at $30,000. Now what do
you want?"
Mr. Howe said, "Get Captain
Ogilvie to write me saying that he will pay
$30.000 for it." I said: "I will do better
than that; I will not only get him to write
you a letter, but I will get him to send you
a ten per cent deposit,"-which Captain Ogilvie
did.
Later on Captain Ogilvie wired me that his
people in Glasgow were anxious to know what
had happened, and I went to the Deputy
Minister of Transport and said: "Would
you be good enough to try to hurry this
thing along? Captain Ogilvie wants to take
charge of the ship and take her to the Old
Country." The next day Mr. Smart telephoned me at 3 o'clock saying, "They have
decided to put her in the hands of the Salvage
Committee."
On Sunday, after being at church, I was
invited to lunch. At that lunch my host
said, referring to the late Dan Cameron,
member of the House of Commons for Cape
Breton, "Did you tell Dan about what Howe
said to you about the Mikula?" I told what
happened, and Mr. Cameron said, "He could
not have sold her to you, as he sold her to
me for the Margaree Shipping Company." I
have three witnesses to prove this.
After talking to Mr. Smart I did not go to
Mr. Howe's office. I have never been in his
office since that Saturday morning when he
told me he would take $30,000. The conversation imputed to me took place outside in the
corridor, and every policeman on the main
floor heard it, and the Minister's excuse for
his own conduct is not correct.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. DUFF: And, to the surprise
of the honourable the junior member from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig), I did not raise
my voice during my conversation with the
Minister. All I said was, "Are you going to
deliver the Mikula to Ogilvie?" His reply
was, "You are nothing but a daimn big windbag." I didn't knock him down, as I should
have done. I did not say one word, but
walked away, for reasons which I need not
explain.

May I repeat? The next Sunday Mr.
Cameron, the member for Cape Breton in the
House of Commons, in the presence of three
witnesses. admitted that he did not believe
Mr. Howe could have sold the boat to Captain
Ogilvie, because he, Mr. Cameron, acting
for the Margaree Steamship Company, had
bought her from the Minister for $40,000.
I say I was never in Mr. Howe's office a-ter
he agreed to sell the ship to Ogilvie. I did
net raise my voice during all the conversations
I had with him in regard to this matter.
He knew he had not donc right. He knew
he had sold Captain Ogilvie the ship for
$30,000. I have never seen him since nor
had anything to do with him. Yet Mr. Howe
called me a damn big windbag; and now he
cornes with a long rigmarole and tries te say
he did not make me a promise to sell Captain
Ogilvie that ship for $30,000.

Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, after listening to such a talk about
ships, it will be a little difficult to bring our

Do you want me to

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. DUFF: Well, I know more about
it than my honourable friend.
But the sale
lon. Mr. DANDURAND:
of the ship to Captain Ogilvie was made at

$50,000.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Absolutely right. And
do you know what Captain Ogilvie had te
do before he got the ship? He had to bring
his principal across the water, from Glasgow,
Seotland, and his other principal from New
York, and they had te stay around here for
a fortnight. It was only because Captain
Ogilvie threatened to expose the transaction
in the newspapers that the Mikula was sold
to Captain Ogilvie.
EXCISE BILL
THIRD READING

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, Bill
123, an Act to amend the Excise Act, 1934,
was read the third time, and passed.
TRANSPORT BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from Thursday, June
9, the adjourned debate on the motion for
the second reading of Bill 31, an Act to
establish a Board of Transport Commissioners
for Canada, with authority in respect of
transport by railways, ships and aircraft.
Hon. Mr. DUFF.

minds back to the humdrum affairs of a
Transport Bill; so I shall not delay the House
at any great length.
Last year the members of this House heid
a very long investigation into the Transport
Bill. True, the Bill of that time covered
many things that are not covered by the
present measure. As there will be opportunity
to deal with details later, I will not discuss
them now. This Bill deals with transport by
air, by road, .by water and by rail. As to
transport by air I shall have nothing to say;
as to transport by road, I shall have very
little to say, because, as you will remember,
it was shown iast year that 98 per cent of
the road transport does not come under the
jurisdiction of this Parliament.
And there is no

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I said not, my dear sir.
But as far as this Bill is concerned, I am
interested on behalf of Western Canada in
the matter of lake shipping and in what are
termed "agreed charges."
First of all, I should like to inquire, who
asked for this legislation. It may be said
that the Governient has the right te bring
in whatever legislation it wishes; that it is
the judge of what the people want, and it can
present legislation to meet the desires of the
public. Well, I am unable to find in this
country any body of public opinion that
wants this legislation. After following the
investigation by the committee of the other
House I am of the opinion that, except for
the railways and their allied organizations,
there is no public support for this measure.
No one realizes more than I do the difficulties confroniting the railways. Honourable genthemen who are members of the
Special Railway Committee have heard the
story of those difficulties fro.m not only the
Canadian National, but also the Canadian
Pacifie. Furthermore, we have only to pick
up a daily paptr to read about these difficulties. I picked up a daily paper on Saturday morning and read that for the week
ending June 7, 1938, the gross revenues of
the Canadian Pacifie, as compared with the
corresponding week a year ago, were down
Il per cent, and those of the Canadian National were dcown 17 per cent. Anybody who
reads those figures will understand that obstacles confront the railways. But, I ask, who
comes first in this country, the people who
produce the goods. whether thev be primary
or secondary producers, or the people who

JUNE 13, 1938
transport those goods? Who should be sacrificed, if anybody must be sacrificed? I submit to this House that it ought not to be
the producers.
Some of my honourable friends, pointing
out that trucks and buses are taking business
away from the railways, will ask why we
should not take business away from trucks
and buses, which do not have as much expense of maintenance as a railroad and do
not have as many employees. But the fact
remains that we can no more hold back
modern methods of transportation than we
can stem the tide in the Bay of Fundy. We
must recognize what is economically best for
this country at large before we attempt to
improve the situation of any particular part
of the community. It 'cannot be said that
any man in public life in our day and generation came into power with a greater desire
to do good than did President Roosevelt.
And what did he do? He brought forward
certain legislation to improve conditions. But
as a result of that legislation the country is
in a worse condition than it was before. Let
us be sure, therefore, when we st-art to
amend our transportation law in this country,
that we are not going to make conditions
worse than they are now.
I find that boards of trade, chambers of
commerce, the Canadian Manufacturers' Association-in fact, public bodies generally,
from one end of the country to the otherare united in their opposition to this legislation. Here is a Winnipeg newspaper which
is opposed to it; here are several Ontario
newspapers which are opposed ta it; here are
newspapers
from
Saskatchewan,
British
Columbia and New Brunswick which are opposed to it. In virtually every -part of
Canada the press is against this legislation. I
have yet to hear of any organized body of
public opinion which is in favour of it.
If you are a member of a manufacturing,
buying or importing organization, you have
in your employ men whose business it is to
advise you on matters of transportation.
Just the other day the man in charge of
transport for the third largest user of transport in Canada told me that they were
strongly opposed to this Bill.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Who are they?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I do not think it is
necessary to name them. I will give the
name to my honourable friend if he wants it.
Now, I have spoken of the Manufacturers'
Association and the like, but what about the
farmers? The farmers do not understand this
legislation or what it will do, and will not
understand it until it is put into effect. What
effect will this Bill have on the farmers of
51958-,31

483

Western Canada, whose product has to come
down the lakes? While the Bill does not
deal directly with grain rates, it deals with
the licensing of the ships that will carry the
grain; and licences will be granted only to
the ships that are thought to be necessary
to carry that trade. The result will be that
the rate will go up, and the Western farmers
will have to pay the increase; and, as you
know, the grain prices are fixed in the world
market. For that reason we in the Western
Provinces, especially in the three Prairie Provinces, are absolutely opposed to this legislation.
Take the Winnipeg Free Press for instance.
I say without fear of contradiction that the
Free Press is the best edited paper in Canada to-day. I seldom agree with it politically,
but I must acknowledge the ability of its editor
to "put across" the story of what he believes
to be in the interest of Canada. He admits,
somewhat grudgingly, perhaps, that if this
legislation does what it is intended to do, it
will inarease the cost of transport to the
primary producers of Western Canada.
I come now to agreed charges. We in Western Canada remember that prior to 1903 the
railways could give special rates. Do you
think the third largest user of freight in Canada could not make a deal with the railwaycompanies prior to 1903? They would say,
"We will switeh it to whichever railway gives
us the better rate." That kind of thing, which
went on in 1903 and previous years when
special agreements could be made, drove the
people of Western Canada to have for the
Canadian Pacific a bitter hatred, which is
deep-dyed in their hearts. Yet here is an
attempt to go back to the Laurier legislation
of 1903 and make secret agreements possible
again.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend says "secret agreements."
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Certainly I say "secret
agreements." I repeat that this kind of
agreement would be made in secret. I know
that it would be published for thirty days in
the Gazette, and other shippers could come
and demand the same rate under the same
conditions. But no two sets of conditions
are ever alike.
Hon. Mr. fORSEY: The rates are not
secret.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The agreements are
made in secret. I repeat that.
Hon. Mr. HORSEY: The rates are published.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: After they are made.
But they are made in secret.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Will the honourable gentleman permit me to ask him one
question?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: If my honourable friend
will wait, he will get his answer. Interruptions are not going to spoil my speech.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I am sorry. You
are perfectiy right. I have taken the same
position myself.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The agreement is secret
when made. It is afterwards published in the
Gazette for thirty days, and then it is confirmed. This is a thing to which we in
Canada should be absolutely opposed. I submit, honourable senators, that no two sets of
conditions can be exactly the same. Take for
instance the T. Eaton Company, one of our
largest importers in Western Canada. It comes
to the Canadian Pacifie and says, "We will give
you all our business if you will quote us a
special rate." Then they work out a special
rate. Across the street from Eaton's is the
McCreary Company. That firm does not do
a hundredth part or perhaps even a thousandth
part of the business that the Eaton Company
does, and, because tIe -aie

ondilioins do

ot

exist with respect to the two companies,
the McCreary Company could nat get the
low rate available ta its big competitor. I
asked the transport officer of the third largest
shipper in Canada: "Why do you oppose
this provision for agreed charges? Could you
not get the same rate as other firms?" And
the answer was: "No, because our business
is of a peculiar nature. It is all over Canada,
and we are not quoted rates as low as vould
be quoted to our competitor whose conditions
are different."
I have gone through this Bill very carefully, and I tbhink there are two underlying
puriposes in it: the first is to give the rail-

roads a larger share of the transportation
business; the second is to increase the freight
rates chargeable by boats operating on the
Great Lakes, especially from Fort William
and Port Arthur eastward. Now, it is impossible for the railroads ta get a larger
share of L.C.L. freight without causing rates
to go up. You need only read the argument
made before the committee of the other
House by Mr. Duncan, of Toronto, to see
clearly that if the railroads had all the L.C.L.
business and charged their present rates they
could not carry it at a profit. And if they
raised their rates, producers or dealers would
combine and operate their own transportation
facilities. I know of farmers in Manitoba
who

own

their

trucks, and

fron

one

year

to the other they do nat pay five cents for
Hon.

Mr. HAIG

the shipment of freight other than grain,
whereas fifteen years ago the same farmers
were paying out hundreds of dollars in freiglit
to the rail.roads. My honourable friend from
Manitou (Hon. Mr. Sharpe) knows what has
happened in the little town of Dariingford,
for instance, in his district. Two or three
truckers do all the local business there. Now,
if these truckers are driven out of business
by the railroads, the producers and dealers will
operate their own trucks. That would be the
only change.
It seems
tIo

me that tlhi- Bill would operate

in restraint of tiade. If the proposed legislation becomes effec tive, it wili increase the cost
of shipping grain from Western Canada to the
markets of the world. It will make transportation charges high er, and tlieriforce increause the cot of living to the consumer. If
it does not do that, it will be no good to
the railroads and the steamships; and if it
does do ih-at, it will injure the consumer.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is what the
comiteex
would imestigate.
lon. -Mr. HAIG: It is one of the most antiLiberal imiea-ures I ever heard about.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Is the honourable member an authority on that?
lon. Mr. HAIG I know that the practice
of the Senate is to send mcasures of this kind
to a committee where delegations may be
heard. I am a comparative newcomer here
and an iot going to protest against that practice, but if I had my way I would throw the
Bill out and not send it to a committee at
all. I do not see how any delegations can
change the principles underlying the Bill. We
listened to delegations last year, for week
after week. when we had the first Transport
Bill before us, and we rejected that Bill. Here
is a similar measure before us this session.
It too bas been opposed, just as the first Bill
was, by manufacturers, producers and others.
However, I shall not vote against sending this
measure to committee.
May I read one or two letters that I have
received from Western Canada? Here is one
from the Canadian Manufacturers' Association
at Winnipeg:
Dear "J. T.,"
We are advised that the Transport Bill is
to be cnsidered by the Railway Commîîuittee of

JUNE 13, 1938
As a senator from Manitoba I am of course
deeply concerned about the welfare of our
largest industry, which is farming. I want to
read to honourable senators the following
letter which has come to me from The Winnipeg Grain Exchange:
Hon. J. T. Haig,
The Senate,
Ottawa, Ontario.
Dear Sir,
We understand from press despatches that
the Transport Bill will be introduced in the
House of Commons in the near future. The
despatches, however, conflict as to whether grain
vessels and grain freight rates on the Great
Lakes will come within the scope of the Bill.
Your knowledge of Western conditions will
doubtless bring home to you cogent reasons why
lake grain vessels and freights should not be
brought within the provisions of the Bill. The
Council of the Exchange bas considered the
matter very fully and we enclose argument
giving reasons why grain vessels and freights
should be excluded.
Inasmuch as this is a matter of great importance to the producers of Western Canada,
we have addressed a letter of protest to the
Hon. C. D. Howe, Minister of Transport, against
the inclusion of lake grain vessels and grein
freight rates within the scope of the Bill, and
we sincerely trust that you will lend your
support thereto.
Yours truly,
H. Gauer,
President.
TIhe rates are outside this Bill, but the
vessels are in, and these control the rates.
I have a number of other letters here from
trade associations in Manitoba. I also have
a copy of one from the Canadian Industrial
Traflic League of Ontario. It is long, but with
your permission I will read it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
clusions.

Read the con-

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Ap.parently my honourable friend has read the letter.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Hand it in.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: If that is agreeable, I
am quite willing to have it appear on Hansard
without having been read. But I should like
to read one portion of it. These people say:
This Bill we consider to be most objectionable
to the shipping public because:
1. It is essentially discriminatory.
2. It provides the medium whereby the inherent advantages of the various forms of
transportation may be set aside in favour of
one particular form.
3. It places the small shipper at a distinct
disadvantage with the large shipper.
4. It enables the railroad systems to annihilate
ail other forms of transportation, regulated or
otherwise.
5. It arbitrarily disrupts and disturbs the
present rate-making procedure which has stood
the test of time for 34 years.

485

6. It means an unnecessary return to private
deals, ail of which are harmful in the extreme
and disruptive of confidence.
7. It will not aid the railroads out of their
financial difficulties, but will cause further inroads into the pockets of the taxpaying public.
(That part of the letter which was not read

is as follows:)

Rt. Hon. Arthur Meighen, K.C., P.C.
Re Transport Bill 31
Rt. Hon. Sir,Last year representatives of the Canadian
Industrial Traffic League appeared before the
Senate Committee on Bill B in opposition to
the regulation of intercoastal traffie and the
"agreed charge" section of Senate Bill B, and,
thanks to your leadership, the Bill was defeated
in the Senate, and for which the business life
of Canada is appreciative.
This year Transport Minister Howe bas introduced to the House of Commons Transport Bill
31, which again includes these most vicions
features that are of a decidedly mischievous and
objectionable character.
Our representatives appeared before the
House Committee on Railways, Canals and
Telegraphs along with the representatives of
a great many other business interests and trade
organizations throughout Canada, but in face
of an almost unanimous protest from the business life of Canada from ocean to ocean as
represented by these business and trade organizations, the Bill bas been reported to and
passed the House of Commons and evidently
sufficient pressure is being exerted to have
same become law with the pions hope that it
will be the means of solving the railways'
financial problem. We have yet to learn of
one large, influential trade or business organi.
zation that have expressed themselves as being
decidedly in favour of these "agreed charges,"
but in spite of what should have been a most
convincing expression of opinion in opposition
thereto on the part of those who have to pay
the charges and the costs of transportation,
the House of Commons bas passed the measure,
and that in face of the greatest protest we have
ever known being expressed by the business
life of Canada from ocean to ocean to the
House Committee against the Bill.
May we request your interest in the matter
again this year to the extent of having the
Bill amended by the elimination of the "regulation of intercoastal traffic between the Atlantic
and the Pacifie oceans via the Panama Canal
and vice versa," also the elimination of the
"agreed charge" section in its entirety.
Whilst the latter bas been greatly improved
over that contained in last year's Senate Bill B,
yet from practical (not theoretical) business
experience we can conceive of no good being
accomplished by baving same become law (even
if not taken advantage of), and will eventually
lead to ail manner of harmful practices being
used similar te those existing prior to 1904
and which have since been largely eliminated.
This Bill passed the House Committee by a
minority vote, 21 out of 60 members, and no
doubt the standpoint of political expediency
bas been influential in its passing the House
of Commons.
In other words the practical
business life of Canada who have to pay the
bills and the cost of transportation are not to
be listened to when business engineering

crucified on the cross of political expediencv.
There is no necessity for either the regulation

on Transport Bill 31.

I have other correspondence, al] expressing
opposition to this measure, froin Western interests and interests representative of Canada
as a whole. I repeat, honourable senators, that
I am convinced we should vote against this
Bill, but in view of the practice of sending
measures of this kind to a committee, I am
willing to vote to have it go so far. I am very
strongly opposed to this or any other kind of
legislation which would increase the cost of
getting our goods on the world markets. I
am aiso stronglv opposed to any system of
agreed charges made secretlv and I say again
that under the systern provided in this Bill
the rates would be made secretly, even though
they would be published in the Gazette afterwards for thirty doys. It seems clear to me
that, as I have already contended, it is not of
much use to tell a firn that it can get the same
rate as was given to its competitor if the
conditions with respect to the two firms are
the saine, for it will seldom happen that the
saine set of conditions will apply to competing
concerns.

WILLIAM
DUFF:
Honourable
senators, my opposition to any measure of
the kind we have before us did not begin as
recently as last year. Fifteen or twenty years
ago, when I was a member of another place,
I opposed a bill whose object was the bringing of ships on the Great Lakes under control
so that rates could be fixed. Whether or not
what I contendcd was effective I cannot say,
but the fact is that the bill was dropped.
I think I am standing on firm ground
when I sav [hat in opposing the present
measure I am doing so from a sense of duty.
What is the history of this proposed legislation? In all my experience I have never
seen a bill, whether introduced by the Government or a private member, receive such
treatmnti
as was given to the Transport Bill
of last year. The honourable leader of the
Hon.

Mr. HAIG.

Goverrnent in this House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) was, I presume, asked by his colleagues in the Government, or at least by
one of them, to introduce Bill B, an Act to
establish a Board of Transport Commissioners for Canada, with authority in respect
of transport by railways, ships, aircraft and
motor vehicles. It will be noticed that this
Bill referred not only to railways and ships,
but also to aircraft and motor vehicles. After
being given second reading here it was referred to the Railway Committee of the
Senate, which committee is made up of some
of the brightest minds in this House. There
it w.as given thorough consideration. As
honourable members know, it is a common
thing for committees to make slight changes
in bills coming before them, but neser to my
knowledge has a bill been given siih a keel
hauling as was given to the Transport Bill
last year. Honourable members who care
to look back at the record will find that the
moasure which was reported to the Senate
was entirely different from the one referred
to the committee.
Now, honourable members, I say that
there is somnething wrong when a bill is
drafted the way the Transport Bill of last
year was drafted. It seems to me tat
whoever was responsible for il. provisions-and
T know that was not my honourable friend
who leads this House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
-- was not familiar with conditions in this
country and did not understand the prevailing
feeling with regard to all kinds of transport,
and to water transport in particular. Honourable inenhers will recall the widespread opposition there was to the measure immediately
after its introduction. As the honourable
junior senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Haig) lias pointed out, protests came in from
all over the country. And what happened
to it in the Senate committee? It would
take too long to go through the records in
detail, but I will refer to one or two points
in particular. The honourable junior senator
from Winnipeg has already reminded the
House that the people of the West are opposed to the regulation of rates on the Great
Lakes by the Board of Transport Commissioners-tlie proposed new name for the Railway Board-for it was feared this would cause
an increase in the rates on grain. To show
honourable ienmbers tbat I am not taking a
selfish or narrow viewpoint in the matter, I
would reimind them that when a delegation
from the Maritime Provinces appeared before the Senate committee Last -ear and spoke
against certain features of the Transport Bill,
I dil no'
s, "So long as the Maritime
Provinces aie satisfied. I do not care what

JUNE 13, 1938
happens to the rest of Canada." No. I felt
that if the measure were passed it would be
harmful to Canada as a whole, and therefore I opposed it. And I am opposing the
present Bill for the very same reason.
In the Bill of last year there was a clause
with regard to the movement of freight by
ships, not only on the Great Lakes, but also
in every other part of Canada. It providedI am not quoting the exact language-that
every freight and passenger boat of over
ten tons on the Nova Scotia coast, for instance, would have to get a licence, and its
owner could not agree with a shipper to
carry goods for a certain rate until the rate
had been approved by the Transport Commissioners at Ottawa. The people of Nova
Scotia objected to that, and the Senate
committee, in its judgment-and in my opinion
it was good judgment-said it would be a
foolish thing to put all the little schooners
and steamers on our Atlantic coast under such
a bill. So that clause was stricken out. As I
said in my remarks here the other night, the
Minister of Transport retreated from the front
line trenches last year, not only with regard
to this feature affecting the small vessels of
Nova Scotia, but all along the line.
This Bill, which was printed after the
Senate committee made its report, is, as I
said a moment ago, in many particulars a
very different Bill. I do not want to ask
too much of honourable senators, but I suggest that before you consider this Bill in
committee you read the four amended bills
to which I have referred, and which give
the whole history of the present Bill and show
how time after time the Minister retreated
from the position he took in the first place.
If we had passed the first Bill, what would
the people of this country who have tried to
do business in a proper manner have thought
of us legislators?
But should
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the honourable gentleman not address his
remarks to the Bill before us? The Bill of
last session was amended, and further amended, and then rejected by the Senate. Of
course the Minister had to note the reasons
given and arguments advanced for the position
taken by this Chamber.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I appreciate my honourable friend is drawing my attention to a very
technical point. In dealing with this Bill today, I submit, we are entitled to go back
not only to last year, but a great deal farther,
in order to arrive at a proper conclusion on
the present Bill. I am sure my honourable
friend, if he were not in the delicate position
in which he finds himself. would not support
the Bill any more than I would support it.

487

I have a perfect right to discuss this measure
from all angles and from the past, in order to
show that this is not along the lines of the
Bill which the Minister of Transport desired
to have enacted last year.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But what does
it matter?
Hon. Mr. DUFF: It shows inconsistency,
or worse.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: If my honourable friend
from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) does not
object, I would say it shows the Minister's
interest in the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
His public
interest.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I did not say what interest it was. I said his interest. Surely
there is no objection to that.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Was the honourable member from Lunenburg interested in
the sale of the vessel?
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Absolutely; acting for
Captain Ogilvie; and I admit it. I have not
a guilty conscience.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:
Minister of Transport.

Hon. Mr. DUFF: How do you know?
"Speak for yourself, John," as Priscilla said.
Now, then, my honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) has referred to the fact
that we are considering a Bill introduced this
session. That is quite true. And what is
that Bill? As I said a moment ago, it is not
in the same terms as the Bill of last session.
It has not as much clothes as the old Bill;
it has only a bathing suit. To change the
metaphor, most of the teeth are taken out
of the present Bill, but not those having to do
with water transportation on the Great
Lakes and railway transportation. I can
understand the Minister's interest in water
transportation on the Great Lakes, and also
in railway transportation. We must not
forget that the Minister has lived for many
years on the Great Lakes-a body of water
that be decreed to be salt water.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
interested in those matters.

But we are al

Hon. Mr. DUFF: I hope nobody will get
mad if I say that all are interested. Of
course, we are all interested. But the Minister was interested because he knew the conditions on the Great Lakes with regard to
shipping, and when lie was honoured by

SENATE
being- made Minister of railways and marine
and a dozen other thing-s, he realized the
shocking conditions in which the railways
were. I cari understand why hie was interested.
And surely it does nn harma for me or anybody else te speak of the Minister's interest
in those matters. But why ail the interest?
As 1 have said, another Bill was introduced
in the House of Commons this year. It is
now before us for second reading, but if contains no reference to the shipping nf Nova
Scotia and the other Maritime Provinces.
Strange to say, too, Part IV of last year's
Bill. with regard to highways, does not appear
in the presenit Bill. Is it any wonder that
the other day I said this Bill had been
emasculated?

Hon. Mr. DUFF: I arn sorry I have flot

answer my honourable friend right now. I
objected to Part IV being left in last year's
Bill, and I arn delighted that it is taken out
of the present Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hon. Mr. DUFF: I am delighted that the

in the Maritime Provinces.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

What does it

Hon. Mr. DUFE: Oh, if matters a great
deal in the eyes of my honourable friend,
because he is a defender of the faith to-night.
He is defending the Minister here.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am not. I am
asking my honourable friend to, remember
that the Senate is now dealing with a Bill
which bas come fromn the Commons. Why
shoul he dicus. the faut that a cornrittee
of the other House made amendments to the
Hon.

Mr. DUFF.

Bill? If my honourable friend says there
were amendments made which are unsatisfactory to him, well and gond; let him discuss
those amendments. But what does if matter
te the Senate that the Bill was amended by
a cormittee of the otlwr Houns?
s rny
honourable friend satisfied with the Bill which
is now before us? If not, we should know it.
Hon. Mr. DUFF:
I arn going to tell
my honourable fricnd pretty soon what I
think ni the Bill. I say the fact that those
clauses and chapters werc eut out of the
present Bill proves conclusively that whoever drafted the Bill and endeax ourcd f0
force it on the people of this country did
ot know business conditions. My honourable friend ni course has tricd to divert my
attention by asking, "Are you opposed to
Part IV being eut out?" No, I arn nu more
opposed f0 Part IV being eut out than I arn
f0 the committee of the other Huse cutting
out a number of other clauses.
Wlhat did that committee eut out? A delegation carne up frorn the Maritime Provinces
and said to that very sensible committee,
"This is a terrible thing su far as shipping
between the Maritime Provinces and the
provinces ni Ontario andi Quehec is conceined."
Witlîout going into d
IraY stiste thev
1aîs
showed the committee conclusively if was a
blunder to have a clause in the Bill providîng
that ships from the Maritime Provinces could
not corne any further than Father Point, on
the St. Lawrence riv'er. The comrnittee in its
wisdomn deleted the clause with reference to,
the Maritime Provinces. But I do not behieve
in playing, favourites. I remember rny mother
saying to me once xvhen I wanted a bigger
appie than rny brothers and sisters: "There
is o favouritismn here. There are no stephairros in rny farnily. You will get the saine
size of apple as your brothers and sisters?"
I contend this Parliameot has nu right to
treat Nova Scofia, Prince Edward Islandà and
Newv Brunswick differently from British Columabia. yet under f his Bill as amended, not
bv the Minister of Transport or by the Cabiiiet-of which rny honourable friend is a
very influential member-but by a committee in another place, British Columbia ships
would he discriminated against. That coinrnittee said. "It is not fair ot to allow

ports? I submit that if it is just and equitable that the clause with regard to the
shipping of the Maritime Provinces should be
eut out, it is also just and equitable that
Canadian vessels from the Pacifie coast should
receive similar treatment. That is, a vessel,
say, loading lumber in a British Columbia
port should be allowed to come through the
Panama Canal and up the coast to the St.
Lawrence and land its cargo in Toronto or at
any other Canadian port on the Great Lakes.
Do honourable members appreciate what
is going to happen if British Columbia shipping is not treated the same as shipping from
our Atlantic ports? Unless the Bill is defeated
-as I hope it will be-British Columbia will
lose its lumber trade and Seattle will get it.
As a Nova Scotian I will not stand in my
place in Parliament with folded arms and
say: "Thank God, they have excepted Nova
Scotia vessels from the operation of the Bill.
What do I care what happens to vessels
from British Columbia or any other part of
Canada?"
As I have already stated, honourable members, this Bill does not contain a single word
about highway traffic. The whole chapter in
the former Bill dealing with that traffic is
gone out slick and clean.
What is the reason for this Bill? As my
honourable friend the junior member from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) said. "Who asked
for it?" Never before was a Bill introduced
either in this House or in the Commons without publie opinion demanding it. Indeed,
sometimes it is hard to get governments to
introduce legislation after repeated public
demands for it year by year. Who asked
for this legislation? My honourable friend
says our boards of trade, our chambers of
commerce, our shipping interests, our business
men, our farmers, even our railways, did
not ask for it. Honourable members know
as well as I do that the only persons who
appeared before the committee of the other
House or in any other place in support of the
Bill were the representatives of the railways.
Of course, we ail know that when objection
was made to the Bill we were assured that
freight and passenger rates would not be
higher. But, I contend, the only reason for
this Bill is to increase railway rates. There
can be no other reason.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: There can be no other
reason than to increase the freight rates both
on the railways and on certain ships on the
Great Lakes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will my honourable friend allow me?
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Sure.

48Y

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The very basis
of agreed charges is a reduction of rates.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: My honourable friend
cannot get away from the argument with that
sophistry. I have had to do business with
railways myself, and I have also had a little
to do with ships.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: A great deal.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: No, just a little.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Too much.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Yes. I never got seasick anyway. As I say, I have had something
to do both with railways and shipping, and
I tell my honourable friend that until Si
Wilfrid Laurier introduced the legislation
which is now known as the Railway Act, whenever a little steamer came into competition
with the railways, the railways eut their rates,
not 10 or 20 per cent, but 50 and even 100
per cent, until they drove that little steamer
off the route. As my honourable friend from
Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner) knows, this
happened to ships plying from Halifax to
Bridgewater or from Halifax to Yarmouth in
the old days. Directly that water competition was stifled what happened to the railway rates? They went sky-high. Oh, yes, it
is ail very well to say sanctimoniously: "We
are not going to increase the rates. Agreed
charges will cut the rates." Yes, in order
that the railways may get their own way to
increase them later on. I do not blame the
railways at all-if they can get away with it.
This Bill interferes with shipping. The
Parliament of Canada should not interfere
with the shipping rates which our ship-owners
charge to merchants and others for handling
their goods. My honourable friend from
Cardigan (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), who has
been in the shipping business, knows that on
some trips you have to take a loss. When
there is plenty of tonnage, and yoù are eager
to get a cargo, you will take it at a low
rate; but next year perhaps conditions will
be reversed and rates will get back to a
profitable basis. I say the Government has no
right to interfere with the shipping interests
of this country, which are in an entirely different position from the railways. It may be
.urged that some years ago a Grit Government appointed a Railway Commission to
regulate railway rates. True. But you and I
own the railways. We have paid for every
railway in this country with money and with
sweat. Look at the money we put into the
Canadian Northern, the Grand Trunk Pacifie,
the Canadian Pacifie, the Intercolonial, the
Halifax and Southwestern, the Dominion
Atlantic. To ail these railways we gave money
and land-made grants of every kind. Conse-

490

SENATE

quently we had a right to say to the railways,
"We are going to appoint a commission to
regulate your rates."
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: The Railway Board.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Yes. But the shipping
business is on an entirely different footing.
Ships are private property-except the Canadian National steamships, which I will net
discuss at the moment. Our ships on the
Great Lakes, on the St. Lawrence, on the
Pacifie coast and on the Atlantic coast are al]
privately owned and operated. Therefore no
legislature, I do net care whether it be this
Parliament or any other, should say to those
who have invested their capital in shipping
and taken their chance of losing or making
money, "We are going to appoint a board in
Ottawa to which every Canadian ship-owner
must submit his rates for approval." I say it
is none of this Parliament's business to pass
legislation of that character. The matter is
entirely between the ship-owner and the shipper of the goods. We have too much paternalism in this country. Why, a person las to
keep taking out licences te tIo this and that,
until he hard]v knows where he stands. It is
time we put a stop to this and allowed business
to he carried on in a proper manner.
What did I hear with regard to the
present depression when I was in the
United States a fortnight ago?
Every
business man I spoke to had the same answer:
"If the Government would only let us
alone, if we did net have all these regulatiens requiring us to go to some board or
official before we can move any goods, we
should get along very much better.
The
sooner the Go-ernmeent minds its own business and attends to the functions for which
it was intended, the better it will be for
the great United States of Anerica." Such is
our position bere so far as shipping is concerned. and the Government should net
attempt to say what a ship-owner should
charge for a cargo.
I repeat, shipping is entirely different from
the railways. Under this Bill it is proposed to
allow the railways to make what are called
agreed charges; that is, special rates. Those
rates must be submitted to the Board of
Transport Commissioners here for approval.
They may say, "Oh, no, we will net agree
to thoe rates." What will be the result if,
after sbipping one load of goods, you cannot
ship the other five? It will mean that the
man with whom you made the bargain will
have an action against you.
Under this law you do net know exactly
what is going to happen in the shipping
trade. I said a moment ago that those who
introduced the Transport Bill last year had
Hon. Mr. DUFF.

this year retreated from the ground they
previously took. Perhaps I shall be pardoned
if I say that as a sop to the Western farmers they eut out, in the committee in the
other Hoise, the clause of the Bill governing
grain rates. My ionourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) may ask me, "Don't you want
that cut out?" Certainly I do. But in view
of the fact that a committee of Parliament
eut out that clause, the highway clause, and
the Maritime clause, I say the whole Bill
should be thrown out and that the people
should be allowed to carry on business in
their own way.
Not only is this Bill attempting a regimentation of the people of this country in
such a way as to interfere with trade in the
matter of freight rates, shipping, etc., but it
is attempting to drive the trade of this
country to foreign ports. It proposes to establish a Board of Transport Commissioners.
Not long ago the Department of Transport
set up in the city of Ottawa a board known
as the Central Harbours Board. This board
is absolutely unnecessary, and is nothing
more nor less than a fifth wiel to a wagon,
but the people of this country, the shippers,
whether they are in Winnipeg, Vancouver,
Halifax or Saint John, have to pay through
the nose. What has happened under the
regulations of the Departmsent of Transport
with respect te harbours is going to happen
under this Bill. Althoughi every harbour of
any importance iad a harbour board of its
own, this central organization was set up. Has
it saved any money? Not at all. It bas raised
the harbour dues-the top wharfage and the
side wharfage-not 10 per cent, not 50 per cent,
net 100 per cent. Three or four months aLo it
set a schedule increasing the fees 500 or 600
per cent. The result was that the owners of
ships that had been calling at Halifax said,
"We are net going to call there any more,"
and the ship-owners and the business men
of Montreal and other ports protested until
the Minister had to crawl and reduce the
rate. But even yet the dues are a hundred
per cent more than they were two years ago.
My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) said a moment ago that the railways were net going to raise their rates.
What notification did they send out to the
shippers a fortnight ago? They said, "In
the past we have absorbed the top wharfage
at Montreal. Halifax. Saint John and Vancouver. but after the lst of July you will
have to pay it."
An

lon. SENATOR:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. DUFF: That means, in my opinhonourable senators. that the people of
Canada, particularly those of the West and

ion,

JUNE 13, 1938
of Ontario, are going to send their goods not
to Montreal, Saint John and Halifax, but to
Portland, Boston and New York, where there
are no such excessive charges.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: That is what this Bill
means.
There is only one reason why this Bill
was ever introduced. When the Minister
came into office he realized that there was a
deficit of $60,000,000 a year, or so, on the
Canadian National Railways. He came into
office without having earned his way from
the fo'c'sle to the quarter-deck of Parliament,
as some of us have done. He came in as a
new man. He was amazed to find what conditions were, and without thinking of the
general good of the public of Canada he had
the Bill introduced in the Senate last year
in order to try to regulate the rates on the
railways, on the lakes and on the highways.
Who is to blame because there are so many
trucks on the highways to-day? It is the railway officials. If they had been a jump ahead
of themselves, as they should have been,
the railways could have had most of the
truck and bus business. But the officials of
both railways, not only of the Canadian
National, but also of the Canadian Pacific,
sat down in their offices and allowed the
truckers to purchase trucks and draw the
freight, and they let the buses take the
passenrer traffic away from them. And now
the Minister is going to crucify the general
public of Canada to try to make up for the
mistakes of the railway officials. I say that
in the interest of the people as a whole this
Bill is not fair; it is not good legislation;
and one reason why I am against it is that in
my opinion it is not Liberal legislation. It
is real old Tory legislation of four hundred
years ago.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Well, then, it is not
Conservative legislation. It is all bad, and
I cannot understand why it is introduced into
Parliament at this time. It is not right
that the people of the country should be
hamstrung by legislation of this kind. Whether
you are a shipper of potatoes, of fish, or of
anything else, it is not right that you should
have to telegraph or telephone to Ottawa to
get a rate before you ship, or that, if you ship
without doing that, the rate may be cancelled
by the board. I say the people of this
country should be allowed to do their own
business in their own way. They should be
permitted to make their own arrangements
with the shipping companies, the railway

491

companies or anybody else, so that business
may flow with the least possible obstruction,
whether it be by way of top wharfage, side
wharfage, or anything else.
I opposed the legislation of last year, and
I oppose the legislation now before us. I do
so because the people in the Prairie Provinces
and British Columbia are not being treated
like the people in Nova Scotia. It is not
enough that we in the East should be left
out of the Bill. This exemption does not
satisfy me. I am not built that way. I say
every part of Canada should be treated equally,
and the legislation should be for Canada
as a whole. I regret that it is necessary for
me to take this stand. Nevertheless, I fl
that it is my duty to oppose the Bill, and I
intend to do so to the utmost, in spite of
what has been said, and the inferences and
insinuations about me in relation to another
matter. That is the smallest thing I ever
heard of. My record of forty years in
public life shows whether I am small and
mean and narrow or not; it shows whether
I have worked for the, best interest of the
country or have tried to advance my own
selfish ends in connection with this or any
other legislation brought before the Parliament of Canada.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I simply desire
to say one word concerning this Bill. The
Bill is divided into five parts, the most important of which relates to agreed charges.
This subject, which has been referred to by
my honourable friend from Lunenburg (Hon.
Mr. Duff) and by the honourable the junior
senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig), will
be examined into minutely in committee. In
the meantime I may say that in Great Britain
the principle of agreed charges has been
accepted, and the railways have been authorized to make them. There is no constitutional difficulty there such as we have in
Canada, and I understand the railways are
allowed to compete with the truckers. In
Canada, on the other hand, while the trucks
are unregulated, the railways are absolutely
shackled. They see their freight leaving them,
to be transported by road. This is a matter
of considerable importance to Canada. We
all know what the situation is with respect to
our railways.
My honourable friend from Lunenburg (Hon.
Mr. Duff) says this is the railways' own fault
-that they have not looked ahead; but we
must take conditions as we find them. It
may be that the Bill can be amended. I am
sure the Government would welcome amendments if they would improve the Bill. My

honourable friend compares the Bill with the

SENATE
one of last year, and fights with that shadow.
This Bill has bettered conditions in the Maritimes, as my honourable friend admits, though
ho claims British Columbia should receive
similar treatment. This is something for the
committee to decide.
I could very easily extend these few remarks,
but I think we should send the Bill to conmittee, and perhaps discuss it further on the
third reading. I move the second reading of
the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Hbnourable senators, at this point I should like
to ask a question of the honourable leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand). I
have not given him notice of the question,
and while I should be glad to have an
answer to-day, I shall of course find no fault
if it does not come until to-morrow.
I have received information to the effect
that within recent months the British Government bas made a request to the Government of Canada for permission to establish,
wholly at the expense of the British Government, a training school in Canada for flyers.
One can understand that on account of the
large open spaces such a location might be
desirable for the purpose of suhh training.
The request, I am advised, bas been made on
two -occasions and refused by the Government of Canada. I would ask whether the
information bas any truth in it, and, if so,
why the request is refused.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: I am quite
ready to confess to my right honourable
friend that for several reaîsons I cannot at
this
moment
answer
his
question. He
occupied this position for a number of years
and was sometimes unable to attend Council,
so much was he engrossed with the work of
the Senate and of its committees.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am in the

w tînic itida as foliens:

JUNE 14, 1938
"285. The Governor in Council may, from time
to time, and as occasion requires, make such
regulations as to him seem meet, with respect
to goods conveyed directly through the Canadian canals or otherwise, by land or inland
navigation, or in or on railway cars, from one
part of the frontier line between Canada and
the United States to another, without any
intention of unlading such goods in Canada;
and he may cause such bonds or security to be
given, or such precautions to be taken, at the
expense of the owner or person in charge of
such goods, whether by placing officers on board
any such vessel, railway car or carriage, or
otherwise, as to him seems meet."
By various Orders in Council passed since
March, 1883, which have been consolidated in
Order in Council (P.C. 27/1108) dated May 15,
1937, it is provided that"Sec. 19. Each railway company, before being
permitted to manifest goods in bond, shall enter
into a general bond to be duly executed in the
penal sum of eighty thousand dollars, conditional
for the due and faithful production at the
respective ports of destination in Canada of all
packages passing over such road under manifest,
and for the general compliance with the
Customs laws and regulations governing such
traffic.
"Sec. 20. All railway companies shall provide
secure and commodious sufferance warehouses
and other necessary premises in connection with
their stations at every Customs port or outport, for landing, storing, transferring, delivering and forwarding bonded goods; also suitable
office accommodation, with fuel and light, for
the officers of Customs appointed to attend such
stations. All such premises shall be made
secure to the satisfaction of the collector or
other proper officer of Customs."
Provision is made for reports at the frontier
port of arrival, for the checking of carloads on
arrival, for the preparation and cancellation of
manifests issued upon interior ports, for the
sealing of the merchandise en route, for its
storage pending Customs entry in any one of
hundreds of sufferance warehouses at interior
points built and maintained by the bonded
carrier, as well as for the marking, numbering
or other means of describing imported packages.
From the foregoing it will be clear that an
expensive und elaborate system has been evolved
through the years, the primary object of which
is to protect the revenue and ensure that all
imported goods which reach the frontier are
not permitted to pass beyond that point until
every possible precaution has been taken to sec
that those goods will reach their destination,
and in the same condition.
The Department objects to the movement of
"in bond" goods by motor truck, particularly
in view of (a) the lack of facilities for handling
such goods, both at frontier ports and at
destination; (b) the utter absence of control
of the movement of the transporting vehicle;
(c) the insecurity of the vehicle itself, and
(d) the replacement of the present unified and
stable system of transport by one in which
the participants would be diversified and keen
competitors whose numbers would be constantly
changing as a result of failures, mergers,
divisions and additions.
If the transportation of "in bond" goods were
to be placed in the hands of motor truck concerns, each one would insist upon the erection
of its own sufferance warehouse both at the
frontier and at interior ports. At ports of

495

entry like St. Stephen, N.B., Windsor, Niagara
Falls, Fort Erie, Sarnia, Ont., Emerson, Man.,
and Pacifie Highway, B.C., it is not difficult
to visualize the possible number of separate
sufferance warehouses, the operations of which
the Department would have to supervise. Again,
at interior ports like Toronto, Montreal,
Hamilton, Winnipeg and many others, a similar
situation would develop, involving an expensive
staff expansion. None of these concerns have
any of these facilities at the present time.
The movement of the present bonded carrier
is restricted to rail routes fenced in and under
the complete control of the operating company
so that the public has no access to the vehicle
while en route, and the vehicle cannot depart
from its prescribed run. Motor trucks use
public highways, can travel between two points
by any one of the number of routes available
and can be diverted at the will of the driver.
Railway cars are at all times under the direct
control of a trained, experienced and responsible
official of the company. Generally speaking,
motor trucks are operated, controlled and driven
by one person whose sole qualification for the
position may be the possession of a motor
vehicle operator's provincial licence.
Railway cars are all of substantial construction, of a weight and strength sufficient to
withstand long and strenuous service. Their
facilities for security and for sealing are well
known. Motor trucks can be similarly built,
but the general and almost universal tendency
is to construct lightly to save original cost and
avoid any weight which would add to the cost
of motive operation. At present many expedients are resorted to by way of protection
of the goods carried, from tarpaulins only to
enclosed jobs with or without doors. If the
Department had to administer the movement
of. "in bond" goods by truck, it would be
practically forced to definitely specify the particular protective type of body which would
be acceptable, and this would lead to impossible
situations involving provincial jurisdiction.
The present system embraces a unified control
with a stable system which affords every possible protection to the revenue. Motor truck
concerns are existent in great numbers, some
operating one truck and others many. The
number of bonded carriers would reach the
hundreds, and would be constantly changing due
to additions, mergers, failures, etc., as evidenced
by the changing records of these companies over
the past few years. There would always be
present the danger of including as a bonded
carrier motor vehicle concerns of very doubtful
financial responsibility.
It is further pointed out that while the
transportation of "in bond" goods is now under
the control of Canadian institutions, the transfer
of this movement to motor trucks would be
rapidly followed by the institution of international trucking concerns with head offices
outside of Canada operated by non-residents.
Summarized, the Department's objections to
accepting motor vehicles as bonded carriers are:
1. No provision in the existing regulations
for their acceptance.
2. If permitted, the administration difficulties
to be faced would very seriously hamper the
Department in performing its primary function
of protecting the revenue, doubtless with
attendant losses.
3. If permitted, the expense of difficult administration would be excessive, and would
involve an increase in staff which would be

496

SENATE

governed only by the number of additional
bonded carriers and sufferance warehouses
operated thereby.

4. The acceptance of the principle of transportation of goods "in bond" by mnotor truck
nerely transfers this operation, or a large
portion of

it,

from

the

economnical and

well

regulated and controiled purely Canadian system now in force, to one of udetermined expense, of doubtful security, and in which the
whole interest could not be inaintained as
Canadian.

P. L. Young,
General Executive Assistant.
That is the situation which confronts us, and
Sthink that in-bond transportation by truck
would afford so manv facilities for evasion
of custons duty as to justify the Senate in
not agreeing to the motion for second reading.
In m- view no suchi legislation should be
brought before this Parliament by private
Bill. Any change of policy in the Department
of National Revenue should emanate from the
Minister of that department. I think this is
the proper practice, and therefore, in order
to test tho opinion of the Senate, I move:
That this Bill be not now read a second time,
but this day six montis.
Hon. W. H. McGUIRE: Honourable senators, I have listened to the statement from
the solicitor of the Departnent of National
Revenue, but I failed to notice much reference to the law. He gave a long explanation
in regard to the management of the department and the possible inconveniences to be
expectedAn Hon. SENATOR: As usual.
Hon. Mr. McGUIRE: -if trucks were to
carry goods in bond all over Canada. But this
Bill bas nothing to do with any such proposal. The petitinoners desire to transfer goods
originating in the United States to and from
Fort Erie and Windsor; in other words, to
and from Buffalo and Detroit.
As my honourable friend from London
(Hon. Mr. Little) has said, the Act under
which the United States Transport Department functions bas reference to all the different modes of transportation. At present
United States carriers have the right to transport goods from Detroit to Buffalo over the
Michigan Central, which is an American railway; also by air. The purpose of this Bill is
to enable goods originating in the United
States to be transported by truck over the
same territory. I am told that, for instance,
goods coming to Buffalo by road are transported by truck south of Lake Erie to Detroit
and beyond, the distance by that. route being
greater by more than 100 miles. The parties
behind this Bill have asked Canadians to incorporate a company in Canada, to have that
lHoii. 'Mr. DANDURAND.

company manned by Canadians, to build their
trucks and other conveyances in Canada, and
to have the business done wholly by Canadians across Canada over this much shorter
route.
The reason why the Bill says, "Notwithstanding anything in the Customs Act," is
apparently that the Act was passed about 1883,
when there was no knowledge of trucks. I
have looked at that statute to-day and find
that the interpretation clause reads:
Vehicle means any cart, car, wagon, carriage,
barrow, sleigh or other conveyance of what
kinud soever, whether drawn or propelled by
steam, by animals, or by iand or other power,
and isnludes the larness or tackle of the
animals, and the fittings, furnishings and
appurtenances of the veicle.
I think that is broad enough to cover any sort
of vehicle.
In 1935 regulations werc passed which permitted what is proposed in this Bill-the transport of goods in bond by motor vehicle.
However, in 1936 the department changed its
mind and issued a memorandum which prevents goods in bond from being transported
by that means. Apparently the departmnent
considered itself quite capable of changing the
regulations even when there was no amendment of the Act, for it has donc so twice in
the last two years.
This Bill would authorize the incorporation
of an ordinary commercial company. The
only difference between it and the ordinary
corporation is that it is restricting itself to
the carrying of goods from Fort Erie to
Windsor. The company is to be subject to
the Departmient of National Revenue and will
give any bond the department asks for. The
department may appoint the sort of conveyance or truck to be used. The company is
to comply with the law of Canada and the
law of the province of Ontario. There is
nothing unusual about it, but apparently there
is some objection from the railway companies.
I do not think this Chamber has heard
much with regard to differences of opinion
between different kinds of carriers in the past,
but it looks as though it would in future,
because the people in Canada connected
with the trucking business are to-day more
numerous than those connected with the
railways, and, I submit, should be considered.
There is, I understand, no objection from
the province of Ontario to this business being
carried on over No. 3 highway.
I see no good reason why the Bill should
not go to tise Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours, the members
of whicb are now so well seized of all matters
concerning railways.
It can be discussed

JUNE 14, 1938
there, and those wbo are promoting it can be
heard.
There bas been a controversy in the different
towns and cities of southeru, Ontario with
regard to this matter. Apparently, once it
was mentioned the railway men objected.
It bas been explained, I arn told, to the
counicils of those different towns and cities,
and I understand that most of them have
rescinded the resolutions they passed in the
beginning. I tbink the motion should pass.
Riglit Hon. ARTHUJR MEIGIIEN: Honourable members, I ar n ot rising to support
the Bill, but, witb great reluctance, I must
oppose the amendment. The three memoranda wbich were read were, to one who heard
discussion on the subject for the first time,
rather overwhelming. The only suggestion I
would make regarding them is that the leader
of the Government sbouid see tbat officiais
preparing memoranda to be read in Parliament
make tbem brief and cogent, so that a quorum
may have a chance of remaining awake during
their entire presentation.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The course
which the bonourable leader of the Government takes in asking that on the motion for
second reading the Bill should be defeated by
means of the six months' hoist, instead of
being ailowed to go to, the appropriate
committee, is quite different from the course
usuaily pursued in this House. I question
=ny bonourable friend's decision.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will my right
honourable friend allow me to say that with
the information of two departmnents before
me I referred the matter to the Government,
and I bave received from the Government
a mandate to oppose the principle of this
iBill? This means that the Bill, if we decide
to send it to the House of Commons, wiil
meet witb the opposition flot only of the two
ministers who have responsibility in this
matter, but of the Cabinet itself. That does
flot preclude us from expressing an opinion,
1 know; but as the Bill manif estly cannot
pass this session-according to the information
I bave, it cannot pass the Government or the
Commons-I tbougbt perhaps the shorter
route would be to bave the Senate express
its opinion on the principle of the Bill on
the motion for second reading.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have no
doubt that the route would be shorter if the
Bill were defeated; but I bave great doubt
as to the wisdom of taking that route. I
would point out again that the duty of this
I{ouse is to seek witb ail the industry it can

497

apply, and ail the intelligence it possesses,
to determine on the merits the proper course
to take with any measure. It sbould not
be our endeavour to make the closest guess
we can as to what is the wiil of the
Government.
As to this Bill, 1 do not tbink I amn going
beyond the mark in saying that I arn predisposed against it. But I may be convinced.
It is not in-conceivable t-hat the Government
migbt be Àeonvinced, althougb, of course, the
process wouJd be a more arduous and d-ifficuit
one. I am in this positioli. The promoters
of the Bill sougbt to interview me with regard
to its m-erits. As is my usual practice, I
declinoed. I find it quite impossible to listen
twice to th~e story in relation to any measure.
I s'aid: "It is the practice of our House to
refer these anatters to committee. You wilîl
have a chance to tell your story then. I shahl
be present, if I jean, to bear it. But I
oannot bear it twice."
Hon. M.r. DANDURAND:

Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It does not
seem to me fair to say now, "We will net let
you go to the committee." Hýad 1 beard
representations from the-se people, I migbt
bave found them as persuasive as were the
tb*ree memoranda frorn dQpartmental officieis.
I do. not know. Even now, different stat-enients of fact are made. The honourable
leader of the Government, in quoting the
officiais.. decl.ared, that Canadian railways could
transport these gonds; that there were ample
fa.cilities. The mover of the second reading
said that if this Biil did not pass our railways would not and could not get the
traffie anyway. On that point there is a
dispute as to the facts.
The trucking
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
companies having that merchandise would go
a hundred miles farthier, around the south
side of Lake Erie, in ord-er to keep the
business in their own banda.
Rigbt Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If that is the
case, our railways would lose notbing- and
th-ere would be no need for the m-ourning
wbicb was so much in evidence in thie

memoranda.

There is clearl'y a contradiction

on the facts there.

I also <'aIl this to the attention of the
Government, because it migbt be more
rea.dily persuaded if reasons were adduced
from the standpoint I now mention. Does

pose in life, may do something for the great
objective of freeing the channels of trade and
pr-omoting a greater movement of goods between the two countries? The Bill may even
become entitled to immortality by serving
the sacred cause of economie appeasement.
It is all in that line. Still we find a Government which is disposed to faveur this
principle refusing te listen to the merits of
the measure as they might be explained
by its proponents before a committee.
The leader of the Government says, "I
think it is a soundc principle that bills affecting public poliy should in every case be
proposed by the Government and he made
Government

measures"

I

am

always

glad

te see reforn. but I an suspicions when it
comes so suddenlv.
Certainly reformation
never before came in a flood, as it has come
here. Why, even since we slept last, we have
had the Government not only permitting but
encouraging the introduction by a private
member of a bill affecting public policy
as respects clectricitv and the export of
power, thereby avoiding its own responsibility. But now, because this present Bill must
be defeated, we are told thmat all such
measures should be sponsored by the Governrment. for they affect policy. Reform is
good, but sincere and permanent reform
usually cones by slower processes. It does
net come in a flood like this. These considerations surely should be taken into mind
by the mrembers of the Administration.
I know the Railway Committee is crowded
with work, and I notice that the chairman
of that committee, maybe by reason of
fatigue, bas seconded the motion for the six
months' hoist. But Ihe Conmmittee on Private
Bills-for this is still a private Bill-could
hear representations on this measure. It would
net be at all improper that it should do se.
Then the promoters of the Bill would have
no complaint. If they have something to say
as to why the Bill should pass. they would
have a chance te say it, and the Senate would
have adhered to its tradition and its praclice. If what is said by the authors of the
memoranda which have been read is anywhere near the truth, the Bill will be lest
in committee. Sincerely and earnestly I ask
the leader of the Government to consider
again whether it would not be better to let
the Bill go to the Private Bills Committee
and meet its fate as others have done before.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK:
Honourable
senators, I have been anxiously waiting for
soineone to bring up one point in connection
with this Bill. I am told that within the
past two years one of the great automobile
companies in Canada undertook to do just
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

as is now proposed, by trucking automobiles
frorn Detroit to Winnipeg through the states
of Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin and
Minnesota, and that after a great deal of
discussion in Washington its request was turned down and refused by the United States.
I had expected that someone would raise that
point.
Now we come to this proposal to authorize
shipment of goods in bond from Detroit to
Buffalo, by truck, over our highway. I presume that one consequence of putting that
proposal into effect would be increased hazard
to life anti limb in the traffic that moves
daily over that highway, to say nothing of
the eneroachrment upon the present channels
of transportation. There are five splendidly
equipped railroads now operating between the
two points. and net one of them bas enough
business to handle. The Michigan Central,
which I suppose is one of the best railroads
on the Continent, is running through that
territory and carrying in bond, between the
Michigan peninsula and Fort Erie, 100 or
150 cars of freight every day. I do net think
that estimate is an exaggeration. The proponent of this Bill says that this traffic is not
now coming and cannot come te the railways
of Canada. Well, that is an argument that
one would expect from those who are supporting the Bill. But is it correct? Is it not
nonsense to say that the traffic cannot come
to the railways of Canada?
Hon. Mr. MeGUIRE: It does not.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
If the shippers
believe they can save money by shipping by
a route that is 104 miles shorter-for the distance between the two points is that much
shorter by bighway througb Canada than by
highway going around the lake in United
States territor-is it not iikelv tîat some of
the traffic now bandled by the railroads would
go to the trucking company, at a lower rate, in
the event of this Bill going through?
There is another point. I said once before
that I was somewhat suspicions. Am I unduly suspicious to-day when I bear it suggested that the Board of Trade of the city
of Kitchener is boosting this Bill? Is there
going to be, somewhere in these buses and
trucks, a secret place into which liquor can
be slipped en route between the two ports
of entry? I mean exactly what I am saying.
Why, Highway No. 3 does not go within
sixty miles of the city of Kitchener; so I
cannot see why the Board of Trade of that
city should be particularly interested, unless
there is to be an arrangement for meeting a
truck sometimes and through a secret panel
slipping in a little good Canadian whisky
for transportation to the United States.

JUNE 14, 1938
Furthermore, I think the whole Bill is
reprehensible and unfair. For some weeks now
we have been trying to devise ways and
means of helping the railroads. Will anyone
argue for one moment that this Bill contemplates any assistance to the railways of
Canada? If it contemplates anything, it is
further encroachment upon the facilities afforded by the five railways now operating between the port of Windsor and the port of
Fort Erie. It seems to me that if ever there
was a measure containing a principle which
should be disposed of in the Senate, and not
passed along to a committee with a haifhearted blessing, this is one. In my opinion
the six months' hoist is the measure of assistance that this Bill should receive.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Dandurand
was negative: contents, 19; non-contents, 35.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The question
now, honourable senators, is on the motion
for second reading.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: Honourable senators,
I should like -to say that, with the consent of
my seconder, I am quite prepared to aocept
the suggestion of the right honourable leader
on the other side (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
that the Bill be sent to the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. LITTLE moved that the Bill
be referred to the Standing Committee on
Miscellancous Private Bills.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Is a protest in
order? It seems to me that if ever there
was a billHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I think I was up
first. I would suggest to those who wish to
have the Bill sent to a committee, that, as
the session is so far advanced, there should
be a motion for the suspension of rule 119
so far as this Bill is concerned. That rule
says:
No committee on any private bill originating
in the Senate (of which notice is required to
be given) is to consider the same until after
one week's notice of the sitting of such committee has been posted up in the lobby; nor,
in the case of any such bill originating in the
House of Commons, until after twenty-four
hours' like notice.
The motion was agreed to.

NOTICE OF MOTION FOR SUSPENSION OF RULE

Hon. Mr. LITTLE: Honourable senators,
acting on the suggestion of the honourable
senator from De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain), I move that rule 119 of the Senate,
in so far as it relates to this particular Bill,

be suspended.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I respectfully
object.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The objection
of the honourable senator is well taken. In
the absence of notice, there must be unanimous consent to have the motion made.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: Then I shal move
to-morrow that rule 119 be suspended in so
far as it relates to this Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is a notice
for to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Why does the
mover not allow the Bill to stand for a
week? Then he would be in order.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The statement
will stand as a notice of motion.
LORD'S DAY BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON MESSAGE FROM
COMMONS

Hon. F. B. BLACK moved concurrence in
the report of the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce on a message from
the House of Commons disagreeing to the
amendment made by the Senate to Bill 13,
an Act ta amend the Lord's Day Act.
Hon. CHARLES BOURGEOIS: Honourable members, I do not intend in the least to
reopen the debate on this question and repeat
what has already been said. It is enough for
me to say that the events which have occurred
since this Bill was given third reading in
the Senate have confirmed in my mind the
opinion which I expressed at that time. When
the Bill was under consideration here and in
our Banking and Commerce Committee, the
other House was blamed for alleged neglect
to scrutinize the measure with the required
attention and care. It was pointed out in
particular that the debate on this important
question scarcely covered two pages of the
House of Commons Hansard. The present
circumstances are different. The House of
Commons had the benefit of the advice and
observations of the wise men of the Senate;
nevertheless it has maintained its first opinion.
In the ma-in it seems that the position taken
by it is the only logical one. The Lord's
Day Act has either been complied with or it

500

SENATE

has not. If it has been complied with, then
it is useless to amend it; but if there has
not been compliance, because the penalties
for infringement are net sufficiently severe,
let us mak them more severe. Above all,
special provisions should be enacted with a
view to reaching the real culprits, that is,
the men who are effect ively responsible for
giving orders to work on Sunday.
In conclusion, honourable senators, it seems
to me that it would be unwiSe for the Senate
to keep ,ignoring the will that bas been so
clearly expressed on two different occasions
by the elected represantatives of the people.
I am not opposed to adoption of the report,
but I think that before the session ends
steps should be taken for a joint conference
between the two Houses of Parliament with
a view to reaching a common understanding
as to this measure.
The motion was agreed to.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have not
had time nor opportunity to read the Bill
since it bas been amended, but I understand
the committee bas seen fit to strike out the
power ta enter homes. Mr. Gibson, the officer
of the department, stated there was no need
of such power. If there had been, of course,
the Government would, I suppose, have supported the authority to enter homes, padlock
or no padlock. But that is the only amendment made, is it not?

elsewhere.

Hon. Mr. MeRAE: May I suggest to the
honourable senator that he should go a step
further, and ascertain how many are residents
of British Columbia and how many are not?

that, with the leave of the House.

CONVENTION FOR SUPPRESSION OF
ILLICIT TRAFFIC IN DANGEROUS
DRUGS
RESOLUTION

OF' APPROVAL

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved:
That it be resolved:
That it is expedient that Parliament do
approve of the Convention of 1936 for the
Suppression of the Illicit Traffic in Dangerous
Drugs

(Geneva,

June 26,

1936),

signed

on

behalf of Canada by the plenipotentiary named
therein, and, that this House do approve of
the same.
He said: Honourable senators, I recently
laid on the Table of the Senate the Convention of 1936 for the Suppression of the
Illicit Traffic in Dangerous Drugs, signed at
Geneva on June 26, 1936.
This convention was drawn up by the
International Conference for the Suppression
of the Illicit Traffic in Dangerous Drugs, which
met in Geneva under the auspices of the
League of Nations. The objectives of the
conference were, first, to secure international
co-operation in stiffening penalties for
breaches of legislation implementing the
earlier opium conventions of 1912, 1925 and
1931, and, secondly, to strengthen police
efforts to repress the illicit traffie in narcotic
drugs.
The draft before the conference was the
result of two years' preparatory work initiated
by the Opium Advisory Committee. A first
draft had been submitted to all governments
signatory to the opium conventions in 1934.
Their observations and criticisms were taken
into consideration in the preparing of a revised
draft circulated in 1935. It was only after
this thorough canvass of the competent
national authorities had established the expediency of endeavouring to draw up an
international convention that the decision to
hold the special conference was taken.
The Canadian Government was represented
at this conference by Colonel C. H. L. Sharman, Chief of the Narcotics Division, Department of Pensions and National Health, who
is also the Canadian representative on the
Opium Advisory Committee and who had
taken an active part in the preparatory
discussions of the draft convention.
The convention requires ratification. It
will come into force ninety days after the
Secretary General of the League has received
the ratifications or accessions of ten states.
It has been signed on behalf of thirty-two
countries, and ratification has been completed,
up to date, by India, China and Belgium.
When Parliament has approved the convention
the Governor in Council will authorize ratifloation.

501

I do not know that I need say much more.
If honourable members wish to know the
main provisions of the convention I can
give them by quoting one or two of its
articles, but copies of the convention itself
have been distributed among honourable members, and that may, therefore, be unnecessary.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I suggest that
the motion stand as a notice until the House
has a chance to peruse the convention.
The right
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable gentleman might move the adjournment of the debate.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: All right.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
I welcome this opportunity of moving the
adjournment of the debate, because adjournment will enable the honourable gentleman
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand), on resumption of the
debate, to supply information which I think
is essential respecting the League of Nations.
I am entirely in accord with any international arrangement which will tend towards
restriction of traffic in narcotic drugs. Just
what this convention may mean in that regard
will depend on just how effective international
agreements are these days. In the past they
have not meant much, and perhaps might
better have been termed gentlemen's agreements. At all events, I take it that the convention now before us will constitute a standard for nations who respect their international agreements and whose views are in
accord with ours on this subject.
I do not want my approval of this effort
towards restricting traffic in narcotic drugs
to be construed as a change of my position
with respect to the League of Nations, as
stated to this House more than once. I
submit to honourable senators that the powers
of the League and its ability to serve this
country have, to say the least, been very
much curtailed, and that in these trying times,
when we need every dollar at home for the
relief and service of our own people, we should
reconsider the expensiveness of the League
to Canada. I am not up to the minute in
this regard, but, as I remember, our contribution to or assessment by the League of Nations
is about $300,000 a year. That is $1,000 every
working day. I should think that in addition
there would be the expense of the personnel,
the staff which Canada maintains at Geneva.
I would suggest to the honourable leader of
this House that when the debate is resumed
he should be prepared to tell us what was
the cost of the League to this country last
year, showing first our contribution, second the
expense of our staff, and third any other
expenses in connection with the League-

502

SENATE

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Delegates.
Hon. Mr. MeRAE: -including expenses of
delegates, and all that sort of thing, so that
we may have before us the sum total of what
the League of Nations effort is costing us.
If at the same time the honourable gentleman
could give us the naines of the nations which
are paying their dues, and of those which are
not, such information would be, I think, very
enlightening. The last investigation of this
matter showed that nany prominent nations
were not paying at all-a fact which would
rather lead one to believe that those who
do pay have to pay an unnecessarily high
assessment.
In view of the situation which prevails in
Canada to-day, I do not think we have
$300,000 or $400,000 a year to throw away in
maintaining our position in the League; and
I believe that if the League is to continue
to do only this minor work in which it is
now engaged, we should revamp our expenditure so that it may be in keeping with the
League's effort.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am not quite
sure that my honourable friend has adopted
the regular course in bringing that matter
before the House on such a motion as this,
which merely asks Parliament to approve of
the drug convention. Of course one may go
quite far afield at times. I would inform my
honourable friend that I think I brought
down the answers to most of his questions some
time ago, in response to the query of the
honourable gentleman from Rigaud (Hon.
Mr. Sauvé). I have no objection to looking
into the matter and seeing if it has not been
fully covered. I would point out that no
further procedure will follow upon the remarks of my honourable friend from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae), because there is
no motion before the House other than the
one I have moved.
But I think he rose to move adjournment
of the debate at the saine time as the right
honourable gentleman facing me (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen). Perhaps my honourable friend
from Vancouver lias said all that he wishes to
say in the matter and can now leave it to the
right honourable gentleman to move adjournment of the debate.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: I want to say just one
word on that aspect. The honourable leader
has presented a motion for approval of a
convention. I am perfectly frank in saying
that if the League of Nations is performing
no more useful service than dealing with two
or tiree of these subjects every year, I am
opposed to the motion, on the ground that
the League is costing Canada too much money.
Hoi

Mi.

MURAE.

I think my questions and my stand in this
moatter are entirely pertinent to the motion,
because approval of the motion would, in a
uway, signify acquiescence in the procedure
we are carrying on at Geneva, and I do not
believe that procedure is justified by the
results. That completes my remarks on this
question. honourable senators, and it is for
someone else to move adjournment of the
debate.
On motion of Right Hon. Mr. Meighen,
the debate was adjourned.

BRITISH GOVERNMENT AVIATION
TRAINING SCHOOL IN CANADA
ANSWER TO INQUIRY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, yesterday my riglht honourable friend
opposite (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) asked
me whether "the British Government has
made a request to the Government of Canada for permission to establish, wholly at the
expense of the British Government, a training sclool in Canada for flyers." And he
added:
The request, I am advised, has been made
on two occasions and refused by the Government of Canada. I would ask whether the
information lias any truth in it, and, if so,
why the request is refused.
My answer is that no such request has
been made to the Canadian Government.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Would
the honourable leader of the Government be
sufficiently non-technical with the House to
follow up his answer with some statement as
to just what the facts are in this connection?
It may be that exactly in the terms in which
I have asked the question there has not been
a request, but has there not been one on the
saime subject-matter and not very far unrelated.
to the very terms which I used? And if so,
what has been the reply? And what is the
policy of the Government of the day?

503

JUNE 15, 1938
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:- I can perhaps
enlarge upon the answer I have made. There
has been no request to the Federal Government either in the terms in which my right
honourable friend's question of yesterday was
couched or in those he has just used to obtain
further information. In a word, there has
been no request fromn the British Government
to the Canadian Government in any shape or
form concerning the matter mentioned in the
query of the right honourable gentleman.

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: I have
read this Bill and the discussion on it in the
other Huse. I need only say that I see no
objection whatever to the measure.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: WilI the
honourable leader of the Government say
there has been no inquiry of the Canadian
Government as to what its attitude would be
with respect to the subjeet-matter?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That I arn
unable to answer. I asked the department,
"Has any request been made by the British
Goverument to the Canadian Government?"
The answer was in the negative.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have put
the question in the broadest ternis I can,
and for the time being I shall have to accept
the reply. I find it very difficuit to conclude
in my own mind that the information given
to me is wholly unfounded.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I arn unable to

IGH COMMISSIONER IN THE UNITED
KINGDOM BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 146, an Act respecting
the High Commissioner for Canada in the
United Kingdom.
He said: Honourable senators, I may explain
that for some years it has been the customn
to pay part of the salary of the High Commissioner for Canada in the United Kingdom
under the statutory authority given hy the
High Commiasioner's Act, and part by a vote
ini the estimates of the Department of External
Affairs. The principal ohject of this Bill is
to repeal the statutory authority contained
in the High Commission *er's Act, 80 that in
future the whole salary may be included in
the departmental estimates. This change will
establish a uniform practice with respect to
the salaries of the representatives of Canada
abroad. As certain other minor amendments
to the High Commissioner's Act were also
deemed desirable, it was decided to a.sk that
the existing statute be repealed, and that it
be replaced with a measure drafted in conformity with modern usage and terminology.

THIRD READING

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Bill was read the third time, and passed.

FIRST READINGS

Hon. Mr. McMEANS, Chairman of the
Committee on Divorce, presented the following Bills, which were severally read the first

INDIAN BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third
reading of Bill 138, an Act to amend the Indian
Act.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, I had the privilege of attending this
morning the meeting of the Committee on
Agriculture and Forestry. The Minister of
Mines and Resources was good enough to
be present and to place his intentions hefore
the committee in more detail than we had
before. What he has in view is the lending of
money not only to individual Indians, but as

504

SENATE

well to Indian schools, for the purchase of
raw material to be wrought into finished
articles for purposes of sale. Indian children
would naturally be expert in making these
articles. The money lent is to be returned
out of the proceeds of sales, and would thus
be revolving. I was agreeable to the reporting of the Bill from committee, and said so,
but I expressed at the time, as did at least
one other senator, a complete lack of faith
in the policy of lending to the individual
Indian. I protest against that policy, though
I can conceive of single cases where a loan
might be justified if the supervision were
extraordinarily capable and efficient. I should
certainly prefer the policy of a straight negative against all loans of an individual character. I should also like to go on record as
expressing again the view that even in respect
of advances for purchases of raw material the
enterprise is bazardons to the last degree, and
that the Minister should exercise the greatest
possible care and experiment with the least
possible amount of money before he goes any
distance along this line.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There seemed to
be general agreement in the committee that
there had been in the department an official
who possessed all the qualities required for
efficient supervision of these matters. He is
still living, but unfortunately bas been retired.
I think bis name is Mr. Graham.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And the hope
was expressed that there would be found in
the department now a man able to take
over the post that Mr. Graham filled so wel:
for a number of years.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.

BIRTHDAY FELICITATIONS

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
My right
honourable friend (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen)
was about to leave the Chamber when I told
him I had a very important matter to discuss
with him. Perhaps I should have said it
was a matter to which I desired to draw bis
attention.
Right Hon. Mr.

MEIGHEN.

I have just learned that my right honourable
friend is sixty-four years of age this day,
and in the name of all members of the Senate
I wish him many happy returns. We have
been most highly favoured by bis consenting
to sit among us. We enjoy bis company,
bis learning-sometimes bis thrusts.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I do not complain of those thrusts. I hope no event will
draw him away from this Chamber.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members. I am very grateful to my
honourable friend opposite for bis exceedingly
generous remarks. If anything could contribute to my present resolve not to be
drawn fron this Chamber, it would be the
fact of wbich be bas informed the public,
that I have reached such an advanced age.
If. prompted by the same kindly feelings, he
should ever congratulate me again, I would
ask him as a favour to leave out the figures.
I thank honourable members.
DISALLOWANCE OF ALBERTA

LEGIS-

ORDERS IN COUNCIL TABLED

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
I desire
to lay on the Table two Orders in Council,
Nos. 1367 and 1368, approving a report of the
Minister of Justice to the Governor in Council respecting certain measures enacted by the
Legislature of Alberta. These orders disallow
an Act for the Security of Home Owners
and an Act to Impose a Tax on Certain
Securities in the Year 1938.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Consistently with the argument I sought to advance some time ago. I wish to congratulate
the Government on its long-delayed decision
to disallow certain Alberta legislation. There
are other subject-matters of Alberta legislation which, I believe, are also before the
Government.

bas under consideration.

505

JUNE 16, 1938
I cannot
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
refrain from expressing regret that the Government has so long delayed its judgment in
these matters, especially as to the Act respecting taxes on securities. It is well known
that a large number of companies and individuals have by that Act been compelled to
prepare the most onerous reports, reports indeed so onerous that it was physically impossible to complete them before the 1st of
June, on which date they all had to be filed
on penalty of fantastic fines. Many individuals and companies not only struggled to

2. $100 a year (minimum salary).
3. None.
4. None.
5. No special recommendation.
6. Postmaster General.
7. To serve patrons on opposite side of
river to Cardigan.
8. Will depend on use made of new office.
SS. VENTURE

prepare such reports and file them, but actually sent in the tax rather than exposa themselves to the ruinous fines which the Act
provided for. All this utterly unnecessary
harm has been done. I submit that disallowance was obviously called for, and should
have been effected with despatch, to remove
from the shoulders of citizens injustices so
preposterous. However, action has been delayed until this date.
With reference to the legislation not yet
dealt with, I express my surprise that no
action has been taken. I can think of no
reason for further postponement, for the
Saskatchewan election is all over. The only
reason that was on the horizon, very obvious,
though very futile, was long ago removed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend has not been outside the realm of
practical politics as long as I have been, and
from events lie draws conclusions that do not
appear to me.

CARDIGAN, P.E.I., POST OFFICE
INQUIRY
Hon. JOHN A. MACDONALD inquired
of the Government:
1. Has a second post office been established
in the village of Cardigan, Prince Edward
Island, during the present year?
2. What salary does the postmaster receive?
3. What rental is paid for the office?
4. What other expense is necessary for maintaining it?
5. Who recommended the opening of this
office?
6. Who gave the necessary approval and

authority for opening it?
7. What purpose is it intended to serve?

8. In view of the fact that practically all
business goes through the other office, is it
the intention of the Post Office Department
to continue maintenance of two post offices in
a village of less than two hundred people?

ORDER FOR RETURN

Hon. Mr. ROBICHEAU moved:
That a return do issue setting forth:
1. Copy of contract in connection with the
construction of "Venture";

2. Copy of a certified pay list in respect of

CONVENTION FOR SUPPRESSION OF
ILLICIT TRAFFIC IN DANGEROUS
DRUGS
INQUIRY WITHDRAWN

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
in the discussion that arose yesterday out of
the motion for approval

of the Dangerous

Drugs Convention, I requested certain information from the Government. I at least
temporarily overlooked the fact that we are
already hard pressed with business and that
the burden on the shoulders of the honourable
leader of this House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
is, as usual in the closing days of the session,

a very heavy one.

I have no intention of

introducing at this time any discussion which

would occupy the House.

Consequently, I

have suggested to the honourable leader that
lie should disregard my present request for

information, and I have stated my intention
of placing on the Order Paper early next
session some questions designed to produce
the required information up to date. Then
we should have ample time to discuss the
matter.

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: I desire to
thank my honourable friend from Vancouver
(Hon. Mr. McRae) for his kindness in withdrawing the request for information concerning the work and cost to Canada of the League

of Nations.

I may tell him that if I am

occupying the same seat in the Senate next

506

SENATE

session I shall be glad then to discuss' with
him the activities and usefulness of the
League.
RESOLUTION OF APPROVAL

Drugs (Geneva, June 26, 1936), sigssed on
behalf of Canada by the plenipotentiary named
therein, and

DIVORCE

BILLS

SECOND AND THIRD READINGS

On motion of Hon. Mr. McMeans, Chairman of the Committee on Divorce, the following Bills were severally read the second
and third times, and passed on division:
Bill R3, an Act for the relief of Marjorie
Ruth Nicholson Lowe.
Bill L3, an Act for the relief of Anna
Verçszczak Finchuk.
NATIONAL PARKS AMENDMENT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of Bill 154, an Act to amend
the National Parks Act, and The Nova Scotia
and Prince Edward Island National Parks
Act, 1936.
He said: Honourable senators, the main purpose of this Bill is to make some corrections
in the boundaries of the park in Prince Edward
Island. As honourable members are aware,
the Government of Prince Edward Island set
aside or acquired the areas that were later
transferred to the Dominion administration
for the development of a national park in
that province. This involved the acquisition
of property from various persons, and in the
adjustments incidental to the acquisition of
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

this property it is now found necessary to
change in some slight particulars the boundaries of senme of the areas acquired.
There is also an amendment to The National
Parks Act relating to a slight change in the
bousndav of the Elk Island park, east of
Edmonton. This is a slight rectification to
permit the Provineial Government road, which
passes by the park, to eut off one small corner
of it, which is replaced by an addition of some
thirty-five or forty acres in another part of
the park.
Then there is provision for the abandonment
of a park known as the Wawaskesy National
Park, north of Medicine Hat. This was
acquired quite a number of years ago for the
purpose of creating a reserve for the pronghorned antelope in Alberta.
It ias never
been fenced. It consisted of a sort of elbow
in the Saskatchewan river. At the same time
another park, west and south of Medicine
Hat, known as the Nemiskam park, was secured
for tlie same purpose, and now it is felt unneeessary to maintain both parks. A resolution was passed by the Alberta Legislature,
I think at its last session, to the effect that
the Wawaskesy park should be either fenced
or abandoned by the Federal Government.
Since the other park which I mentioned a
moment ago is quite sufficient, in the judgment of the park administration, for the
maintenance of the pronghorned antelope, it
is proposed under this legislation to abandon
the Wawaskesy park and let it revert to the
ownership of the province.
I may add that schedule 2 contains in
detail a description of the Prince Edward
Island park.
As honourable members are
aware, the honourable senator from Prince
(Hon. Mr. MacArthur), a couple of years
ago, very generously donated a piece of land
to enlarge this park. If the House desires
any further explanation in regard to the
Prince Edward Island park, I have no doubt
the ionourable senator from Prince will be
happy to enlighten us.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN:
Honourable
members, in the absence of the right honourable leader on this side of the House
(Rigit Hon. Mr. Meighen) I may say that
I have read the Bill and the discussion on it
which took place in the other House. The
purpose of the Bill is two-fold: first, to
amend the boundaries of the Prince Edward
Island park; second, to provide that a certain
park, which has become unnecessary, shall
revert to the province of Alberta, in
accordance with the terms of the agreement
made between Alberta and the Dominion for
the transfer to the province of its natural

JUNE 17, 1938
resources. There is nothing contentious in
the Bill, and there is no reason why it should
not be given second reading.
Hon. CREELMAN MacARTHUR: Honourable senators, as the honourable member
from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) has
just said, there is nothing contentious in this
Bill. I thank the honourable leader on this
side of the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
for his references to myself. Five years ago
I acquired the old Warburton estate of 655
acres, only to realize that it was a white
elephant. I built a lodge and a concrete and
steel dam and put in some 50,000 trout.
In a Word, I did everything that I thought
might appeal to the Commission when
selecting in the province an area for a national park which would be attractive to
tourists. But it seems the outstanding requirement was surf bathing, and my property
had only sheltered stretches of river. It is a
very beautiful area and its waters are well
stocked with trout, lobster and oysters.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: What a place!
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: The property
cost me some $15,000. I offered it to the
Government as a gift, free of restrictions of
any kind. I thought in that way a greater
service would be rendered to this country,
and to visitors in this country, than could
be rendered by me as an individual.
However, it was deemed the part of wisdom
to select an area in Queen's county, of which
the honourable senator from Queen's (Hon.
Mr. Sinclair) can speak in more detail than
I can. Mr. Cromarty and another gentleman
from the Parks Branch went down and after
looking at four or five sites selected the one
referred to in the Bill. Unfortunately, there
was some difficulty with three or four landowners with regard to the expropriation, and
for a year or more there bas been some contention. This difficulty has now been removed,
and the purpose of this Bill is to describe the
area. We are now looking forward to having
a park which will be the equal of anything in
any other province in Canada.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
THIRD READING

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Bill was read the third time, and passed.
ADJOURNMENT

OF THE SENATE

Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
senators, as there is nothing further on the
Order Paper for to-day, I move that when
the Senate adjourns, it stand adjourned until
Monday evening at 8 oclock.

I may say thait the practice of the Senate
in times gone by was to meet from day to day,
whether there was anything on the Order
Paper or not. When I came to the Senate,
in ý1898, the debate on the Address would
take up several weeks in the House of Commons; yet the Senate met daily.
At that time we had the privilege of having
with us an Anglican bishop who would
solemnly enter the Chamber, kneel near the
Table, and offer up a prayer of some fifteen
minutes in length. Possibly the legislation
was a little better for this. I do not know.
Now His Honour the Speaker has replaced
the bishop, and our prayer, which is the same
as that used in the House of Commons, is
shorter. We pray on the same terms as the
other House.

OCCUPATION OF VANCOUVER
OFFICE

POST

INQUIRY

On the notice by Hon. Mr. Casgrain:
That he will inquire of the Government:
How many of those who have made their
abode in the Post Office Building in Vancouver
were born in British Columbia? How manty
are residents of British Columbia, and how
many were born outside of the province of
British Columbia?
And that. ie will call the attention of the
Senîate to those particulars.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is very difficult to get an answer to this question. The
only reply I can make is in the form of an
unofficial general statement, but perhaps my
honourable friend will be satisfied with it for
the time being.
A survey conducted by the Vancouver
Youth Council on Friday, June 10, showed
that there were 607 men in the Art Gallery
and Post Office. The number in each bilding is not stated. Of the total 445 have lived
in British Columbia for five years, 87 for three
years and 75 under three years. But, as I
have said, these figures are net official.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Honourable senators, may I leave this notice of inquiry on
the Order Paper? I do net feel well enough
to go on with it to-day. I want to call the
attention of the Senate later to the situation
caused by the coming of foreigners into this
country. No
other civilized
country is
organized as Canada is, except England, and
over there they have Scotland Yard, who
know all about a foreigner before he lands.
BRITISH
GOVERNMENT
AVIATION
TRAINING SCHOOL IN CANADA
FURTHER INQUIRY

On the Orders of the Day:
Rigit Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable memibers, last Tuesday, on information I then had, I addressed a question to
the Government as to its attitude towards
giving permission to the British Government
lo establish flying school facilities in Canada.
On Wednesday I received an answer to the
effect that no request had been made by the
British Government for such permission.
I
then took the liberty of following up the question, my only purpose being to have it in such
a general forci as would enable the Administration to enlighten this House as to what,
if any, conversations there had been on the
subject. When I put myv question in that
gen(eral form the leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) answered as follows, as

JUNE 21, 1938
reported at page 503 of the Debates of the
Senate:
That I am unable to answer. I asked the
department, "Has any request been made by
the British Government to the Canadian Government?" The answer was in the negative.
I wish to-day to renew the question, emphasizing particularly the generality of its form.
I earnestly hope the Government will see its
way to take the House into its confidence in
respect to a matter of such vital and perhaps
permanent consequence, not only to the Empire, but to this country.
Of course, I
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
could at the time only give the right honourable gentleman the answer that I had
received. Now he is asking whether there
have been conversations. Is that the meat
of the question?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
I will get an
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
answer for my right honourable friend.
FARMERS' CREDITORS ARRANGEMENT BILL
MESSAGE FROM COMMONS-SENATE
MENT INSISTED ON

AMEND-

The Senate proceeded to consider a message
from the House of Commons disagreeing to
an amendment made by the Senate to Bill
25, an Act to Amend the Farmers' Creditors
Arrangement Act, 1934.
Is this open for
Hon. Mr. HUGHES:
consideration now?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There is no
motion yet.
I move
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
that the Senate do not insist on the second
amendment to Bill 25. This motion is in
accordance with the stand which I felt obliged
to take when the amendment was proposed
in this Chamber. The apparent unanimity of
the House of Commons in refusing to accept
our amendment fortifies my present attitude.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, the amendment to which
the House of Commons has not agreed is one
which terminates on the 1st of January next
the application of the Act to new proposals
under it, in provinces other than Alberta and
Saskatchewan. The honourable leader of the
House, when spea.king on this Bill on a
previous occasion, intimated that the Minister
of Finance, who, of course, is chiefly or very
closely concerned in the matter, had particularly asked for an expression of view by
honourable members of this Chamber on the
entire subject of the Farmers' Creditors

509

Arrangement Act. Such a request on the part
of a minister is one which this House should
always welcome, and to which it should always
respond with the utmost thoroughness of
study and frankness of expression. We have
sought to respond in that way.
There is no phase of the Act so important,
in my judgment anyway, as that relating to
its termination.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Now, what
has happened the expression of view by this
House as respects the Act in its application
to the various provinces? Let us start at the
Pacifie coast. The honourable senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) expresséd
the view that the province of British Columbia
would like the continuance of the Act.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I am afraid I shall
have to correct my right honourable friend.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I hope I am
wrong.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I do not think I
expressed any opinion on behalf of the
Government.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That takes a
load off my mind. The honourable senator
expressed his own view that the Act should
continue to apply to British Columbia after
the 1st of January next.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Will my right honourable friend permit me to correct him again?
In my view it should be left to the department
to get the figures and to study and decide the
question.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am becoming happier every moment. I thought the
honourable senator from British Columbia
was more firmly opposed to termination in that
province than he is. I know he did say wha't
he has now expressed. So, as far as British
Columbia is concerned, nobody has ventured
to express definitely the opinion that the Act
should not terminate as early as January 1,
1039; the only view stated is that the Government should have some discretion as to
whether it terminates or not. To some extent
the honourable senator has failed to respond
to the appeal of the Minister of Finance
for an expression of opinion.
As regards Alberta and Saskatchewan, the
view presented by more than one, but not
many, is that the Act should not be discontinued there at so early a date, and there is a
willingness to leave termination to be decided
by the Governor in Council. Therefore, as
to that area, we are all at one, and there is

510

SENATE

no difference with the other House. We do
not wish the termination clause to apply to
Saskatchewan and Alberta.
From Manitoba there has been no view
whatever expressed against terminating the
Act on the 1st of January; from the great
province of Ontario there has been not one;
from the great province of Quebec not one.
The same applies to New Brunswick, and
the same to Nova Scotia, both heavily populated portions of this Dominion.
There has been a difference of opinion as
respects Prince Edward Island, but the
operation of the Act in that province was
vigorously defended by only one honourable
senator as against three.
So. in so far as we have had the opinion
of bonourable senators from the different provinces on this Bill-and we have had it to a
very gfeat extent-it is almost fully in accord
with the terms of the amendment which we
have passed.
Now, I do not want to be obdurate in a
matter of this kind, but my opinions are most
decided. I dislike the Act. I came to the
opinion I now hold, against the operation
of the Act in toto, from the very opposite
standpoint, for I sponsored the Act in this
House. From my experience of its operation,
and particularly its administration, I am convinced that its undermining effect on the
general morale of the community is observable
everywhere. There have been so many pieces
of legislation-mainly provincial, it is
true,
but not wholly so-that have tended to the
same deleterious and indeed fatal effect, that
I rejoice to see them one by one cast into
oblivion. If there is one thing needed in
Canada it is a restoration of the sense of
obligation-a restoration of those old principles of honesty, as to financial obligation,
upon which civilization rests. I cannot impress too strongly upon the House, and upon
all persons outside of it to whose attention
these words may come, that in my view the
worst thing that has happened in this Dominion un years, the worst of the calamities that
have followed us, is simply this minimizing,
this overthrowing, this ignoring, of the sacred
sense of obligation.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. 'MEIGHEN: We ail know
that where a debt cannot 'be discharged, it
cannot, and some means must then be found
of providing for a new start. But we are
giving encouragement to the ignoring of
obligations where they can be discharged, and
we are listening to talk about buman rights
as though human rights were on one hand
Rlît Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

and money rights on the other. There is no
such situation at ail. Human rights pervade
everything; it is only a question of where
the incidence falls. This applies to the
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act as to
every other Act. I do not want to bring
the slightest pressure to bear upon anyone,
and I have spoken to no one about this
except one honourable friend to my right, but
for mY part I should like to sec this House
adhere to its position on this Bill. A conference can follow, if such is the desire of the
other House. I cannot think the other Ho.use
would insist that this law be made to apply
indefinitely to a great range of communities,
throughout the area of which no sympathy
is expressed for it and there is universal
appreciation of its general effect.
Hon. Mfr. CASGRAIN: I should like to
ask one question, which I am sure the right
honourable leader on the opposite side (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) can answer better than
anvone else. How can Parliament make a law
for certain provinces and not for others? I
ask that in my innocence as a land surveyor.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I never like
to presume to be an authority on any such
point. particularly when I have not given it
spccial study. But I believe that from the
constilutional angle there is no objection at
all to Parliament legislating as respects any
section of our country. We do that continualiy, and have dlone so this session. For
instance. we pass laws respecting the North
West Territories alone. The question did
occur ta me earIier, but I never heard anyone
raise any doubt as to our power to impose
a geographical limit to the application of
any statute.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Thank you.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators,
I Io not know whether it would be in order
to move a further amendment, but that is
what I should like to do. I do not see why
it is considered necessary to ]eave the Act
effective in Saskatchewan and Alberta. The
provincial governments af those two provinces
are vying with each other in putting into effect
programs for cancellation of debt.
These
programs are in themselves severe enough fQr
anv citizen to have to live under. In the
province of Saskatchewan many farms bave
bren sold to mnc
wio have it
pait a
dollar down and perhaps have hat maney
advanced ta then for the purclase ai impiements and other essentials. Yet the AttorneyCneral of that province, speaking over the
radio, has informel the farmers that notwithstanding any agreements they may have

JUNE 21, 1938
signed to pay half their crop towards debt
reduction, all they need to pay is one-third
their crop, less taxes. Talk about sanctity
A man who has signed an
of contract!
agreement is placed in possession of a farm,
with the necessary equipment, and is given
money to purchase seed, and then on the
authority of the Attorney-General of the
province he is told that he need not pay more
than one-third of his crop towards his debts.
So I say we have sufficient debt adjustment
in those two provinces already.
The honourable junior senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig), in urging that the
Act be made inapplicable after the end of
this year to every province except Alberta
and Saskatchewan, reminds me of a story.
A man was endeavouring to get permission
from an Indian chief to build a school on
his reservation. After some fine speeches had
been delivered, the chief got up and admitted
that schools were very desirable for other
reservations, but said he did not want one
on his. The honourable junior member from
Winnipeg wanted his own reservation exempted. I feel the same way about mine,
which is Saskatchewan, and I should also
like to see Alberta protected. So, if it is in
order, I would move an amendment to the
effect that no applications under this Act be
receivable in any province of Canada after
December 31 next.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It would not
be in order for the honourable gentleman to
move such an amendment now. The question
before honourable members is on the motion
that the Senate do not insist upon its amendment which bas not been concurred in by
the House of Commons.
Hon. J. W. deB. FARRIS: Honourable
senators, in view of the observation by the
right honourable leader opposite (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen) and a statement made by Mr.
Barber, the honourable member for Fraser
Valley in another place, I think I should
perhaps try to make a little clearer what was
said in this Chamber about British Columbia's
attitude towards the Act. Mr. Barber said:
I understand that for some time the British
Columbia Government has been opposed to this
legislation.
He apparently held an opinion opposite to
that of my right honourable friend, and suggested that the Senate was influenced by this
supposed attitude of the British Columbia
Government.
I am not in a position to speak for the Government of British Columbia, but I do know
something of its attitude, for I was retained
to act for it before the Privy Council, as I

511

That Government's
have already stated.
objection then was two-fold. First, on the
broad constitutional question, the province
felt that the Dominion, by an enactment
in the guise of bankruptcy legislation, was
in reality invading the field of provincial
jurisdiction as to property and civil rights.
The second fundamental objection pressed at
that time was that the operation of this Act
extended so far that contracts which the province had made as a province with private
citizens were being interfered with by the
board of review. For instance, as to sales of
certain lands and other matters, where moneys
were owed to the province, the Dominion was,
under the authority of this Act, presuming-I
think the Prime Minister of British Columbia
would approve of my using that word-to interfere with provincial contracts, although the
province feit that it had the responsibility of
dealing effectively and fairly with its own
contracts with its own citizens, and was able
to do so.
It was on those two grounds that British
Columbia opposed this legislation before the
Privy Council. Since the Act has been declared intra vires the Provincial Government,
so far as I know, bas not in any way taken
a stand for its immediate withdrawal. When
the Prime Minister of the province was in
Ottawa some three or four weeks ago I asked
him a direct question, and he intimated to me
that he was not then in a position to give
any advice to the Dominion Government as
to whether the Act should be repealed or not.
And I think that is as far as one can go.
Having said that, I should like to add that
when this matter was under discussion here a
little while ago I suggested that there were
two fundamental points to be considered in
relation to a measure of this kind. One is its
merits, as to whether it is the kind of legislation that should stay on the Statute Book.
A great deal of opinion has been expressed here
against the Act as such, but with all deference
to honourable members I would submit that
that is not the immediate issue before the
House. The Senate has already voted in favour
of having the law remain effective in seven
provinces until the end of this year, and in
the other two provinces indefinitely. That
position having been taken, the merit of the
law as such is no longer an issue. As I see
it, there is, in the circumstances, only one
point to be considered. That is, assuming the
legislation to be sound and beneficial, how
long is it needed? That is a question, not of
principle, but of fact, which. as to each province, must depend upon the local situation.
My right honourable friend on the other
side (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) said the
other day, in replying to a statement I had

512

SENATE

made, that he had not sat in committee as a
juror, and therefore was under no obligation
to he guided by information given in committee. I quite agree that that is a sound
principle when we are discussing the merits
of a measure. But, with all deference, I
repeat that that is net the present issue. The
issue now is: The legislation being assumed
to be sound, how long should it remain in
effect in any given province? And on that I
would reiterate a point I made a few days
ago. My right honourable friend said most
of the provinces Lad not expressed any desire
to have the legislation continued in effect.
But is that negative statement a fair way
to put it? Is the issue not an affirmative one
now? Let us look at Nova Scotia. I ask
my right honourable friend: is there any
information of a statistical nature to show that
this Act, in which we may assume there is
somo benefit. bas fuifilled its purpose in Nova
Scotia and is no longer-needed there? There
is not a scintilla of evidence to that effect.
The same is true as regards New Brunswick.
As to Ontario, there was divided testimony.
I cannot find that any honourable member
of tlie other House supported the stand taken
by the Senate.
Wlien I spoke on this Bill some days ago
none of mv colleagues from British Columbia
were present. Several of them are here teday.
I would ask them, and my right
honourable friend opposite as well, if they have
the figures with respect to that province, if
they know how many loans have been dealt
with, how many there are awaiting consideration, and so on. I doubt that any honourable member of this House is in a position
to give statistical information to indicate
whether or not the Act is any longer necessary
in that province.
After some of my earlier remarks my right
honourable friend the leader on the other side
was kind enough to sar that I had imposed
some eloquence upon. the House. I had not
intended to be guilty of that. My purpose
was simply to sar that the Dominion Government has machinery in every province for
getting figures to show how the Act is working there; and, on the assumption that the
legislation is beneficial, it seemed to me the
logical course for us to take was to leave
to that Government the decision as to when
the effect of the Act should be terminated
in any province.
Right Hon. ir. MEIHEN: Honourable
members, as I listened to my honourable
friend I wondered just what kind of figures
could h got to help the House in deciding
whether this Act shouki longer apply in
Hon. Mr. FARRIS.

any province. I consider what is before us
now just as much a matter of principle as
are the merits of the Bill as a whole. We
passed this Act because of emergent conditions.
Hon. Mir. MacARTHUR:

Hear, hear.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Emergent
conditions prevailed to a degree in our rural
communities all over our country, but the
section in which they were very hazardous,
unfortunate, and difficult to deal with, was
the Prairie Provinces. The principle upon
which I stand now, and upon which I wish
I had stood thenHon. Mr. MacARTHUR:

Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: -is this, that
it is only where such conditions are exceedingly difficult. disastrous and abnormal in
every way that we should ever venture to
apply extraordinary legislation of this kind.
Even whether we should do so in respect of
such districts may be questioned. But I for
one am convinced that nowhere else should
legislation of this cliaracter apply at any time.
My honourable friend from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) says 'that once we
decide in favour of continuation of this law
in seven provinces for a little while longer,
or in the other two provinces until the Governor in Council repeals it, we admit it is good
legislation. We do not. We admit that perhaps the original purpose of the Act can
still be carried out in Alberta and Saskatchewan, and we are ready to make a compromise
so far as agreeing that it shall continue to be
effective in those two provinces for the time
being, for we know that conditions existing
there to-day are as serious as those that existed when the Act was passed.
What those statistics would be passes my
power of imagination. We know that conditions are fairly normal in the rural cornmunities in seven of the provinces. Does the
Governor in Couneil know that any better
than we do? To listen to the honourable
member, one would think that this Act had
to exhaust itself in each of these provinces,
one by one. In that case, I presume, the first
province we should let out would be Prince
Edward Island. If the Act has not exhausted
itself there. I do not know where it could
exhaust itself. There it Las covered the whole
community. Apparently the argument has
crevailed thore that if one farmer is relieved of
his debts every other farmer ought to get
similar relief. What kind of statistics do we
want? The only statisties that would mean
anything to me are those bearing on the
general condition of the community. I do
not need any statistics on that point; nobody

·

.JUNE 21, 1938
in this House needs them. We know that in
Ontario to-day there is no emergent condition; there is none in Quebec; there is none
in the Island-except what the Act brought
about; there is none in Nova Scotia. At the
rate 'the good people of Nova Scotia are making 'themselves debtors under this law, it
would take hundreds of years to exhaust
itself .there. In fact very few people in Nova
Scotia have come under the Act ait all. The
truth is, the Act has been pretty well administered in those provinces, as the few applications under it indicate. And the truth
is, as well, it was never needed in Nova
Scotia, nor in Prince Edward Island, nor in
New Brunswick, and certainly not in Ontario and Quebec.
Those are, to my mind, all the facts that
anyone requires in deciding how long the
Act should continue to apply. Whether it
should ever have applied or not is a grave
question. J submit it never should have been
made to apply at all where demonstrably
there were no such unprecedented conditions
as call for an unprecedented law. Such conditions do not exist save in two provinces.
Therefore, I say, do not leave this to some
other body, but let us legislate that in other
places, where unprecedented conditions do not
exist, the Act shall cease to apply.
Hon. JAMES CALDER:
Honourable
menibers, I am very strongly inclined to the
view expressed by the other member from
Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Horner).
I am
reasonably certain that before long this Act
should cease to apply in that province. It
lbas been in operation there for some years.
All, or nearly all, those whose condition was
such that they should get relief have already
applied to the board of review, and a large
number of applications have been dealt with;
others are in process of being dealt with.
This Bill as amended by the Senate provides
that not only in Saskatchewan and Alberta,
but in all the provinces, the Act shall continue in existence for a period of six months.
I cannot help feeling that if any fariner who
has difficulties at the present time wishes to
have his debts adjusted, he has ample time
within the next six months to make application to a board. Then, for goodness' sake,
let us end this type of legislation, which
results in the conditions that have been so
well described by the right honourable leader
on this side of the House (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen).
In Saskatchewan and Alberta, and to a
lesser degree in Manitoba, as every honourable senator understands, we have an absolutely abnormal condition which does not
exist anywhere else in Canada. We have had
51958-33

crop failures for nearly seven years, and our
people there, by the thousands, have been in
all sorts of financial difficulties, and it is quite
possible that more time is necessary in order
to clean up a very difficult situation. But
even in Saskatchewan I can see no reason
why any farmer who is in difficulties at the
present time should not get his application in
before the end of this year. Then, I repeat,
the Act should cease to operate. I am thoroughly convinced that its results are very bad
for all the people of Canada, and we should
put an end to this legislation.
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourable senators, I am one of those who four years ago
voted to bring into existence the Farmers'
Creditors Arrangement Act, and a few days
ago I voted for the amendment we are now
considering. So I want to make my position
clear.
The fact that this Bill has been returned
frorn the other House, the Government declining to accept the amendment made by
the Senate, is proof to my mind that the
Minister in whose department the Farmers'
Creditors Arrangement Act is administered
wishes to have the power to terminate it
when and where he thinks such action should
be taken. It is a fairly heavy responsibility
for the Minister. The Senate, by its discussion of the measure and its amendment to
the Bill, expressed its desire to share this
responsibility with him. It is quite evident,
however, that be thinks better results will
be obtained if the Governor in Couneil is
given power to act entirely on his own initiative. Possibly the Minister is right. In these
.circumstances it seems to me to be the duty
of the Senate to accede to the wishes of the
Government and the other House by agreeing to the Governor in Council being given
that power.
But this does not prevent us from discussing the matter here and now. In fact,
to my mind, it increases the duties of members of this House to give the Minister all
the information they can in regard to the
working of the Act in every part of the
country, which information, I feel sure, be
will weIcome, because when he told the
other House be could not accept the Senate
amendment be asked the members here to
give him their opinions freely. I shall try
to comply with that request.
In my opinion it is practically impossible to
get satisfactory results in the provinces unless
the men administering the Act there are
capable, honest and free from class prejudices. It is equally impossible to expect
satisfactory results in Canada as a whole

REVIBED EDITION

SENATE
unless the director and his staff in Ottawa are
also honest, capable and free from class prejudices.
The reports of the operation of the Act,
prepared by the head office here and submitted to Parliament, show the expenditures
in the several provinces. I have read from
those reports and put some of the expenditures on Hansard. If the members of this
House, the members of the other House, and
the Government, think these expenditures are
all right, I have only this to say on that
phase of the subject at present. When the
director in Ottawa was giving evidence before
our Banking and Commerce Committee, I
asked him if he ever found it necessary to reduce any of the expenditure accounts he received, and he said yes, and that by the
reductions he had saved the treasury large
sums of money. Then I asked him if he had
ever found it necessary to increase expenditure accounts he had received, and he answered
in the affirmative. These answers told me
much, but I do not think they were equally
revealing to all the other members of the
committee.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Now, with regard to
the class prejudices of the officials administering this Act-of which overwhelming evidence
is supplied by the officials themselves-I
must take up the memorandum read by the
honourable leader of the Senate (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) on the 25th ultimo. I shall read
only the short part referring to Prince Edward Island. Here it is:
2. Now as to Prince Edward Island. The
debt situation of farmers in Prince Edward
Island differs from that in almost every other
province, in that the great proportion of these
farmers' debts is to local merchants, who have
taken mortgages on the farmers' property.
Many of these mortgages have been in existence for several generations, the farmer turning his produce over to the merchants, who,
in turn, sold him his supplies. These merchants
are violently opposed to any change n an
arrangement which, for many generations, bas
been extremely satisfactory to themselves, but
not so satisfactory to the farmer.
Many cases of hardship have been reported
in this connection.
The following are two
sample cases:
I should like to direct the attention of
honourable members to the two "sample
cases." Here they are.
The creditor bad been charging his debtors
10 per cent interest on his bills, taking cattle,
grain or other produce, whether the debtor
farmer could spare it or not, and is reported
to have allowed these farmers only one-half of
the value of such stock and produce as a credit
on his bill.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES.

That is "some" statement.

Now, case No.

2:
A woman owned a fair farm and provided a
living for her son, his wife and a family of
ten children. She owed a mortgage of $650
at 7 per cent interest, and with $32 interest
only due, the mortgagee instituted foreclosure
proceedings.
These cases were adjusted by the Prince
Edward Island board of review, to the dissatisfaction of the creditors.
Now I have some comment to make. Here
we have sweeping charges made against the
merchants of Prince Edward Island as a class.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I rise to a point of
order. Everything we are now hearing has
been presented before and is on the record.
The point before us now is the message from
the House of Commons. It is not a question
of the merits or demerits of the measure
generally.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Honourable senators, this has not been before the Senate
before. This came out in committee, and
the majority of honourable members did not
hear it.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I still respectfully
suggest that it will bc found on Hansard.
If not, I am greatly mistaken.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: Go ahead.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: A point of order
las been raised by the honourable senator
from Parkdale (ion. Mr. Murdock). I think
the opinion of the House would be that the
honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Hughes)
should confine his remarks more closely to the
question under discussion, namely, whether or
not the Senate shall insist on its second
amendment.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I know that some
honourable senators have not read the reports
which have been submitted to this House,
and I know that some of them were not
present when this matter was discussed before.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: The honourable
senator has his speech in writing. May I
suggest that Pe put it on Hansard?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I ask honourable
members whether they will hear it. I am
nearly through. I want to make some comments on the slanderous statements made by
officials administering this Act, and officials
of the Government, respecting the merchants
of Prince Edward Island as a class.

.JUNE 21, 1938
Right lion. Mr. MEIGHIEN: On the point
of order: I do flot wish either to encourage or
to discourage my honourable friend, but I do
flot see how hie can discuss the way in which
the Senate should deal with the amendment
unless lie discusses the merits of the Act.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: There is mucli that
1 do not know about the Bill, but I should
like to ask the rîglit honourable leader opposite
(Right lion. Mr. Meigben) or the leader on
this aide (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: That is better.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: -as to the propriety
of usurping the prerogatives of constitutional
government as vested in the Governor in
Council. To me that seems the important
question that is involved here right now. This
Bill when it came to uslion. Mr. HUGHES: I am addressing the
House, and I do not want any otherSomne lion. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
lion. Mr. HUGHES: I rise to a point of
order.
Right lion. Mr. MEIGHEN: Go ahead.
lion. Mr. HUGHES: I say again, here we
have sweeping charges made against the
merchants of Prince Edward Island as a class,
against their characters and business methods.
But in one of the specific cases mentioned the
creditor is not a merchant, at ail, and neyer
has heen. lie is a brother farmer, and in a
class by himself; yet the director of this
organization put him down as a merchant,
and said it was only a "sample case" of the
way in which the farmers in the province had
been treated by the merchants as a class.
I do not know the creditor in the other case,
but in ail probability the samne remarks will
apply. And I feel sure these men are not
typical of any class on Prince Edward Island;
yet the director, Mr. Gordon, declared they
were but "sample cases" of merchants.
The memorandum prcpared by the director,
and read by the leader of the Senate, states
that the merchants are violently opposed to
the operations of the Act, or to any change.
The long, ram'bling, innocuous speech prepared by the director, and delivered by the
senator from Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair) on
the 9th instant, states that the debtors, the
creditors and everybody else on Prince Edward Island are well pleased, with the Act
and its administration. It is bard to reconeule this idea, adopted by the senatoT from
Queen's, with the declaration that he endorsed
the sianderous attack made by the director
on the merchants of the province.
5195-43à

The fact of the matter is that these men
do not comprehiend what they are writing and
saying. They are so angered that any persoir
should disturb them at the feast which they
preparcd for themselves and their friends,.
at the public expense, that they strike out
widy on ail sides, and in their rage woundi
even themselves. At first they apparcntly
thouglit it would be a great thing to malign,.
traduce and siander the merchants -of Prince'
Edward Island, and that it would be a crowning achievement to get the leader of the
Senate to read the document and place it on
the records of Parliament. They neyer thought
it would become such a boomerang. Transgressors seldom provide for ail the avenuesof escape.
When Alexander Mackenzie was Prime Minister of Canada he declared that hie had to
rest on his arms night and day to protect
the treasutry. If lie iived in this day and
generation hie wouid, I think, have to empioy
an army to do that work; and even then the
raiders would outwit him. Some ten or
twelve years ago a customs scandai, with
headquarters at Montreal and, ramifications in
many other places, which shocked the country,
was unearthed. I am afraid that history, in
principle, if not in volume, is repeating itseif.
liere I think of the woýrds, of Robert Burns'.
But ocli mankind are unco weak,
And littie to be trusted.
If self the wavering balance shake,
'Tis rareiy riglit adjusted.
I am inciined to give the Minister the
responsibility and the power he wishes. We
shahl have to wait but a few months, and I
am inclined to watch resuits. Perhaps they
wiil be better than some of us expect. I arn
going to vote that the responsibility be given
to the Minister.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: lionourabie senators, as 1 started to say a few moments ago,
there is mucli I do not know about the
application of this Bill. Pc.rsonally, from what
I have heard, I judge that it neyer was necessary; that seif-resource and stability, properiy
utiiized, would have answered the samne purpose. But it strikes me that that is not the
question.
This Bill, when it came to us from anoth.er
place, had a section, No. 20, whieh read:
On and after a date to be fixed by pro%-.
lamation of the Governor in Council, no new
proposai shahl be made or filed by any farmer
or accepted by any Officiai Receiver in ay
province in respect of which the said proclamation is issued.
The amendment made by the Senate ccmutempiated that the Senate, not the Goverpor
in Councîl, shouid decide that in seven prov-

516

SENATE

inces out of nine the Act should cease to
function after January 1 next. I have been
sitting here during the discussions wondering what demonstrations of horror and resentment would be emanating from the other
side if it se happened that another Government were in office to-day and we undertook to usurp the prerogatives of that Government and to determine for the Governor
in Council that this Act, brought in by a
previous Government, should be discontinued
in any province. It seems te me the important point now before us is whether the
Governor in Council or the Senate, which has
decided that the Act is no good., is the better
judge of the time when this Act should cease
One of its
to function in any province.
chief proponents in the days gone by says
now it never was any good. But are we
going to say te the Government, in effect,
"You are no longer the judge; you are not
performing the functions of constitutional
government with the authority and judgment
necessary in dealing with these matters, and
we are going to do it for yeu"? It scems to
me that is really the important question, and
I should like to hear from the right honourable gentleman opposite (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen), or the honourable icader on this
side (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), if there is anything in that point, which, as a result of the
Commons declining to accept our amendiment,
appears to me to be the most important point
before us.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
members, I do not wish to be discourteous to
the honourable member; so perhaps I should
inflict myself on the House for a moment.
The Senate of itself can do nothing, can
decide nothing; the Senate and the House
of Commons can do everything and decide
everything. The Governor in Council has
no prerogatives save such as the Senate and
the House of Commons give him and do not
take away.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
senators, I may state that the House of
'Commons has net taken exception to our
:amendment on the score that it was unconstitutional or that it invaded the rights
of the executive. I have yet to learn that
Parliament could invade the rights of the
executive, since the executive is governed
by the laws that Parliament itself passes.
This message, although it expresses the
unanimous opinion of the House of Commons
that the Senate should net insist upon its
amendment, is net quite satisfactory to me,
because of the reason given, namely:
The adoption of the said anendment would
impose hardship on certain provinces.
Han. Mr. MURDOCK.

Now, we are facing two opposing opinions:
that of two members from Saskatchewan, who
say we should let the Act come to an end
on the 1st of January as far as Saskatchewan
is concerned; and that of the House of
Commons. which says that to do se would
impose a hardship in certain provinces. I am
sorry the House of Commons did not indicate
the provinces. I have just run through the
discussion which took place in the House of
Commons, and I find that there were some
representations from British Columbia. I do
not know but that there were some from
It would have been far
Manitoba also.
more satisfactory to the Senate to know in
what provinces the amendment would work
hardship. Yet, inasmuch as the House of
Commons has asked that this amendment
be not insisted upon, I have placed a motion

before the House. and I shall naturally be
satisfied with the decision of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:

Question!

The Hon. the SPEAKER: The question,
honourable senators, is on the motion of
Hon. Senator Dandurand, seconded by Right
Hon. Senator Graham, that the Senate do
not insist on its second amendnent to Bill

Arrangement Act, 1934.
Hon.
Mr.

Honourable
senators, I understand that the special committee on railway matters is desirous of

delay that meeting. With your permission,
therefore, I would move the adjournment of

JUNE 21, 1938
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: The honourable
senator from Cardigan (Hon. John A. Macdonald).
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it your pleasure
to adopt the motion for the adjournment of
the debate?
The motion of Hon. Mr. MacArthur was
negatived.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The question
now, honourable senators, is on the motion of
Hon. Senator Dandurand, seconded by Right
Hon. Senator Graham, that the Senate do not
insist on the second amendment to Bill 25.
Is it your pleasure to adopt the motion?
The motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand was
negatived.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Will some
honourable member now move that a message
be sent to the House of Commons accordingly?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think that
motion follows from the negative vote. I
think all that is necessary now is that a
message be sent to the House of Commons to
acquaint that House that the Senate insists
upon its amendment. I will so move.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
must be given.

I think reasons

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If reasons
have to be given, I do not know that I should
undertake to express them now. I do not see
why reasons are always necessary. The reason
in this case is obvious-simply that the clause
is meritorious.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Why?
would have to say why.

You

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Because the
Act should go out of effect in all provinces
except Saskatchewan and Alberta on the first
of January next. I know of no rule which
compels us to give a reason for insisting.
However, I would put our reason this way:
that in the view of this House there is no
further necessity for the Act in any of the
provinces except Saskatchewan and Alberta
after the 31st of December, 1938.
Hon. CREELMAN MacARTHUR: Honourable senators, it seems to me there will
likely be a terrible state of confusion. If a
message goes back to the Commons in that
form the Bill may be dropped altogether, and
in that case the Governor in Council would
not have the prerogative or right to take any
action and we should be worse off than we
were before.

I know I am not in order, but nobody has
spoken about the first amendment to-day.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
approved.

It

bas been

Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: I know that, but
nobody bas said why it was approved. Why
bas there been this omission? From the very
start this Bill bas been ambiguous and confusing. Even after it had passed through
criticism in the other House, it was in such a
form when it reached us that our Law Clerk
had to point out an amendment which was
necessary in order to make it constitutional.
That fact bas not been touched upon here
to-day.
Now, if the Bill is dropped altogether, where
will Prince Edward Island be? We shall be
in a state of confusion. There will be many
more jobs handed out to political appointees,
there will be a continuation of inefficiency
and of disadvantage to creditors, not only in
Prince Edward Island, but all over Canada.
It seems to me the Senate bas a duty to
perform, and that is to try to arrange a
conference with the other House. I do not
know why we cannot have one.
Hon. Mr. COPP: That is what will likely
follow.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: No, it is not.
The honourable senator from Cardigan (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) had correspondence with the
director of this Act, who says that certain
things were said and done, and who challenges
us to have an investigation and prove our
contentions in this House. Nothing would
please us better than to have an investigation.
I wanted to speak to-morrow, but honourable
members are tired and sick of hearing about
Prince Edward Island and would not give me
any assistance. However, I want to make it
plain that we are not going to stand for this
Act much longer in Prince Edward Island.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The question
before the House is the motion by Right Hon.
Senator Meighen, seconded by Hon. Senator
Griesbach, that a message be sent to the
House of Commons informing that House
that the Senate does insist upon its second
amendment to Bill 25, an Act to amend The
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, for the
following reason: That there is no further
necessity for the Act in any of the other
provinces after the 31st of December, 1938.
The motion was agreed to.

DIVORCE STATISTICS, 1938
lHon. L. McMEANS: Honourable senators,
I believe it is the custom te present, towards
the end of the session, a final report of the
Committee on Divorce.
For the present session 88 notices of
intention to apply to Parliament for bills of
divorce were given in the Canada Gazette.
There were 88 petitions actually presented in
the Senate and dealt with by the Committee
on Divorce, as follows:
Unopposed cases ieard and recommended.. ..................
82
Opposed cases heard and recommended.. .....................
4
Applications not proceeded with.. ..
2
88
Of the petitions recommended 19 were by
husbands and 67 by wives.
Of the applications recommended 84 were
from residents of the province of Quebec,
and two from the province of Prince Edward
Island.
An analysis of the occupations
followed by the applicants is as follows:
advocate, broker, caretaker, clerks, decorator,
electrician, grocer, hotel manager. importer,
insurance inspector, labourer, longshoreman,
manager, manufacturer, married women, mechanical engineer, salesman, sccretary, tailor,
textile worker, translater, waitress.
The committee held eigiteen meetings.
The Hon. the SPEAKER.

In 46 cases the Committee on Divorce
recommended that part of the parliamentary
fees be remitted.
Assuming that all the bills of divorce
recommended by the committee and now in
various stages before Parliament receive the
Royal Assent, the comparison of the number
of divorces and annulments of marriage
granted by the Parliament of Canada since
the passing of the Ontario Divorce Act is as
follows:

I would ask the indulgence of the House
while I comment on a statement made by
the honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. McRae)
wlen introducing his motion with
respect to what should be the attitude of this
louse towards applications for divorce from
certain provinces.
He made a valuable
contribution to the subject of divorce, but I
must take exception to one expression. He
stated that consideration of applications for
divorce was beneath the dignity of this Hoiuse.
I do not think the impression should prevail
throughiout the country that the Sonate is
bound by that statement.
Your Standing Committec on Divorce is
composed of nine members, of whon four are
lawyers of high standing-I apologize of course
for including myself-and one is a distinguishied
doctor; besides, four of the gentlemen are of
the highest standing in this House.
The
members of the committee very carefully
consider every application for divorce. Certainly, I do net think it is beneath the dignity
of tis House when a subject " petitions the
King," as the old expression is, to consider
his case.
I have been a member of the committee for
thirteen years. When I first entered the House
the then leader of the Government, the late
Sir James Lougheed. a gentleman, as you all
know, of the very highest legal attainmentsHon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: -was
chairman of
the Divorce Committee. He took an active
interest in its proceedings. He was followed
in the chair by the late Senator Ross, who
was also the Governnment leader in this House.
He, in turn, was followed by another leader
of the Government in this Chamber, the late
Senator Willoughby.
When his physical

JUNE 22, 1938
condition became such that he could not very
well attend to his duties, I was selected to fill
the position temporarily, it being assumed
that as soon as a new leader of this House
was selected he would follow his predecessor
in the chairmanship of the committee.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Too young.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I am afraid so.
At least he has not given the matter very
serious consideration. The honourable leader
on the other side of the House never takes
an active interest in the work of the Divorce
Committee, but I do not imagine the cause
of his lack of interest is that he thinks it
beneath his dignity to engage in such work.
Nothing affecting the interests of the people
of this country should be beneath the dignity
of the leader of the Government in this
House. In England divorce cases are tried
by the highest courts of the land, and appeals
have been taken to the Privy Council.
There is just one thing further I desire to
mention. At one time in our part of the
country we had a celebrated judge who always harped on this theme: "There is one
law for the rich and another for the poor."
The honourable judge met with some reverses,
I think, and retired from the Bench. On
Monday a very prominent member of the
other House made this statement: "I submit,
Mr. Speaker. that we are beginning to understand in this country more and more that
there is one law for the rich and another
for the poor." Such a statement is an utter
fallacy. Undoubtedly there is but one law
for the rich and the poor. But while this is
so, may I point out that the cost of invoking
the law may bear very severely on people
in straitened circumstances. Particularly is
this true in proceedings before our committee. During this session forty-eight applicants for divorce have filed affidavits pleading poverty. We cross-examined each petitioner and in most cases we found a pitiable
condition. For example, a wife is deserted by
her husband, and she finds it very difficult
to raise money for a divorce. I think it will
be found on inquiry that recently in England
legislation was enacted reducing the fees so
drastically as to make resort to the divorce
courts available to the poor as well as to
the rich.
What is going to become of people who
desire to obtain a divorce, but have not the
money to proceed? Suppose a woman is
deserted by her husband. He goes away,
and she cannot raise the money to come here.
Her life is before her. Another man comes
along, whom she likes, and they live together,
unmarried. Whether that is immoral or not
I cannot say. Perhaps my honourable friend

519

from King's (Hon. Mr. Hughes), who is much
better versed in these matters than I am,
could say.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: You are much better
versed in them than I am.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: But I would urge
upon the leader of the Government the need
of trying to establish some system by which
relief could be given to such people. I hesitate to guess how many people there are in
the great minority of the mighty province of
Quebec. Should I be wrong if I said onequarter?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: That is about
right.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: And the population of Quebec is three millions?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Two million eight
hundred thousand.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: There you have a
large minority absolutely deprived of certain
rights. I would therefore urge upon the
leader of the Government in this House that
he bring this matter before the Administration
and see if some remedy cannot be suggested.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
it is not my intention to detain you for more
than a moment. I want to assure my honourable friend the senior member from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. McMeans), and the other members of the Committee on Divorce, that it
was not my intention to reflect in any way
on the committee; and I do not think I did
so. On the contrary, I sympathize with them
in the very extensive work they are doing.
I think I did suggest that in these difficult
times their efforts might be directed to something which would be of benefit from a national
standpoint. I have the highest regard for
the members of the Divorce Committee. I
do not think there is a committee here that
has worked harder this year. Nevertheless,
it does seem to me that we could make some
better disposition in the matter of divorce.
I am not going to enter into any extended
remarks on this subject at the moment, but
I promise to bring it up early next session.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, rny honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
McMeans) has appealed to me to try to do
something to improve the situation. Like
the honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. McRae), I have the greatest sympathy
for the members of the Divorce Committee,
who have given so muoh of their time to
fulfilling a duty which was imposed upon them
by the Senate. I know that I express the
view of all their colleagues in this Chamber

520

SENATE

when I say that they have performed their
duty seriously, and it is d.oubtful that any
body, either in this Chamber or outside,
would have done the work better.
The
honourable gentleman from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. McRae) says that next session he will
propose some kind of reform. I do not
know what it will be, but I shall listen to any
proposal of his with very great interest.
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourable senators, while listening to the remarks of the
distinguished chairman of the Divorce Committee (Hon. Mr. McMeans) I came to the
conclusion that that committee's actions do
net correspond with its chairman's wishes.
The committee now seems te be looking for
work. It accepts applications from Prince
Edward Island, whieh bas a divorce court of
its own. I should like to ask the ehairman
of the committee why it does that.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
As I understand
the matter-I am not very clear on itPrince Edward Island bas the right to create
a divorce court, but it has never done so.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Oh yes, it has, and a
case bas been tried there. I must inform
my honourable colleague that the court is
composed of the Lieutenant-Governor in
Council, that is, of the Lieutenant-Governor
and at least five of his counsellors. If the
Licutenant-Governor does nut wish to act,
or cannot act, he bas the power to nominate
the Chief Justice of the province in his place.
I am simply pointing out one way by which
the Divorce Committee can relieve itself of
dealing with divorce petitions from Prince
Edward Island.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:

That must be a

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Maybe
the honourable member from King's (Hon.
Mr. Hughes) would tell us what part of the
British North America Act gives Prince
Edward Island power to appoint its own

Hon. Mr. HUGHES:

I will not enter into

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not think
your court is any good.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: The province of
Prince Edward Island had a divorce court
when it became a member of Confederation,
and bas never lost its jurisdiction in divorce
matters. That is my information, and I
think I could submit fairly good proof of it,
though I am not prepared to do so now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I only wish
to add a word of appreciation for the memb ,rs of the Divorce Committee, and the
chairman in particular. Not only do I feel
grateful to them, but I also sincerely
sympathize with them in their labours. I
should never dream of aspiring te a post so
ably filled as the post of chairman of the
Divorce Committee at present is. And,
knowing something of the work that the
committee does, I have tried not to add to
the chairman's load of responsibilities other
duties which he could very ably discharge
but for his heavy work on the Divorce Committee.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: If I were in
his place I would rather have those other
duties.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, may I call the attention of my
honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) te
the fact that he overlooked a request made
by the honourable senior senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. MeMeans), namely, that the
Government be informed of the desirability
of arranging some method by which petitions
for divorce could be presented by members
of the minority in Quebec to some body other
than Parliament.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Perhaps there
is enough wisdom within our four walls to
solve that question.
BRITISH

REPLY TO INQUIRY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: My right
honourable friend yesterday asked me whether
I was in a position to answer a certain question. Last week he asked me whether the
British Government had made a request to
the Government of Canada to establish a
training school for flyers here. I answered
him that no such request had been made.
Yesterday my right honourable friend asked
whether any conversations on the subject
had taken place.
Requests have been received from the
British Government during the past year
regarding short-service commissions for Canadians in the United Kingdom Air Force, and
the Canadian Government bas co-operated in
making the arrangements proposed.
No requests have been received from the
British Government for the establishment in
Canada of an air school or other agency of the
United Kingdom Air Force. Some informal

JUNE 22, 1938
conversations have taken place with persons
who did flot indicate tbey had been autharized or instructed by the British Government
to make any proposais. It is not customary or
desirable to refer to inquiries of this description.
Sbould any such proposais be mnade by the
Government of the United Kingdom, the
Canadian Government would of course be
prepared to discuss themn witb that Government, and at the proper time ta make its
position known ta the Canadian people.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Wauld
the honourabie leader of the Government
state whetber the persans with wbom the
Government had conversations were Canadians or ritizens of the British Isies?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It seems ta me
that informai conversations can hardly form
the basis of an inquiry in this Chamber or
the other wben they are not foilowed by some
officiai action. I simpiy surbmit that as my
own answer to my right honourable friend;
not as an answer from the Government.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: What I arn
getting at is this. Informai conversations
may be just as important as if ail the farmalities in the worid were attached. It depends
on whom they were with. Wiil the bonourabie
leader of the Government say wbhether the informai conversations were flot with a persan
who might reasonabiy have been expected ta
be feeling out the position of this Government
on behaif of the Government of Britain?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 cannot answer
the query of my right honourable friend as ta
whomn they were with. It wauid strike me as
extraordinary that informai conversations
should produce rumours which would reach
this Chamber or the other and form the
basis for a query as ta the action of the Government on such conversations.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do flot se
anything extraordînary about that.

On the Orders of the Day:
HonourHon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
able senators, it is my great priviiege ta draw
the attention of my colleagues ta the fact
that one of aur members is at present surrounded by rases. I refer ta the bonourable
senator fram Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Faliis).
Ta-day marks a milestone in ber life. The
passing of milestones is an annual occurrence, but upon certain of aur coileagues it
seems ta have no effect. During the f ew
years the hanourable member fromn Peterborough bas been witb us, we bave enjoyed
ber companionship and have appreciated ber
quaiities, so essentially feminine, and ber
charma and kindliness. It gives me great
pleasure ta tell my bonourabie friend that
wben I look across at the opposite ranks-seidomn da I bave an oppartunity of glancing
backwards or sideways--I find ber presence
a pieasing variation, for she is a giariaus
exception ta the drabness of ber colleagues.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, bear.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I tbink it was
fortunate for us that representatives of the
weaker sex exerted themselves and obtained
fram the Privy Council the rigbt of eiigibiiity
far appaintment ta this Chamber. We are al
the better for the presence among us of twa
lady members (Hon. Mrs. Wilson and Hon.
Mrs. Fallis).

522

SENATE

I sincerely wish many happy returns of the
day to my honourable friend from Peterborough.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I join in the felicitations
expressed by the honourable leader of the
House. In many things I could never hope to
compete with him. Particularly in the sphere of
gallantry, he is in a class by himself, Honourable members will have noticed with what
subtlety and skill he omitted all reference to
any number of years. Of such an omission he
was never guilty before, to my knowledge.
We do appreciate the presence of the two
lady members of this House, because of their
modesty, their judgment, and the high value
of service which they render to the public.
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN:
Honourable
senators, I would only suggest, by way of
amendment, that we do not add to the number
of roses placed on the desk of the honourable senator (Hon. Mrs. Fallis) in future, for
we can see from her appearance that she does
not get any older.
Hon. IVA CAMPBELL FALLIS: Honourable senators, I need scarcely tell you that
I very deeply appreciate all the kind things
which have been said. I especially appreciate
the remarks of the honourable leader of the
House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand). I may say
now in public, what I have said to him privatelySome Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: It is net as bad as
that. I have said it to many others too. It
is this. When I, one of the weaker sex, so
called, was appointed to the Senate, I felt a
certain timidity about entering this stronghold of the male, although the way had been
beautifully paved for me, five years before, by
my honourable colleague from Rockcliffe
(Hon. Mrs. Wilson). The way has been made
easier by the kindness and consideration shown
to me by all honourable members, and particularly by the honourable gentleman who
leads this House. For bis consistent kindness to me as well as for wbat he bas said
to-day, I wish to offer him my heartfelt
thanks.
The right honourable leader on this side
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) was quite apt in
his remarks, as ahvays. I recall that last week,
when be bad occasion to reply to congratulations tendered him, be gave a gentle admonition to the leader of the House that in
future it would not be necessary to mention
the number of years. Perhaps that admonition fell on fruitful ground; or it may be
that the honourable leader realized that, after
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

all, ho would be a brave man who would
disclose a woman's age in public. An bonourable senator opposite asked me when I
came in this afternoon if I had counted the
roses on my desk. I said that of course I
did not need to count them, that naturally the
number would not be more than twenty-one,
for no woman's age ever passes that.
I thank you all for making this one of the
happiest birthdays I have ever celebrated.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend will perhaps understand the
expression -better than I do, for he sat on
both sides of that House. I have been
informed, to my surprise, that Parliament may
prorogue toward the end of next week. As
honourable members know, we have an
important measure before our Railway- Committee just now, the Transport Bill, upon
which that committee will resume work as
soon as we adjourn this sitting to await the
arrival of the Deputy of the Governor General.
I fear that discussion on the measure will

if we met in the Senate for a short time
Monday evening we could go back to the
Railway Committee then and dispose of the
Transport Bill before midnight. On Tuesday
morning that committee could deal with other
measures which have been referred to it, and
endeavour to clean its slate so as to be in
position to take up additional pieces of legislation that are likely to come to us from the
Commons-the Housing Bill, among others.
Perhaps my right honourable friend could
arrange to be present for the sitting of the
Senate on Monday evening and the committee
meeting on Tuesday morning. I am in his
hands.
Right Hon. 'Mr. MEIGHEN: I suppose
considerable work remains to be done on the

why we should not finish with that Bill this
afternoon. If we did that, we could have a

consideration on that day, and other measures.

by the Senate to Bill No. 25, intituled, An

Act to amend The Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934, to which this House disagrees
and upon which the Senate insists, and any
amendment which at such Conference it may
be considered desirable to make to the said

Bill or amendments thereto.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved:
Resolved that a message be sent to the House
of Commons to acquaint that House that the
Senate accedes to its request for a Free Conference with the Senate, for the purpose of
considering certain amendments made by the
Senate to Bill 25, intituled: "An Act to amend
the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934,"
to which the House of Commons has disagreed,
and upon which the Senate insists; that the
Senate have named the Honourable Senators
Beaubien, Dandurand, Haig and Meighen as
managers on their part at the Free Conference,
and also that the Managers of the Free Conference on the part of the Senate will meet in
Senate Committee Room 258, at 2.30 o'clock
p.m. on Wednesday, June 29.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Honourable
senators, I am of course quite agreeable to the
conference. But I must express disappointment that the honourable gentleman from
King's (Hon. Mr. Hughes) is not one of the
Managers.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The House of
Commons had suggested three Managers and
we have named four. I thought we should
stop there.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

THE TURGEON GRAIN INQUIRY
COMMISSION
DISCUSSION
Hon. A. B. GILLIS: Honourable senators,
I have delayed calling attention to the Turgeon
Grain Inquiry Commission, hoping that the
Government
would
introduce
legislation
implementing the commission's report; but
now, I understand, it is definitely settled that
nothing is to be done along that line this
session or maybe ever. It is evident, therefore,
that the report is net considered of much
value.

JUNE 28, 1938
I have a few observations to make in regard
to this report.
Appointing commissions to deal with various
public matters appears to have become a
habit. When the Government is faced with
problems it cannot solve, it appoints commissions to deal with them. We have had many
commissions appointed to seek solutions of
various matters.
I am informed that during the last two
years more than a million dollars has been
spent on royal commissions, among them the
Turgeon Grain Inquiry Commission. In the
last ten or fifteen years we have had four
commissions investigating the grain trade.
First we had the Turgeon commission of
1923-24. Then in 1931 we had the Stamp
commission. In Saskatchewan, a few years
ago, we had a commission under Chief Justice
Brown. Now we have a second Turgeon
commission.
It is strange that the personnel of those
commissions were nearly all lawyers. When
an investigation such as the grain inquiry
is deemed advisable, why should we engage
a battery of lawyers, passing over the heads
of the Government permanent service? I
suggest that in our Civil Service we have a
body of men equipped with thorough knowledge and experience of the business interests
of the country and its trade and commerce.
That is the reason why they are in the
country's service. Yet we turn aside from
them and employ at a high rate of pay a
number of lawyers, who in their profession
may be able men, but who cannot be
considered as students and experts of the
business to be investigaýted.
I wish to direct the attention of the House
to one of the Governxment's answers to my
inquiries. At page 304 of Senate Hansard my
question is stated thus:
What matters or facts relating to the grain
industry of Canada that were heretofore unknown to Parliament and men in the industry
did the Turgeon Royal Commission on Grain
discover and report upon to the Government

and Parliament?
The answer to that inquiry is in these
words:
The

inquiry

related

chiefly

to

economie

matters and facts. These are listed and related
in the report in such a way that a proper and
considered judgment may be derived from them.
It is impossible to state what facts or matters

were "unknown to Parliament and men in the
industry."

So the Government itself cannot direct us
positively to a single new matter or fact
elicited by the royal commission. Then in
what way does the inquiry into economic
matters benefit the producer or improve existing conditions?

527

I am glad to note that the commissioner
gave some credit to Mr. McFarland for the
splendid work he did for the grain producers.
Mr. McFarland was general manager of the
central selling agency of the Wheat Pool.
When he took charge, wheat was selling
around forty cents. By an enterprising action,
backed by the Bennett Government, be succeeded in stabilizing prices, thus creating better conditions. No one perhaps is in a position to say positively the precise amount of
money the farmers of Western Canada received for their wheat, through those stabilizing operations, more than they would have
received had the Federal Government left
Canadian producers at the mercy of the
futures market; but it was substantial.
In a recent published statement J. I. McFarland said:
It is impossible to compute the price benefit
received by the people of this Dominion during
the past four years, as a result of the support

of the price structure under the guarantee by
the Bennett Government. Unprejudiced observers of world market conditions, of production figures, and of the enormously reduced
constructive speculative factors, have estimated
such benefits at upwards of 200 millions of
dollars. It is now quite evident that without
government support in these years, the futures
system would have failed in its essential
function.
This estimate appears to many as being
entirely too low. In the four years when the
central selling agency provided the only
actively functioning hedging market for wheat,
approximately a billion and a half bushels of
Canadian wheat were sold by the farmers.
If the Government had done nothing, the
prices of wheat might have fallen so low
that it would have been worth little more than
freight and elevator charges, and widespread
bankruptcy of éthe Western farming population would have resulted in not nearly so much
wheat being grown. The farmers, however,
have been able to continue producing, even if
wheat prices have been unprofitable. They
could not have continued producing if a hedging market had not been provided, as there
was a surplus of unwanted wheat in the
world, which could not be sold.
These benefits are the result of the courageous policy of R. B. Bennett and the grim
determination of J. I. McFarland, without
the aid of any royal commission and without
extra expense to the country. Despite all the
good he had done, Mr. McFarland was a target of attack for politicians, and was finally
dismissed when a change of government occurred. I may say that during the four years
he gave his services to the country without

528

SENATE

remuneration, accepting only actual living
expenses.
Why did the commission not recommend
some system of contribution to the wheat
farmers to stabilize prices? The Government of the United States bas contributed
hundreds of millions to the wheat producers
of that country; Australia is giving its wheat
farmers annually a bonus of between ten
and thirteen million dollars; and European
governments have assisted their wheat growers to the extent of billions instead of millions.
I do not believe that the producers will
look with any degree of favour on the suggestion that a supervisor of the Winnipeg
Grain Exchange be appointed, or that a
permanent representative be established in
London to investigate complaints arising out
of grain shipments. This would only create
two additional high-salaried positions. Surely,
as far as London is concerned, the regular
officials of our Trade Commissioner can look
after such matters. As for an inspector in
Winnipeg, be would be only a walking delegate
drawing salary and doing nothing.
The commissioner recommends a continuation of the Winnipeg Grain Exchange. I will
not go into this matter further than to say
that the grain producers of the West consider it nothing but a gambling institution
which is more or less responsible for the
fluctuations that occur from time to time in
the grain market.
In regard to the last grain inquiry, I am
informed there was correspondence between
the Honourable the Minister of Trade and
Commerce and Mr. Justice Turgeon to the
effect that the Judge did not look upon the
proposed investigation with any degree of
favour.
As for the other commissions, I am not
prepared to say what was the cost to the
country, but I have no doubt it was considerable.
When I speak of the battery of lawyers
engaged in these investigations I do not refer
to the eminent jurist who was head of the
Royal Commission on Grain. I have known
Hon. Mr. Justice Turgeon for a long time.
I sat with him for several years in the Saskatchewan Legislature, and can safely say that
I have always found him fair and most bonourable.
I am going to deal with the cost of this
last commission. In the return brought down
in this House, a few days ago, we find that
the cost so far amounts to 8140,749.19. The
return shows the amounts paid for services,
for travel, and for living expenses. The comHon. Mr GILLIS.

missioner received, an allowance of $12,880
and travelling expenses $2,911.34; a total of
$15,791.34. Mr. Ralston, an eminent lawyer,
had a living allowance of $3,675, legal fees
of $37,399, and travelling allowance $1,577.95,
or a total ýof $42,651.95. Mr. Coyne, the assistant legal adviser, had a living allowance
of $2,470. legal fees of $18,475, and travelling
expenses $1,308.74, or a total of $22,253.74. He
probably lived in cheaper quarters than Mr.
Ralston, as his living allowance was $1,000
less.
Then, peculiar to relate, we find that these
three eminent legal gentlemen had to call in
a fourth, Mr. W. C. Hamilton, who received
legal fees amounting to $3,700 and travelling
expenses of $196.93. All tliese figures added
together make a total of $84,593.96 for the
legal side of the inquiry, or approximately
60 per cent of the total cost of the commission.
Furthermore, the commission had a secretary at a cost of $6,301.55, and an assistant
secretary at a cost of $5,033.57, the total
being $11.335.12.
Now, this expenditure, which is very large,
would not be considered unreasonable if the
commission had accomplished any results that
might be regarded as helpful to the grain
producer. But in tîat respect, like all other
commissions appointed for the same purpose,
it bas been an absolute failure. Why did the
commission not recommend the re-establishment of the Wheat Board, which did so much
for the Western farmer? Why did it not
recommend the stabilizing of prices? Had it
done so, it might have accomplished something. From the present outlook there is every
hope of a bountiful harvest in many parts
of the Prairie Provinces, and I appeal to
the Government to do something to guarantee
prices. If it does this, it will be of great
assistance not only to the producer, but to
the whole of Canada.
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
It will be
readily realized that I am in a somewhat disadvantageous position, inasmuch as I have
no expert knowledge on the subject brought
up by my honourable friend from Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Gillis). At different times the
suggestion bas been made that ministers of
the Crown should come to this Chamber to
take part in debate and answer questions
relating to matters administered by their
respective departments. I myself have proposed that, as have some of my colleagues
under different regimes. I regret that the suggestion bas never been put into effect. For
the time being, it is my duty to answer questions concerning activities of all departments.

JUNE 28, 1938
I would. submit to my honourable friend that
his criticism of the employment of lawyers
and judges on royal commissions of investigation is not a just one. Let laymen say what
they will, members of the legal profession
derive from their training and experience a
general knowledge of things. In the course
of practice they have to study thousands of
questions of all kinds and to advise clients
upon them. This does not mean that they
acquire a monopoly of knowledge about all
these subjects, but, in general, laymen and
men of other professions are not so well
equipped to grasp the fundamentals of such
matters as are dealt with by royal commissions, many of which matters are of an intricate character and, involve constitutional
and legal points.
My honourable friend has suggested an investigation into the appointment of royal commissions. In the Senate we have had discussions before on this question. It is one that
may be approached from different angles.
From time to time problems arise which the
Government itself is unable to study thoroughly, and concerning which the detailed knowledge required for the formation of opinion
can be obtained only by a body appointed
specially to make full inquiry. In such instances all governments, of whatever hue, have
resorted to the appointment of commissions.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Not very many in the
past.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I had a list of,
I think, some fifteen or twenty that were appointed under the preceding Administration,
during the Bennett régime. I believe my
honourable friend will find that it has been
the custom of all governments since 1867 to
appoint commissions for the study of special
matters, and that these appointments have
become more numerous as the country has
developed.
My honourable friend has criticized the appointment of Hon. Mr. Justice Turgeon on
the Grain Commission. As honourable members know, he was commissioner on the textile inquiry. From witnesses high and low,
who appeared before that body, I have received nothing but encomiums of his lucid
mind and his fairness. Even witnesses who
felt that their actions were being investigated
and that they might be penalized in consequence of the commission's report, praised
the commissioner as a man who could understand their point of view and discuss it in a
clear and intelligent manner.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: I would remind the
honourable gentleman that I did not say a
word in disparagement of Mr. Justice Tur-

geon. I did not reflect on him in any way.
I am well acquainted with his ability and
honesty.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then the objection is directed to his having been taken
away from his duties as a member of the
Saskatchewan Bench.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: There is no
objection on that ground. He had not a
thing to do.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Then there
cannot be any objection at all.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There can be
no objection whatever to his undertaking
other work if he had nothing to do on the
Saskatchewan Bench. There is perhaps something to be said in favour of a suggestion
made to the Rowell Commission that the
courts of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta
should be merged.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I suppose that
would meet with the approval of this Chamber.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But we must
accept the situation as it is in that respect.
My honourable friend, I understand, criticizes
the report of the commission more particularly
for what it omits.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: He may have
read the report. I have not, because I have
had no time. I shall do so as soon as I am
free of my obligations in this House. That
report is now before the Government, and
action will be taken on it even without legislation, for, as my honourable friend knows,
the Government has some authority in the
matter.
My honourable friend says that the Government has donc nothing to stabilize wheat
prices, and that the Bennett Government did
come to the help of the farmers of the West
in this respect. I would remind him that the
present Government has followed the policy
of rendering them assistance. I speak subject
to correction, but I believe that throughout
the Dominion the only instance in which prices
were fixed was in favour of the wheat growers
of the West.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: They are not fixed
now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I understand
that the matter will be dealt with. I wonder
if the honourable senator from Saskatchewan

51955-.4
REVISED !DITION

530

SENATE

is justified in charging the present Government with failure to do its duty towards the
wheat farmers of his province. I doubt
whether any Government has been more
solicitous for the welfare of the farmers of
the West, and especially the farmers of
Saskatchewan. We all know of the calamity
that befell the farmers of that province, and
of the millions of dollars that the Federal
Treasury bas devoted to helping them.
I would remind my honourable friend that
in the present Government are three men
who are no mean representatives of public
opinion in the West. The Minister of Agriculture, an ex-Premier of Saskatchewan,
travelled constantly between Saskatchewan
and Ottawa during the drought and introduced
relief measures representing expenditures of
millions of dollars. I know something of
this, as I happened to preside at Council.
Never did we hesitate for a moment to come
to the rescue of Saskatchewan. Another exPremier of Saskatchewan sits in the Council,
the Hon. Mr. Dunning, who knows something
about the West, and who as Minister of
Finance consented to the expenditure of
millions of dollars for relief of Western farmers
-money which would have helped to maintain
our financial equilibrium and render possible a
budget surplus. The third gentleman to whom
I refer is the Right Honourable the Prime
Minister of Canada, who sits for a Saskatchewan riding. I doubt whether the province
has ever before been so well or so largely
represented in the Cabinet.
I am sorry my honourable friend bas brought
forward this matter. It bas already been
dealt with in the other Chamber, where
Saskatchewan is well represented. As my
honourable friend knows, criticism is easy,
but action is sometimes difficult.
He bas referred to the cost of royal commissions. I would point out that when we
decide to appoint a royal commission to
make an investigation, we must be prepared
to meet the expense which such an investigation involves.
I am not in a position to advise my honourable friend as to what legislation will be
introduced this session to implement the
Turgeon report, but I may be able to give
him an answer to-morrow.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators, I take issue with the honourable leader
of this House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) with
respect to what the present Government bas
donc for the wheat growers of Saskatchewan.
This Government abolished the W'heat Board
and discontinued set prices, and we were
left to the mercy of the market with the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND

rest of our wheat, which was given away
before any set price was named. I know
personally men who made thousands of dollars
gambling in wheat after the set price was
discontinued, two years ago tihis July. I
said then that every bushel of wheat would be
required here, because there were not more
than 230,000,000 bushels of wheat in all
Canada; that our elevators would be empty
and we would be importing wheat for our
own purposes. I said it was a shame and a
calamity for the new board appointed by the
present Government to be giving away the
farmers' wheat without any safeguards. Our
farmers had an equity in their wheat. Many
of them wished to sell to the board and take
participation tickets in the expectation that
when the wheat was sold there would be some
money coming to them. Had they known the
new board was going to put the wheat on the
market without any thought for their interest,
they would have retained their wheat in their
own granaries. What happened? In spite of
every Liberal member from the province of
Saskatchewan urging the Government to set a
price of not less than $1-in fact many asked
for $1.15-the wheat was soldHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
fixed was 90 cents.

The amount

Hon. Mr. HORNER: It was fixed at 871
cents. We were absolutely debarred from
using the Wheat Board unless the price
dropped below 90 cents.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. HORNER: The farmers wanted
to hold their wheat. They were ready to sell
it on the basis I have indicated. But word
went around to the elevators that they could
not do so. There was to be no board unless
the price went below 90 cents. The wheat
was sold away below the proper price. A lot
was sold to speculators; not grain growers, but
gamblers.
In this Chamber and in the other we hear
sanctimonious speeches in opposition to
hospital sweepstakes, on the ground that
sweepstakes encourage gambling. In my view,
the Winnipeg Grain Exchange is one of the
greatest gambling institutions in the world.
All kinds of unfair methods are resorted to
there to deprive the farmer of a fair price
for his grain.
But that is not the worst feature. When
you buy a sweepstake ticket at $2.50, that is
all you lose. I know farmers who have lost
not only all their money, but their farms as
well. They put up so much money on wheat.
Then the market weakened and they had to
put up more money to cover their holdings.

JUNE 28, 1938
Now, every elevator agent throughout the
country is an agent for the Winnipeg Grain
Exchange. The records show that the entire
wheat crop of Canada was sold forty-one times
on the Winnipeg Grain Exchange. There is
an expense of 10 cents a bushel, apart from
all other charges, in marketing wheat. The
elevator agent in the country, in order to
earn his salary, must make money for his
employer. He does not say openly to the
farmers that they should buy or sell. No.
Instead of doing that, he will be standing
among a group of farmers and will remark,
"If I had the money I would sell to-day"; or,
"If I had the money I would buy to-day."
The next thing you will see a farmer going
to his elevator, and for every thousand bushels
of wheat bought from the company that agent
gets $3.50 commission. If he sells the wheat
a certain number of times, you can see how
much he makes in commissions.
My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Gillis)
has criticized the expense of the Turgeon
Commission. I notice there is an allowance of
$35 a day for living expenses. I can take
honourable members to farm families in which
husband and wife, both working very hard
and raising a little family, do not see $35
in cash during the entire year. I am convinced
that Mr. Justice Turgeon could have written
his report without assistance from legal counsel. We all know that he has a thorough
understanding of the grain question. I submit
there was no need of this heavy expense for
legal assistance.
If the Government wishes to do something
for the farmers of Western Canada, why not
give them a futures market for live stock?
There is no such market in Canada that I
know of. We send our cattle to certain points
where they are bought at a stated price by one
packer to-day and by another packer tomorrow. We all know that hogs must be sold
at a certain weight. Grain can be stored for
a year or more. Apparently there is a disposition to insist on our having a futures
market for wheat-sonething we do not need
at all. Surely in this civilized age we should
not encourage a gambling racket in order to
dispose of something that constitutes the livelihood of the people of Western Canada. That
is all I wish to say at the present time.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable members, I was not privileged to hear
the criticism by the honourable senator from
Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Gillis) of the Turgeon
report on the wheat situation of Western
Canada. I have listened with considerable
interest to the remarks of the honourable
gentleman from Saskatchewan North (Hon.
Mr. Horner), who has just taken his seat. I
51958-34à

531

shall not attempt to deal with his references
to the possibility of a futures market for live
stock and the sincerity of opposition to the
Sweepstakes Bill; but I would point out that
his description of the recent action of the
Wheat Board as being equivalent to engaging
in selling wheat to gamblers is slightly overdone, and is wholly unsupported by evidence
of any kind.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: It is a well-known
fact, and there is evidence to prove it, that
the entire crop has been sold forty-one times.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: The statement
just made by the honourable member may
be true of the turnover on an average crop
in a year when the Wheat Board was not
in existence, but the fact is that the Wheat
Board, over which Mr. Murray presided from
the time he was appointed late in 1935 until
a year ago, sold the wheat direct to the
exporters and consumers of wheat without
any intermediate gambling process whatsoever.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Oh, yes, he sold on
the Grain Exchange.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT:
Excuse me. I
should like to finish this statement.
When Mr. Murray took charge of the
Wheat Board the wheat situation was one
that anybody with any memory at all can
picture without difficulty. Wheat had accumulated in the hands of the Government of
this country to the extent of over 300 million
bushels. If there is any suggestion of speculation in connection with the policy of selling
grain or wheat, it surely can be charged
against the operations of the Wheat Board
during the three or four years prior to the
advent of Mr. Murray as chairman. He sold
the accumulations of the board of the three
previous years, as well as the harvest of the
succeeding years, at prices far exceeding those
which had prevailed during the previous years;
and for the greater part the fixed price of
871 cents was not drawn upon at any time
during Mr. Murray's régime. It is truc that
there was established a 90-cent provisional
price, at which wheat would begin to be
accumulated by the board, and be paid for
at 871 cents; but I draw my honourable
friend's attention to the fact that subsequently
wheat never reached that price. The farmers
sold most of their wheat at over $1 a bushel
that year.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: There were some
hundred million bushels of wheat sold below
S7ý cents at a time when it was evident to
any schoolboy in Canada that there was a
crop failure, and wheat never stopped going

SENATE

532

My complaint is
ip till it reached $1.50.
that my wheat, as well as the wheat of other
farmers, was deliberately sold off before the
price was set.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I think the honourable senator made the statement that after
the price was fixed at 87½ or 90 cents, wheat
was deliberately soldHon. Mr. HORNER:

Before.

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Before. Very well,
I think it is only fair to say that the Wheat
Board, which was charged with the sale of
wheat in this country, having on hand over
300 million bushels, involving many millions
of dollars of publie money, was justified in
liquidating that amount and relieving the
people of this country from the overhanging
burden that had aecumulated during the previous three or four years. After Mr. Murray came into the administration of the wheat
sales policy be did sell very freely in order to
liquidate that amount and to relieve the
exchequer of Canada from that burden; but
he more than made up for it by sales following the fixing of the market on the basis of
871 cents and the provisional figure of 90
cents; and I still question very definitely the
statement of the bonourable senator (Hon.
Mr. Hornier) that Mr. Murray during that
time sold wheat to gamblers. I think my honourable friend's statement in that respect is
absolutely unwarranted, and I would suggest
to hin that he bas no evidence whatever in
support of it.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Except that I bought
some myself, and made some money on it.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT:

Hon. Mr. HORNER: Will the honourable
senator argue that the wheat was consumed
so much faster that it all disappeared? What
was donc nerely meant that someone got

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I suggest to the
honourable senator that be is confusing the
facts. The wheat sales policy of this country
was te dispose of the surplus of wheat and te
relieve the country from financial embarrassment.

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: And te relieve the
farmer of the embarrassment of an overshadowing proportion of wheat which would
have prevented him from getting the price that
he did get in the fall seasons of 1935, '36
and '37.
I should like te refer te one other matter,
and that is the statement made earlier in
the session in the other House that 7,000,000
bushels of wheat represented a speculative
enterprise on the part of the Wheat Board.
Anyone who knows the facts knows that if it
had net been for the foresight and wisdom
of the chairman of the Wheat Board last
year Western Canada, and particularly Saskatchewan, would have been in very dire
straits in the matter of seed wheat. But the
prevision of the chairman of the Wheat Board
enabled him te foresee the shortage of the
higher grades of wheat, and, he succeeded
in allocating some 7,000,000 bushels of No. 1
and No. 2 Northern grades when they were
selling at a premium of 1, 2 and 3 cents over
the option in the Winnipeg market. Later
on these same grades of wheat, which were
represented in the seed requirements of the
country, went te a prenium of 24 or 25
cents a bushel over the option; but owing
te the policy of the Wheat Board, supported
by the Wheat Committee of the Government,
the farmers of Western Canada were assured
net only of a supply of geod seed wheatHon. Mr. ASELTINE:

At $1.50.

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: No. sir; it was on
The S1.50 a bushel te
the average pr.ice.
which my honourable friend refers was the
top price that was registered for the option
during that period. The seed wheat was made
available to those who required it, at an
average price over the period.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:

What was that price?

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I shall indicate it
in a moment. But the supply of seed wheat
would never have been available te my honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Horner) and
his farmer friends in Saskatchewan if it had
net been for the prevision and wisdom of Mr.
Murray and his associates. They bought their
supply at a small premium over the option,
and carried it in the elevators and made it
available at a price wbich was the average
price over those nontbs. They did net profiteer
in consequence of their correctness of judgment, but made the supply available at cost.
I should like te make that very clear, because
<lue credit bas net been given in either House

to the actions of the Wheat Board; and if
I were to offer any criticism of the Turgeon
Commission it would be that it did not give
due credit to the record of the Wheat Board
for the past two years.
Mr. Murray resigned as chairman of the
Wheat Board a year ago this coming July,
when hie had, finished his work, realizing that
during the period in which he had funetioned the supplies had been consistently
liquidated, in keeping with the policy of the
Government to seli the overhanging surplus
of wheat. I think this country owes him a
debt of gratitude for the work be did, and
I only regret that his condition of bealth
prevents him from continuing for another
year.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Would the honourable
gentleman answer my question as to the price
the Saskatchewan farme-rs had to pay for the
wheat?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I indicated that
in a general way.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Gîve me the figure.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I cannot give you
an exact figure, but I can indicate it to you.
It was an average figure arrived at on the
basis of the cost of the wheat after carrying
it for several months.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yoii do not know wbat
it was.
H-on. Mr. HORNER: After carrying somne
of -it down the lakes and bringing it back to
the West again.
Hon. HENRY A. MULLINS: Honourable
senators, I have noV taken up much of the
time of the House this session, but having lived
in thc province of Manitoba since the year
wben we shipped 875 bushels of wheat, I cannot help thinking of the various ways in
which the grain farmer bas been exploited
down through the years. While I listened to
the honourable senator from Saskatchewan
(Hon. Mr. Gillis) my thoughts went back to
the various corporations that sprang up. wbich
were to be of great assistance to the farmers
of the West. Men went out there to work
the land and to pioneer the country. Then
these great saviours came along. I ar n ot
going to quarrel with the legal gentlemen,
because I have one on each side of me here;
but when I think of the enorinous fees they
receive I cannot but believe they are doing
pretty well. I have noV had much to do with
lawyers, baving had only one lawsuit in my
life. A cow of mine broke a man's leg and I
was sued for damages, and Charlie Millar
was tny lawyer on that occasion. The legal

538

fees that are beîng charged remind me, by
contrast, of the old pioneers slaving on the
land. I lived among the pioneers, and I have
always been glad that I was engaged in the
cattle business rather than in the wheat business, wbere a person could be exploited. in
the way described by the honourable senator
from Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Gillis) and the
other honourable senator opposite (Hon. Mr.
Horner).
I bave heard a lot about James Murray, and
I want Vo say this about bim. He is smart
and clever. He is the clevcrest trader there
is in the West. I pay that tribute to Mrý
Murray, whom I know well personally. But
I wonder if the farmer got the value for hie
wheat-if he got ahl that was coming to him.,
Wby did we budget in the oCher House for a
loss of $15,000,000 on that wheat? We neyer
needed to incur that loss. The wheat ran up
too quickly for those who were bandling it,
when it went to $1.45 or $1.50; that was the
trouble. I bad more faith that things would
turn out aIl right when Mr. McFarland was
bandling the wheat. I believe that had lie
been left in charge a good many million
dollars would bave gone back to the farmers.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: He would not bave
sold it.
Hon. Mr. MULLINS: Instead of spending
on royal commissions such enormous sums as
we bave heard about to-day, it would be
better to go over to Scotland and buy a few
pure-bred bulis and bring tbem out to this
country. In that way we should be givîng
the farmers something that would be of belp
to tbem. I was told only this morning by
one hoûourable senator that a herd of cattie
whicb be had fattened in the West bad just
been sold by him at home for $5.75 a hundred.
I know of several other sales at very good
prices. I see an honourable gentleman fromn
Ontario wbo put through a sale at 87.25.
These prices indicate that the farmer makes a
mistake when hie bothers with wbeat and
leaves himself open to be exploited. The
growing of an exclusive wheat crop is al
wrong. Unless the farmer goes in for mixed
crops and farms the way tbat the Almighty .itended, there will be a f ailure in Western
Canada.
My memory goes back to the time whç)

years. It also showed that instead of selling he
purchased more options-not wheat, but
options; that is, he speculated in futures.

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN:
ourable senators-

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes, and he
was right in doing so.
He did not take
advantage of small bulges in the market. He
waited for the day which, after a survey of
the world-wide wheat field, he saw coming;
and he was right.
The Govearnment which saved Western
Canada was not the present Government. It
is true that this Administration unloaded and
released us from our obligations. When the
market came right in front of it the Government jumped. It jumped a little too soon.
but I do not find fault for that, even though
seed had to be bought later at a higher price.
But what I want to emphasize is that it did
take real courage and a lot of it to carry the
grain of the whole Empire through those bad
years that we experienced. I remember some
of the criticism that was expressed. I had to
face a lot of it. It was pretty hard to defend
the policy then in Eastern Canada, where the
main burden of credit was sustained. But
what was done was justified in the event.
The service rendered was a tremendous one,
comparable with which I know of nothing in
the history of our Western land. I do not
know that it has had much reward.

Hon-

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: May I suggest
to my right honourable friend, who knows of
the work before some of our committees, that
if he has extended remarks to make he could
perhaps adjourn the debate for the time
being, so that we might be free to leave here
now and proceed to the committees. It seems
to me that if this somewhat academie discussion is to go on, it could be postponed for a
little while.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: My honourable friend knows that my remarks are never
extended. I rise only to make a comment on
the general wheat policy of the Administration
of late years. I do not at all question the
wheat-trading ability of Mr. Murray; nor do
I question the general wheat-trading and other
capacities of Mr. McFarland. Both are very
able men. But to compare the loss under Mr.
McFarland and that under Mr. Murray is
like comparing the ability of a burglar at night
with his ability in the noonday sun. When
markets are glutted the world over, when
prices fall to starvation levels, how is a man
to sell? It takes courage then to hold; and
great was the courage of the Administration
which on Mr. McFarland's advice held through
those very bad years. That policy saved
Western Canada from desolation.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But for that
there would have been nothing short of
desolation throughout the West.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: True, as prices
rose Mr. Murray sold. He sold too soon, but
nobody can be 100 per cent right; at least,
I cannot.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And no one can
say what the morrow will bring.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: May I ask my right
honourable friend whether he has taken the
trouble to peruse the records of the special
Wheat Committee, under the chairmanship of
the then Prime Minister, which sat towards
the end of the 1935 session? I think the
evidence given before that committee showed
conclusively that the head of the wheat selling agency of that day did not sell when the
market went up, on three occasions: earlier in
that year, and in each of the two preceding
Hon. Mr. MULLINS.

Hon. Mr. MARSHAIL: Does my right
honourable friend not think that lack of rain
had more than anything else to do with the
increased price?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: But we are
only one countryHon. Mr. MARSHALL: They had a dust
bowl in the United States.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Mr. McFarland had nothing to do with the price of
wheat, neither had Mr. Murray. Tremendous
criticism and risk had to be faced in carrying
through, but the stake was Western Canada.
What was done had to be done. I know
there has not been very much recognition
of it. Looking back over the results of the
last twenty-five years, one can 'hardly escape
the conclusion that two things are necessary
in order to get the Western vote. The first
is to do absolutely nothing at all, and the
second is to promise very much. And the
one sure way to lose that vote is to give
practical and courageous help. However, all
that is by the way. There was a rig'ht
thing to do and a wrong thing to do; a strong
thing and a weak thing; and the right and
strong thing was done.

JUNE 28, 1938
The honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) said that some fifteen commissions had
been appointed by the preceding Government.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think there
were more.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: But they were
different kinds of commissions altogether.
There was the Duif Commission, which was
comparable with nothing which we have had.
And there was the Stamp Commission.
Surely if ever any man should have been able
to give us some help in our grain business it
was Sir Josiah Stamp. Besides, there was the
Price Spreads Commission, which was a continuation of a committee of the other Hbuse.
The rest were appointed to make some special
investigations, in relation to alleged misconduct of iudg-es, and things of that kind. But
the practice of authorizing -commissions to inquire into ordinary matters of policy and
administration was not in vogue. One could
hardly get a better instance of that practice
than in the appointment of this Turgeon
Commission. I have an admiration for Judge
Turgeon; he is a competent man, and I had
to do with lis appointment to the Bench.
I do not know what of any value the Government felt he would find out which would
differ from what was already known about the
grain trade. I criticize the creation of the
commission on that ground, not because of
Mr. Justice Turgeon.
Then the honourable leader says that
lawyers are necessary on these bodies. I
admit that. But what experience did Colonel
Ralston have to make him especially useful
in relation Vo the grain problem of Western
Canada? There is no one in this House to
whom I yield in admiration for Colonel
Raîston as a lawyer and -a man. H1e has
great capacity and is very industrious. But
if ever a man came Vo a task without the
faintest trace of experience Vo assist him. in
the discharge of it, Colonel Raîston did when
he came Vo this grain inquiry. What reasons
were there for paying to Colonel Raîston
froin the treasury of this country the fees
which his high standing and great ability
command? Besides, he hýad two or three
assistants. I say Vo the honourable leader
that the results of the commission's work are
not en.ough to cover the palm of one's hand.
My hünourable friend says: "We are looking
after the West sedulously and conscientiously.
We are pouring out money in the drought
areas." I know that. That is the only Vhing
to do. Surely that is not a policy, and surely

535

it does not take any courage Vo do it. That
is simply following up what was done before,
certainly just as thoroughly and, I Vhink,
more fairly, under just as dire cirdumstances.
My honourable friend tells us that Mr. Gardiner is a very busy man who is ont in the
West repeatedly and îs looking after that
part of the, country ail the time. I know he
is. I think he has n-ot missed a by-election
out there, provincial or federal, for years, and
certainly he has not missed a general election.
H1e has flot missed a political trick in the
distribution of relief. There is nothing hie
misses: he is a very busy man. But I cannoi
see traceable ta him any original policy, or
anything In the world except the following up
of lines of policy whieh were in vogue before,
and prodigality in the voting of moneyindeed, a great deal of such prodigality.
Let the Government determine the big lines
of poli-cy which. are necessary for the purpose
of meeting the exigencies of a sorely tried
country, and let it then proceed to work
along them. Such action would get the support of both bouses. To my mind Mr.
Gardiiner's industry does not offer very much
hope to Western Canada. And I trust the
Government will not rely upon further grain
commissions to stave off its responsibility in
respect of the Western Provinces.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would remind
my right honourable friend that I stated Vo
this Chamber the policy and work of the
Department of Agriculture in the West, as
exemnplified by legislative measures.
Right bon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: Quite a number of waterworks.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The activities
have heen very nýumerous. But we need not
go into that now.

A message was received from the House of

Construction of Houses.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER:
When

shall

Hon. R. DANDURAND:
With the leave
of the Senate, I would suggest we give this
Bill second reading now. I shall explain as
concisely as I can its main features, and
then, if it is agreeable to honourable members, instead of going into details, we could
refer the Bill to the Banking and Commerce
Committee. There experts of the Department of Finance can answer any questions that
may be asked.
Part I of the Bill involves repeal of the
Dominion Housing Act and the re-enactment
of portions of it. with important changes and
additions designed te bring the facilities of the
Act to individuals and communities that
have not hitherto beoefited from it. This part
of the legislation is intended solely for families who wish to own their homes, and strong
emphasis is placed upon facilities for families in the lower income brackets and in small
and remote communities.
Part II contemplates an experiment on a
comprehensive scale in the low rental housing
field.
Part III is intended as an attack on the
major obstacle retarding the building of new
houses, the high level of real property taxes.
Part I, as I have said, repeals and reenacts portions of the present Dominion
Housing Act, with important changes and
additions. It will be remembered that the
present Dominion Housing Act was passed in
1935. It followed examination of the housing
question by a committee of the House of
Commons.
Certain grave defects developed in the
operation of the Dominion Housing Act. The
Government endeavoured to meet those defects in so far as the powers contained in
the Act would permit the Government to do
se. In September, 1936. by the changed regulations then put into effect, the operation of
the Act was liberalized very materially. However, it will be recognized by all who have
followed the operation of the Act that it
suffers from at least two grave deficiencies.
But before dealing with those deficiencies I
should at any rate give the Act this comThe Hon. the SPEAKER.

mendation. It was the first effort by the
Dominion Parliament to deal with the problem of housing; and in spite of the defects
and weaknesses which have developed in
operation, it should be noted that, prior to
May 31 of this year, 4,249 family housing
units had been financed, involving an aggregate expenditure of $17,350,000, and as of
that date the average loan per family unit
was S4,083.
As a consequence of the broadened regulations made available in September, 1936, there
bas been a considerable acceleration of lending activity under the Act. It nevertheless
remains truc that the total volume has been
substantially less than is desirable.
The defects to which I have already referred are as follows: First, the unwillingness
of the lending institutions to mnake loans in
many small and remote communities; and,
second, the reluctance of the lending institutions to make loans for small amounts in
whiat they regard as the less desirable residential areas of the larger urban communities, despite the fact that these districts in
many instances are the only areas in which
it is possible for the people in the relatively
low income groups to build houses for themselves. Those are the main defects of the
original legislation, and part I of the new
Bill seeks to remîedv tien.
The new provisions of part I I "hall now endeavour to
summarize briefly.
In the normal case of a loan under part land I use the word "normal" as distinct from
the special low-cost provisions to which I shall
refer later-a housing loan may in future be
made for from 70 to 80 per cent of the lending value of the new house, and of this total,
whatever it may be, the Dominion will advance 25 per cent and the private lending
institution or local municipal authority, as
the case may be, 75 per cent. Under the old
legislation the Dominion's advance was 20
per cent of the lending value, and the maximum amount of the joint loan was 80 per
cent, with provision *made by regulation for
75 per cent and 70 per cent loans in certain
cases as well. This change will simplify accounting, lessen bookkeeping
costs, and
eliminate
the temptation te
manipulate
estimates of cost and of appraised value in
order to bring the loan within the existing
70, 75 or 80 per cent category.
The Bill provides that in the case where
the lending value does net exceed $2,500that is the definitely low-cost house-a loan
may be made up to 90 per cent, of which
the Dominion is te advance its 25 per cent.
That is to take care of the case where it
is difficult for the individual to put up a

JUNE 28, 1938
minimum equity of 20 per cent at the start.
It is expected that we shall be able to get
the consent of at least some lending institutions to make these small high-percentage
loans to deserving people in certain sections
of our larger cities, in suburban and rural
areas, in fishing villages, mining towns, and
small urban communities generally.
The most important change which we are
proposing in this part of the Bill involves
the application of the Home Improvement
Plan principle of a pooled guarantee in respect
of loans made by lending institutions and
falling into certain definite categories. It will
be observed that the Home Improvement
Plan, which has been in o.peration for over
a year and a half, and under which some
$16,000,000 have now been advanced for home
improvements, involves the pool principle;
that is to say, the Government's guarantee
of 15 per cent under the Home Improvement
Act applies to the aggregate losses of each
lending institution operating under the law.
We discussed this entire feature quite extensively last session.
As regards the experience up to date, although it is a little early to speak of final
results, the losses have been insignificant.
The experience therefore is felt to be such
as to warrant the Government in attempting
to apply the same principle with respect to
the construction of low-cost houses. In other
words, we are asking for authority to enter
into contracts with lending institutions under
which we shall guarantee the.m against loss
up to a maximum of 20 per cent of the total
amount of 80 per cent loans made by them
which do not exceed $4,000 each for a single
family dwelling, and made in such communities or districts as may be designated by
the Minister, and up to a maximum of 25
per cent guarantee in the case of 90 per
cent loans.
These guarantees of 20 and 25 per cent
represent maximum limits. It is proposed not
only to designate special areas, consisting
of small and remote communities in which
loans are not now being made, but also to
develop a schedule of the amounts that the
Government will guarantee. This schedule
will be graduated downward in accordance
with the size of the loan, say from three to
four thousand dollars, and graduated upward
in accordance with the percentage which
the loan bears to the lending value, that is
to say, from 70 to 80 or 90 per cent. In other
words, we may go up to the maximum 20
per cent guarantee in the case of 80 per cent
loans for $3,000 or less, but the guarantee
which we shall give with respect to 70 per

cent loans for an amount of $4,000 will be
very much less-perbaps as low as 5 per cent.
The development of a schedule of this sort
will, of course, be a difficult and complex
process, and will -have to be worked out with
great care.
A further important change in connection
with part I is to make it possible for a payment to be made to a lending institution to
assist it in defraying the special costs incurred
in arranging loans, making appraisals, inspections and so forth, in designated small and
remote communities. This payment is not to
exceed $20 for any loan, plus a mileage allowance fixed by the Minister for necessary travelling expenses, based upon the distance from
the nearest place from which the loan can
be arranged and supervised by the lending
institution.
Another new provision in part I increases
the maximum amount which may be paid out
by the Minister in respect of advances, losses
and expenses. A maximum of ten million
dollars was the authority under the old Act.
It is proposed to increase this authority to
twenty million dollars. Under the old Act
the Dominion bas already committed itself
to $4,500,000 in respect of the $17,350,000 housing construction to which I referred earlier.
The figure of $20,000,000 provided in the new
Act gives an additional authority of about
$15,500,000, which, together with the funds
advanced by the lending institutions under the
provisions of the Act, should make it possible
to make aggregate loans up to $60,000,000 or
more under this part of the National Housing
Act.
I do not know that this matter is so
technical as not to be followed easily by my
fellow members.
Part II of the Act is designed to make possible a comprehensive experiment in the field
of low rental housing. It is based upon
acceptance of the arguments advanced in this
connection by the National Employment Commission, and it follows in general, though not
in detail, the main lines of the program
suggested by that commission.
Briefly, part II provides that the Minister
of Finance, with the approval of the Governor
in Council, may make loans to local housing
authorities to assist in the construction of
houses to be leased to families of low income.
The aggregate principal amount of the loans
under this part is not to exceed .30,000,000.
Local housing authorities may consist of
either of two types, depending upon whether,
on the one hand, the municipality desires to
enlist the co-operation of private enterprise
in working out its low rental housing scheme,
or whether, on the other hand. it desires to

538

SENATE

operate entirely under the municipal authority.
If the municipality desires to enlist the cooperation of private enterprise, private capital
and business management of a private nature,
it may do so through the medium of a limited
dividend housing corporation with capital
sufficient to provide for 20 per cent of the cost
of the project. This capital, it is presumed,
will be subscribed by public-spirited citizens
who may be expected to plan, construct and
administer the enterprise on sound business
lines. They are limited to a dividend of 5
per cent on the capital they invest. Secondly,
if the municipality desires to operate a low
rental
housing project
under
municipal
auspices, it may do so through the medium of
a commission or other body having authority
to construct, hold and manage houses built
as a low rental housing project; and in the case
of a municipality doing the job itself in this
manner it is required to put up an equity of
only 10 per cent.
The Dominion's contribution is to be made
on the basis of the Dominion supplying the
bulk of the funds,-80 per cent in the case of
a limited dividend housing corporation, and
90 per cent in the case of a municipality, at
very low interest rates. In the case of a
limited dividend housing corporation, where
the equity subscribed privately must be at
least 20 per cent, the interest rate will be
l¾ per cent per annum. In the case of other
local housing authorities, that is municipal
bodies, where the equity required is only 10
per cent, the interest rate is two per cent per
annum. Semi-annual payments must be made
by the local housing authority to cover interest and to amortize the principal over a long
period. The rate of amortization in both cases
will mean that the loans will be completely
retired in between thirty-four and thirty-five
years.
If the local housing authority is a municipal
body, then, under the same principle as was
enunciated in connection with the Municipal
Improvements Assistance Bill, we must ask
the provincial government to guarantee repayment of the amounts advanced by the Dominion. No such guarantee is asked of the
provinces in connection with a scheme operated
by a limited dividend housing corporation.
The municipality must have approved the
project, and must have secured the guarantee
from the province, if it is to be operated as a
purely municipal project. The municipality
must also agree that while there is any money
owing to the Dominion, municipal taxes on
the low rental housing project shall not

corporation, to agree that if administration
by that method involves a shortage in the
amount due the Dominion Government, the
municipality will reduce taxes still further to
enable the shortage to be made up. Not
having the guarantee of the provincial government in such cases, we must insist upon a
degree of co-operation from the municipality.
The municipality must also agree net to levy
taxes on the income of a local housing authority. In addition, the municipality maythere is no " must " about it-make additional
voluntary contributions to a rent reduction
fund, which I shall describe a little later.
No family housing unit in a low rental
housing project is te be rented to a family
whose family income is equal to more than
five times the economic rental of the unit,
unless there is no demand for the unit from
families of lower income. The logic behind
this provision is that a family can afford to
pay about 20 per cent of its annual income for
rent. If this 20 per cent is sufficient to pay
the economic rental of housing accommodation, private enterprise should ba able to
provide sufficient housing accommodation
without any special subsidy from the State.
" Economie rental " is defined in the Bill as
a rental which gives a return of 9 per cent
on the cost of construction plus the annual
municipal taxes. Families of low income are
defined as families whose total family income
is less than five times the economic rental of
a family housing unit built as part of a low
rental housing project. The annual rental to
be charged a family of low income is not to
exceed 20 per cent of the total income of such
family.
Provision is also made for the
possible establishment of a rent reduction
fund by voluntary contributions from the
province or the municipality concerned. These
contributions are not compulsory; but if it is
desired by the municipality to lease the accommodation at lower rates than are made possible
by the annual carrying charge of the projectthat is at rates low enough to meet the needs
of families in the very lowest income groupsthen the municipality and the province are in
a position to reach this objective by making
voluntary contributions to the rent reduction
fund.
So far as safeguards are concerned, there
will be provision that evidence of the need
for a low rental housing project must be
shown by the municipality. The area must
be adequately planned and zoned. The project
must be of sufficient size to give reasonable
economies. Economic design and sound construction will be required. The management
of the local housing authority must be
satisfactory. The terms of acquisition of the

JUNE 28, 1938
land must be satisfactory. The terms of the
charter of any local bousing authority must
be satisfactory. The local housing authority
must agree to keep the house in a satisfactory
state of repair, and must keep books and
accounts and make an annual report to the
Minister. A limited dividend bousing corporation must give an option to the municipality
to buy the project for the amount of the
corporation's paid-up capital and any unpaid
dividends.
The total of the loans muade in any munieipality shall not exceed that proportion of
$30,000,000 which the population of the municipality bears te the total urban population
of Canada on the basis of the 1931 census.
The third part of this Bill is designed for
the purpose of making a direct attack, over
the next tbree years, on what is believed by
many te be the major factor retarding house
construction in this country. While there are
other factors, most will admit that the cost
of real property taxes in our municipalities
is the most important deterrent to the construction of new bornes. It is proposed therefore that the Minister of Finance, with the
approval of the Governor in Council, shal
be autborized ýto pay the municipal taxes levied
upon a house, the construction of whicb
begins between June 1, 1938, and December
31, 1940, up te the following amuounts: 100 per
cent of such taxes for the first year in wbicb
the bouse is taxed; 50 per~ cent of such taxes
for the seoond ye-ar in whicb the bouse is
taxed; and 25 per cent of such taxes for the
third year in wbich the bouse is taxed.
Municipal taxes are defined to include the
general municipal tax and the sebool tax, but
exelude special and local improvement taxes.
The Minister pays only the incre-ase in such
taxes due to the construction of the new house.
The principal conditions te be complied with
are relatively simple. We think that as an
evidence of good faith, having regard to tbe
Dominion 's contribution under this part m,
municipalities owning a considerable number of
lots suitable for the building of low-cost homes
sbould co-operate by making such lots available at a figure not to exceed $50 each ta
people wbo want te build low-cost homes.
The second condition is that the cost cf
the construction of the bouse must not exceed
$4,000. Furtbermore, the house must be built
by a person for bis own occupation, and the
owner of the bouse, must be released by the
municipality from paying any part of the taxes
wbîch tbe Dominion pays.
0f course, it is impossible te, predict how
many bouses will be built prior ta December
31, 1940, as a resuit o.f the stimulus given
by this part of tbe new Bill. However, if we

539

assume tbat during the tbree years bouses
eligible for this tax subsidy are construoted
to tbe value .of $100,000,000, we can make
certain estimates as te the volume of employment created and tbe aggregate cost te the
Dominion.
Let us assume tbat as a resuit of tbis volume
of construction municipal assessments will be
increasèd by the same amount, .namely, $100,000,000, and tbat the average tax rate is two
and a baîf per cent of tbe cost. Wben we
bear in mmnd tbat assessments of improvements are frequently on the basîs of 60 to 75
per cent, or less, I tbink these assumptioens
are reasonably safe. In tbat case the total
cost to the Dominion would be less than
$5.000,000 for the three-year period.
It bas frequently been estimated tbat eigbty
per cent of every dollar spent in bouse building goes ta labour, eitber directly or indirectly. ýIf Vbis estimate be correct, the
$100,000,000 spent on the construction of lowcost bousing during the next tbree years
would provide $80,000,000 in wages to workmen in the construction trades and ini the
building material and supply industries. If
that be true, the resuit would be that for
every 31,000 paid ini wages the tax subsidy
would cont the Dominion about $54.70-and
that is very mucb cbeaper than relief.
Witb these remarks, whicb I bad tbought
I could make mucb more concise, but which
cover the wbole Bill, I meve the second
reading.
Rigbt Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, I -have no trouble i rememberi.ng a time wben I sbould bave beard

estimates and predictions with -respect to a
measure like this, and should bave regarded

life cf me I cannot imagine wby bouses are
not bujîlt if the 'building of tbem is sucb an
inviting occupation as the figures given by my
bonourable friend wouId lead us to believe.
The only reason 1 know of why bouses are
net being built is that tbey are not a good
investment. Taking the bazards over the
years, particularly witb taxation at its present

level, one cannot make building pay. The
bousebuilding industry being therefore a
hazardous and indeed hopeless undertaking
from every standpoint, the Government is
called upon to be good enougb to get jnto
the field and do *what the individual will
flot do.
To state something that refiects on my nwn
judgment, 1 remember building casties in the
air as I thought of the Soldier Settiement
Act. I built themn quite innocently, faithfully and honestly. But now, a score of years
afterwards, looking back along the path, one
caoi see tbe ruins. Year after year the Government struggles with the soldier settiemnent
problem, making concessions ameunting to
millions nf dollars, flot because it wants to
do so, but becausc it cannot avoid the losses
entailed. One mizbt look farther baekl; at
the glowing Elysiumn which was painted when
the Transcontinental Railway was to be built
at a moderate cost te the taxpayers of this
country. We bave learned something in the
intervening thirty-five years, but we have
flot learned to refrain from launcbing upon
similar ventures with tbe same abandon. We
are launching upon tbem ail the time. I do
not indict this Government more ths.n any
other. I oly warn my honourable friend that
he should flot imagine the losses in this
matter are going te be within striking distanre. even within visible distance, of tIse
figures be bas placed before us.
Why, se fer as my experionce goes, every
aggreg-ation of capital, every company that
bas gene into the business nf mortgages on
bouses, bhas done so on the basis nf a 60 per
cent valuation made by its own approved and
tried valuators. I should .iust like te get
the average history ni companies loaning on
bouses in this country. I venture to say it
bas nlot been a favourable one, even with such
stern precautions. The last property I want
to own to-day is a bouse. Fortunately 1 own
none but the one I live in.
Tbe Government, tbrougb tbis policy, is
geing te become one nf the flnest landewners
in tbe Dominion; it is going to be the ]andowner par excellence. It is geing te be the
bouse renter, the heuse repairer, the bouse

Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

I do net know how other people reason,
but if 1 cen see in a straigbt line tbere is
only one possible end: continueus berrewing.
We already take the attitude, "Why worry
se long as we cao borrow more?" We know
the reason we can burruw is that ind-ividual
enterprise is net inviting te capital, and capital
runs te shelter under Gevernment boans. But
the time will comne wben that must cease,

this country-and the last Government is in
large measure responsible for that-house loaning is a great deal more hazardous; it is
hazardous to the last degree. The headaches
which will result from our loaning on houses
will be far more painful and ominous than
those which follow from our loaning on farms.
The Minister provides, however, that municipalities shall make contributions. After
getting a copy of the Bill and reaching my
seat I read all I could of the provisions, but
I did not get a full appreciation of the concessions required from municipalities. From
what has been said by the honourable leader
of the Government here, though, I realize
they are very substantial. In respect of part
II the concession, I think, covers everything
above ten mills in the dollar.
The Minister
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
may pay 50 per cent of municipal taxes for the
second year and 25 per cent for the third year.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is under
the third part of the Bill, not the second part.
Now let us examine the full meaning of that
concession. Houses for rent are owned by individuals or companies. It is far better to
consider the companies as individuals, for they
really are just aggregations of individuals; their
holdings are the holdings of an aggregation of
individuals, sometimes running into the thousande. So individuals are owners of houses in
our towns and cities. If there is one class of
capitalist or so-called capitalist whom I pity
most it is that class of individuals who own
houses and rent them. A great many tenants
are on relief. Rentals are at the very minimum
and almost no care is taken of buildings:
they are left to go to rack and ruin. Sometimes the landlord is able to sustain himself,
and get his taxes paid and' perhaps the mortgage; but very often he cannot do this and
the house is given up to the municipality.
Many a good house as well as a poor one has
been turned over to the municipalities, which
to-day are very large owners of real estate
within their borders.
Now the Government comes along and says
to the municipality, "We will lend money at
a very low rate if you will release a large
per.centage of your taxes." Well, what happens? A good and shrewd tenant will find
it pays him better to build a house than to
continue as tenant. By building he will be
bonused by the municipality and money will
be made available to him at a low rate of
interest. But what about the landlord, the
owner of the house? What is being done for
him? This discrimination in favour of one
person is a discrimination against another. Did
that occur to the mind of the Government?

541

The landlord is to-day in the most unfortunate business on earth. The Government is
going to make his lot harder stilI, for it is
taking action that will cause him to lose good
tenants and eventually to turn his houses over
to the municipality. This inducement to
people to build houses will mean a multiplication of the number of properties already
owned by municipalities.
I do not think I am exaggerating in this. I
ask the honourable leader to wait for, say, ten
years. When the sun is up the early morning is bright, but later on the shades of evening
come. It may be possibly ten years before
the evening of this legislation comes, but it
inevitably must come. I do not see how the
Government can stand and face house owners
whose properties will certainly be damaged
by this policy now being launched, particularly
those numberless small owners whose entire
savings have been invested in their properties.
Houses have been popular as a form of investment because it is one that people have
understood; they have been able to keep
them under their eye, and to go around and
colleet their rents.
The principal feature of this policy which
will injure the small house owner is the taxation feature, the concession from the municipality. Of course he will be injured as well
by increased competition, by the building of
more new houses. This is one of these instances where things look very bright until you
closely examine the ground and find out who
is going to be hit here and' who there. I know
this is not the first Government which has
introduced plans of this sort. Far-away fields
are green, and we sometimes hear of wonderful
results from similar plans put into operation
at a distance. I do not know whether housing
schemes in other countries have been along
the lines proposed here or not, but in any event
I believe that some distant fields will look
less green a number of years hence than they
do now. In fact, I hear reports that some of
thern are already pretty well sunburned and
dried out. In any event, it is not certain that
a scheme suitable for an older and more thickly
populated country would succeed here.
What I have tried to urge upon the Government for a long time I now urge again as a
final word. All these things are palliatives,
discriminatory and dangerous palliatives. The
real cure is a solid, sane, economic administration of the affairs that a Government must
administer, a refusal to launch into new
matters really beyond its function, the steady
reduction of taxation which would come as a
consequence of such policies, and the release
of human energy and enterprise in those
activities in which men are eager to engage

you will find that 60 per cent is the maximum; and again I speak with some authority.
It has been figured out time and again. On
larger bouses it is doubtful whether it runs
up to 40 per cent, but on smaller houses it
runs higher.
Speaking for Winnipeg, I think there will
be very little private building undertaken.
In my view a far better scheme would be for
the Government to shoulder the cost of unemployment relief. This would help to solve
the problem, for then, I believe, local industry
and enterprise would engage in building houses.
I do not think anyone can take pencil and
paper and sa'tisfy me that people in Montreal,
for instance, can pay its tax rate-as they
will have to do if they are to pay off the
municipal debt-and build houses as cheaply
as they are to be built under this scheme.
I shall vote for the Bill, but I am positive
it will not bring any relief to the provinces
which we are desirous of helping.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend suggests that a transfer to the federal
taxpayer of the share which the municipal
taxpayer pays for relief would cure many
evils in our municipalities. I would point out
to him that the load would simply be shifted
from one shoulder to the other, for the Federal
Treasury would have to carry the whole
burden and levy additional taxes to meet its
added obligations.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: In answer to my honourable friend I would say the difference is this.
When a person builds a house for himself be
regards it as his home and exerts himself to
pay off the mortgage as soon as possible.
Under a housing scheme the owner has an
equity in some cases of only 10 per cent,
which is a very small stake. In the old days
50 per cent ws considered a safe amount to
loan on a house, then it went up to 60 per
cent, and later even to 80 per cent, where
surely you have reached the danger point.
I say that relief will come in the form of
local industry being stabilized.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: I doubt whether
this legislation will be used to any great
extent, but if it were, I think, it would do
great injury. While those sponsoring the Bill
may believe it will benefit conditions in this
country, I can see a grave danger that they
will be made much woese. I refer to the fact
that to-day we have far too many of our
citizens living in urban centres. Go wherever
you will, you will find vacant farms. I would
suggest to the Governnient a scheme whereby
they could make self-liquidating loans. Many
of our delightful farm homes are still using
coal-oil lamps and other out-of-date equipment. Let the Government send out experts

543

to help the owners modernize such homes.
This would help to bring about a permanent
solution of our unemployment problem, for
in addition to the resultant stimulation of
business, this modernization would encourage
many young people to remain on the farm.
You may build more and more houses to
combat unemployment, but you must stop
somewhere, and when you do stop you are in
a worse.position than when you started. The
carrying out of my suggestion would help to
retain our young people permanently on the
farm.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable senators,
it seems to me that the conditions are really
not as grave as they appear to be. We have
two housing problems confronting us. One is
the slum situation in all our larger cities.
I agree that if anything can or should be done
by the Federal Government to clean up that
situation, it should be done as far as possible.
Outside of that, except for the extraordinary
conditions which have existed during the past
two or three years, there is in my judgment
no necessity at all for this legislation. Our
trouble is the result of what? The depression.
This means lack of money. Take my own
city, Regina. I agree with the honourable the
junior member from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Haig) that there are plenty of houses in
Regina. The only difficulty is that the people
have not the money to rent them. This is
equally true of every city, town and village
in Western Canada. If -the owner desires to
let his house, instead of getting a rent of $25,
$35, $40 or $50 a month, as be did in former
years, be must be satisfied with $15. In that
sense there is no such necessity for housing
as there is for slum clearance.
I repeat, our people have no money. As
my honourable friend has said, the efforts of
this nation should be directed towards creating conditions to end the depression. Whether
or not it can be done is a big question. I am
strongly inclined to the view that the depression exists in Canada because it is worldwide; everything taking place in the United
States and in Europe and in the rest of the
world is affecting us. We have not sufficient
earning power to-day in this country simply
because earning power is clogged elsewhere
in the world. Nevertheless, our Government
should endeavour in every way possible to
increase the earning power of the people,
which in turn will increase their spending
power. This, I think, is undoubtedly the object
which the Government has in view in proposing this legislation. Its purpose is to create
opportunities whereby our people may earn
money to spend. But there must be a limit
to this sort of thing; otherwise, eventually,

544

SENATE

there can be only one result: the debt of
this country will grow until it becomes simply
an insupportable burden. We may have to
face that eventually. Such is the trend of
the world everywhere-expenditure of billions
of dollars in an effort to overuome depression.
As regards any actual necessity for this Bill,
I say it does not exist; but as to the desirability of providing work for our people and
getting money into circulation, yes, this
measure will help a good deal.
Hon. G. LACASSE: Honourable members,
I am surprised at my right honourable friend's
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen's) lack of enthusiasm for this scheme. His changed attitude
towards a certain scheme which he sponsored
so whole-heartedly in this House four years
ago creates a precedent which may explain
his lack of enthusiasm for any new plans
evolved by the present Government. I refer
to the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

That is not

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: It has created considerable embarrassment for many people who
had money invested. I quite agree with what
be has said about it on the floor of this
House; but be must admit that in that instance he lacked far-sightedness. At least
that is how I interpreted his attitude tewards the Bill which we dealt with recently
to amend that legislation.
I think we should apply to our study of
the depression the same principle as we
would apply to a medical case: in order to
remove the effects we should first try to find
the causes. That is the only practical way to
study any problem. Of course, we must distinguish between causes and occasions.
I
think one of the main causes of the depressien is our more or less free spending of money
in days gone by, both individually and collectively. But the principal point I wish to
emphasize is that mentioned by my bonourable friend from Saskatchewan North (Hon.
Mr. Horner)-the lack of equilibrium between
our rural and our urban population. I am
afraid successive governments must be blamed
for this situation, more perhaps because of
things they failed to do than of what they
did. As individuals we too must share the
blame. How many poor farmers do I know
in my own district whose sons have deserted
them and gone to get fat wages in the cityl

had 'to let everything drift. We have to face
this anomaly, that in a country mainly agricultural our rural population are but 40 per
cent; 60 per cent of our people are crowded
together in urban centres. I should have been
pleased to see the attention of -the Minister
directed to this anomaly.
In saying this, however, I wish to give
full credit to the members of the present
Government, particularly to the honourable
Minister of Finance, for thei'r honest, earnest
and sincere efforts to solve this problem of
depression. I think the preceding Government also tried to do its best towards this
end when, six or seven years ago, it proposed
legislation which we in this House then accepted without much enthusiasm.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
senators, my right honourable friend (Right
Hon. Mr. Meighen) bas spoken of the
enthusiasm with which' we went into schemes
in years gone by, and aiso in more recent
years, to better the condition of certain
groups of our people. He instanced the Soldier
Settlement Act. I would draw the attention
of himself and other honourable senators to
the fact that we are now facing a condition
which bas been with us for the last five or
six years, during which time we have been
trying to provide more work for our people.
As my honourable friend from Saltcoats (Hon.
Mr. Calder) bas said, the object of this Bill
is to increase purchasing power by providing
more work. I think that is the main reason
for this measure. Conditions are very different
to-day from what they were before 1929, and
we must examine the Bill in the light of that
fact. The National Employment Commission,
after
investigating
conditions
prevailing
throughout the country, came to the conclusion
that this was one of the schemes which should
be tried for the purpose of offsetting unemployment.
I appreciate the importance of my right
honourable friend's argument that under this
Bill present property owners will be in competition with new property owners; but I cannot help thinking that if by encouraging the
building trades we can inurease opportunities
for work we shall make considerable progress,
inasmuch as some 80 per cent of building costs
go to labour.
The loaning of money is surrounded by as
many safeguards as could bu devised. I do
not say the Government will not lose money,
but it strikes me nothing will bring to our
people a greater measure of relief than the
stimulation of the building industry, which
in its various activities extends from the raw
materials of the mine, the forest and the quarry
to the finished products that enter into every

JUNE 28, 1938
building. If we can expand that work, and
free our people from a certain amount of
taxation, the encouragement, I think, should
go a long way towards bringing this scheme
into successful operation.
We ail know that one of the principal
reasons why people are not building in our
towns and cities ie that municipal taxation is
too heavy, and therefore there can be no
return for the builder. Under this Bill municipal taxation will be lessened for a certain
numýber of years, and it may be that the
increased facilities for borrowing money and
reducing the burden of taxation may help the
scherne along. I think it was in 1934 or 1935
that we had bef ore us similar legisiation proposed by my riglit honourable friend. I do
not recail the particular Bill on which I
expressed the opinionRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Farm
Loan Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -that we should
perhaps create a fund of $100,000,000 to help
the building of low-cost houses in order to
give the people outright 20 per cent of the
cost and lessen the burden of taxation. I
mnade that suggestion because I felt that $100,000,000 would represent M50,000,000 worth of
construction, which would perhaps set the
wheels of industry moving. It seemed to me
that an ann-ual appropriation of $20,000,000
was less than the amount we were paying out
in relief every year, and I thought some such
scheme would help to solve our unemployment problern. The Government has now
proposed another formula, and I think it is
worth studying and putting into operation.
I believe that in cities like Montreal and
Toronto there je considerable need for new
bouses. I know there would be an advantage
in wiping out slum districts and building new
bouses; but we have plenty of vacant land
around our cities, and, in my opinion, when
this building scheme je well under way, it will
gradually bring about a transformation of our
elum districts by giving an object-4esson in
low-cost building of the proper kind.
With these few remarks, I would suggeet
that unlees the Senate is prepared. to pas
the Bill now, we might give it second reading
and then send it to committee.
Hon. HENRY A. MULLINS: Honourable
sen-ators, 1 have listened with some interest
to tbe rcmarks of the honourable the younger
member from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig). I

similar to that which we are experiencing
now. I rernember mien who accumulated a

real estate in a period like this. To my
mimd, it is better to buy farm lande than
city property. If I were slightly younger I
would purchase farm lande to-day in preference to property in the city of Winnipeg, which
my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Haig) and
I both know very well. A friend of mine
who died left an estate worth $6,000,000 which
was accurnulated in a period of depression.

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Honl. Mr. DANDURAND rnoved that the
Bihl be referred to the Cornmittee on Banking and Cornmerce.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: Honourable
members, I do flot want the Government
to be wholly diecouraged; s0 I arn going to
say a word of oommendation. I do not think
it bas yet succeeded in getting order out of
the chaos of its budget, but in so far as it
does so by tbe rernoval of tbe sales tax on
construction materials it will improve the
situation of tbe construction industry more
than tbis measure will improve it in a lifetirne. That ie tbe means to take to etart
thinge moving; that and the reduction of
the estimates. The biggeet sbock I got this
session occurred when the supplementary estimates were brought down. Reduce those
estirnates, and then take the tax off, eay,
ice cream and other materials of that kind,
and you will bave progrese. I know of a
company in the city of Winnipeg which bas
had to default its bond intereet and has not
paid a dollar for two years, because everything it has earned has gone to the Government in tbe ice cream and sweets tax. It
would be in bankruptcy, and approximatély

of people. It may be that in places where
there is a large area of custom this particular
type of industry can be made to go, even
under the tax; but that is not true of a large
part of Canada. The Government to-day,
through its taxation, has simply absorbed
bonds into its own possession, and has become
the owner. Is it any wonder there is unemployment? By taking the sales tax off the construction materials you will do more to
encourage the construction industry tnan you
can accomplish between now and eternity by
artificial methods and by the Government
getting into business. Extend the same principle into the other sphere I mention and
you will save from unemployment more than
100 persons in the city of Winnipeg, and will
probably bring into that very industry scores
of others who are now hungry for a job. That
is the method to pursue.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am very glad
to hear my right honourable friend express
that view. I may say that I called the
attention of the Government to similar cases
in other lines of activity, where the whole of
the profit from the work done went to the
Government. The Minister of Finance was
quite responsive to that situation, but, unfortunately, during the year there developed
such exceptional demands for levies upon the
treasury that, though he had hoped to balance
his budget, he found himself $13,000,000
behind. He is praying Providence that the
situation may turn in such a way that, with
good crops in the West, he may be able to
alleviate the sufferings of the people when he
presents his next budget.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Let him recall those estimates.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If my right honourable friend examines them in the light of
necessity, he will find, I think, that he would
have voted for them had he been in the
Cabinet.
The motion was agreed to.

TRANSPORT BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM presented, and
moved concurrence in, the report of the
Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours on Bill 31, an Act to
establish a Board of Transport Commissioners
for Canada, with authority in respect of transport by railways, ships and aircraft.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members. I am. rising to concur in
the amendments, but I feel I ought to make
a statement with respect to the Bill as a
whole as it now emerges from committee. A
great deal of work has been done on it in
committee, though under the stress of some
haste, the end of the session being near.
It will be recalled that a similar Bill was
introduced here a year ago, but it was vastly
more extensive than the present one.

possibly, to the inter-oceanic traffic to which
I have just referred.
The second reason I have for making a
statement at the present time has to do with
agreed charges. I referred to the universal
opposition which mustered itself before the
committee a year ago, and to the failure on
the part of the railways at that time to sponsor
the Bill and support it aggressively. This year
a somewhat different situation presented itself.
The railway representatives came forward and
frankly stated that in their judgment the
mensure was only an instalment of justice for
them in the keen competition with which they
are now confronted, and they advanced arguments in support of the Bill. I know of no
arguments made before the committee in
support of agreed charges except those arguments which were presented by the sponsor of
the Bill in the other House and 'by the railways. From end to end of the country there
came
representations against the agreed
charges provisions. My own mail has been
cluttered for months with protests against
agreed charges, all of which protests I have
read, and I have not received one communication in support of those provisions of the Bill.
I fancy a somewhat similar experience has
been the lot of every honourable member.
Wherever I have been I have been waited
upon and asked to hear representations, always
against agreed charges. I do not doubt for a
minute the bona fides of the opposition,
particularly from those who represent our
varions industries throughout the country, or
of their apprehension as to the effect which
these agreed charges provisions may have.
I am going to confess frankly that a year
ago I was opposed to agreed charges. In committee I opposed them on the strength of the
fact that the representations were all against
them. But now I have determined, as far as
I am concerned, to give agreed charges an
opportunity. I was very much impressed by
the argument made by Mr. Rand, of the Canadian National Railways, before the committee,
the reason being that I could not answer the
argument either in his presence or in his
absence. Without being too confident that
my decision is right, I intend definitely to
support agreed charges, because I am convinced by the argument presented that they
should be given a fair trial in this country.
I shall do so in the knowledge that this is
one of the most unpopular legislative proposals that have come before Parliament in
many a day. It is not for this House, though,
to canvass the popularity of legislation. If we
have any function to perforrn it is to canvass
the merits, and the merits alone, and, because
I have been convinced of the merits of this

proposal I should like to sec it given a fair
trial in Canada and to observe what the
results will be. I support the Bill in its present
form.
Hon. G. GORDON: Honourable senators,
for the life of. me I cannot understand how
any person can put up any kind of argument
for agreed charges, and I prophesy that as
time goes on, if this Bill passes, they are going
to do harm to the railways. I cannot understand why the railways come here asking for
agreed charges and at the same time contend
the rates under which they are operating are
as low as railway rates anywhere else in the
world, if not lower. One of the chief funetions of the Railway Commission, the most
important one, it seems to me, was to see
that agreed charges were not put into effect.
To my mind this proposal is a most vicious
and retrograde step, and I shall be sorry to
see the House agree to it.
Right Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM: It
has not agreed to it yet, but I think it will.
As a matter of fact, my honourable friend's
nemory is short, or he would remember the
reception given by the shippers to the Bill
establishing the Board of Railway Commissioners. They thought it was a good thing
in theory, but bad for their business. I remember that shortly after I came into the
Government I received letters opposing the
Board of Railway Commissioners, and those
letters contained the same arguments which
are advanced against agreed charges to-day.
It was said the people were going to be
ruined because they were not to be allowed
to manage their own affairs. But the world
moves on. To my mind the Board of Railvay Commissioners has done a great piece
of work for the industries of Canada, and for
the people as well.
Now, if agreed charges are fair, and I think
they are, surely they will provide one way,
without injuring any business, but rather by
helping it, of giving a little aid to our railways in the troubles which we have been
investigating for months. I have been in
favour of agreed charges because of my experience in the control and regulation of traffic.
I believe they will be of assistance in solving
the general transportation problem. If that
be the case, they are worth while.
My only reason for rising was to remind
my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Gordon)
that I could show him trunks full of correspondence opposing the establishment of the
Board of Railway Commissioners.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: What difference does
that make?

JUNE 29, 1938
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: I just wanted
to point out that human nature remains the
same.
The right honourable gentleman (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen) has given us a complete résumé
of what the Bill was, what has been done to
it, and what it is now. The reason we may
appear to be hurrying on a little is that we
want to get the Bill back to the House of
Commons if we can.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable members,
I wish to say just a few words on one feature
of this Bill. Some honourable senators may
remember that I opposed it last year, chiefly
on the ground tliat we had no evidence before
us as to the operation of agreed charges in
Great Britain. That feature has now been
cleared up to my satisfaction. I understand

54

even the labour organizations of that country
defend amalgamation in every way possible as
a means of securing efficiency and better conditions. I am convinced that if our railway
problem continues as it is, the same attitude
will develop here in due course. Our people
are not ready for it yet, by any means. There
is no doubt at all that the principle of unification has been adopted in very large
measure in EnglandHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Under four
systems.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes, under four
systems, but those four systeis are to-day
endeavouring to eliminate every competitive
feature that they can; and, further than that,
they are pooling passenger and freight
traffic where possible. Just the other day I
was reading in one of the documents I have
received that goods are not necessarily shipped
over that particular system to which the
shipper takes them; they go over the shortest
route, whatever it may be. They are pooling
all their freightHon. Mr. DANDURAND: By co-operation.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes, by co-operation;
but the point is, they are pooling their freight,
the idea being to eliminate unnecessary expense resulting from competition.
Now I come to the matter of agreed charges.
When I came into the Chamber the right
honourable leader on this side (Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen) was intimating that he approved of giving this provision a fair trial.
Personally I should like to see a time limit
placed upon the experiment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We remain the

that one witness before the committee gave
a full description of agreed charges, what
they are, how they work and what is their
purpose. Although I was not present when
he gave his evidence, I have since read it.
Besides, we have been furnished with other
statements in reference to the operation of
agreed charges in Great Britain. I concede
that, in a sense, agreed charges are opposed
in our rate-fixing plan. They are reminiscent
of the old custom of making secret agreements whereby one person would have an
advantage over others with respect to rates.
That practice is, I think, well provided against
by this Bill; it cannot occur if the Bill is
passed.
As was said by the -honourable member who
has just taken his seat, we are living in

can afterwards amend the law and place the
railways back in the position where they
now are.
If the Bill contained nothing but the provision for agreed charges I should vote for it,
but I have very strong objections to the part
which regulates water transport, and therefore
I shall find it necessary to vote against the
Bill as a whole. I listened to the evidence
that was taken in our committee last year.
Unfortunately, I was not able to hear all
the evidence given at the present session,
but I followed what was said in another place,
and I have not been able to conclude that a
case bas been made out in favour of the
control wbich this Bill would give over shipping on the St. Lawrence and the Great Lakes.
The Bill provides for control not only of rates,
but also of the number of ships and their
routes. No argument bas been adduced to
convince me ihat such interference with the
liberty of trade is at this time expedient or

to control rates, or, in other words, to increase
rates, on the St. Lawrence and the Great
Lakes. I think it would be an economic
crime to do that just now. There is no
justification for such a move; the evidence
is all against it.

Yesterday in coimittee the Minister, replying to a question asked by a senator as to
flic reason for including these sections covering transport by water, pointed to the large
ap. on the Wall and said: "Look at
rtaih
transportation
that rnap. We have too much(-I
now." What docs that mean? Docs it mean
that the Minister or the pronoters of this
Bill believe the railways will ever be able
to compete with transportation by water?
Surely net. It is an economie impossibility.
Water transport is too cheap as compared with
transport by rail for the railways ever to be
enabled by restrictive legislation on ships to
get the freigit that it now carried by water.
Last year we were told that a chaotic condition existed on the lakes; that there were
too many ships and they were not making
nioney. That is not a chaotie condition from
the point of view of public interest, though
it may be regarded as chaotic by owners of
Sinilar situations occur in many

businesses in times of depression and distress.
Commerce n general is subject to these conditions, but that does not mean that public
interest demands that changes bc made by
legislation. In so far as transportation is coneerned, public interest in Canada demands that
shippers and producers should have as low
transportation rates as possible. That is essential in a country of such geographical magnitude as ours, wbere distances are so great The
present situation on the lakes is such that
producers are able to get cheap transportation,
and that service is offered by any number of
ships. I for one can sec no reason in the world

legislation fo limit the number of ships and

HonourHon. RAOUL DANDURAND:
able senators, I followed with interest the
We

have now to consider the Bill as reported.
It seeks to extend the principle of regulation of rates by the Board of Railway Commissioners-which would be renamed the
Board of Transport Commissioners-to shipping by water. The endeavour may prove
futile, but we are striving to do the best that
can bc done in a very crucial situation. Our
railways, as we know, arc gradually losing
ground. We who have an investment of billions in them feel they should not be shackled
by regulations which prevent their meeting
competition on the lakes and elsewhere. So
we seek to regulate transport by water in
a way as to save lake shipping from
suc
chaos and our railways from untold injury.
Regulation of water transport would apply
te package freight, and the idea would be
to maintain a sufficient number of boats for
that traffic. Hundreds of vessels carry nothing
but bulk goods, such as grain, and to those
the provisions of this measure would net
extend. But there would be a safeguard
against invasion by those vessels, through
unfair rate cutting, of the package freight
business landled at present by other ships
and our railways. We are experimenting with
a view to assisting our railway systems. Canada is not the only country which finds it
necessary to see what can be done for its
railways, for, as we all know, England too
has been making an important railway experiment in recent years.
I may say that at first I was averse to
exempting from regulation under this Bill all

An Hon. SENATOR:

Here is a proposed interference with liberty

St. Lawrence and the Great Lakes for three
centuries. Surely a case must be made out
before I am asked to support such interference; and, I repeat, a case bas not been
made out here. Therefore, although I have
no objection te agreed charges, I shall have
to vote against the Bill as a whole in order
to voice my dissent from and opposition to

two railway systems should have the advantage of handling all heavy freight, particularly
lumber, transported from British Columbia
to the Eastern Provinces. Yet, on thinking
over the arguments made in committee by the
honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. McRae), I wonder if there is not some
justification for the stand taken by the committee; for if we discouraged the movement
of such goods by water from British Columbia the railways would have no incentive to
quote as favourable rates to the trade as
they do at present. Since they have been
able to compete with competition by water
in the past, they will perhaps be able to
continue doing so. We all know that water
rates are much lower than railway rates, and
yet because of the necessity for rapid transfer
of goods from the West to the East the railways have carried somewhat more of that
freight than have the water carriers.
On the whole I believe this legislation is
worth trying as an experiment. My right
honourable friend says it is very unpopular.
Well, I think we are doing the fair thing by
our large transport companies. We have
passed so many pieces of so-called popular
legislation which later failed, that I think
we might well try the reverse policy in
this instance.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, on the motion for second reading I
opposed this Bill. I cannot see anything in
it to convince me that it was introduced
by a Liberal Government. It is charged
against the Bill that it is the acme of Tory
legislation-not Conservative, but Tory. It
seems to me it is essentially Tory legislation.
Will the honHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ourable gentleman explain to us what distinction he has in mind between Toryism
and Conservativism?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, my dear friend, I
will, with a great deal of pleasure. A Tory
is a man or woman who does not want to make
any release of existing privileges. A Conservative is a conserver of the past, but a
constructor of the future.
I would draw
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
my honourable friend's attention to the fact
that that formula was .carried into the official
name of the Liberal-Conservative party. He
seems now to depart from that title.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: As my honourable friend's
party has raised the question of nationailism
all over Canada, and as we are about to
have a Conservative convention, I think we

should call the party the National Conservative party, because, if anybody can do so,
certainly the Conservative party can conserve Canada.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable members,
I cannot understand how any Liberal Government could propose to control lake or
ocean shipping. The history of transportation
shows that the boat has from the earliest
days been the free instrument of trade.
But this Bill, as the honourable senator from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Coté) said a few minutes
ago, seeks to regulate or control shipping on
the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence. It
cannot be in order to help the railways,
for they simply cannot compete with water
transport. It must simply mean that the 120
boats owned by one pool and the 45 owned
by another pool, according to the approximate
figures given to the committee, are to have
conserved to them in perpetuity the carrying
trade of the St. Lawrence and the Great
Lakes, because, mark you, under this Bill
urgency and necessity for greater service must
be proved before another boat can- be put
into commission. I venture to suggest there
is not a man or woman within sound of my
voice who will be alive when another boat
will be built on the St. Lawrence for that
trade, if this Bill be enacted. That policy,
to my mind, is a mistake.
We of the Western Provinces fear any
regulation of water transportation. The West
has urged the expenditure of money on the
St. Lawrence waterways. For what purpose?
Power? No. To make an agreement with
the Americans? No; but in the hope that
it will give us cheaper transportation of our
principal product to the world markets. We
of Western Canada have an awful time voting
for either the Liberal or Conservative party,
because both stand for protective tariffs. The
Conservative party is always going to lower
the tariff, and it does lower it frequently
when in power. On the other hand, the
Liberal party is always going to lower it
when out of office, but it fails to take action
when in power. As a result, the tariff is
pretty much the same whether the Liberal
party is in or out of office. We in the West
raise a prodiuct which has to be put on the
world markets at the cheapest possible freight
rates. We are strongly in favour of freedom of transportation by water. True, the
West has probably made more mistakes than
any other part of Canada. We asked for a
federal expenditure of from $52,000,000 to

552

SENATE

$55,000,000 on the Hudson Bay Railway. The
money might as well have been thrown into
the Atlantic ocean.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: No.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: My honourable friend
says "No." I am one of those who say
" Yes." There is not enough grain going
over the Hudson Bay Railway to pay for the
axle grease used on the freight cars. That
railway never has paid and never will pay.
A'nyone can convince himself that this is so
if he will but view the matter with an
open mind.
We in the West must get our wheat on the
markets of the world at the lowest possible
cost. If by legislation of this character Parliament limits the freight rates to be charged
into and out of Western Canada, let me say
quite candidly, such action will only feed the
smoldering fire of that country's disapproval
of protective tariffs. This Bill, especially in
that part dealing with shipping rates, is a
direct challenge to a lower cost of transportation into and out of Western Canada.
I am opposed to the Bill. In fact, if I
could get an honourable member to second

An Hon. SENATOR:

I will

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Thanks.
As to agreed charges, I admit that a very
substantial argument was made in committee
by the right honourable leader of the Opposition and by the solicitor for one of the railways, but I am not convinced. When I sit
in a small town and see a truck go buzzing
by, I feel as did a certain gentleman, a shareholder of the C.P.R., when he said to me,
"There goes my dividend." I am persuaded
that agreed charges will lead to such a
struggle among water and truck and railway
transportation interests as will result in
serious detriment to the railroads of this
country.
Hon.

Mr. HAIG.

Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I can assure honourable
members that the truck companies will not
take a beating lying down. All producers,
shippers and freighters, and all others concerned, so far as I can find out, are opposed
to agreed charges. The other day in committee someone expressed the view that those
opposed to agreed charges were putting on a
campaign. Well, I should like to have them
as organizers of the Conservative party if
they could make an election campaign as
convincing as their campaign against agreed
charges. The on-ly opinion in favour of agreed
charges came from the railroads and the
package freighters of the Canada Steamship
Lines. Apart from that, there was no public
opinion in favour of the principle.
My right honourable friend the leader
of the Opposition says he would like to
reason himself into a position against agreed
charges, but after hearing the argument in
committee he cannot do so. I admit that
the argument presented to us sounded plausible. As Mr. Rand said, if the railroads can
ship biscuits during the winter season from
Montreal to Quebec at 45 cents a hundred
pounds, but cannot get any of the business
during the summer season because the boats
charge only 15 cents, it is but reasonable
that the railways should be allowed to make
an intermediate rate of 30 cents for doing the
business the year round. But the matter will
not end there. Reference to the history of
agreed charges in England shows that when
the railways made a certain agreed rate the
truckers eut under that rate. That is what
will happen here, and then the war will be
on. I am persuaded that ultimately agreed
charges will hurt the railroads rather than
help them. I am one of those who believe
we should try to help the railroads. I submit that those of us who were members of
the Special Railway Committee of this House
could inevitably reach but one conclusion after
listening to the arguments presented to us
there, namely, that. apart from unemployment, the most serious problem confronting
Canada to-day is what to do with our railways. But, as I have said, I do not believe
the adoption of the principle of agreed charges
will help our railways. On the contrary, in
my opinion, it will only lead to more traffic
disintegration, more trouble, more secret
understandings than we can deal with.
I repeat, I am opposed to this legislation.
I am not going to oppose adoption of the report, but when the Bill is down for third
reading I shall move "that it be not now read

course. I am convinced, will be in the in-

the Seeds Act, 1937.

FIRST READING

The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
second reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable senators, this is but
a consequential Bill based upon a reorganization which has taken place in the department.
It is to change the names of some of the
officials. If my right honourable friend will
look at the BillRight Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have looked
at it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The purpose
of the Bill is to amend section 2 of the
Seeds Act, 1937, to strike out the words "Seed
Branch" and to substitute therefor the words
"Plant Products Division." to conform with
the reorganization of the Department of
Agriculture. That is all there is in the two
clauses of the Bill.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, the Minister in the House
of Commons gave the same explanation that
has been given here. He said this Bill was
to change the names of some of the officials.
The Bill having been passed with that explanation, another Bill came up, an amendment te the Dairy Industry Act.
The
explanation in that case was the same, and
the Bill passed the Commons. Well, I have
read both Bills. and they do not change the
name of anybody or of any office. What
they do is to change the departmental organization and the name of the organization.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The department has already been transformed, and now
the titles are changed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: So the oneline explanation given of this Bill and the
succeeding one, in the Commons, was in
error, and neither of the Bills passed on
the statement of the Minister does what the
Minister said. However, the Bills are all

FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 160, an Act to amend the
Bank of Canada Act.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved, the
second reading of the Bill.
He said: Perhaps I should draw the attention of my honourable colleagues to the
explanatory note that accompanies the Bill.
It says:
The primary purpose of this Bill is to amend

agitation then arose, with the cry: "We don't
own the whole of the bank yet. That is the
reason we are not getting distribution in terms
of need. Those private owners are gouging."
Therefore a demand arose to get hold of all
the stock, and the Government, seeing an
election ahead in Saskatchewan, yielded to the
demand. Hence we have this Bill.
After the Bill is passed we shall be in
precisely the same position as we are in now.
The Minister admits it will not make one iota
of difference. He did not say, " We did this
because of the Saskatchewan election," but
everybody knows that is why it was donc.
Here is the way he puts it. I ask the House
just to stand in admiration of the subtlety
shown by the Minister as he expressed this
weighty reason. He said it was not at all good
that there should be public discussion about
the constitution of the bank, though, he
realized, there would always be public discussion of its policy. I will quote his exact words

course, because they had certain rights to
protect, and in this way they contributed
to the soundness of the institution itself. It
is true that control over the bank has been
wholly in Parliament. Under the original
constitution, management of the ban.k was
entirely in the hands of the directorate, which
was controlled by the Government of the
day and answerable to Parliament. With
private ownership. the shares being held by
individual investors, the position has been
similar to that of the Bank of England. But
election attacks were made.
It was said
that this was a privately-owned bank, and
unthinking people would rush to the conclusion that its private owners could run
it as they run other institutions which they
own, though the fact was that they could do
nothing of the kind. And certain election
promises were made. So the Government of
the day. under a leader who proclaimed that
banks should be controlled, brought down a
Bill for purchase of the majority stock of
the Bank of Canada, the idea being to regulate the extent of monetary distribution
in Canada for the purpose of bringing about
distribution in terms of need. This is interpreted now, of course, as being in terms of
public need, whereas the innocent elector

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I should be
a good judge. I have stood by and witnessed
this kind of performance year after year for
many years. This whole thing is a farce. We
do not gain the slightest thing by putting up
this money. Intention to do so was announced just a little while before the
Saskatchewan election, in the hope of helping to re-elect the Provincial Government.
I do not doubt that the announcement contributed extensively to the result, and maybe
that contribution did no harm to the eternal
interests of our country. But where is this
kind of thing going to end?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My right honourable friend says that this Bill does not
alter the present situation-that it does no
harm. Well, we can deal with new conditions
as they arise.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: My honourable friend has misunderstood me. I do
not think any particular harm was done to
the remote interests of Canada by re-election
of the Saskatchewan Government. I am not
an apostle of the persistent, perennial and
unending propaganda throughout Canada to
the effect that by some legerdemain, some
magical monetary performance, we are going to get people something for nothing. That
propaganda got a considerable hold in the
West, and the purpose of this Bill was to
counteract it.

bit, and so I do not think any harm was done
by defeating Social Credit. It may have been
well worth while to go through this circus
performance-for that is what this Bill isin order to defeat Social Credit. But there
is this danger. When the country is the
owner of all the bank's shares we shall be
off the basis of private interest in affairs of
the bank. So long as we remain on that
basis the shareholders have ground for a just
complaint if foolish things are done. Such
has been the position of the Bank of England
for centuries, and it is a worth-while position.
The Minister says that nothing more disastrous could take place than that the Bank

557

of Canada should become a mere arm of the
Government. Well, it is all the time getting
nearer and nearer to being an arm of the
Government. Does the honourable leader
think that the demand to make it an arm of
the Government will be in the least silenced
by this measure? It will be encouraged, for
one demand that is successful is always followed by another. A number of demands
will roll in upon the Administration. Indeed,
some rolled in only last night, and I heard
the echoes myself. What I fear is that they
may continue until the Government, with
this arm in its possession, will get into the
hands of people who will use the arm to
wreck our country. In my opinion the Administration is taking a wrong step. I do not
deplore the immediate political effect, but I
fear the ultimate consequences.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The argument
of my right honourable friend implies that
the people may want the policy altered. If
that happens, how far will the Senate be able
to resist?
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do not
want our conduct taken in future as a
precedent for disastrous alteration. I should
like to see the policy in such form that
disastrous alteration would be most difficult
to make; that it could not be brought about
without more radical and more determined
steps being taken than the public have any
conception of. In short, I want the position
to be kept so fortified, its ramparts so strong,
that unthinking people, hungry to get something for nothing, will not be able to shatter
the very financial structure of our country.
But that is exactly the position we are abandoning.
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN:
Honourable
senators, we have just listened to a speech
from the right honourable leader on the other
side (Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) full of unrelieved gloom and prophecies of desolation
to come, in respect of this particular measure.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Not quite.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: We had a similar
speech from him yesterday with regard to the
Housing Bill, and we have had two or three
similar speeches on other projects of the Government in the course of the present session.
I am afraid my right honourable friend is
getting into the position of the Jeremiah of
this House, if not, indeed, of the country.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The trouble
is, I am a little late in coming on the scene;
I should have been here long ago.

558

SENATE

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I remember reading in Boswell's Life of Johnson a description of a meeting between Dr. Johnson and
a very old man who said that for many years
he had tried to become a philosopher, but
the trouble was that cheerfulness was always
breaking in. Now I do wish that a little cheerfulness would occasionally break into the
speeches of my right honourable friend.
He referred at some length to the Saskatchewan election. I am an innocent sort of
person; I do not know very much about elections, and I do not intend to follow him in
the observations he made with respect to
that particular subject. But I do wish te
advert for a moment to his comments on the
inadvisability of extruding, or doing away
with, by this Bill, the private interest which
now exists in the Bank of Canada to the
extent of somewhat less than 50 per cent.
There does not seem to be any great logic
in that argument when you reflect that no
private shareiolder of the bank as at present
constituted is permitted by the statute to
hold more than 50 shares. Mvy riglit honourable friend knows as much about corporate finance and the actions of nminority sharebolders as I do. He knows xvery well that

Hou. Mr. HUGESSEN: -a minority distributed all over te country-has for practical putrposes no ontrol whatever over the
policies of the institution.
Then my right honourable friend said that
if the bank is altogether publicly owned there
is a danger that the people may come to believe it is a bottomless source of supply for
those who need money most. Now, I disagree with him, in this way. While the
sources of credit and the monetary structure
of the country were entirely in the hands
of private banks, as they were until a few
years ago, an agitation could have been
started, by people having no knowledge of
the matter, on the ground that the banks
were using the credit of the country entirely
for their own ends. When, however. you
establish a publicly-owned central bank,
surely you are bringing about gradually a
process of public education as to the true
meaning of currency and credit, because
every step which the bank takes has to be
reported annually te Parliament. I must say
again that I do not agree with my right honourable friend when he stresses the danger
from public ownership of the Bank of Canada.
Right

Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

I think it is quite conceivable that having
this Bank under our own control and in our
own hands may result in a considerable extension of sound ideas about the relationship of
currency and credit to the national policy.
The right honourable gentleman referred
to the fact that the Bank of England is
privately owned. That, of course, is so. But I
think I am correct in saying that England is
the only country in the whole world which
has a national bank so privately owned. In
every other country where there is a central
bank fulfilling functions similar to those of
the Bank of Canada, it is either entirely
owned by the country or controlled as to its
policy by the Government of that country.
For instance, I need only refer honourable
senators to the very recent alteration in the
sta tus of the Bank of France, brought about
by the Blum Government the year before
last, I think, as the result of which that bank
is now controlled for all practical purposes by
directors appointed by the French Government.
I agree with my right honourable friend in
the view that this Bill does not make a great
deal of difference to the position which has in
fact existed since slightly over 50 per cent
of the shares of the Bank of Canada were
acquired by the Government two years ago.
But for the life of me I am unable to agree
with the attitude of unroelieved gloom witi
which he views this transaction, and J do
venture to hope that after Parliament bas
prorogued and he is on holiday during the
course of the summer months a little cheerfulness may break through the lowering clouds.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, this is not the first time in
a rather long career that I have been accused
of playing the part of Jeremiah. I do not
know that I have essayed the rôle so much
in this House as perhaps I did elsewhere years
ago. I do not get any satisfaction from seeing
prophecies of failure fulfilled; but at the same
time I find no discomfort in having said
thing s would not go well and being later
vindicated by the event. I prefer that to
being in the position of those cheery optimists
who have seen all their optimism vanish in
the results. I recall that two years ago I
was referred to, not as a Jeremiah, but rather
as being unduly pessimistic, when I ventured
the suggestion that the hope of the Minister
of Railways, of bringing joy out of gloom
in the Canadian National by substituting his
own trustees and his own Government control for the former trustees and parliamentary
control, would be disappointed. I find now in
the returns just vouchsafed to Parliament some
confirmation of the soundness of my prognos-

follows its reports with the greatest care. But
what is the value of putting out this money?
Nothing at all. We are not in a liquid position to warrant it. We do not gain anything
at all. The Minister of Finance in the Commons did not suggest that we could gain

BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACT
EXAMINATION

OF RECORDS-NOTICE
MOTION

OF

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, if I can get the unanimous approval of the Senate I desire to miake a motion
bearing on some work which I hope to have
accomplished on behalf of the Senate by the
Parliamentary Counsel during the summer.
If I cannot get unanimous approval I shall
put it in the form of a notice of motion.
It is only too clear to us all that the time is
coming when there will be considerable discussion in the Parliament of Canada of the
present terms of the British North America
Xct, and possibly, though I should net think it
ikely, of the Statute of Westminster. The
commission which is at present occupied in an
examination of this problem and allied financial questions will doubtless be reporting
during the summer. A peculiar responsibility
rests upon the Senate of Canada in all matters
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

affecting our Constitution. We are not solely
the guardians of constitutional rights and
rights of minorities, but we are in a special
way the guardians of those rights. I thought
it would be well, therefore, if the Parliamentary Counsel. with whom I have consulted,
could devote his summer months, or such part
of them as will be necessary, to a complete
study of the subjeet. I do net know of anyone
we could commission who would make a
better job of iL. Certainly from the standpoint of his law studies he has the advantage
of a background of experience and learning
which very few in Canada possess. What I
have to suggest will involve very little or no
expense, as through the summer the time of
the Parliamentary Counsel is his own; and
I am sure there will be no disposition here to
demur at the payment of the amount mentioned in the following resolution:
That during the coming recess of Parliament
the Parliamentary Counsel of the Senate be
authorized and commissioned as follows:
1. To examine the records of the Quebec
Conference and such other pre-Confederation
records as diselose the scope of the intended
legislative powers of that precise central or
general union which was presented to and
accepted by the three original provinces of
Canada; and
2. To compare the text of Part VI of the
British North America Act, 1867, headed
"Distribution of Legislative Powers" with (a)
such pre-Confederation records and (b) such
pronouncements of the Judicial Committee of
the Privy Council as define or disclose the legislative powers of the Parliament of Canada at
the present time; and
3. To report to His Honour the Speaker for
the information of the Senate
(a) Any material differences between the
scheme of distribution of legislative powers
between Dominion and provinces as apparently
intended at the time of Confederation and the
like legislative powers as expressed by the
text of Part VI of the British North America
Act, 1867; also any material differences between either such pre-Confederation scheme of
distribution or such text and such pronouncements of such Judicial Committee as define
or disclose as aforesaid with relation to
Dominion legislative powers as of the present
time; and
(b) In what respects, if at all, it would be
nîecessary to cause the British North America
Act to be amended so as to produce consonance
(so far as distribution of legislative powers is
concerned) with the apparent intent of the
provinces which originally constituted this
Dominion. Also, in what respects, if at all,
it is necessary to cause that Act to be amended
in order to render it (so far as distribution
of legislative powers is concerned) competent
to meet, and sufficient for, the present legislative requirements of the Dominion, so far
as these have become apparent or are determinable; and
(c) Concerning any other matter or thing
appearing to be relevant to the examination
and report hereby authorized.

561

JUNE 29, 1938
That out of any moneys available to the
Senate there be placed at the disposal of the
Parliamentary Counsel an accountable advance
of five hundred dollars for defraying the costs
and expenses of such examination and report
and that he be authorized to incur, if necessary,
in the premises, further expenses not exceeding
five hundred dollars, or in all one thousand
dollars, including a living allowance to himself
of fifteen dollars per day while out of Ottawa
on the business hereby provided for.
As far as expense is concerned, I may say
it is intended to confine it to the $15 per day
living allowance.
The information which it is proposed to
secure is highly desirable for the Senate,
and of course it will be available to others.
It will put this House and the other in a
more advant'ageous position when the time
comes for important discussion.
I do not think more need be said. I have
conferred in this matter with the honourable
leader of the Government. But he will speak
for himself. I hope he will second the motion.
Hon. RAOUL DAN[DURAND: I do not
know what time will be at our disposal to
examine into and discuss the opportuneness
and importance of this work. On first thought
it seems to me that the Senate will find it
interesting to familiarize itself with all the
preliminaries to the British North America
Act, including the documents and submissions
which came from the Maritime Provinces as
well as those from Ontario and Quebec, or,
as they were known before Confederation,
Upper and Lower Canada. I should be agreeable to accepting what my honourable friend
bas read as a motion, but perhaps it would
be better to have that placed on the Order
Paper as a notice of motion for to-morrow,
so that honourable members may know
exactly what it covers.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: All right.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may say that
I am favourably inclined towards having the
work done that is here proposed. The British
North America Act is based upon the conferences of Charlottetown and Quebec. As I
have already said, the submissions from the
different provinces would be found interesting
by us, especially since it is alleged, and the
Senate of Canada bas affirmed, that the Act
was passed as a result of an agreement which
was virtually a contract of the various
Although no appendices were
provinces.
attached to the Act, it was the product of the
negotiations which preceded it. Of course we
know that after our negotiators got to London
they had to accept some modifications to the
agreement which had been made here. But
from the very outset the provinces were
agreeable to divesting themselves of certain

powers and transferring these to a federal
authority. The interpretation by the provinces
of various sections of the Act would be quite
interesting in any discussion that might follow.
As my right honourable friend and I are
the only two who have discussed this proposal,
it would perhaps be well to place it on the
Order Paper as a notice of motion for
to-morrow.
The proposal stands as a notice of motion.
FARMERS'CREDITORS ARRANGEMENT
BILL
REPORT OF CONFERENCE

Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, as one of the Managers
appointed by the Senate to meet with Managers appointed by the House of Commons in
a Free Conference on the Farmers' Creditors
Arrangement Bill, I desire to report as follows:
The Managers on the part of the Senate
have the honour to report that they met in a
Free Conference the Managers on the part of
the House of Commons, for the purpose of
further considering the Bill 25, intituled "An
Act to amend the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act," and the amendments thereto.
The Managers on the part of the Senate
report that they have come to an agreement
with the Managers on behalf of the House of
Commons.
I may as well explain what agreement was
arrived at. The whole objection on the part
of the House of Commons was to section 9,
which we had added as the last section of the
Bill. Section 8 empowered the Governor in
Council to fix by proclamation a date after
which no new proposal could be received in
any province in respect of which the proclamation was issued. By section 9 we provided that
no proposal could be received in any province
other than Saskatchewan and Alberta later
than the 31st of December, 1938. The amendment agreed upon by the Managers was that
in respect of British Columbia and Manitoba
no new proposals shall be receivable after
the 30th of June, 1939. The rest of section
9 stands as it was, except for the addition of
a proviso that this section shall not apply to
soldier settlers.
Hon. Mr. LITTLE: I am not sure if I
heard my right honourable friend correctly,
but I thought in his opening remarks he said
he was speaking as a Manager of the House
of Commons. I hope there was nothing
prophetic in that remark.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I was speaking not as a manager of anything, either in
prospect or in being, but as one of the Managers on the part of the Senate.

It is a very good piece of draugbtsmanship.

eonsidering it. We shahl proceed to-morrow

of Gommons must wait until we compiete our

measures somewhat hastily. Like my right

mention two bihls. One is the Bill before us,
which, I arn told, is of very littie importance
except that it imposes heavier penalties for

indulged in, to the great peril of human beings
on the road. I thought I bad before me a
record which would show in a general way the
more important clauses, but I do not find it
here. I shahl have it to-morrew. I shahl
sirnply ask that we give the Bill second reading
now, and refer it te Comrnittee of the Whole
te-morrew.
Right Hon. Mr. MEICHEN: I know, of
course, that there are other bills te corne
to us, including the Elections Bill, which is of
inordinate length. 0f that I do net complain
particu]arly, because, while there was a division of opinion in the other House as to one
feature, the Bull in the main represents the
judgrnent of that House and is its ewn
particular concern. Wbat I am complaining
of is that we are now getting bis upon
which we could bave done some real work
had we got themn in good time. There bas
neyer been another session when so littie
legislation bas reacbed us befere the hast

the iegislation-tbougb there bas not been
very mucli of consequence-has been initiated
in the other bouse. There is no excuse for
adopting such a course. Any nurnber of these
buis shouhd have been initiated here. Wbat
was the commen sense of deaiing with the
Radio Bill in the other bouse over a long
period of tirne and throwing iA at us at
the end of the session? It was pre-erninentiy
a bill for initiation in this House. What about

time. The fault is cleariy that of the Government-a f ault of whicb the late Government
was flot guilty. The late Government introluced much of its legisiation in the Senate.
Because the Transport Bill was defeated here
two years ago, one Minister took a scunner
at the Senate and would flot introduce it
here again. What nonsense it ist His bils
ail received the fairest consideration by this
Huse, and ail were passed but one, to which
the country was opposed. This year we are
passing his bill substantially as he introduced
it, with some modification. There is no reason
whatever for the attitude he bas assumed,
and none whatever for the attitude of the
Government.
Here is a Bill, to amend the Criminai
Code in fifty or sixty different aspects, thrown
at us when we have hardly time to get our
meals. And there wilh be more to-morrow.
This method of procedure is flot right, nor
*ust to the country, and it is an affront to
this bouse.
0f course we
bon. Mr. DANDURAND:
have the remedy in our own hands.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:

No, we have

Perhaps my
bon. Mr. DANDURAND:
right bonourabie friend is right, but we couid,
if we wanted to take our time in going through
these bis, keep the House of Commons
waiting. Perhaps if we decided to do that for
one session, and kept tbemn here for eight
days, they would corne to a realization that
the Senate shouid be deait with otherwise.
I confess that wben I asked one of my Cabinet
colleagues in a jocular way if he wouhd not
give me a bill te introduce here, he said,
'II arn afraid I shahl neyer see it again."
0f course he too was speaking jocularly.
Nevertheiess, I think we shahl succeed in
coping witb our work and performing our
duty before the end of this session.
I move the second reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed te, and the Bill
was read the second time.
ELECTRICITY AND FLUID EXPORTATION BILL
REPORT OF OOMMITEE

Hon. Mr. BLACK presented the report
of the Comrnittee on Banking and Commerce
on Bill 21, an Act to amend the Electricity
and Fluid Exportation Act, and moved concurrence therein.
He said: bonourabie senaters. the committee recommends that the Bill be not

SENATE

further proceeded with at the present session,
circumstances having changed since its introduction in this House.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Perhaps it would
be opportune to outline the different opinions
expressed in the committee on the principle of
this Bill, so that the House of Commons and
the Government might have some knowledge
of them. I would suggest that my right
honourable friend give his point of view;
or perhaps it would be sufficient if he were
to refer to the remarks he made when the Bill
was before us for second reading.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: My remarks
on that occasion were the reason for my
remaining silent now. The reasons which have
prevailed were included in my comment on
the second reading. There was some difference
of opinion in the committee, but inasmuch as
there was no ground for that difference, I was
not going to refer to it.
All agree that it does not matter a whit
what our electricity export law is. because
we cannot export any electricity now, nor
can we do so for an indefinite time to come;
certainly not for two years, if ever. Under
these conditions it seems to me manifest that
there is no need of going on now with a
controversial measure; and it would be controversial. For reasons which have been stated
before, I fail to see why we should put into
the hands of Parliament the decision in a
phase of governmental administration in which
Parliament is about as clearly disqualified as
any body the human mind could think of
can be.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
general policy.

Except

as to

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Except as to
general policy, of course. However disqualified
Parliament may be as to administration, it
must lay down lines of general policy. These
must be stated in the statutes, and the administration of those statutes must follow the
iegular course.
I have expressed no opinion at all as to
the tribunal which should do the administering. It might be a department of government,
it might be the Governor in Council, or it
might be the Board of Railway Commissioners, any one of these necessarily having a
technical organization to advise it. As to
that I express no opinion, and I am satisfied
with whatever the Government wishes in that
regard. But I say it is impossible that Parlianient can have such an organization and can
deal wisely with the administration of power
export.
For these ressons the Bill would
certainly be contentious. There are other
Hon. Mr. BLACK.

reasons I could advance; but in view of the
fact that it will not matter a whit for a long
time to come what our electricity export
policy is, I ask why, in the baste of the closing
hours of the session, we should thresh out a
purely futile measure.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Of course, I have
drawn the attention of my right honourable
friend, and of the committee, to the fact that
the House of Commons has three times voted
unanimously in favour of the principle of the
Bill. However, I do not intend to open up
the discussion now. I simply desire to inform
the House of Commons of the differences of
opinion which have been expressed in this
Chamber and in the committee. I leave the
matter at that until next session.
The motion was agreed to.
NATIONAL HOUSING BILL
REPORT OF

OOMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. BLACK presented, and moved
concurrence in, the report of the Committee
on Banking and Commerce on Bill 145, an Act
to assist in the construction of bouses.
He said: There are some nine amendments,
but they do not pertain to the intent or the
principle of the Bill, being largely corrections
of grammar and verbiage.
The motion was agreed to.

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the Bill

ORDER FOR THIRD READING
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall thiBill be read a third time?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would move,
with leave of the Senate, that the Bill be
read a third time now.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I would suggest that third reading stand until to-morrow.
I should like to look over the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then I withdraw my motion and move that the Bill be
placed on the Order Paper for third reading at
the next sitting of the House.
The motion was agreed to.
DOMINION ELECTIONS BILL
FIRST READING
A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 91, an Act respecting the
Franchise of Electors and the Election of
Members of the House of Commons.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the Bill
was read the second time.
ORDER FOR THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would suggest
that we show our confidence in the House of

Commons by passing this Bill now. It specially
concerns members of that House, who have

agreed upon its principles. Perhaps it may
be correct to say that it has been to them a
labour of love, for they spent two months in
committee dealing with it. Would my right
honourable friend agree to third reading now?

SENATE
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think it
would be a mistake to take third reading toFrequently I have
day, for this reason.
observed with respect to a bill in which we
have no special concern that within a short
time after we receive it someone discovers
an error and wants it corrected. If we pass
this measure now and an error is found by
to-morrow. it will be too late to do anything
about it then. It is just possible that there
may be a request for a change in that clause
under which polls in the Maritime Provinces
would be required to close later than in the
West, so that reports from the East could not
go out before voting in the West was completed. In the other House there was a difference of opinion on the matter-not a party
division at all-and it is not impossible that
we may have a request for a change before
to-morrow.

PRIVATE BILL
REFUND OF FEES
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG moved:
That the parliamentary fees paid upon the
Bill B2, "An Act to incorporate The Workers
Benevolent Society of Canada," be refunded to

MacTavish, solicitors for the petitioners, less
printing and translation costs.
The motion was agreed to.
BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACT
EXAMINATION OF RECORDS

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have no objection to the postponement. I heard that the
Bill contains a section which prohibits publication of reports from the East before polls in
the West have closed. The prohibition, as I
understand it, is quite severe, applying not
only to official reports but also to announcements in newspapers and all other publications. I have not read the section.

Right lion. ARTHUR MEIGHEN moved:
That during the coming recess of Parliament
the Parliamentary Counsel of the Senate be
authorized and commissioned as follows:
1. To examine the records of the Quebec

(Right

Hon. Mr. Meighen) is right. The course
he suggests is a safe one, which is something
that cannot be said of all his suggestions. I
had the misfortune to be leading this side of
the House for a few months when my honourable friend to my left (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
was away regulating the League of Nations,
I think. An election bill came over from the
other House. I asked someone to look
through it, principally with the idea of getting

a few pointers, and ny recollection is that it
was found nccessary to make sixteen or
eigbteen amendments to carry out what
honourable members of that House desired.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I move that the
Bill be placed on the Order Paper for third

yesterday in respect of this.
The motion was agreed to.
INCOME WAR TAX BILL
FIRST READING
A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bill 164, an Act to amend
the Income War Tax Act.
The Bill was read the flrst time.
SECOND READING
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND nioved the
second reading of the Bill.
H1e said: Honourable senators, the purport
of this Bill ie explained by the titie, "An
Act ta amend the Income War Tax Act."
In some particulars the Bill provides for
relaxation of taxes: it is not extensive, but
it will be deemed important by the beneficiaries. In other particulars there je a strengthening of the authority of the Department af
National Revenue to reach out and coileot
moneys on behaîf of the State. 1 would draw

the attention of honoýurabie members ta sections 8, 9 and 10, which read as follows:
8. The schedule of rates at the end of subsection one of section eighty-eight of the said
Act, as enacted by section fourteen of chapter
forty of the statutes of 1935, is repealed and
the following substituted therefor:
"On gifts up to and including $25,000- 5%
On gifts exceeding$ 25,000 but not exceeding $ 50,000- 6%
100,000- 7%

1,000,000
9. Subsection eight of section eighty-eight of
the said Act, as enacted by section fourteen
of chapter forty of the statutes of 1935, and
amended by section nineteen of cbapter tbxrtyeigbt of the statutes of 1936, is furtber amended
by adding tbereto the foilowing paragraph:
year, if
gifts value thereof does not exceed an
" aggregate or donations made in any
the (g)
one-baîf of the difference bearnount equal to

tween the income of the taxpayer in the next
preceding year and the income tax which was
payable thereon."
10. Any increase of tax imposed by this Act
in respect of the years 1936 or 1937 or fiscal
periods ending therein shahl bear interest from
tbe firet day of September, 1938.
These are the most important sections of
the Bill.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable members, this is another measure

which need not have been delayed until the
end of the session. I presume it could have
been introduced only in the other House, but
there is no reason why that should not have
been done much earlier. The reading of a
few sections of an involved measure like this
before honaurable members have had a chance
of looking at the measure itself is about as

useful as-would ho the reading in simîlar
circumstances of a few extracts from a thesis
on the quinquasection of the biquadratie, or
some other high mathematical problem.
This being a
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
money Bill, we could hardly amend it. I
suppose we may very well accept whatever
changes it provides for, and recognize that
it is a measure for which the other House
is essentially responsible.
Will the
Rîght Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
honourable Minister say where the increased
taxes apply? We are ail desirous that taxation in the 'higher brackets be as high as will
secure the maximum revenue without providing incentive for taxpayers to leave aur
midst and contribute to the revenue of some
o-ther country. As I understand it, our rate
of taxation in the higher brackets is above

that which obtains in Great Britain.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am not quite
sure.

I saw a comparison the other day.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: It is, in the
higher brackets, federal and provincial being
taken together. As long as this can ho sa

without a penalty having to be paid in the
curtailment of activity, or even in the removal
of the taxpayer, there is no disposition ta
abject. But I shouid like to know where the
incidence of the higher taxes is.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
an what clause?

That wouid bear

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Clauses 32A and
32B show the general purpose and intent af
this Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: The first is

perfectly right.

itis

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If my right
honourable friend has his answer, I may move
second reading of the Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I should like
to read this 32B. Section 32A, or anything. of
such a nature as to prevent the avoidance
of taxes, is certainly right. I should like to
understand 32B before 1 assent to it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have before
me an explanation of all the clauses.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Section 32B simply says
that if the company is wound up and the assets
are distributed, their fair market price may be
determined and it may be assumed that they
have been sold at that price and the proceeds
distributed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That explains
it. That is to say, what is in reality a profit
and is being distributed on the winding up of
the company cannot be said not to be a profit
merely because the inventories were not
valued.
Hon. Mr..HAIG: Before the motion is put,
may I say that we in the West have a good
deal to do with the Income Tax Branch, and
I want to compliment Mr. Elliott on the work
he is doing. The lawyers in my city and province are well satisfied with the way in which
he handles that work. I wish to pay that
tribute to him.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: He is from Winnipeg?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No; his wife comes from
Winnipeg.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: That explains it.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I have one suggestion
to make. The War ended about twenty years
ago. This Act still continues to be called an
Act to amend the Income War Tax Act. I
think when the next amending Bill comes
before us we might take out the word "War."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes; but the
effect of the War still continues.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I feel like
adding a word to what the junior senator from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) has said about
Mr. Elliott. I do not know any official so
uniformly courteous and at the sarne time so
clear-headed and competent.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Perhaps I
should not make my statement so exclusive,
but certainly I know no one more courteous
and efficient. How Le gets time to see all
those who call on him in connection with
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHIEN.

income tax matters I do not know. I have had
a good many interviews with him, but I cannot recall any occasion when I got my way.
He always persuaded me I was wrong.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think the
opinion just expressed is the judgment of
everyone who has had to do with the Income
Tax Branch.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
THIRD READING

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.
CANADIAN BATTLEFIELDS
MEMORIAL COMMISSION
RESOLUTION

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: Honourable
senators, with the leave of the Senate, as I
have not given notice, and with the cordial
consent of the right honourable leader on
the other side. I would move:
That this House desires to record its thianks
to the members of the Canadian Battlefields
Memorial Commission, who served without
remuneration over a period of years, and whose
endeavours ensured the erection in France and
Belgium of appropriate memorials of the valour

and sacrifice of Canada's forces in the Great
War; and
That this House desires particularly to express
its appreciation of the services of Mr. Walter

S. Allward, who, as the designer and architect
of the memorial at Vimy, has given to the
world a work of art of outstanding beauty and
character. Through years to corne the Vimy
memorial will remain the symbol of Canada's
efforts in the War, and its tribute to those
who, on the field of battle, sought to preserve

the free institutions of mankind.
I should perhaps state in explanation of
this motion that the origin of the Canadian

Battlefields Memorial Commission dates from

1920, when the House of Commons appointed

a committee to examine into the question of
erecting memorials in France and Belgium to
the men who fell in those regions during the
Great War. That special committee of the
House of Commons decided to erect eight

menmorials. as follows: in Belgium, at Passchendaele, St. Julien, and Hill 62 (Sanctuary
Wood); and in France, at Vimy Ridge, Dury
(breaking of the Quéant-Drocourt Switch of
Hindenburg Line), Bourlon Wood (crossing
of the Canal du Nord), Courcelette (in the

Somme), and Le Quesnel (farthest point of
8-mile advance of Canadians on August 8,
1918). It was later decided to erect memorial
plaques at Mons and St. Hilaire.

569

JUNE 30, 1938
The Canadian Battiefielde Meanorial Commission was set up by Order in, Council of
Septernber 2, 1920, and accepted. thei responsibility of carrying out the mandate of the
Housp of Commons coinmittee.
The original personnel of that Memorials
Commission was composed of Major-General
Hon, S. C. Mewburn; the late Hon. Rodolphe
Lemieux; Lieut.-General Sir R. E.* W. Turner,
V.C., the late Hon. J. C. Turriff and the late
Colonel R. W. Leonard. 0f the five original
members of the commission only three: lived
to see the culmination of their task in the
unveiling of Vimy memorial, namely, Hon.
Mr. Mewburn, General Turner and Hon. Mr.
Lemieux. and since then Mr. Lemieux bas
passed away.
Under direction of the commission a
national comnpetition was held to secure suitable monument designs by Canaddan artists.
Two designs were selected: that of Mr. Walter
S. Allward. of Toronto, for the Vimy memorial; and thait of Mr. F. Chapman Clemesha,
of Regina, for the St. Julien memorial, which
was unveiled by His Royal Highness the
Duke of Connaught in 1923.
The members of the commission have served
over a period of fifteen years. They have
performed a patriotic work of great value,
for which they were given, no remuneration.
What they have done will outlive themselves
and be a testimony to generations to corne
of Canada's ability to prod-uce monuments
comparable in artistic quality to those which
other allied countries have erected in France
the sites of hattlefields from the Atlantic
-on
to Verdun.
Special mention should be made of the
invaluable assistance given to the commission
by its officers. 'The Secretary was Colonel
H. C. Osborne, our popular friend,, of Ottawa.
Brigadier-General H. T. Hughes was Chief
Engineer; Major D. C. U. Simpson, Resident
Engineer, and Mr. P. E. Nobbs, Architectural
Adviser. Others who rendered no-table services
were Lieut.-Colonel M. N. Ross; Dr. Oscar
Faber, O.B.E., D.Sc., M.I.C.E.; and Mr.
Luigi Rigamonti, master carver. Messrs.
Walter W. Jenkins and Company, Limited,
Torquay, England, were the contractors.
I wjll not attempt to describe the Vimy
monument, which was unveiled by his former
Mai esty, King Edward VIII, two years ago.
But I may say that I visited the site when
the monument was being erected, and I have
seen the monument itself since it was unveiled. As I looked upon it I felt proud, as
a Canadian, of the splendid piece of work
done by our own artist, Mr. Allward.
As honourable members know, the Senate
and House of Commons approved in 1923 the

gift made by France to Canada of 250 acres
of land in perpetuity, for the erection of the
Vimy memorial. The resolution passed by
our Parliament that year read as follows:
That Parliament do approve the acceptance
hy the Government of Canada of the gif t
graciously made by the Republic of France of
a tract of land 250 acres in extent on Vimy
Ridge at the site selected for the erection by
Canada, of a monument commemorating the
exploits of Canadian soldiers in the Great War
and in so doing records its sense of gratitude
for and«its bigh appreciation of the motives
which prompted France to associate herself
with a project so dear to the hearts of the
Canadian people.
This land which. was given to Canada, although in France, is virtually Canadian soil.
Over it our own flag floats. When the
memorial was unveiled King Edward, surrounded by bis Canadian Cabinet, received the
President of the Republic of France, who
recognized that wbilc on that site hie was virtually in a part of Canada.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The site of the
monument is an admirable one. It overlooks
a valley which extends as f ar as the eye can
reacb. Within a few hundred feet of the
monument are trenches which were manned
by our Canadian soldiers, and, at a littie further distance, some German trenches. Preserved by concrete walls and made accessible
by concrete stepa, which, in some cases, lead
to deptbs of 100 feet or more, these trenches
are a realistie reminder of the grim defence
maintained by our soldiers throughout four
years. For six or seven months out of the
year the monument and its surroundings are
an attraction for tourists from every part of
Europe and, indeed, ahl over the world. It
is recorded that during this period the spot
is visited every Sunday by an average of
10,000 persons. This vast number of visitors
cannot fail to be impressed by these memorials
to our valiant Canadian soldiers, who during
the whole time tbey were ini France neyer
retreated a foot from the enemy.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGREN: Honourable senators, we are ail very glad to join
ini this gracefully expressed, sincere and, I
may say, reverent tribute to the members. of
the Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission. As the names of these members were
read the thought came to me that each and
all of tbem were bound to the battlefields
of France by ties sadder, more poignant and
more lasting than any of the monuments
which now crown their devoted service to
this Dominion.

SENATE

I have not had the privilege of visiting
France since the last year of the War. Though
I have visited the site of the Vimy memorial,
I have never seen the memorial itself. Those
who have seen it are very earnest in their
praise of the achievement of Mr. Allward.
Possibly I could be permitted to quote particularly the architect of this splendid strueture in which we now are meeting, Mr. John
Pearson. No one, I fancy, has a more refined
and at the same time more exalted conception
of the glories of architecture than he. On his
return from France he described the Vimy
memorial to me in language so tender and so
fraught with feeling that I shall never forget
it. He told me that in his opinion that monument is one of the world's triumphs of architecture.
At this hour, when clouds are hovering over
Europe and indeed over the world, we can
only hope that the sacrifice of those to whose
honour monuments have been raised will
not be lost by the disturbance of that measure
of peace which we still enjoy. And we do
anxiously trust that if that measure of peace
should unhappily and cruelly be broken there
may be found defenders brave and strong
enough to ensure that those memorials of
our fallen soldiers may be saved from the
sacrilege of destruction by the brutal forces
of war.
The motion was agreed to.
TRANSPORT BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third
reading of Bill 31, an Act to establish a
Board of Transport Commissioners for Canada. with authority in respect of transport
by railways, ships and aireraft.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
I will try ta avoid repeating what I said
yesterday.
I propose to move an amendment. that this Bill be not now read a
third time, but this day six months.
The measure may be divided into five
parts: 1., definitions; 2, transport by water;
3, transport by air; 4, tolls; and, 5, agreed
charges. The meat of the proposed legislation is contained in the second and the
fifth parts.
I am opposed to the control over ships
which this Bill would give the Transport
Board. The honourable senator from Ottawa East (Hon. Mr. Coté) covered very
clearly the point that I want to make in
respect of this, and I adopt his language.
I deait with the matter of agreed charges
the other day.
One of my honourable
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

colleagues stated in committee that he was
aware of no demand for agreed charges. I
will not at this stage attempt to convince anyone whether it is or is not desirable to give
our railways the right to make such charges.
This illustration was given by the advocate
of agreed charges. He said a biscuit manufacturer in Montreal ships biscuits to Quebec
in the summer time at a rate of 15 cents a
hundred pounds, and in the winter at 45
cents. The railways cannot give him an allthe-year-round rate, because if they do they
must quote the same rate to all. Ta accomplish
their purpose they must have agreed charges.
The argument, as it stands, is unanswerable.
The only weakness about it is that it will
not stand, for the simple reason that neither
the water carriers nor the truckers will accept
the situation without a fight.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: May I interrupt
the honourable member for a moment? If
I understood Mr. Rand correctly, he said
that if the principle of agreed charges were
accepted by Parliament the railways could
give a rate of 25 cents in the summer and
35 cents in the winter, which would assure
their getting all the biscuit company's shipments.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Correct; that is exactly
what I said.
But under the present law,
if the railways give that shipper a rate of
35 cents in the winter instead of 45 they
have to give that lower rate to every shipper.
On that statement of fact I may be asked:
"Are you not in favour of agreed charges?"
But make no mistake, honourable members.
The truckers and the water carriers are not
going to take it lying down. We found
that out in Manitoba when the provincial
authorities started to regulate trucks. All
trucks then on the road were granted a licence,
and anyone desiring to put new trucks into
service had to show publie necessity and convenience. The life of a truck is about four
or five years. During that time you are
going to have a battle between the railroads and the trucks, and the railroads will
lose out.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The public will win
out.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The public will win out;
but this legislation is designed to help the
railrocds. Before our committee only the
railways and the owners of a small minority
of ships, 45 out of 165, asked for this legislation. Let us get that clear.
Besides the
truckers and the water carriers, all the primary
producers, all the manufacturers and all the

JUNE 30, 1938
merchants in the country are against this
legislation. Western Canada, Eastern Canada
-every part of Canada is against this legislation. Yet we are asked to pass it, because,
it is said, the investigation by the Special
Railway Committee of this House has demonstrated clearly that something must be done
for the railways if they are to survive.
Behind this struggle is a struggle between
Dominion and provincial rights. At the
present time the truckers who haul 98 per
cent of the L.c.l. traffic are controlled by the
provinces. We, as members of the Parliament
of Canada, feel that we should support the
railroad side of the argument. If for one
moment I thought the railroads would benefit
by this legislation, and the primary producers
of this country would not suffer, I should vote
for it; but I am doubly persuaded that not
only the primary producer, but also the manufacturer and every user of goods handled by
the railroads, either into or out of Western
Canada, will suffer by this legislation. Further,
I am persuaded the railroads themselves will
suffer a serious menace and challenge for the
next four or five years if this Bill is enacted.
I do not believe this is the way to solve the
railroad problern.
I am not going to discuss the Old Country
and its transport legislation, but I am convinced that any attempt to regulate boats is
against the spirit of water transport the world
over. Fundamentally we are absolutely wrong
when we seek to license and control boats and
boat rates. No evidence was given before our
committee in support of such regulation. True,
the Minister of Transport demanded that we
pass the Bill. When we made some minor
amendments he protested that we were
destroying the Bill. I do not think so. Our
duty is to pass legislation that is in the interest
of all the people of Canada. An important
function of the Senate is to see that sufficient
consideration is given to bills sent here from
the other House, in order that no hasty or illconsidered legislation may be enacted. We
should take the long view. I say, therefore,
that in respect of ship regulation we should
reject the Bill.
I say also that in respect of agreed charges
we should reject the Bill, although I am persuaded that politically, from my point of view,
it would be a fine thing to pass it, because, if
enacted, it will raise the very mischief al
over this country, to the detriment of the
present Government. I think the Administration will be deluged with protests from one
end of Canada to the other-from gasoline
station owners, from gasoline users, from
farmers, manufacturers and distributors using
their own trucks. All will attack this legislation.

571

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This Bill does
not affect farmers and others who use their
own trucks.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Oh, yes, it does. Once
you start to control transportation you start
to limit it, and in another two or three years
there will be a request for a further limitation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Bill does
not even affect any truck user.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Oh, yes; agreed charges
touch him. True, we cannot touch trucks,
because we have not legislative power; but
we have power-at least we think we haveto make agreed charges. If it does not give
business to the railways, this proposal for
agreed charges is no good. If it does give
business to the railroads, they will have to
get higher rates than they are getting for the
traffic now, or it will be no good to them.
At the present time they cannot compete
with water and highway carriers. I say that
if the legislation is to be of any use to the
railroads they must get more revenue from
it, and if they do, shippers will have to pay
the difference. That applies to the whole of
Canada; but Western Canada is particularly
affected, for we have to sell our wheat in the
world markets, and at the present time every
quarter, yes, every eighth of a cent makes all
the difference between a sale and no sale.
Our Governments in the past, by the Crowsnest Pass and other agreements, have tried
to prevent interference with the grain rates
out of Western Canada to the seaboard. It
may be said that, as our grain is shipped out
in bulk, it will not be affected; but I would
remind honourable members that shipments
to Ontario or Quebec would be covered by
agreed charges. I am afraid of any legislation
to limit or restrict the free use of the transportation facilities of this country, and,
speaking for opinion in Manitoba and the
West generally, I say we are opposed to this
Bill lock, stock and barrel. I submit it is
not in the interests of the producers and distributors of this country, and, further, that
instead of being an advantage it would be a
detriment to our railways.
I therefore move in amendment to the
motion for third reading, seconded by the
honourable member from Bedford-Halifax
(Hon. Mr. Quinn):
That the word "now" be left out and the
words "this day six months" added at the end
of the motion.
Hon. JAMES CALDER: May I ask a
question before the motion is put? As I
understand the honourable senator's statement, it means that if agreed charges are

572

SENATE

put into effect they will not result in increased
rates anywhere in Canada. Now, agreed
rates -are provided for what purpose? As I
see it, for the purpose of creating a condition whereby our railway companies shall not
be in competition with transportation facilities not regulated. The truck is not regulated or under control as to rates; the railway is regulated and under control. The honourable gentleman has intimated, that if
agreed charges go into effect there will be a
fight on, for, as he himself said, the steamboats and the trucks "will not take it lying
down." What does that mean? It means
rate cutting, not rate increasing. He intimates
that the truck and the boat will be prepared
to fight any schedule of rates the railway
companies put into effect under the provision for agreed charges. To sum up, agreed
rates would not, so far as I can see, mean increased rates to anyibody in Canada. Their
adoption would mean a decrease of rates, and
that would be in the publie interest.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I will answer my honourable friend. If he is correct, then the railroads will lose money.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:

No, not necessarily.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Therefore they will become
bankrupt; and consequently we shall have
to carry the load.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: No; the railways will
not get what they expect to get.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Let us take the case of a
boat running out of Montreal to Quebec.
It is charging a rate of 15 cents a hundred
pounds on biscuits. Thereupon the railroad
puts in a reduced rate and gets the traffic.
If I were running that boat what would I
do? Naturally I would cut the rate to 10
cents, or even lower, so long as it was sufficient to cover fuel and wages.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That is in the interest
of the public.
Hon. Mr. COPP: The manufacturer would
win out in that case.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: One minute, please.
The life of a boat is about five years, I think.
I am not an authority on the subject. But
suppose we take it as being ten years.
Hon. Mr. BLACK:

Twenty-five years.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Well, twenty-five years.
As a matter of fact, that cannot be the life
of the boat, for you have to take repairs into
consideration. As soon as that boat is driven
off the route, the railroad will put the rate
up again.
Hon. Mr CALDER.

Hon. Mr. MARSHALL:
Railway Commission?

What about the

Hon. Mr. HAIG: The Railway Commission cannot control rates going up.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL:

Yes, it can.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: The railway companies
will say they cannot handle the traffic at a
profit.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: The railways were
not allowed to raise rates in the days of Jim
Mabee.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: But he is dead and gone.
Hon. Mr. MARSHALL: He did a good job
while he was here.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I agree with you. That
is what the people in Great Britain are
dreading now. Reports from England emphasize that buyers of supplies, producers and
shippers are afraid that once highway conpetition is driven off, railroad rates will go up.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
come back again.
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

Then the trucks will

No.

Hon. Mr. CALDER:

Why not?

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Once the motor carrier
or the highway carrier is driven off, it is very
hard to get him back again. In the meantime the people of Canada will suffer. This
legislation is for the benefit of the railroads,
or to save the railroads, that is all; but if
my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Calder) is
correct, it cannot save them. For five or ten
years there will be a rate war, and the railways will lose business. Meantime there is an
uncertainty that is disastrous to business.
That is my answer to my honourable friend.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Question!

Hon. HENRY A. MULLINS: Honourable
senators, I have listened with some attention
to the remarks of the honourable the junior
senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig),
and I do not agree with him. I have lived
in Western Canada just as long as he has.
I know the menace of the truck on the highway, and I am net in faveur of the truck.
I am in favour of this Bill as amended. I ask
my honourable friend to go to Toronto or
Winnipeg and look at the trucks hauling the
products of the farms into the stockyards of
those cities. They have ruined the live stock
industry and are a menace to the country.
Now let me say for the benefit of my
honourable friend that we saluted the railway

Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
I find myseif in a position that I do not
exactly relish, namely, that of having bo
explain my vote against the amendment proposed by the honourable the junior member
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig). If my
vote were to be given strictly on the question
of principle, it might be in favour of the
amendment; so I should hike to explain why,
if the opportunity offers, I shall vote for the
Bill.
Two of the points at issue in this Bull
have been referred to at length by the honourable the junior member from Winnipeg. The
first is the control of lake shipping. I neyer
could see just wby the position of private
corporations and indivîduals engaged in lake
shipping, and who found business unprofit-

Hon. Mr. MeRAE : Our statements were entirely too conservative.
I was iinpressed, as I think were many
others, by the prevalence of special rates at
the present time. We have, for instance, a
winter rate and a summer rate on lumber from,
the Pacifie coast. At times it is substantially
more than the amount mentioned in the committee. It will be impossible, I fear, to make
an agreed rate for one manufacturer without
making it for another; so I think the agreed
charges will flot be applicable to, that business,
and the special rates will be continued, and
extencl to every shipper. I arn afraid the
agreed charges will not bring the railways much
additional moncy, and that, for the various
reasons which were discussed in the committee,
they will result in chaotic conditions.

However, this measure was discussed at

CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
FINANCING AND GUARANTEE
BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND moved the
third rcading of Bill 174, an Act to authorize
the provision of moneys to meet certain
expenditures made and indebtedness incurred
by the Canadian National Railways System
during the calendar year 1938, and to authorize
the guarantec 'by His Majesty of certain
securities to be issued by the Canadian
National Railway Company.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, I have had an opportuniiy
of studying this Bill.
It authorizes the
guarantee of bonds not exceeding the sum of
$17,574,233 for the Canadian National Railways during the calendar year 1938. This, of
course, will be only a beginning of the bonds
required by the system before the year is out.
Why this limit is fixed does not appear from
the discussion in the House of Commons, nor
from any information that I have. It does
appear. though, that the $17,571,233 comprises
$8.555.000 for new capital investmente i0 the
forin of additions and betterments, the rest
being for capital retirements and acqiition
of securities.
This acquisition, of course,
simply means the taking over by the Canadian
National Railways of new money requirements in the form of new issues of securities
by subsidiaries. Honourable members who
were on the Special Railway Committec will
recall that evidence was given by Mr. Fairweather and others to the effect that there
had been extensive betterments and repairs
to equipment this spring, which fact was said
to account for the very sad showing made by
the system in the early part of this year.
It looks as though capital requirements keep
growing ad infinitum, despite a very decided
falling off in traffic. Really, I cannot see how
so much more is needed in the way of betterments when traffic is so seriously lower than
it was even last ycar and each of the two
vears before that. It is difficult, indeed, to
forecast the future in the face of this policy
of continual expenditure.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I woiuld draw
the attention of my right honourable friend
to the fact that the shareholders of this institution are the people of Canada, whose
elected representatives are in the other House,
and that House bas a committee specially

JUNE 30, 1938
appointed to inquire into the accounts and requirements of the Canadian National Railways. That is why I believe there is justification for this Bill.
As to expenditures for additions and betterments, referred to by my right honourable
friend, I may say that necessity for these
may gradually appear-and, indeed, rapidly
appear-if the West produces the crop of
400 or 500 million bushels for which we are
hoping. The railways have to prepare themselves for the increase in traffie which will
result if our hope is realized.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN: I will not
prophesy as to this year's crop, in the absence
of the honourable junior senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig).
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.
DOMINION ELECTIONS BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND

moved the

third reading of Bill 91, an Act respecting the
Franchise of Electors and the Election of
Members of the House of Commons.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The bonourable leader of the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) statcd yesterday that the Bill was
well prepared, having been drafted, he thought,
by Mr. Bi.ggar. If it had been drafted by
Mr. Bîggar it would have been well prepared,
but it was not. My information is that the
Bill was drafted by Mr. Butcher, a former
mnember of the other House, and Mr. Castonguay. It is based maînly on the Act of
1920. I will not mention who prepared that
legislation, for fear the Government might
withdraw the Bill.

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.
CRIMINAL CODE BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 137,
an Act to amend the Criminal Code.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine in the Chair.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Perhaps I should
have mentioned yesterday that the explanation given by the Minister of Justice for this
Bill, which contains fifty-six sections, was a
very short one. He simply said:
I shail flot try to give the particuiars of all
the amendments, but the most important relate
to reckiess driviflg, salting mines and mine
samples, common gaming bouses, et cetera.

575

That brief comment indicates what the Minister of Justice considered to be the principal
amendments to the Code.
I would ask permission to have Mr. Anderson, of the Department of Justice, sit by my
side.
Section 1 was agreed to.
The CHAIRMAN: Shall we consider sections 2 to 9 together? They ail -appear to
deal with the subject of fire-arms. I wl
read the marginal headings.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I should like
to know what changes in the law are proposed. We have been legislating against
possession of fire-arms by aliens -almost every
other year for as long back as I can remember.
I do not know why we neyer seem to get the
law into a satisfactory form.
On section 2-alien not f0 have fire-arnis
without permit:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This is for the
purpose of putting the onus of proof upon the
allen to establish that he is not an alien.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That is al
right.
Section 2 was agreed to.
On section 3--seiling or lending:
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I suppose that
applies only to vendors in business, and flot to
individuals who seli their personal weapons.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The object of
this amendment is to provide that a person
must have a permit to purchase, before buying a pistol or revolver or other offensive
weapon. The present paragraph reads as
follows:
(d) sels, or without iawf ni excuse, gives or
lends any pistol, revolver or other offensive
weapon that may be concealed upon the person
to any one not being the hoider of a permit.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I do flot see
the distinction.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: In other words, if a
parent lends a shotgun to his son he will
violate the law.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGREN:- He will violate
the law as it is now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The amendment
covers purchasing.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I presume the
trouble was that the party getting the weapon
by purchase might have only a borrower's
permit.

576

SENATh

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, he had no
purchaser's permit.
Section 3 was agreed to.
Sections 4 and 5 were agreed to.
On section 6--registration of revolvers and
pistols:
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Most returned men
have automatic guns. Would this amendment
require their getting a permit?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: They must
register their weapons.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I thought you might
have exempted them.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It might be a
little dangerous in some cases.
Section 6 was agreed to.
Sections 8, 9 and 10 were agreed to.
On section 11-restriction on publication of
reports of judicial proceedings:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This is similar
to the British provision to protect public
morals.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: It is a padlock law.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My right
honourable friend should not use that expression too freely.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The amendment is
directed against yellow journalism.
Section Il was agreed to.
On section 12-common gaming bouse
defined:
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: What is the object
of this amendment?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND• Its object is to
include in the definition of a common gaming
house one where any direct or indirect fee
is charged for participation in a game or for
the use of appliances. The present provision
applies only to payments from stakes.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: Is this to apply
also to social clubs?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: So it would apply
to a game of bridge or poker in the Rideau
Club, for instance?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
If a fee is
charged.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: Certainly a fee
is charged. Any member would have to use
his own cards; he would not be able to buy
them if this amendment passed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There is nothing
in the amendment to prevent a member from
buying cards unless the price includes a fee
for the game.
Hon. M.r. MARCOTTE: Social clubs are
not rmn to make a profit; they are conducted
for the enjoyment of their members. It seems
to me that in line 39 after the words "charitable or religious" there should be inserted "or
social." The same change should be made in
line 42.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But there are
social clubs that are simply gambling institutions.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: They say that every
poker party is a social party.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: The law is already
broad enough to cover what the Department
of Justice wants to do by this amendment.
T think it goes too far.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am told that
the Department of Justice feels these abuses
cannot be controlled otherwise than through
such apparently stringent legislation.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: I have been connected with .clubs and sporting organizations
for the last fifty years. I have practised law
for more than twenty-five years and have had
considerable experience in criminal courts.
It is very easy for the ýpolice to establish
a case. After all, this amendment is only
for the purpose of making their work a little
easier. True, many clubs instead of being
conducted for social purposes are simply
gambling houses, but that is no reason for
penalizing bona fide social clubs. I would
rather the whole amendment were abandoned
than allowed to carry in its present form.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Many of the
so-called social clubs are gambling dens.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: They are not bona
fide social clubs. It is very easy for the police
to make out a case against such institutions.
But suppose you are a member of the Rideau
Club and want to play a game of bridge at
25 cents a corner. If you paid for the use
of the table you would come under this
amendment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is true if
you pay especially to enter the game, but
not if you are a member of the club.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: If you deprive a
bona fide social club of its profit in that
waY you will simply encourage a lot of
gambling dives.

JUNE 30, 1938
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: It is ridiculous
that this amendment should prevent a game
of bridge in a decent social club. Is there
not some way of restricting the application
of the section to gaming bouses? That is the
real purpose of the amendment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The difficulty
is that those institutions parade as social
clubs.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I know, but as a
matter of fact they are gaming bouses. The
law should be so drafted that such houses
will be put out of business, without decently
conducted social clubs being affected.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Let me direct
my honourable friend's attention to this section 12:
Sub-paragraph (ii) of paragraph (b) of sub-

section one of section two hundred and twentysix of the said Act is repealed and the following
substituted therefor:
"(ii) the whole or any portion of the stakes
or bets or other proceeds at or from such games
is either directly or indirectly paid to the person
keeping such house, room or place, or any
direct or indirect fee is charged to or paid by
the players or any of them for the right or
privilege of participating, or for the purpose
of enabling them or any of them to participate,
in such games or for the use of any gaming
appliances, tables, chairs or other paraphernalia
employed in playing such games; but the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to any
bouse, room or place while occasionally being
used by charitable or religious organizations
for playing games therein for which a direct
fee is charged to the players if the proceeds
are to be used for the benefit of any charitable
or religious object."
The object of the amendment is to include in
the definition of "common gaming house" one
where any direct or indirect fee is charged
for participation, in a game or for the use
of appliances, and so on, with the exception
provided for. The present provision applies
only to payments from stakes.
I would rem-ind my honourable friend from
Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte) that any decent
social club charges its membership an annual
fee, and therefore would not fall under this
definition.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: Oh, no, we are
not covered by that at all. Suppose you go
to the club-house of the Knights of Columbus,
either here or in Montreal. You have paid
your entry fee, and then if you want to play
a friendly game of poker you have to pay
an extra 25 or 50 cents. Thereupon the club
comes within this definition of a gaming
bouse. It is a matter of evidence; it is a
matter of fact. Because you want to prevent
racketeers or gaming clubs from benefiting,
you prevent everyone from indulging in social
life.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If a club finds
that it is in the red and wants to increase its
revenue, it can do so by raising the fees, and
thus avoid the risk of being classed with clubs
in which one pays for a seat at a table and
participates in a game of chance. A line must
be drawn between genuine, reputable clubs
and those which falsely parade under the
title of social clubs. I do not know exactly
what the situation is in Montreal to-day, but
there was a time when the so-called social
clubs flourished. You could sec them as you
passed along the streets; they even advertised.
The Department of Justice is trying to draw
a line between them and respectable, wellknown institutions. My honourable friend
wants to know if the Rideau Club would not
come under this head. I say it would not,
and no respectable institution would. If it
needs money it levies a special fee.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: If a club increases
its fee, it will never get any new members.
I know that from actual experience.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I think there is
something to be said on both sides. It is
the business of the Department of Justice to
draft a definition that draws the line between
the two kinds of clubs. I know how difficult that is to do. But it seems to me that
under this clause, if a member goes into a club
for the purpose of playing a game of cards,
even if the stake is only 25 cents, and buys
a pack of cards at twice their value, as sometimes happens, and the club gets a profit, lie
is directly or indirectly paying for the
privilege of playing. Is that right?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

That is true.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Then my honourable friend from Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte) is quite right in saying that the law
goes too far. As I say, it is very difficult
to draft a law to caver those clubs which are
conducted exclusively for the purpose of
gambling, and which do a tremendous amount
of harm. They have members who pay a fee.
I think the Department of Justice should
concentrate on that and bring in an amendment this afternoon.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Before accepting the amendment of my honourable friend
(Hon. Mr. Marcotte) may I suggest as an
alternative that the clause should read:
But the provisions of this paragraph shall
not apply to any house, room or place while
occasionally being used by charitable or
religious organizations, or to a bona fide social

club.

Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: That is all right.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is suggested
ta me that the addition should be made at
the end of the clause.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: It would be better
to insert the words "but the provisions of
this paragraph shall n-ot apply to any bona
fide social club," and then continue with the
words:
-- or to any house, rooni or place while occasionally being used by charitable or religious
organizations,and se on.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I think the words
"bona fide social club" should follow the
word "charitable" in line 39.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am told that
it will be very difficult to apply this amendment, and I suggest that the committee might
be tested on it.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: If you put the
amendment at the end of the clause it is
subject to the words "while occasionally
being used," and everybody knows that in
bona fide social clubs members play cards
every day.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: The word "occasionally" applies in both instances?

On section 14-disorderly

conduct:

Hon. Mr. LEGER: Honourable senators,
it seems to me that by this section we are
opening wide the door to prosecution and
persecution. The explanation given is that
the a-mendment is to cover cases of shouting.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The only change
is in the words, "or in any other way."
Hon. Mr. LEGER: It seems to me that if
this were passed a person would certainly
have to wateh his step and guard his tongue
while he is walking on the street. Under this
section, as I read it, one could be indicted
and prosecuted for even walking the street.
That, of course, is absurd, but the section is
open to that construction. The existing clause
defines how a disturbance.is caused, but the
added words, "or in any other way," do not
define it, and a magistrate might say that
running on the street or walking fast was
causing a disturbance. It secms to me that
if the section is intended to cover shouting,
that word should be used.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I think my honourable friend is quite right.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Could not anyone

Hon. Mr. BEAUIBIEN: If I understand this
article as drafted, it is justified because it is
prefaced by the word "disturbance."

Hon. Mr. DANDURANU: The objeet of
this amendment is to increase the penalty and
to place the burden of proof on the accused
with respect to the intent to, escape liability.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would point
out that this applies to vagrancy. The law of
vagrancy does not apply Vo persons of generaIly good character, but is intended to apply
to loose, idle and disorderly persons.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: So ahl women walking on the streets would have to carry
certificates to show that they are not loose
women.
No, no; the reason this class is
widened is to include shouting. Why not put
in the word "shouting"?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It amuses me
to think that a magistrate dcclared that

Hon. Mr. LEGER: The magistrate was

The CHAIRMAN:
Section 16 provides:
Section two bundred and eighty-five of the
said Act, as amended by section six of chapter

of chapter forty-seven of the statutes of 1934,
by section four of chapter fifty-six of the
statutes of 1935, andi by section fifteen of this

580

SENATE

Act, is further amended by adding thereto the
following subsections:
"(6) Every one who drives a motor vehicle
on a street, road, highway or other public
place recklessly, or in a manner which is
dangerous to the public, having regard to all
the circumstances of the case, including the
nature, condition, and use of the street, road,
highway or place, and the amount of traffic
which is actually at the time, or which might
reasonably be expected to be, on such street,
road, highway or place, shall be guilty of an
offence and liable
(a) upon indictment to imprisonment for a
term not exceeding two years or to a fine not
exceeding one thousand dollars or to both such
imprisonment and fine; or
(b) on summary conviction to imprisonment
for a term not exceeding three months or to a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars or to
both such imprisonment and fine.
(7) Where any person is convicted of an
offence under the provisions of subsections one,
two, four or six of this section the court or
justice may, in addition to any other punishment provided for such offence, make an order
prohibiting such person from driving a motor
vehicle or automobile anywhere in Canada during any period not exceeding three years.
(8) Every one is guilty of an offence and
liable on summary conviction to imprisonment
for a term not exceeding six months or to a
fine not excee(ding five hundred dollars or to
both such imprisonment and fine who, whilst
disqualified from driving a motor vehicle or an
automobile by reason of the legal suspension or
cancellation in any province of his permit or
licence to drive therein, or by reason of an
order made under the provisions of subsection
seven of this section, drives any motor vehicle
or automobile anywhere in Canada."
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Honourable senators,
I think there is a disproportionate penalty
provided in at lcast one, if net more, of
these subsections. It seems to me that the
provision for imprisonmient "not exceeding
two years" or a fine "not exceeding one thousand dollars," or a combination of "both such
imprisonment and fine," is altogether excessive.
Experience bas shown that when penalties are
too severe there is more likelihood of guilty
persons being acquitted. I realize that the
magistrates and judges have seme discretion
in the matter, but I think the maximum
limits of the penalty are altogether too high.
Compare them with the penalty provid-ed by
section 15, which we have just passed. Under
that section, if a person is guilty of a hitand-run offence he is liable to a fine of not
more than $500 or to imprisonmient for a
term not exceeding six months. Yet under
this section 16 a man convicted of reckless
driving, even though no accident had occurred,
could be given a much heavier sentence.
Under subsection 8 another very heavy penalty
is provided for a person convicted of driving
when his licence -is suspended: he may be
sentenced to prison for a term not exceeding
six months, or fined net more than $500,
The CHAIRMAN.

or made to serve the term and pay the fine
as well. Of course I realize that some serious
instances may arise where it is necessary to
deal severely with a person who drives when
his licence is suspended, but if some thoughtless young person whose licence has been
cancelled decides to drive and run the risk
of being caught, he may be placed in jail
for six months along with hardened offenders.
To my mind these penalties are atrocious,
barbarie.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: What penalty is inflicted upon parents whose child is killed by
a reckless driver?
That is something far
worse than anything to which my honourable
friend has referred.
In my opinion this
amendment is an attempt to take care of a
situation that has become simply dreadful.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: I realize that.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Severe penalties must
be provided if this situation is to be improved.
The man or woman or boy who
drives a motor-car recklessly should be made
to understand that that sort of thing must
stop.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: The toll of death
resulting from reckless and inefficient driving,
all over this continent, is terrible.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: And I may say
to my honourable friend that the provinces
are wide-awake to the seriousness of the
situation. They are moving ahead of us in
the matter of increasing penalties. For a
second offence Ontario bas already provided
as severe penalties as those proposed in this
amendment.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Justification for
penalties of this kind is surely to be found
in the fact that for the last ten years an
average of more than 40,000 persons a year
have been killed by automobiles in the United
States.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: And in Canada
during the last ten years there bas been an
average annual death toll from automobiles
of 1,150. Can laws possibly be too severe
in the face of a situation like that?
Hon. Mr. HARDY: In England, where the
penalties are heavier than here, motor accidents
and deaths therefrom have been increasing
right along. I have known of instances of
merely thoughtless driving-not what could
be called reckless driving-where motorists
have had their licences cancelled for two or
three years. For what we might regard as a

JUNE 30, 1938
fairly light offence the English courts will
without hesitation sentence a man to a year
in jail. Yet in the last three years the number of deaths through automobile accidents ini
England has been increasing.
Hon. Mr. LEGER Why flot eut these penalties in two?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: 1 think the penalties
proposed here are severe, but I appreciate the
necessity of eliminating reckless driving. We
should not forget that this section applies flot
only to those who drive recklessly, but also to
those who drive "hn a manner which is dangerous to the public." What does that mean?
Anybody who drives a car knows that lie
frequ.ently does something which might faîl
within the meaning of that phrase. Every
time you go a few inches over the centre of
the road you are, I suppose, doing something
dangerous. As my honourable friend from
Leeds (Hon. Mr. Hardy) lias said, the penalties are heavy.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In cases of minor
infractions of the law, summary proceedings
would be taken.
Section 16 was agreed to.

Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: It seems to me
there is absolutely no proportion between the
fine and the term of imprisonment. The
fine has been increased froma $20 to $50-about
two and a haîf times; but the term of imprisonment has been incrensed from one
month to twenty-four months-twenty-four
times.
Hon. Mr. DANDITRAND:
My honourable friend will observe the explanatory note
on the opposite page:
The objeet of the amendments to sections
three hundred and seventy-four and thrce hundred and seventy-flve is to, make the penalty
eonform to that contained in section three
hundred and seventy for stealing certain
animaIs. These amendments are made at the
request of various municipal county councils.
It is simply a maximum penalty.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: I know; but the
honourable gentleman will certainly admit
that if a man is to be fined $50, it is not
reasonable that in default lie should lie sentenced to two years' imprisonment.
As I
-say, there is no proportion between the two.

Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
I wish te,
make a suggestion to the honourable leader
of the Government. A stolen automobile is
the indispensable instrument of the major
crimes of to-day. But for the stolen automobile, there could lie ne spreading of these
maj or crimes of a most daring and devilish
ebaracter. 1 think we shall have to make it
compulsory on every owner to lock the door
of his car, and its ignition, and on the manufacturer to, provide different keys for the
ignition and the door. The motor can bo
started by an ingenious mechanical thief,
but he might find it difficuit to unlock the
car door. It seems to me that in flua day
of the motor-car the public will have to bo
taught to help in the protection of property.
The owner who leaves his car so that somebody can steal it does something not only
harmful to himscîf, but vastly more harmf ul to life and property.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I think it is
an excellent suggestion, but I do not see
how it can be put into effeet just now.

Honourable
MARCOTTE:
Mr.
Hon.
senators, in reading over this section it strikes
me that we are getting away more and more
from the principles of British law. You will
find in practically every section that the burden of proof is on the accused. There is
always a prima facie case. Under the principle of law that no person is guilty until
he is proven guilty, you are net able to force
an accused person to give evidence in court;
but if you put on him the burden of proving
that he is not guilty, yen can put him into
the box and cross-examine him. I think that
is going too far.

The

Hon. Mr. HAIG: This section refers to
"milk, biy-products of milk or other liquid
commodities." In the city of Winnipeg there
are four dairy companies, and if you return
a bottle of one of those companies to another
company it will be acccepted.

The object of these amendments is to provide

offences in question.
The only amendments to these sections are

On section 12-common gaming house
defined (reconsidered):
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I move that
clause 12 be amended by inserting in line 38,
page 5, after "place," the following:
-while occupied and used by an incorporated
bona fide social club if the whole or any portion
of the stakes or bets or other proceeds at or
from such games is not either directly or indirectly paid to the person keeping such house,
room or place, and no fee in excess of ten cents
per hour or fifty cents per day is charged to
the players for the right or privilege of participating in such garnes norHon. Mr. COTE: Before the amendment is
carried I should like to ask why the word
"incorporated" is inserted. There are many
bona fide social clubs that are not incorporated.
There are branches of fraternal societies
throughout the land which are not part of the
incorporated company, but only local branches.
They would not receive the benefit of the
amendment.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Are they not
branches of the parent incorporation?
Hon. Mr. COTE: No. They are quite
independent. They are a local partnership.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Every member is
responsible?
Hon. Mr. COTE: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The reason
that word is used is to make it possible ta
follow the societies and make sure that they
have not been organized just for the hour and
are not likely to disappear the next day. If
they ask for letters patent they can be traced
for the purpose of seeing what their organization is. I think it is an advantage to be able
ta follow them.
Hon. Mr. COTE: It is suggested to me, and
I am willing ta adopt the suggestion, that
the words "or branches thereof" be added
after the words "incorporated social clubs."

SENATE

584

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would a branch
not be covered by the incorporation of the
-nother society? It is a part of the whole.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I think it would be
covered. So far as we in the province of
Quebec are concerned, we have a means
whereby, without any cost at all, the clubs
can be incorporated by the municipality.
Hon. Mr. COTE: How would it be to say,
"incorporated or constituted either by agreement or under local incorporation"?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: You are loosening the guarantee which the word "incorporated" gives.
Hon. Mr. COTE: Not to a very great extent, because it would have to be a bona fide
social club before it would be entitled to the
protection of the amendment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am told that
a club may be a bona fide social club and yet
be carrying on a racket. I think we should
try the clause as it is.
Hon. Mr. COTE: You do not get my point.
I am rather helpless, because I have not a
copy of the amendment before me. Would
this be satisfactory: add after the words
"social club" the words "or branches or councils thereof"?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have no objection to that.
Hon. Mr. COTE: I move that after the
words "social club" the words " or branches
thereof" be added.
The amendment was agreed to.
Section 12, as amended, was agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed to.
The Bill was reported, as amended.

ECONOMY
REPORTS

INTERNAL

COMMITTEE

SENATE EMPLOYEES

Hon. G. V. WHITE presented, and moved
concurrence in, the sixth report of the Standing Committee on Internal Economy and
Contingent Accounts.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I am not
going to object to the report, but I do wish
to comment upon the continual growth of the
scale of remuneration. It is very easy to keep
lon. Mr. COTE.

raising that scale and apparently very difficult to bring it down. It would seem that
the only practical course is to leave things
where they are.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not recall
whether my right honourable friend is a
member of the committee.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I may be,
but I could not get to its meeting.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am a member
of the committee, and I confess I too was
unable to attend its sitting. Perhaps the
Sena.te itself should sometimes look into its
accounts early in the session and adopt a
policy which could be carried out by the
Internal Economy Committee. It is true
that the Senate has the right to deal as it sees
fit with the committee's reports, but often
it is difficult to intervene and alter any recommendation made by the committee, which has
had the advantage of receiving first-hand
information on the subject concerned. I am
not at all intending to criticize, but I believe
that these reports are presented a little late
in the session, when there is very little time
left for members to examine them.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: May I ask the chairman
of the committee (Hon. Mr. White) whether
he can give us any reasons for the recommended increases? It is a regular occurrence
to have similar reports presented at the end
of every session, but, thinking back over a
period of some fifteen years, I cannot recall
having ever heard any explanations for such
increases. They may be based on statutory
requirements or long service, but, whatever
the fact is, we do not know it.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: I can assure honourable
members that the committee gave the fullest
possible consideration to these matters. We
had a number of applications for increases
which were not granted. The committee felt
that where increases had been recommended
they were justified by the merit of the
respective employees.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Is the explanation satisfactory?
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Just about as satisfactory as answers we get to any other requests
for explanations of recommended increases
in pay. In other words, it is not satisfactory
at all.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Of course, it
would be somewhat unjust to make general
declarations concerning a number of increases,
some of which may be of a petty nature and
quite acceptable to the House. I imagine that

585

JUNE 30, 1938
in most instances the Senate would be quite
agreeable to what is recommended by the
committee.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: We have taken our eue
from the supplementary estimates.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Then there
will be further supplementâry estimates.
The motion was agreed to.
PRESS REPORTERS OF THE SENATE

Hon. G. V. WHITE presented, and moved
concurrence in, the seventh report of the
Standing Committee on Internal Economy
and Contingent Accounts.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I would suggest
that this report be taken into consideration
to-morrow.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: That would
be equal to the six months' hoist.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: I think my honourable
friend from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) is
unreasonable. I submit this report ought to
be dealt with immediately.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I insist that it
stand over until the next sitting.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, objection has been made by the
honourable gentleman from Parkdale (Hon.
Mr. Murdock) to the report being taken
into consideration to-day. Under the Rules,
unanimous consent of the House is necessary
to permit consideration of a report sooner
than one day after it is presented. Therefore this report cannot be taken up to-day.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: I appeal to my honourable friend from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) not to insist that the Rules be followed
in this case. He realizes that Parliament
will likely prorogue to-day. I think that in
fairness to the committee the report should
be dealt with now.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I do not want
to appear obstinate. I agree with the sentiment expressed a few moments ago by the
right honourable leader on the other side
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighen) about increases.
Now, if honourable members want to enter
into a discussion of what is involved in this
particular report, I will withdraw my objection, go upstairs, get some papers and come
back and go into the matter thoroughly.
Personally I regard, some of the things that
have been done in connection with this item
as-if you will pardon the expression-a pure
and simple hold-up. Do not forget that before

our dear old departed friend Tom Blacklock
went to his reward he was paid a certain
weekly allowanoe while the Senate was not
in session. That was unanimously agreed
to, I think.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It seems to me
the honourable member is out of order.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Excuse me.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I rise to a point of order.
Has che last Order been passed?
Hon. Mr. COPP: No; it is held up.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Other people can hold
up things too.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Order!

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I rise to a point of
privilege. In committee I voted with the
honourable member from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) against this report, but, as it was
adopted after full discussion, I certainly object
to its being held up now. I do not intend
to be on a committee and let that happen
without protest. So far as I am concerned,
there will be no more suspension of rules
for the rest of the afternoon. We can sit
to-morrow, if necessary.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I understand that
before the honourable senator from Parkdale
was called to order, an appeal had been made
to him to withdraw his objection, and he
was speaking to that question. I think he
should be given time to explain his position.
Hon. Mr. DENNIS: Honourable senators,
reference has been made to the late Thomas
Blacklock. He was a very dear personal friend
of mine and of .many other members of this
House. Many honourable gentlemen will
recall that before his appointment as our press
reporter the work of the Senate received very
little publicity from the newspapers of this
country. It was only when the matter was
brought to the attention of the Canadian
Press, and we had its representative in this
House, that the Senate received full publicity
across the continent. I maintain that the
remuneration suggested for the representatives
in the Senate Press Gallery is a very modest
amount.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DENNIS: If we want publicity
for our work, then I think this item should
be passed.
Hon. Mr. BLACK:

Hear, hear.

586

SENATE

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Do other honourable senators wish to speak to the point
of order?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Surely
no point of order involved.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: It is rather difficult
for me to ignore so many suggestions that
these reports should be dealt with. On the
understanding that early next session I shall
place on the Order Paper a list of questions
which I hope will elicit the facts in this case.
I withdraw my objection now.

there is

The Hon. the SPEAKER: On the point
of order raised by the honourable junior
member from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig), I
would remind honourable senators that we
have been transgressing the Rules during the
past few days; there is no question about that.
Under the Rules a report can only be taken
into consideration forthwith by unanimous
consent. The honourable member from Parkdale objectcd, and thereupon only one course
was left open ta me: to declare that the
report would be taken up at the next sitting
of the House.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: Honourable members,
my honourable friend from Parkdale a few
moments ago said he would consent to proceed with consideration of the report if given
time ta get his papers. I should like him
to equip himself so that we may dispose of
the matter now.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:

Do it to-morrow.

lon. Mr. HAIG: All right. That is an old
game two can play at.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Honourable members,
it seems to me unfortunate that we did not
begin this discussion when the first report
was prcsented. Then we might have objected
to them all. But to hold up the last item is,
I think, manifestly unfair. I am willing that
the Senate should reconsider all the reports,
though I am not prepared to say that the
remuneration is too high. As to the recommendation now before us, I agree with my
honourable friend to my left (Hon. Mr.
Dennis) that the remuneration of our press
reporters is not excessive; in fact it is very
modest. Further, I agree with him that for
many years the proceedings of the Senate
were given no publicity whatever in the press
of the country, and that for the past few
years there tas been a great improvement in
this respect. It is, I believe, for the benefit
of the country generally that full publicity
should be given to the proceedings of this
House, since some of the nost important
legislation is either initiated here or so
amended by the Senate as to be of real value
to the country. Personally, I am strongly in
favour of the reportSome Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: -and I do not think it
should be quashed on technical grounds.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

FARMERS' CREDITORS ARRANGEMENT
BILL
MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE OF COMMONS

The Hon. the SPEAKER presented the
following message from the House of Commons:
Resolved that a message be sent to the Senate
to acquaint Their Honours that with respect
ta Bill No. 25, an Act to amend the Farmers'
Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934. this House
has substituted a further amendment agreed
upon at the Free Conference with the Senate
i lieu of the Senate's second amendment, to
which the House had disagreed and on which

the Senate had insisted; and tao request the
concurrence of the Senate thereto.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
senators, I move, seconded by Right Hon.
Mr. Meighen-since we were both Managers
of that Free Conference-that the Senate
concur in the amendment which is now
submitted to this Chamber.
The motion was agreed to.
PENITENTIARY BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 175, an Act respecting
Penitentiaries.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable senators will find on
the right-hand page of the Bill this short explanatory note:
The general object of this Bill is to establish
a

commission with power,

under the

Minister

of Justice, to control and manage the penitentiaries.
At present the penitentiaries are

JUNE 30, 1938
directed and administered by a Superintendent
and three inspectors as officers of the Department of Justice.
To attain this objective it is necessary to
amend many of the sections of the Penitentiary
Act, as well as to re-number the same, and for
the purpose of clarity the provisions of the
said Act have been amended and consolidated
in the present Bill.
I desire to submit the explanation given
by the Minister of Justice when he presented
to the House of Commons the resolution
preceding this Bill. He said:
I do not minimize, the committee may be
sure, the great importance of this resolution
and the legislation which will follow it. As
the honourable member for Winnipeg North
Centre (Mr. Woodsworth) said, this question
is one which bas been before the country for
many years. Rightly or wrongly there has been
a feeling that all was not perhaps as well as it
should be in the penal institutions of Canada,
and I well remember well-meaning citizens
imploring us te carry on an investigation. I
was on the other side of the House at the time
when that great social worker, my own fellow
citizen and townsman, Archdeacon Scott, the
padre, came to see me and besought me to
plead with the then Government for an investigation into the penitentiaries. A large body
of public opinion was certainly aroused at the
time, and when the campaign of 1935 took
place the present Leader of the Government
made a promise that there would be an investigation by royal commission into the administration of the penitentiaries.
We came into office in October, 1935, and
the royal commission was appointed in February,
1936. The resolution before us is the result
of the report of that commission. Whatever
may be our opinion as to its findings and recommendations, I think everyone will agree that
its report is a considerable and well-prepared
work and that the commissioners have devoted
their energies and abilities to doing the work
as completely and even as perfectly as it could
be done. This does not mean, of course, that
we are to agree with everything they may
suggest or recommend. I personally agree with
a great many of the things they recommend.
With some of them I do not agree, and as to
many others I have doubts whether they should
be carried into practice. But as far as one of
the recommendations is concerned, and it is
their main recommendation, the one which is
embodied in this resolution and in the Bill to
follow, namely, the appointment of a commission or a prison board to replace the present
administration, with that recommendation I am
in agreement.
Most of the other suggestions and recommendations-and there is a multitude of themwill have to wait. Most of them can be
carried out by regulations after the commission,
the prison board, to be appointed have satisfied
themselves that they should be carried out;
but the most important of them will have to
be the subject of legislation, and Parliament
of course will have ample time to study the
report and consider the advisability of making
The commissioners in their
those changes.
report suggest that it is a work of five years
to put into effect all the recommendations which
they make, but this Bill, I repeat, is merely
for the purpose of creating a prison board.

I fully sympathize with the view expressed
by my right honourable friend the Leader of
the Opposition (Mr. Bennett), by my honourable friend the member for Fraser Valley (Mr.
Barber), and by my honourable friend the
member for Yale (Mr. Stirling), that the
members of the House have not had sufficient
time to read and consider this voluminous report; and if this legislation would have the
effect of carrying out all the recommendations
of the commission, I would certainly feel that
their contention was even stronger than it is.
But so far as merely creating a prison board
is concerned, changing the present system in
that respect, I do not sec that it is so essential
or necessary to have read all the arguments in
favour of the numerous changes which are
suggested. There may be some who think, as
my right honourable friend does, that we should
wait, but I am quite sure that there are a
good many more who would strongly criticize
the Government for not doing anything this
session, after this report has been tabled.
I do not agree with the basis on which my
right honourable friend lays his strongest objection. He says that we are asking the committee
to render a verdict against General Ormond.
We are doing nothing of the kind. It is not
the person of the superintendent; it is the
system against which a verdict is rendered. If
there is a verdict it is a verdict against a
system; it is a question not of changing a
man and putting another man in his place, but
of changing the system. My honourable friends
who spoke of the dismissal of General Ormond
did not state the position correctly. There is
no question of dismissing the superintendent by
the creation of a commission.
Mr. Stirling: That is the recommendation
Mr. Lapointe (Quebec East): True, his
office would disappear. As this happens quite
frequently in the Civil Service, he would be
eligible for retirement allowance if be is entitled
to any. The question of dismissing General
Ormond bas not been considered at all. Surely,
if the policy of having a prison board in charge
of the administration of the penitentiaries of
Canada is the right policy, no single man
should be an obstacle to putting that policy
into effect. I repeat, the fact of giving effect
to the recommendation of creating a prison
board does not mean that anything is done
against the superintendent who is in charge
at the present time.
Of course J should be following the line of
least resistance if I were to accept the view
that it would be better to wait a few months.
This will be a very difficult task. The appointment of the three men who will serve on this
prison board will be a task of great magnitude. Some seem to believe that we should
find supermen for that work. Unfortunately
they do not exist 'any more in Canada and
the other countries of the world. We have
to find the best men possible. I am free to
admit that at the present time I do not know
what men will be appointed on that board.
I have already received many requests, and I
am afraid I shall disappoint some of the
writers when I say that the choice which will
be made will not be made from among those
who have written. I may add that these will
not be political appointments. If there is a
work which will be most responsible and difficult, it will be this. It is a work which does
not bring much satisfaction. There is no

588

SENATE

occupation more open to criticism than that of
those in charge of penitentiaries, working all
the time earnestly, satisfying nobody and being
subject to criticisrn which is not always fair.
I think I am right in saying this. But I am
going to do my best, with the help of my
ceolleagues, to find three men who will most
adequately recommend themselves to our appreciation. I have a great deal of sympathy
with the suggestion of the honourable member
for Portneuf (Mr. Gauthier) that one of them
should be a medical man. I believe that is
recommended by the members of the royal
commission. But as honourable members will
see when the Bill is introduced, it will come
into force only on proclamation.
Of course
we have to consolidate the Penitentiaries Act
by striking out in many places the words
'Minister" and "Superintendent" and replacing
them by "board" or "commissioners." But the
Bill in itself will mainly consist of this great
change of ereating a board to administer the
penitentiaries.
My right honourable friend has spoken of
the parole system and of the change which is
suggested by the commission. I must say, without enlarging upon it, that I am inclined to
agree with him that the carrying out of the
recommendation in that regard will be a
difficult step to take. This, however, will be
considered later, and Parliament will have its
say if this change is suggested in a practical
way.
I do not think I have anything to add to
this. When the Bill is discussed after it has
been introduced, I shall be prepared to give
any further information.
I thought I would give this statement, because after it was made, earnestly, sincerely,
loyally, the Minister of Justice said that while
he had but respect and esteem for General
Ormond, the superintendent would have to
disappear and bo replaced by the commission.
The Minister recognized the difficult situation
in which General Ormond was placed, and had
nothing but words of esteem for him. I have
mentioned this in order to show
how the
Minister approached the subject. He has
declared somewhere that he did net feel that
he would be doing justice to himself if he
failed to state that he could net properly
discharge his duties if he were net granted the
powers which he seeks under this Bill. For
this reason he begged of Parliament to accept
this legisiation. the sole object of which is to
confine the administration of our penitentiary
system to three commissioners.
With these remarks I move the second reading of the Bill.
Right Hon. ARTHUR MEIGHEN: Honourable senators, there is no time this session to
discuss adequately the penitentiary question.
Honourable members who have been here for
any number of years know pretty well what
I think of it now. I do net try to minimize
the necessity of maintaining a sound, sensible
and well thought out penological system, and
I do not try to argue that what we have been
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

maintaining, and what we have to-day, is
absolutely perfect. I do think our penitentiary
system has been, and is, reasonably efficient,
and I think there are other problems of
infinitely more consequence weighing on us
in Canada, which are more urgently in need
of the expenditure of the time, money and
controversy which have been spent in relation to those who have committed crimes
against society.
I do not know what the state of psychology
of the masses at this time is. It seems to be
to deprecate anything in the world in the
way of industry, enterprise and success; to look
upon the man who does something for himself
-and therefore for everybody, if he does it
honestly and within the law,-and who employs others and contributes to the general
betterment of humankind within the nation,
as prima facie a public enemy. It seems to
regard the man who rests lazily in the arms
of the State and depends upon the public to
keep him going, who does nothing and who is
content to accept relief, or, still worse, who is
in jail, with the tenderest and most infinite
solicitude as one of the darlings of the nation.
I may have exaggerated that attitude of mind;
but it exists; it is everywhere. And it is
that attitude which has driven the Government-I think, against its own will and judgment-to spend almost a fortune in getting
the opinions of 1,860 prisoners in our penitentiaries as to whether they were properly
treated, and in examining various officials,
guards, and se forth, throughout the country,
the assumption being that three men may
make themselves experts and authorities,
speaking as Jove from high Olympus, on the
management of penitentiaries.
I regard the protection of society as the
first object of punishment, and by far the
major object. The regeneration, if possible.
of the prisoner, is the second.
For two of the inembers of the commission, and particularly for the chairman, I
have nothing but respect and high regard.
Se far as I can survey the field, I do not
think that a better chairman could have been
selected.
He bas had wide experience, he
knows the whole of Canada well, and ho has
the right make-up generally to compose difficulties, to come to intelligent opinions if
allowed to do so, and, were ho alone, lo
express them. I have much regard also for
Mr. Craig. I have seen little of him for
many years; so perhaps I should say no
more. As for the third commissioner-well,
I see in the report a great deal of what I
should regard as the fruit of his appointment.
The less I say about him, the better.

JUNE 30, 1938
I arn opposcd to the Bill now before the
House. I do not agree witb this phase of
the commission's report. I do not think a
board to superintend our penitentiaries is
necessary fromn any point of view. I wondewbether, fromn this time on, we could run a~
lien-roost in this country witbout a commission. One would think, to listen to tho
words of the Minister of Justice, that it was
a ginnt's.job to exercise the powers and per..
form the duties of Superintendent of Penitentiaries. It is the job of an able man, I
know, and possibly lie needs an assistarnt;
but that it is a job for a commission 1 dr,
not know and do not believe.
Commissions are appropriate wliere the
duties are judicial, wliere the meeting of mind
with mind over controversial matters is
essentîal. It is not appropriate here. This
is a mere matter of administration. It is a
fairly large matter of administration, but it
is no more than that. To tell me that one
capable man cannot do the job is an affront.
The real test of the success of management
of penitentiaries is not the superintendent,
and never will lie. H1e is miles, in most
cases tliousands of miles, from the real
task. The real task is donc by the wardens
and deputy wardens and those under them

get the riglit warden and deputy warden, and
do not infliet tbema witli humbugs for guards,
you will get the best out of those men,' and
you will have a good penitentiary. Ali the
commissions between liere and the end of
Cliristendom will lie a failure if you have not
a good warden and deputy warden.
If the Minister thinks that by a commission
hie will convert and renovate the condition of
our penitentiary inmates into a sort of paradise, or even improve it by an iota, lie is
wrong. In fact, lie is likely to get the *very
opposite resuît. H1e is going to have now a
bureau instead of individual responsibility.
I do not know of any place wliere a commission is less appropriate than wliere it is
superimposed in lieu of a superintendent of
penitentiaries.
I do not pretend to know more than anybody else on thîs subjeet, but I do know
something. For about four or five years I
was in charge of parole and visited the penitentiaries frequently; and I have liad the more
reason to study the subi ect because one of my
brothers happened to lie a warden.
And I repeat that the way to get better penitentiaries is to get better wardens and better
deputies, and to see that tlie men tliey are
given Vo belp tliem are of the riglit type.
That is the wliole problem. There is nothing
else to it. An excellent man miglit not be a
good warden. The warden's task is about the

and bis record, deserves better. But I arn
afraid there are signs of unfairness. I regret
very mucli to say tliis, for I have a higli regard
for Judge Arcliambault.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Tlie Minister of
Justice lias said just about the same thing.
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I have to
admit that tliis is another reason wliy I
oppose tlie report. It is ail riglit to say the
Minister of Justice lias spoken kindly of General Ormond. H1e lias; lie could not have
spoken more kindly. But, f ollowing the dictates of a report which condemns the superintendent, the Minister abolishes General
Ormond's office, establishes a commission in
bis place and leaves him to bis fate. Tlie Minister says: "I am not discussing General
Ormond. I bave not a word to say against
him. I am not accepting the findings of the
commission against him." I tell him lie is
accepting the report of the commission, which
coudemons the work of the superintendent, lis
character and bis fltness. The Minister proposes to abolish the office and substitute a
commission, and then lie says, "I bave a higli
opinion of General Ormond." If so, why does
lie kick him downstairs?

lionourable friend allow me to answer?
Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Mdnister of

looked througli the reports from. the peniten..
tiaries as to convicts wlio were asking f or
tickets of leave. That lias been my sole
contact witli the penitentiaries. However,
the Minister of Justice says that from the
experience lie lias gathered lie feels that lie

will be unable properly to discharge bis
duties if he is refused the collaboration of
first-class administrators. The Minister stated
to the House of Commons that he felt it was
necessary to transfer responsibility for administration of the penitentiaries to a commission of thrce good and true men. It will
perhaps be difficult to find three men who
possess the requisite experience, character
and administrative capacity, but the Minister has hopes that he will be successful in
his quest. The Order in Council proclaiming
the effective date of the measure will not
be passed until the Minister is satisfied that
ie has three suitable commissioners.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: The Minister of Justice states the reason he wants to
abolish the superintendent's office is that he
himself cannot do the whole job of admîinistering justice without the assistance of
a commission. My knowledge of the Miniýter of Justice-and it ought to be a fairly
decpendaible knowlodge, for I sat opposite
him many years-and my appreciation of his
ability compel me to decline to accept that
\phination. I know he can manage his department perfectly well, no matter who is
Superintendent of Penitentiaries, and esspecially when the superintendent is a man
of whom be speaks so highly as ho does of
Goneral Ormondl. The Ministor can take
cire of the department all right; I am net
worried a bit about that. If be has wardens
who are unfit for their posts and not doing
their duty, let him got botter wardens. In
the wardens' posts is whore be needs better
men, not on a commission. If you have the
right wardon. the less you interfere with him
and the less you "commission" over him, the
better it will be. This Bill would not reduce
the Minister's responsibility one iota; be
would still be charged with the administration of our penitentiaries. He thinks be can
go out on the higbways and byways and get
three men to take this load off his back. He
will not; the load will remain there. The
oely way to improve the situation is to appoint better men to do the work that has to
be done; net to establish a bureaucratic commission. I refuse to accept the plea that the
Minister is net capable of performing his
task. There is no do-ubt that be is capable.
I do not want it to be understood that I
am placing the stamp of my uninformed approval, without reservation, upon General
Ormond as Superintendent of Penitentiaries.
I am not in a position to express an opinion
on the subject. Critical representations have
been made to me by persons in whom I have
nuch confidence, but I know General Ormond
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

as a man, and as one who has done thingsand that in a very important and perilous
period. I do not want to sec him treated unfa.irly. In view of the fact that -he could not
possibly have had adequate means of establishing his own side of the case, or presenting what he would like to present in answer
to allegations made against him, I cannot
accept a report in which he is slapped on
both sides of the face, kicked in the back,
thrown out on the street, and left with only
such rights as he may have in respect of a
pension.
It may be that men can be found for this
proposed commission. I do net know. I do
net think it makes a tremendous amount of
difference who they are, unless they are able
to select for the work to be done under
them botter men than have been selected in
the past. And, on the whole, I do net feel
disposed to complain, as some people do, of
the past selections. Taking them over the
whole range of Canada, I think they have
been pretty fair. With not a single one of
those men-and I ask that this sentence be
noted-had I the slightest thing in the
world to do. Nobody in that service, within
my knowledge, got bis advance on anything
except his own merits; every man stood on
his own feet and never needed any help from
me.
I am opposed to this measure. I do not
think it wvas necessary to bring it down in
these crowded and congested minutes at the
end of the session, and I am going to vote
against it.

Hon. GEORGE GORDON: Honourable
members, I wonder if any other civilized
country in the world ever created a commission which defamed officers of an institution
on the strength of evidence given by convicts.
I understand that this commission took evidence from more than 1,800 convicts. I could
understand that being done in sene country
like Russia, where persons are imprisoned for
political purposes, but to my mind the taking
of evidence from 1,800 prisoners in Canada
was ridiculous.
I have not read the whole of the report,
but I understand the commission went to
England and took further evidence there. I
should like to inquire of the honourable leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
whether convicts were examined in England,
and, if so, how many. I assume that if for
the discovery of facts it was found necessary
to
receive testimon.y from convicts in
Canada, the same procedure would be found

JUNE 30, 1938
necessary in England. Yet I am under the
impression that officials only were questioned
in England. Am I right or wrong in that?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would suggest to my honourable friend that during the
recess he do his duty as a member of Parliament, as I intend to do, and read that report.
As I have not read it yet, I cannot answer my
honourable friend. The Minister of Justice
stated that he was not prepared to discuss
the report, and therefore he did not ask members of the other House to pass judgment on
it. He said he had read it, and, though he
did not approve of all the conclusions, he
acquiesced in the recommendation that a
commission be appointed. He asked his
colleagues to suspend their judgment on the
report as a whole until next session, when
it will come before Parliament in some form
or other and be fully discussed.
The only part of the report which it is
now sought to implement is that recommending
the appointment of a commission to administer the penitentiaries. That is the single
objective of the Bill before us. If the Senate
decides that the measure is not opportune, it
will so state. We have here an opportunity
of transferring the administration of penitentiaries to a commission of three, it being
understood, of course, that a certain responsibility must always devolve upon the
Minister.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: After glancing over
the report I have come to the conclusion that
the commission took no evidence from prisoners in England. Considering the.source of the
evidence upon which the commissioners base
their findings, I must express my surprise and
regret that the Government has seen fit to
take action on this report. It seems to me
that the report is ridiculcus and not worthy
of consideration.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I can answer
my honourable friend's question by reading
from page 4 of the commission's report:
In addition to inspecting the prisons in the
London Metropolitan Area, your commissioners
examined other prisons and Borstal institutions
in different parts of England. Nineteen institutions were visited, and, at each, conferences
were held with the governors and members of
their staffs.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: That is exactly what
I said, that the commission examined, officers
only in England. If that procedure had been
followed here, the report would have been
different.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I have not read the report.

I do not know.

Hon. Mr. GORDON: The commission went
over to England for a joy ride and took
evidence of officers only. I have been in
Parliament since 1908 and never heard of
anything more ridiculous than this report. I
am surprised that the Minister of Justice,
whom I respect very much, would give any
consideration at all to the commissioners'
findings and recommendations. In my opinion
it is disgraceful to ask us to pass a Bill like
this in the dying hours of a session.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators. I know little about penitentiaries. I
have never been confined in one. But it seems
to me that as the honourable senator from
Nipissing (Hon. Mr. Gordon) has said he is
not fully informed as to the contents of the
report, it is necessary to place some extracts
from it on the record. My right honourable
friend the leader opposite (Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen) stated that what we are concerned
with here is a mere matter of administration. I do not think anyone can disagree
with that. It is a matter of the administration
of our penitentiaries, which are housing persons
convicted of having broken laws of the
country. Then my right honourable friend
suggested that better wardens should be got.
I do not know about that. I did hear a
member of the commission say that there
was one good warden. It happens that that
good warden's name is Meighen. He is at
New Westminster, British Columbia.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN:
argument?

What is the

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: My right honourable friend also stated that a commission of
three members would not improve matters,
and he expressed himself as being opposed to
any unfair treatment. I am first, last, now
and all the time in agreement with him on
that. But let us look at this report to see
if there has been any unfairness, having
regard to the rights of human beings, whether

they are for the time being incarcerated in
a Canadian penitentiary or running the
streets free like the rest of us. All of us,

I believe, want to sec fair treatment given.
I do not know the distinguished General
Ormond. I have never met him, nor had I
heard anything about him until I read some
of his own statements as recorded in this
document. I had never heard a single word
in disparagement of his ability, his character,

his courage, his intentions as a citizen of
CanadaHon. Mr. GORDON: And now you have
got only the word of convicts.

592

SENATE

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
That is not so.
If my honourable friend will possess bis soul
in patience for a few minutes I shall quote to
him some words of General Ormond himself.
Editorials have appeared recently in a number of our very fine newspapers deprecating
some things that the report bas said about
General Ormond. I thought there was something in that point of view until I came
across certain parts of this report. I presume
that what I find here is accurate.
It is
stated that General Ormond answered questions that were asked. So I think it is right
and proper for me to place on Hansard now
a few extracts from the Report of the Royal
Commission to investigate the Penal System
of Canada. At the bottom of page -3 J find
this, under the heading of "Staff":
Superintendent.
The office of Superintendent of Penitentiaries
has been held by General D. M. Ormond since
August 1. 1932. Prior to bis appointment, be
was District Officer Commanding Military District Number 13, performing the duties and
holding the rank of colonel, with the honorary
rank of brigadier-general. Fron February 3,
1920. to August 1, of the same year, he was
Superintendent commanding "A" Division of
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Prior to
that appointment lie had been on active service
with the overseas forces during the Great
War. He is a member of the Manitoba Bar,
to whiclh he was called in 1909.
When the Superintendent assumed office be
introduced into the penitentiary system a more
drastic policy of militaristie contro than badi
prevailed during the previous administrations.
I cannot find fault with that.
was necessary to do so.

Probably it

The character of this policy bas already been
dealt with.
The action taken to divest experienced wardens of authority, even in the

most trivial and inconsequential matters, and
to subject them to a minute direction in
detail, and the profusive issue from day to
day of new regulations and lengthy circulars,

explaining, countermanding, and amending pre-

penitentiary service were required ta enforce
a voluminous, and in many cases obscure, code
of rules governing their own conduct and the

conduct of the prisoners, without even having
had an opportunity ta read them. As bas been
pointed out, when one warden asked that the
enforcement of the new regulations be postponed, be was immediately threatened with dismissal.

In the interpretation of these regulations,
the Superintendent bas in many cases put an
unduly severe construction upon them, and, in

some

instances. he bas deliberately

violated

their terms, with consequent unwarranted hardship ta the prisoners.
In Kingston Penitentiary. a number of prisoners were placed, on the direction of the Superintenîlent, in what was called "segregation."
This did not amount ta mere isolation of the
prisoners front the rest of the population,
but iwas. in fact. although not so called. a form
of piinisbment. Many were not allowed normal
employnent, and were deprived of some of
the ordinary penitentiary privileges. We can
find no authority for this course in the penitentiary regulations, nor was the Superinten(lent able to justify it, ta our satisfaction, in

his evidence before the Commission. Many of
these prisoners were kept in what miglit almost
lie termed solitary confinement (although not
in punishment cells)-some
over two years.

of

Regulations 66 and 67, which provide for whîat

is called "Disassociation," are as follows:
"66. If at any time it appears to the Warden
that it is necessary or desirable for the main-

tenance of good order or discipline, or in the
interests of the convict, that he should not be
employed in association, the Warden may
arrange for him to work temporarily

in

a

cell

or other place, and not in association. The
Warden may take action but shall report any
such case to the Superintendent for approval
and direction.
67. It
shall be in the discretion of the
Warden to arrange for such dissociated convicts
ta be again employed in association when lie
considers it desirable, and lie sball in any case
so arrange at the expiration of one montht from
the commencement of the period of dissociated
employment, unless further authority is given
frain montb to month by the Superinteident."

The object of these regulations is ta remove

vious ones, soon threw the whole penitentiary
system into a state of confusion.
We regret
to find that it bas continued in the same
state ever since.
The Superintendent, who was without experience, bas since made no effort to call the
wardens into consultation or ta hold annual

may be agitators, or of an incorrigible type,
and a disturbing element to the maintenance
of discipline in the institution. We quite recognize the necessity of these regulations, but

The Superintendent contended

before

the

Commission that these regulations did not apply
to the prisoners in question, and maintained that
the object of these regulations was to permit
the wardens to give solitary confinement without
a trial. We do not agree that this is a correct
interpretation, and, if it is, we are of the
opinion that such drastic power ought not to
be in the bands of the wardens, because it is
contrary both to the spirit and the letter of
regulations otherw-ise dealt witi in this report.

JUNE 30, 1938
The Superintendent submitted to the Commission that the manner of dealing with these
prisoners was covered by the power vested in
the classification boards. The fact is that the
Superintendent did not leave the matter to the
classification boards, but overrode them and the
regulations in regard thereto by issuing orders
that certain prisoners should be placed in
"permanent segregation," and that others should
be "indefinitely segregated."
The matter was
taken out of the hands of the classification
boards, and they were given no opportunity to
review the cases of these prisoners, or to consider when they should be removed from the
so-called "segregation" and restored to the
ordinary penitentiary population.
The expressions contained in correspondence
affecting many of these prisoners indicate an
unduly vindictive attitude of mind. In one
letter, addressed to a warden, the Superintendent used the following language:
"Undoubtedly you will receive many complaints from these convicts wishing to know why
they should be placed in the east cell block. It
is not necessary for you to give them any
information.
If any information is given
nothing more is necessary than to say that that
is a part of the penitentiary in which it has
been decided to confine them."
In regard to these prisoners, the Superintendent was asked whether the classification
board should not meet regularly to consider
these men and determine whether or not they
should be kept in segregation. He agreed that
it should be done, but that it had not been
done to his knowledge. The direction to keep
prisoners in permanent segregation does not
indicate that he expected such a course to be
taken. The Superintendent did not, from the
year 1935 to September, 1937, visit the part of
Kingston Penitentiary where these prisoners
were confined. In our opinion, this shows a
callous attitude and a clear neglect of duty.
The regulations governing the trial and
punishment of prison offences were drawn up
by the Superintendent, and were the object of
a detailed brochure of instructions. Regulation
162 is as follows:
"162. A convict shall not be punished until
he has had an opportunity of hearing the
charge and evidence against him and of making
his defence."
Notwithstanding the explicit provision of these
regulations, we found it gravely violated, under
the direct authority of the Superintendent, in
a serions case involving corporal punishment
at Kingston Penitentiary.
The warden had tried one Price, a prisoner,
on a charge of "attempting to incite trouble,"
and had found him guilty of two other offences
mentioned in the regulations but not included
in the description of the offence in the charge.
He was sentenced to be flogged with 20 strokes
of the leather strap. The warden reported
the matter fully, as he was required to do, and
forwarded a copy of the evidence to the
Superintendent for confirmation of the sentence
before it was executed.
We have perused the evidence and, in our
opinion, it was not such as would have supported
a conviction in a court of appeal, even for the
offences of which, although he was not charged
with these offences, the prisoner was found
guilty. Notwithstanding this, the Superintendent, in a long letter to the warden, reviewed
the evidence in detail, the manner in which it
5195

had been given, and suggested the form of
answers the guards should have given. He
pointed out that the offences for which the
prisoner had been found guilty were not
covered by the charge. Notwithstanding this,
his letter states:
"A perusal of the evidence would appear to
indicate that Price was guilty of the following,
under Regulation 165,"
and sets out four separate offences. This was
followed by the following statement:
" Copy of the evidence is returned herewith,
and would appear to support the charges as
redrawn."
The letter concludes:
is considered that Price bas been
"It
sufficiently put on his trial under the charges
as now re-drawn, and that he is guilty of gross
misconduct requiring to be suppressed by
extraordinary means. Your award of:
(1) Twenty strokes of the leather strap,
ten (10) strokes to be administered immediately,
and ten (,10) strokes suspended, under the
provisions of Regulation 231; and
(2) Twenty-one (21) days No. 2 diet; is
approved.
It is presumed that this convict will be kept
segregated indefinitely."
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Could the honourable
gentleman not put the whole report on Hansard instead of reading it?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: No. I am just coming to the interesting part. I am going to read
the remainder of the extract.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Is it very long?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: It is not too long.
We have had considerable discussion about
General Ormond and what he did or did not
do. Let us see what he himself said. That
is what I am coming to now.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I would remind the
honourable gentleman that the question before
the House is whether we are to have the
penitentiaries administered by a commission
instead of by a superintendent. That is the
only thing we are discussing.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: As we are
anxious to dispose of this Bill one way or the
other, I hope my honourable friend will accept
the suggestion to put the remainder of the
report on Hansard as though it had been

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: If I have permission to put the remainder of the report on
Hansard, I am content. I wish to treat as read
the portion from page 47 to the end of page 51.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I think if honourable members will take the trouble to read
Hansard to-morrow they will find that Gen-

eral Ormond was convicted out of his own
mouth as being totally unfitted for the position
he occupies. In saying this I am making no
reflection on the gentleman personally. I have
never had the honour of meeting him, but I
understand he is a man of the highest
reputation.
When the Superintendent appeared before
your Commission, he was asked to explain the
course taken in this matter. The following
are relevant extracts from the evidence:
"Q. Now General, how do you expect the
wardens to carry out the instructions contained
in the brochures or lectures or anything else,
when the Superintendent convicts a man and
authorizes his punishment on charges upon
which he has never been tried?
A. I see your point in tha-t.
Q. lt is not a question of seeing the point.
Can you expect the wardens to deal with things
regularly in the face of that? What was your
justification for authorizing punishment for a
man on a charge he had never been tried on?
A. With that letter as it stands, obviously
your point of view is correct.
*

*

*

*

*

Q. Frankly,

I expected another answer than
that, General. Do you realize the seriousness
of this matter? Here is a man who is found
guilty on what I think might be termed an
indictment. You write a letter to the warden
telling him that that is not the way the man
should have been tried, and you find him guilty
on something else, on a more serious charge?
A. I agree.
Q. And then you agree with the judgment
that corporal punishment should he inflicted?
A. Yes, sir. The only expianation I have
to offer is that the words used in the paragraph which says what you say it says-I admit
the letter as it stands is wrong in every way."
Regulation 162 has the force of law. Your
Commissioners cannot come to any other conclusion than that this prisoner was illegally
flogged at the direction of the Superintendent,
whose duty it was to review the findings of
the warden but who had no legal right to
substitute the new charge and to pass a finding
on that charge without giving the prisoner
an opportunity to defend himself. It is an
elementary principle in the administration of
criminal justice, which lias prevailed in British
tountries for centuries, that no person shall be
found guilty or punished for an offence without being properly charged and convicted at a
trial where lie bas had an opportunity of hearing tie charge and presenting a defence.
The same prisoner involved in this incident
had previously complained to the Superintendent, on an occasion of his visit to Kingston
Penitentiary that he had been badly manhandled by a guard. Notes on file, made by
the Superintendent at the time, are:
"Case investigated. This man 'faker,' was
perhaps badly handled by guard-but not hurt.
D.M.O."
There is no suggestion that the guard was
ever reprimanded for badly manhandling the
prisoner, and the investigation apparently
closed without further consideration of the
matter.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

This is the same prisoner who was shot
during the disturbance in 1932. His case is
fully dealt with in Chapter VII of this report.
He is a young man who has several times
been convicted for crime and, for the purpose
of this report, may be assumed to he an
incorrigible offender, but, nevertheless, there
is no place in our administration of justice
for the treatment ho bas received at the hands
of the prison authorities. He was shot without legal justification, flogged illegally on
charges on which he had never been tried,
assaulted by a guard, and kept indefinitely
in segregation. All these matters came directly
to the attention of the Superintendent, and
he was directly responsible for the irregularity
of the flogging and indefinite segregation. He
failed to treat the other matters with the
justice appropriate to his important position.
ls the opinion of your Commissioners, it is
incumbent on those engaged in the administration of justice to see that its officers are
ever vigilant in obeying the law. No place
is this vigilance more necessary than in the
administration of a prison system. Prison
officials must necessarily be vested with great
authority, and this authority must always be
exercised with wisdom and restraint. Its unlawful use can never be tolerated. Prisoners
are as much entitled to the protection of the
law as any other members of society.
Our
system of administration of law depends on
public respect for those who administer it.
Wanton and unlawful acts by prison officials
toward prisoners are degrading, and bring the
law into disrepute. Tbey also tend to develop
violent and incorrigible prisoners.
The Superintendent bas been required by the

provisions of the Penitentiary Act to make an
annual report to the Minister of Justice.
"The Superintendent shall make an annual
report to the Minister on or before the first
day of September in each year, which shall
contain a full and accurate statement of the
state, condition and management of the penitentiaries under his control and supervision for the
preceding fiscal year, together with such suggestions for the improvement of the same as he
may deem necessary or expedient, accompanied
by such reports of the officers of the penitentiaries and financial and statistical statements
and tables as he deems useful or as the Minister
directs."
This report is printed, and laid before both
Houses of Parliament. It is circulated widely.
Your Commissioners regret to find that many of
these reports have been gravely misleading in
important matters affecting penitentiary management. Recent reports have been so drawn
as to indicate tlat prisoners are effectively
classified, tiat a complete system of training
of young offenders, comparable to the Borstal
system in England, is in effect in the penitentiaries, that the prisoners receive competent
vocational training, and thsat a comprehensive
system of education is in effect. The annual
report of 1935 states:
"During tie first month that a convict is in
a penitentiary, he is classified, lis educational
standing being one of the principal points
ascertained from the examination held and tests
applied."

The annual report of 1936 states:
"Tie Classification Board in each penitentiary bas been functioning satisfactorily.

JUNE 30, 1938
Following the policy advocated for many
yeans, the actual segregation of convicts under
twenty-one years of age was brought into
effect. This segregation included all "A" Class
convicts and "C
Class convicts under twentyone years of age."
The report of 1935 contains an elaborate
report of the Superintendent on his study of
the "Borstal System" of England, and a statement of the arrangements presently being put
into effect in regard to the treatment of young
offenders. The report states:
"The type and nature of treatment for young
convicts will follow as closely -as possible that
presently existing in the Borstal institution of
England."

In reference to the officers to be in charge of
young prisoners, the following statement is
made:
"Each supervisor will be called upon to have
an intimate knowledge of the history, character,
disposition and capabilities of approximately
thirty young convicts.
It will also be necessary for him to carry on
correspondence with their relatives and other
persons who may be in a position to give useful
information considered to oe essential in the
treatment to be applied to each individual."
In the report of March 31, 1936, the segregation
of the young prisoners is detailed, and the
following statement is made:
"This segregation has necessitated the detailing of specially selected officers to supervise the
young convicts, this being one of the reasons
for the retention of officers in excess of the
minimum authorized establishments."
In the report of 1937, the following statement
is made:
"The segregation of young convicts is now
accepted by the penitentiary staffs as an
ordinary and routine practice, the results of
which 'are reported to be beneficial."
As indicated in our report, such statements
as these are entirely misleading in form and
substance, and convey erroneous impressions to
the public in respect to the treatment of young
prisoners.
The report of 1935 contains the following
statement:
"Vocational training is carried on throughout
the whole year, and includes agriculture,
carpentry, metal-work, motor mechanics, plumbing, painting, plastering, and all kindred building trades, tailoring, shoemaking, laundry work,
cooking, catering, steam power plant management, water supply and sewage disposal. Vocational training is augmented by well equipped
libraries for extensive research work. advanced
and intensive studies."
In the opinion of your Commissioners, it was
unfair to the Minister and to the public, and
unjust to those who might be sentenced to
serve terms in the penitentiaries, that the
Superintendent should so describe the work
carried on in the shope of Canadian penitentiaries.
In the report of 1935 the Superintendent
states:
"Changes and expansions have been made
from time to time until to-day each penitentiary
bas a program which covers every subject
taught in the public schools, plus correspondence
courses. Extra-mural university courses have
been arranged in three penitentiaries . . . .
51958-38j

595

Students following correspondence and extramural university courses are guided and aided
in their studies outside of the hours that they
are employed in the shops or at other work."
In the report of 1937, under the heading of
individual penitentiaries it is stated that "the
school functioned in accordance with the regulations and instructions." A cursory inspection
of the institutions and a perusal of wardens'
reports show conclusively that this is not a
correct statement.
(See Chapter VIII for
details.)
In January, 1936, in the case of Rex vs.
Carter and Goodwin, the members of the Court
of Appeal of the Province of Alberta had some
doubts as to whether young prisoners in the
Saskatchewan Penitentiary were afforded an
opportunity of learning a trade, and, as a resuIt,
a telegram was sent to the warden, requesting
information as to whether these young men
would be enabled to learn a trade if they were
to be confined in that penitentiary. The warden
telegraphed to the Superintendent, quoting the
telegram from the Court of Appeal, and the
Superintendent wired directly to the Assistant
Deputy Attorney General of Alberta as follows:
"Re Appeal Court cases William Carter and
Harold Goodwin stop Convicts under twentyone years completely segregated in separate
corridor with separate exercise yard stop Youths
employed manual labour not less than six months
after which assigned to agriculture construction
building trade or shop depending upon capability
and conduct stop Institution not overcrowded."
On receipt of this telegram, the Court of Appeal
confirmed sentence of two years' imprisonment
in the penitentiary. Your Commissioners do
not believe that the above telegram correctly
answered the inquiry of the Court of Appeal.
It is quite apparent that, under conditions as
they are at the present time in the Saekatchewan Penitentiary, young prisoners are not
given an opportunity to learn any trade whatever. They have the opportunity of taking part
in any construction work that happens to be in
progress, but they are not assigned to shops and
the instruction they receive in particular trades
is practically negligible. Your Commissioners
consider that the telegran to the Assistant
Deputy Attorney General ie seriously misleading.
It has not been uncommon to read in the
press that judges and magistrates, in sending
young prisoners to penitentiary, have declared
that they are sending them "where they will
learn a trade."
The gravity of publishing
reports that mislead the public in this manner
requires no further comment.
The evidence of the Superintendent before
the Commission occupied eight days. He was
given every opportunity to go into all phases
of prison administration, and bas since supplied
the Commission with voluminous memoranda on
matters discussed during his evidence and concerning which he was of the opinion that
further information ought to be supplied. We
have had ample opportunity to discusa with
him the many matters drawn to our attention
affecting his administration of the penitentiaries,
and to consider his knowledge of penology, his
disciplinary methoda, his personality, and his
general fitness for the office he holds. His
evidence before your Commission was not
satisfactory.
It was characterized by long,
irrelevant, and often evasive answers to simple
questions.

596

SENATE

He has displayed an irritating manner of
exercising authority which, we are convinced,
lias been reflected, not only in the discipline
of the penitentiary staff, but in that of the
inmates, and, in our opinion, this was one of
the major contributing causes of the sixteen
riots or disturbancee which have taken place
since the Superintendent assumed office.
The Superintendent's particular part in the
unsatisfactory aspects of the administration of
the penitentiaries is referred to in detail
througliout this report. His record since lie
took office lias not been a success. He lias
displayed great diligence in exhaustive attention to a multitude of details, but lie lias, in
the opinion of your Commissioners, failed to
grasp fundamental principles so essential in the
performance of the important executive duties
connected with the office of Superintendent. He
has completely lost the confidence of the staffs
of all the penitentiaries and, without this, no
administration can succeed.
Your Commissioners are of the opinion that it is necessary
to the good management of the penitentiary
service that the Superintendent should immediately be retired, and they recommend accordingly.

Hon. Mr. CORDON: Will my honourable
friend answer the question I put to him?
When the commission went over to England
it examined certain officials of the British
penal institutions. Why did it not take the
evidence also of convicts? J may say to my
honourable friend that I have read that part
of the report in which the commission deals
with the evidence it obtained from the
convicts in our penitentiaries.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Then I do not
think my honourable friend can show that
the commission examined 1,800 convicts.
Obviously lie is mistaken. It would be foolish
for a Canadian commission to interview
In
convicts in the British penitentiaries.
>rder to find out anything about the handling
of convicts in those institutions it would
naturally seek information from the officials
over there.
Hon. Mr. CORDON: Why did it not do
that here?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: It did in every case,
as my honourable friend will find if lie reads
the record.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The question is
on second reading of Bill 175, an Act respecting Penitentiaries. Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?

Hon. Mr. McRAE:
There was no need
to rise. There was considerable dissent, and
we were waiting for His Honour's decision
when immediately we proceeded into Coinmittee of the Whole.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I suggest
that it will be quite satisfactory, after the
explanation of the honourable senator from
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae), to report the
Bill out of committee and proceed with the
motion for third reading. It is quite clear
he did intend to vote against the second

decides simply to report progress, then the

SENATE
CANADA'S RAILWAY PROýBLEM
REPORT 0F SPECIAL OOMMITTEE

Right Hon. GEORGE P. GRAýHAM presented the report of the special committee
appointed to inquire into and report upon
the best means of relieving the country from
its extremely serjous railway condition and
financial burden consequent thereto, and
moved concurrence in the report.
Hon, C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable senators, I think the report of this committee
should be accompanied by a few words of
explanation. Lt is a unanimous report-at
ail events, it is supposed to be-and for that
unanimity I arn sure a great many honourable
members of the committee are deeply thankfui. It would have been regrettable indeed if.
on a question of sucli importance, one wbich
bas attracted so much attention throughout
the country, the House had been divided,
particularly if the division had been on party
lines. Happily that bas been avoided.
The committee bas done excellent work.
Nobody, I think, will deny that. Lt worked
assiduously, and I think the resuit of its
labours wiIl be of great value to this House,
to Parliament and to the country. Certain
things have, 1 think, been proven beyond contradiction. For instance, when this subjeet
was introduced in this H-ouse there was some
controversy as to what the Canadian National wvas costing the country every year.
That cannot now be contested. The statistics
filed in the records of the committee show
co-nclusively that the country is losîng every
year between $95,000,000 and $100,000,000, haif
of this amount being interest on money inve.sted, and the other hiaif fresh mooey.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would suggest
to my honourable friend, our labours not being
terminated, that he sh-ould invade as little
as possible the confines of the record.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: 1 certainly did flot
intend to proceed very far in that way, but
1 wanted to show the usefuiness of what bas
been done. Perbaps my bonourable friend
will allow me to say that doubtless every
member of the committee is now eonvinced
that very large economies can be effected if
unification of administration is accomplisbed.
I think also-Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I earnestly protest
ag-ainst this.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

lunch at one o'clock, and I attended a funeral
at 2.30. 1 have been around expecting a
meeting of this committee, and-by whose
orders I do not know-the committee meeting wvas rushed along and I was not notified.
I arn not finding fault; 1 arn not objecting
to, what bas been decided upon; but when
my honourable friend who started this discussion (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) launches out
into a furtber discussion and argument as
to what is in my mind or in the mind of any
other honourable senat-or who was on the
committee, I do object. I think we should
adopt the report and let well enougli alone.
If there is going to be argument on this
matter I shaîl expect to be allowed to go
into it as fully as anyone.
Hon. Mr. McRAE:

Adopt the report.

Some Hon. SENATORS: Carried.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Lt is quite evident
that under these circumstances it wýill be very
difficult for me to convey certain general information that I was going to give, and to
make a point I had intended to make. I arn
sorry that we could not convince the committec, or perhaps the GovernmentHon. Mr. DANDURAND: I draw the attention of my honourable friend to the fact that
lie bas signed the report to the SenatelIon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Tbat is true.
Hon. Mr.
chairman-

DANDURAND:

-as

joint

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: That is true.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: -and that it
xvas unanimously adopted, on the assomaption
that the honourable senator fromn Parkdale
(Hon. Mr. Murdock) would accept it as submitted. That being so, the report contains al
that we intended to bring to the Senate. If
we are to enter into a discussion of what
niight have been contained in the report, but
is not, w'e may be undertaking a very delicate
task. and I woîîld suggest that my honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) forego, any further criticism.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Could I do this
without toucbing the report? Could I ask My
bonotirable friend the leader of the Governmuent (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), outside of the
report entircly. to try to prevail upon the
Gox ernmentHon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, no. I will
not allow my honourable friend to charge me
with anv mandate. The mandate is in the
report.

JUNE 30, 1938
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: My honourable friend is not riglit. The report was
agreed to by everybody, but my honourable
friend the joint chairman (Hon. Mr. Beaubien), in my hearing and in the hearing of
others, stated that he roserved the right to
say what he is proposing to say now, and I
repeated it to the honourable member who
was rigbt beside me-I forget who it wss.
This is not at aIl in confliet with the report.
We could have made a minority report, or
whatever else you might call it, because what
was suggested involves an expenditure which
the Govornmont did flot feel like making. It
is only right, therefore, that the honourable
gentleman (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) should have
the privilege of stating to the Houso something which is not a dissent from the report
at ail. We shall be absolutely loyal to the
report. Thus we shall ho acti.ng consistently
with it in every way. In face of the statement
of the honourable leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) we could not recommend in our report that this work be done;
and 1 said so at the meeting of the committee.
But we have a right to say to the House that
we should like the Government to take upon
itself the responsibility of having the work
done. It could not be done unless the Government assumed that responsibility. I think
that is ail that my honourable friend (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien) wished to say.
Hon. Mr. BEAIJBIEN: That is ail.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We ought not
to discuss the merits of any possible solution
of the problem, and the interruption by the
leader of the Government for the purpose of
intimating that was quite proper. We have
agreed to a report, and we are standing by it.
But we felt-I will express it, if my honourable friend from Montaiville wishes me tothat we were not competent to weigh the
conflicting evidence presented by two sets of
witnesses. As honourable members know, the
two railways unfortunately expressed opposing
'views. We thought, therefore, that the Government should employ a firm. of engineers
and accountants to analyse the facts gathered
by our committee and report what they think
could ho done; and if they conclude that
certain savings are possible we should like
themn to specify how these would ho arrived
at, just what reductions in service would he
necessary, if any, and so on. We could flot
go any further, because the matter is entirely
one for the Government. I do not suggest
that the cost of such work would ho trivial;
on the contrary, I admit it would likely ho
considerable.

599

In any event, the committee could flot have
made any other report than it did make.
After ail the time and work spent on our
study of the problem, it would have been folly
to attempt to deal with any merits in the
case unless we could deal with them in an
adequate, complete and illuminating manner
for the advantage of the country in particular
and of the Government too, in some measure;
and this we were unable to do. There was rio
alternative to putting further study over
until next session. But it seemed to us. that
in the interimn an authoritative finding might
be made as to just what savings, if any, are
possible. and through what means they are
possible.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask my
right honourable friend whom be means by
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGIIEN: I refer only
to, the honourable senator from Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) and myseif, though
possibly I have represented the views of others
too.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The question in
my mind was whether other memabers of the
committee would concur in those views.
Anyone
Rîght Hon. Mr. METOHEN:
can express what he wishes.
Hun. Mr. MURDOCK: But surely he
cannot express his thoughts a the apparent
viewpoint of the committee.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGEEN: No.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I did not do that.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: We could
flot recommend to the Senate that a firmn of
accountants and engineers be employed. because the Sonate cannot authorize expenditurcs, but we did desire to ask the leader of
the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) if he would
requcst the Government to take the responsibility of having a complete analysis made
of the facts gathered by our committee.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: May I ho permittedHon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I have just a
few words to add.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Shall I have permission to follow with a few remarks?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The right honourable leader on this side of the House
(Right Hon. Mr. Meighon) bas expressed
my view, and very much botter than I could
bave donc myself. I want to add just a few
words. We bave gathered a lot of evidence
and have recommended that the committee'î

600

SENATE

work should be resumed next session. My
purpose was to seek some means of having all
the facts that we gathered weighed by specialists during the recess, and a report made by
them to us as to the value of various parts of
the evidence. The committee has not the
special knowledge to enable it to weigh the
evidence as it should be weighed. If my
prayer to the Government were answered the
cornmittee's task would be enormously helped
next session.
HIon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable members-Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Would my
honourable friend allow me? I desire to say
that we cannot be certain as to what decision
may be made by the committee next session,
if it is reappointed.
Right Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: Quite righit.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The committee may decide that certain parts of the
evidence should be tested by outside engineers and accountants. But in that event
the committee would have o lay down some
general lines along which the specialists should
work. It is expected tîat Parliament will
prorogue before midnigit.
This railway
miatter i. so involved that I have serious
douts as ta he possibility of our framing,
in the short time now at our disposal. a
basis upon wiich examination by experts
should proceed. Besides, though the committee took considerablie evidence, it may be
found necesary to supplement this next
session. These are reasons why I feel we
should abstain from suggesting to the Government ai this stage the appointment of
outside engineers and accountants to continue
the work started bv our committce-for that
is what tho suggestion would mean. I think
it is necessary that we should pursue our
study of the railway problem next session,
in order to do justice to ourselves and the
Senate as a whole. and I hope the committee
will be reappointed.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK:
Again I express sincere regret that I was not informed
of the last meeting of this special committee, although it is fair to say I knew that
a meeting would be hurriedly called. I was
not present. In view of what has been said.
I think it is only fair to place on record
what it is we are talking about now. When
this investigation started we heard from our
honourable friend from Montarville (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien)Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

tion now; that he will limit himself to what
we have been discussing.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I will try to do
that. We heard that unification was inevitable. And the first witness who came before
the committee undertook to prove that it
was inevitableHon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
I appeal ta His
Honour the Speaker. Ail honourable members of this House must be treated alike.
My honourable friend was kind enough to
call me to order. and since I was consequently
prevented froni discussing evidence brought
before the committee. I hope he will be
good enough to abide by the same ruling.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
I will do that.
My honourable friend las made the suggestion that we recommend to the Government that during the recoss a company of
experts be employed to inquire into the
whole situation.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:

No.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Whence emanated
that proposal?
Right ion. Mr. MEIGHEN:

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:

That is what my

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: No.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I think the record
will show that my honourable friend suggested
we should ask the Government to employ a
firm of accountants and engineers to inquire
into and make an analysis of the situation
of both railways. Is that fair?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Will my honourable
friend allow me? The suggestion first came
from Sir Edward BeattyHon. Mr. MURDOCK: That is what I was
going to say, and I am glad you said it.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Here was the situation facing us. We had two sets of evidence;
and there was a conflict between them.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That is all I was
trying to say. The suggestion came as an
afterthought from Sir Edward Beatty the
last time he was before the committee. I
wanted the record to show where that suggestion came from.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I cannot speak of
the record, but I can speak of what is in my
own mind, and that is why I made that
suggestion and requested the Government to
act upon it.

JTJNE 30, 1938
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I quite realize the
situation as it is seen by the honourable
leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand). When Sir Edward Beatty firet made
the suggestion that has been referred to, the
honourable gentleman from Moncton (Hon.
Mr. 'Robinson) followed it up a bit, and it
seemed to me that the idea was a good one.
The committee had got to the point where it
had two sets of evidence that did not agree,
and the suggestion was that a flrmn of engineers and accountants should be appointed
for the sole purpose of deducing some substantial facts out of that evidence. I quite
understand that it would neyer do for the
Government to appoint a commission to continue during the recess the task our committee had undertaken, because if that were
done it would mean the expenditure of an
enormous sum of money, and the job would
neyer be ended. But I do urge that if our
committee is reappointed next session it
should meet early. review the situation and
determine exactly the points upon which it
wants to get facts, if necessary appointing
engineers and accountants to help in that
work.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: H1onourable senators, I
amn sure that an analysis of the evidence given
before the Senate committee would be very
helpful, not only to this Chamber, but to the
people throughout the country, who are very
much interested. The circulation of the
record of proceedings of our committee hs
been fairly general. I risc to suggest to the
honourable leader of the House (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) that after prorogation our Senate
staff should prepare a cross-index of the
evidence, as a ready reference to the various
subjects dealt with, and that a copy he sent
to ahl of us and every other person who has
received a copy of the proceedings.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. COPP: To whom would that
index be sent?
Hon. Mr. McRAE: To every member of
the Senate and everyone else who has received a copy of the proceedings.
Hon. Mr. CON': Does the honourable gentleman mean to members of the committee
only or to ail members of the Senate?
Hon. Mr. McRAE: To all members of the
Senate.
The motion for adoption of the committee's
report was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

SENATE
BUSINESS

0F THE SENATE

Hon. RAOUL DANDURAND: As honourable senators will have noted, we may expeet
the visit of lis Honour the Deputy Governor
at one o'clock. This would imply that during
the interim between now and then the Supply
Bill will reach us. So perhaps we should now
adjourn during pleasure, to, be recalled by
the sound of the bell as soon as the Supply
Bill is in the hands of our Clerk..
But before we adjourn I should like to mention an incident which occurred last evening
when the Penitentiary Bill was before us for
second reading. I do so because somo of my
honourable colleagues may think I was somewhat hasty in asking that the Bill ho referred
to Committee of the Whole.
When the
motion was put, I was of course aware of the
stand taken by my right honourable friend
(Righit Hon. Mr. Meighen), but a senator
who sits not far from him had told me that
no vote would bo called. To my remark that
the right honourable gentleman had clearly
intimatod what his stand would bo, the reply
had beon, "Yes, hie has expressod lis views,
but I do flot believe a vote will ho called."
So, with that information, 1 xvas haslening
the proceedings in order that wo might dispose
of the Bill, which was quite a voluminous one
to go through clause by clause.
Probably
My informant had not attended caucus and
did not know the opinion of bis colleagues.
An Hon. SENATOR:

Order.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I may say that
I have reproached somne honourable senators
who sit oijposiitc witli the fact, that they had
not cahled me to caucus. I desire now to
give this pledge, that I intend, whenever I
cahi the liheral-minded senators to caucus,
to invite the old Liberal-Conservatives, as
they have hieretofore bcen named. I may
draw a linc hetwveen the Liberal-Conserx atives
and the Tories. and I would ask my honourable friend the junior member from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. Haig) to give me the names of
the Tories.

Right Hon. ARTHUR. MEIGHEN: Honour-able members, I want it understood that
I badl no complaint to make yestorday of
the conduct of the honourable leader of the
Govcrnment.

honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. MI-lae), who wvas of the opinion that

the SPEAKER.

Riglit Hon. Mr. MEIGHEN: I think ho
misuniderstood what took place. I could seo
no irregularity in it.
While on my foot I want to make it very
plain, though, that 1 had not made up my
mind to exorcise any authority I may possess,
which is very little, to put the Penitentiary
Bihl to a vote. I just wanted to state my
position. When the leader of the Govornment
says there was misinformation as to the
decision of a caucus of this side of the Huse
on this subi oct, ho is running down a blind
trail.
I can assure him wve nover had a
caucus on the subject. The subject was nover
mentioned.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
hear that.

I am glad to

Ilight Hon. Mr. MEICiHEN: We do flot
bother much about caucuses. I fancy tho
ruhe is about this, that a caucus is called
only when it becomes apparent that honourable gentlcmen around me are not able to
understand what I am doing. That may occur
more froqucntly than thcy acknowledge.
I will give my honourablo friend a furthor
confidence: we met only once this session,
and the only subject discussed Ivas the Transport Bill of the Government, which has been
passed.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

SPEECH FROM

THE THRONE

After which the Honourable the Deputy of
the Governor General was pleased to close
the Third Session of the Eighteenth Parliament
of the Dominion of Canada with the following
speech:
Honourable Menbers of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
In bringing the present session to a close,
I desire to express my appreciation of the
careful attention given the many measures
submitted for your consideration.
International relations and domestic conditions continue to be affected by conflict, disorders and tensions in different parts of the
world. The disturbed situation abroad, and
prolonged and unprecedented drought in Western Canada, have, unfortunately, somewhat
retarded recovery. Improvement in economie
conditions has, however, been more steadily
maintained in Canada than in many other
countries. Gratifying factors in the situation

604

SENATE

are the further diminution in the numbers
on relief, and the progressive and substantial
reductions in the deficits in the national
accounts.
The outlook for agriculture in the
West is more hopeful than it has been for
some years.
An outstanding feature of the session has
been the adoption of measures constituting
a long-range nation-wide programme of conservation and development, designed te stimulate employment and enlarge the national
income. They include a comprebensive housing
scheme, under which special assistance will be
afforded in the construction of bouses to be
owned by families of limited means, and of
bousing accommodation in urban centres to be
leased at less than economic rentals.
The Dominion has undertaken to pay a
substantial proportion of municipal real estate
taxes, over a three-year period, on new bouses
erected before the end of 1940, and to make
loans, at low interest rates, to municipalities
to enable them to undertake projects of a selfliquidating character.
The housing programme has been further
aided, and increased activity in the construction
ndustry fostered by the exemption from sales
tax of materials entering into the construction
of bouses and other buildings.
Under the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act,
further progress lias been made in the development and conservation of water supplies, and
the formation of conmunity pasture areas
where lands are net suitable for cultivation.
Appropriations have been made for the continuation, on a broauder scale, of the youth
trainng prograniie. and for its extension to
i'melde
mrsons of older age.
Provision !is been made for the complete
nationalization of the Bank of Canada througli
the

acquisition

by

the

Government

of

the

ownership, in its entirety, of the capital stock
of the bank.
The Board of Railway Commissioners for
Canada lias been superseded by a Board of
Transport Commissioners, w ith authority in

respect of transport by air and water, as well
as by rail.
The trans-Canada air service is now operating a regular air mail schedule over a considerable area of the Dominion. It is expected
that, at an early date, a coast to coast service
will be in operation.
The provisions of the Criminal Code relating
to the improper driving of motor vebicles have
been made more stringent.
Other important
amendments have been adopted.
The War Veterans' Allowance Act bas been
amended to provide for veterans who, although
not totally incapacitated, are incapable of
maintaining themselves, and for those who
served in South Africa and were domiciled
in Canada at the time of their enlistment.
The registration of shop cards has been
authorized, a moasure which has been advocated for many years by labour unions in
Canada.
The Special Committee of the House of
Commons on Elections and Franchise Acts
has given careful study to the means employed
to effect redistribution in Canada and other
countries, and to proposals with respect to
political
expenditures.
A
new
Dominion
Elections Act bas been enacted.
Conisiderable progress bas been made in the
negotiations whicb, for several months past,
have been carried on with the Government of
tlie United States, with a view to revising and
exteniig the trade agreement concluded in
1935. It is hoped the negotiations will result
in a comprehensive
agreement, which will
facilitate the further development of trade
between the two countries.
'Members of the House of Commons:
I thank you for the provision yen have
made for the public service.
Hoenourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the flouse of Commons:
In taking leave of you at this time, I pray
that the blessing of Divine Providence may
rest ipon your labours.
