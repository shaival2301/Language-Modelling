Madam,
I have the honour to inform you that His Excellency
the Governor General will arrive at the Main
Entrance of the Parlianient Buildings at 10.40 a.m. on
this day, Wednesday, the 27th of February 1974, and
when it has been signified that ail is in readiness, will

of Canada.
I have the honour to be,
Madani,
Your obedient servant,
Esmond Butler
Secretary to the Governor General
The Honourable
The Speaker of the Senate,
Ottawa.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
At il a.m. His Excellency the Governor General proceeded to the Senate Chamber and took his seat upon the
Throne. His Excellency was pleased to command the
attendance of the House of Commons, and, that House
being come, with their Speaker, His Excellency was
pleased to open the Second Session of the Twenty-ninth
Parliament of Canada with the following speech:

27601-1

Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
I have the honour to welcome you to the Second Session
of the 29th Parliament of Canada.
In addressing you for the first time, I should like to
express my feeling of honour at having heen chosen Her
Majesty's representative in Canada. As I said at the tume
of my investiture, the office which I have the honour to
hold has a continuous history of three and a haif centuries.
I am anticipating with pleasure the opportunity to travel
in Canada and to meet citizens from ail walks of if e.
We look forward to the visit of Queen Elizabeth, The
Queen Mother, for whom ail Canadians have a great affection. She will be in Canada from June 25th to June 3Oth to
present new colours to the Toronto Scottish and to the
Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada; Her
Majesty is Colonel-in-Chief of both regiments.
I speak to you at a tume of serious disturbance in the
international economic situation, arising from problenis of
supply and price of certain commodities, particularly oil.
Most countries, developed and developing, witnessed
significant economic expansion in 1973. The economic
prospects for 1974 seemed, until recently, no less encouraging. The reduction of the amount of oul exported by some
of the major producing countries and the increase in price
has brought a sudden and dramatic change in this
situation.
For the developing countries of the world, the increased
cost of ail has in many cases wiped out the small margins
on which they depended for economic development and
better means to support their growing populations. For the
industrialized countries, of which Canada is oxýe of the
few close to being self-reliant in oul and energy generally,
it means that many of them will incur large balance of
payments deficits and will have to find means of financing
them. For the world as a whole, it could mean an overaîl
reduction in demand with a consequent depressing effeet
on economic activity.
The Government attaches the highest importance to
solving these problems through concerted international
action and co-ordination of national policies. The meeting
of the major oul importing countries was a first step in this
direction. It will be followed by meetings with the oul-producing states and the developing countries. The United
Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World
Bank and other international organizations will also
become actively involved.
In working towards a solution of these international
economic probienis the major consuming countries must
recognize the legitimate aspirations of ail the producing
countries to utilize their resources to assist in their own
national economic development. But the developed world,
as well as the resource-rich countries of the deveioping
world, must also take increasingly vigorous steps to

SENATE DEBATES
reduce disparities between themselves and the less developed and less fortunate nations.
While the developments affecting the supply and price
of oil are in part the product of special circumstances, the
underlying situation thus set in relief is much more general. Food prices have risen sharply as a result of the growth
of world population on which bas been superimposed
serious crop failures in a number of countries. The prices
of other internationally-traded commodities have also
increased following the simultaneous upsurge in economic
activity in all industrialized countries. The increases in
the food and commodity sectors have moreover led to
increases in other prices producing generalized inflationary pressures.
No country has been immune from the increase in prices
experienced in 1973 and which is continuing in 1974. The
phenomenon is world-wide, not an isolated one affecting
this or that country alone.
All countries, including Canada, have rejected a deliberately planned slow down in economic activity as a means
to fight inflation. Some have turned to income and price
controls. These attempts have on the whole not been
successful.
The Canadian economy, perhaps more than any other, is
closely tied to international trade and markets. The principal inflationary pressures have come from outside the
country. It would have been singularly inappropriate
under such conditions to have resorted to general income
and price controls and the Government rejected them for
these reasons.
A principal responsibility of the Government and one of
its main policy objectives is to maintain high levels of
income, production and employment. This policy should in
itself help to overcome some of the supply problems which
are causing prices to rise. But in addition, and more
immediately, the Government's policy in dealing with
inflation will be to step in, as it has done in the past, and
take specific measures to increase the supply of certain
goods and services, to protect those who are not able to
protect themselves against the effects of inflation, to cushion consumers against sudden and disruptive price
increases of essential commodities, and to prevent any
group or groups from taking undue advantage of the
current situation at the expense of others.
In the case of oil, the Government has been concerned
about the individual hardships caused by the rise in prices
and about the overall effect of the increase on the economy. Nonetheless, for Canada to become self-reliant and be
protected against abrupt changes in supply, prices must be
such as to encourage the exploration and development of
non-conventional and frontier oil resources. The Government must ensure that a sufficient part of the funds
generated by higher prices will be used for such exploration and development. It will introduce legislation to
create a national petroleum company which will assure
greater Canadian presence and participation in these and
other activities. It has announced the extension of the
pipeline from the Western oil fields to Eastern Canada
and the establishment of a single Canadian market which
will guarantee an outlet for domestically-produced oil.

February 27, 1974

In furthering these longer-term objectives, the Government bas a duty to manage the economy in the interests of
all Canadians, and in particular to moderate the inflationary effects resulting from the oil crisis. It has sought, in
co-operation with the provinces, to make sure that the
difficult transition to higher oil and energy costs occurs in
an orderly way so as to not cause unnecessary disruptions
in economic activity, employment and prices. To this end,
it must ensure that the price of domestically-produced oil
does not increase at an unreasonable rate and that the
price of oil be the same in all parts of Canada subject, of
course, to transportation costs. Legislation will be introduced to ensure that the responsibilities of the Government in these respects can be effectively discharged.
Discussion with the provinces on the Government's
objectives and on the best means of achieving them is
continuing. The Government will make every effort to
reach agreement on arrangements that will discharge its
responsibilities in a way that is fair to the provinces
where the main sources of the oil and gas are located as
well as to consumers in the country as a whole.
At the same time as there is increasing concern about
shortages in the supply of energy, it is apparent there is an
inadequate supply of food in many parts of the world. In
some countries the situation has reached critical proportions. In Canada there have not been such serious shortages but international market pressures have forced our
food prices upwards. It is clear that this country's production must be increased. The Government is developing a
policy on food based on the following objectives:
-an adequate and dependable supply of quality food for
a growing population in Canada enjoying a rising standard of living;
-reasonable food prices:
-for the consumer, in not requiring an undue proportion of income for Canadians to secure a sufficient and
balanced diet,
for the producer, in providing a return adequate to
encourage production of food items which can be
economically and efficiently produced in Canada;
continuing supply and increasing production of
-a
those food products in which Canada has a competitive
advantage for export to commercial markets and also for a
contribution to international food aid programs.
The Government's objectives will guide a re-assessment
of existing programs in the areas of agriculture and fisheries. The Government will wish to consult with provincial
governments, consumer groups and producers.
The producer must be ensured a fair income for his
work. His confidence in long-term market opportunities is
an essential element in the Government's policy. The producer should have access to all markets in Canada. He will
also be encouraged to expand food exports.
The consumer must be ensured a fair value from his
dollar. He must be protected against disruptive increases
in the price of essential foodstuffs caused by international
market demand. Guarantees against unduly low prices to
producers must be coupled with guarantees against
unduly high prices to consumers.

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

In the long term the continuity of domestic supply must
take into account optimum overall land use in Canada and
especially the trend to diversion of productive land for
non-agricultural purposes. The Government intends to
enter into discussions with the provinces since they are
vitally involved in this question.
As positive steps in the achievement of adequate supplies of food at a reasonable cost, measures directed in the
main at increasing food production will be laid before you
in the following areas:
-guaranteed loans and other forms of assistance to both
farmers and fishermen to assist them in purchasing or
modernizing their equipment;
-amendments to the Export and Import Permits Act to
provide the Government with better means to stabilize the
Canadian market;
-improving
the availability of manpower for food
production;
-assistance
in the construction of new storage
facilities;
-research to make it possible to increase production,
improve quality, and lower costs;
-improvements in harbour facilities for fishing fleets;
-incentives to increase Canada's catch of unexploited
stocks of fish;
-advance
payments on crops to assure producers of
timely cash receipts;
-an agricultural stabilization plan to encourage rational production decisions;
-assistance
to young farmers to provide sufficient
financial incentives for them to establish themselves in
farming;
-better veterinary training facilities;
-a prairie grain market insurance plan;
-improvements
in Canadian grain rail transportation
capabilities;
-increased
availability of reasonably priced feed
grains;
-incentives
to increase the production of livestock
necessary to provide for Canadian and export markets.
As part of the Government's economic management, a
major element in the policy to mitigate inflation is to
increase production and supply: many measures have been
indicated with respect to energy and food. Of course,
Canadians must strengthen their economy in other ways
to expand employment opportunities and achieve a greater
degree of control over their economic affairs.
Measures will be proposed to aid small businesses, both
finarcially and by providing better counselling services
by the creation of a Federal Business Development Bank.
Steps will be taken to ensure further processing of
resources in Canada. The Government will encourage the
development of the petrochemical industry based on the
upgrading of Canadian resources and better access to
world markets. Amendments will be proposed to the Bank
Act in order to permit provinces to participate in the
ownership of banks. An amendment to the Export Development Act will be introduced to encourage further
expansion of Canada's foreign trade. Proposals will be

27601-11

made to ensure Canadian control of the computer communications field. Amendments to the Combines Investigation Act, directed at encouraging competition, will be
put before you.
The development and use of technology is also essential
to the Government's approach to increasing national economic production. Steps will be taken to obtain greater
returns from industrial research and development as well
as technological innovation in Canada.
Scientific knowledge and its application is a keystone to
meeting the challenges facing Canada, including those in
the areas of food, energy or industrial development. The
objective of the Government's science policy is the rational generation and acquisition of scientific knowledge and
the planned use of science and technology in support of
national goals. The Ministry of State for Science and
Technology will be developing national science objectives
as a basis for exercising enhanced advisory and coordinating authority within the Government. Two new
granting councils will be formed, one for social sciences
and humanities and the other for natural sciences.
The Government attaches great importance to regional
development. Many of the measures to be introduced
during this Session were discussed at the Western Economic Opportunities Conférence, and will be of benefit to
all areas of Canada. Transportation in particular is a key
factor in regional development. A number of measures will
be taken in the larger context of ensuring that Canada's
transportation capability supports the Government's
national goals and is safe and efficient. Steps will be taken
to end any discrimination in freight rates. A new ports
policy will be developed to ensure an effective and comprehensive port structure in Canada in a framework
where a high degree of local involvement in management
and improvement of ports can be established.
Other measures will be taken to increase production and
employment through providing workers with improved
access to available jobs, and employers with improved
access to Canada's manpower. These steps will relate
employment policy, immigration policy and the activities
of the Unemployment Insurance Commission. The Government will be working together with the provinces in
developing a community employment policy in a social
security context for those Canadians who have particular
and continuing difficulty in getting and keeping employment. Amendments will be introduced to the Unemployment Insurance Act as a part of a comprehensive review of
the plan undertaken in the light of the experience of the
last few years.
In the domain of social policy the Government is playing a vital role to achieve a more balanced pattern of
urban growth and to increase the quality of life in our
cities in co-operýtion with the provinces and municipalities. Improved rrieans of public transportation are indispensable to the achievement of these urban goals. Measures will be introduced to establish a National Urban
Transportation Development Corporation to co-ordinate
and market the development of required new technology
in this field. Yu' will be asked to consider measures to
assist provinces and cities in the relocation of railway
lines and terminals and in the redevelopment of these

February 27, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

areas for purposes that will enhance the environment of
many of our cities and towns.
Provision of adequate shelter at reasonable prices in a
satisfactory neighbourhood environment has been a continuing concern of the Government, and levels of funding
to meet this objective are being reviewed. Substantial
assistance to rural and native housing programs will also
be proposed. The sewage assistance program will be
revised to make it more effective as a means to increase
the supply of serviced land. The Government will
introduce measures to increase the protection available to
consumers in the housing market.
The Government has taken many measures to improve
the status of women in Canada since the Report of the
Royal Commission on the Status of Women. Amendments
to the statutes of Canada will be placed before you for the
purpose of providing equal treatment for women. The
legislation to be introduced creating a Federal Commission on Human Rights and Interests will include provisions to protect women from discriminatory practices.
Regulations governing government employees will be
amended to remove all possible inequities based on sex.
Crown corporations will be asked to undertake positive
action to encourage the assignment and advancement of
more women into responsible positions within their
administration. The Government's objective is to create a
society free from discrimination.
The federal and provincial governments have agreed
that the Canada and Quebec Pension Plans should be
further amended to provide for increases, beyond 1975, in
the levels of income upon which contributions may be
made, and in the pensions which will be paid. Legislation
will be introduced to remove the earnings test now
required for people aged 65 to 69 from the Canada Pension
Plan. Finally, federal and provincial ministers have agreed
that the provisions which now accord differential treatment to men and women under the Canada and Quebec
Pension Plans should be removed.
You will be asked to consider other legislative proposals.

TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS
REQUEST OF STATE COUNCIL FOR CLOSER ASSOCIATION
WITH CANADA-NOTICE OF INQUIRY

Hon. Hazen Argue: Honourable senators, I give notice
that on Thursday next, March 7, 1974, I will cail the
attention of the Senate to the resolution passed unanimously on March 15, 1973, by the State Council of the
Turks and Caicos Islands, which reads as follows:
"BE IT RESOLVED AND MADE KNOWN THAT:

The State Council of the Turks and Caicos Islands
desires to thank formally the Canadian People and
their Government for the considerable help and
advice received by these Islands from them in recent
years.
This State Council, recognising the urgent need for
both long and short term solutions to our present
constitutional, financial and economic problems, further resolves that it would welcome additional professional and technical advice from both governmental
and non-governmental organisations so that we may
benefit from your long and loyal membership of the
British Commonwealth.

February 28, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

In particular, this State Council would welcome far
greater official contact between our two governments
and herewith cordially invite a Canadian Parliamentary Delegation to visit these Islands and advise us
during these days of decision."
And to the fact that, from time to time, both before
and after the passage of this Resolution, there have
been discussions between a number of Senators, Members of the House of Commons and representatives of
the State Council of the Turks and Caicos Islands, and
that members of that Council have expressed the
f ollowing:
Honourable senators, I have quite a lengthy statement
of the request that has been formally put forward by this
Council. If it meets the convenience of the Senate, honourable senators may wish to take it as read.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, before I agree to
that procedure I will register an objection. I do not believe
this to be the form which a Notice of Inquiry should take.
I have no objection for the time being, but in my opinion
by using such a device as that of Senator Argue anyone
could make a speech at this time, which would be entirely
out of order.
Hon. Mr. Argue: If the Senate is agreed and without
making any comment on the statement of the honourable
Senator Flynn, I would like to have the balance of this
taken as read.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.

(The statement follows.)
"(a) The need for a new Constitution caused by the
independence of the Bahamas and the desire for greater internal self-government.
(b) The need to establish a new relationship with
Britain and the Commonwealth now that Britain has
entered the European Community.
(c) The need to work out a practical relationship with
the United States Government over such matters as
immigration, bases agreement, use of Grand Turk airstrip and currency restrictions.
(d) The need for a long-term (30-year) plan for the
economic development of these Islands so that the
short "Three Year Plans" can fit into a meaningful
pattern and so that they can establish a sensible order
of priorities.
(e) The need to find many more job opportunities for
the rapidly increasing work force which is leaving
school or returning from the Bahamas-and who are
finding it very difficult to migrate or to find suitable
jobs at home.
(f) The need for the Islands to develop new and
reliable markets and industries to supplement the
present dangerous dependence on fishing and ephemeral tourism.
(g) the need to find additional sources of finance,
capital funding and expertise so that the basic infrastructural requirements can be met more quickly and
more efficiently than at present."

And that members of the Council have stated that by
becoming closely associated with Canada the Islands
would obtain the following advantages:
"(1) much greater internal self government at a "Provincial" or "Territorial" level, but within the framework of Canadian federal laws and regulations. They
would become an integral part of a major world political unit.
The Canadian Governor General and the Federal
Courts of Appeal would be shared with the Islands.
(2) The Islands would utilise the canadian dollar.
(3) As Canadian citizens, the Islands would acquire a
completely different relationship with other members
of the Commonwealth and the world. They would
have the benefit of the Canadian diplomatic services
which are well established in the neighbouring countries and they would cease to be unwanted British
Colonials and a burden on the British taxpayer. At
present, the British passports give them no right to
migrate or to work in Britain.
(4) The Islands would benefit from the very close
relationship that Canada has with the United States.
(5) The economic future of these Islands would be
rapidly integrated into that of Canada. Canada has no
warm southern states and suffers some of the worst
winters in the world. These Islands would naturally
attract the Canadian winter vacationist and the
retirement couples who wish to invest their savings,
earned elsewhere, in seasonal homes. The geographical position of these Islands will probably be developed by those Canadian manufacturers who need a
Caribbean show-case and entrepot facilities. Canadian
airlines could become "domestic" airlines with the
ability to quote preferential tariffs.
(6) The educational system would become Canadian
and it should then be far easier to obtain places in
Canadian universities and trade and professional
institutions. Employment opportunities and the spectrum of jobs would increase far beyond those of these
small Islands with their small population.
(7) As a Canadian tropical Province or Territory, the
Islands would be able to tap a "domestic" tourist
market.
(8) The Canadian Government has a long tradition of
helping underdeveloped countries and communities.
They have well established governmental agencies,
development funds and professional consultancy
firms who have worked throughout the world."
And that in considering this association the following
steps should be taken:
"(1) Visits by parliamentary and governmental
delegations.
(2) Acceptance of Canadian dollar as basis for
currency.
(3) Appointment of Governor General of Canada as
Governor of Turks and Caicos Islands.
(4) Establishment of Canadian banks and financial
institutions.
(5) Encouragement of Canadian investment in tourist
facilities and industry.

SENATE DEBATES

(6) Relaxation of immigration regulations to encourage travel between the two communities.
(7) Establishment of internal domestic air route structure so that the Islands become readily accessible
from all Provinces.
(8) Coordination of legislation to protect travellers
and settlers, particularly with reference to welfare
benefits.
(9) Rationalization of Island legislation to permit
operation and protection of Canadian investments.
(10) Closer political and constitutional ties written
into the legislation of both countries."

MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE ADJOURNED

The Senate proceeded to consideration of His Excellency
the Governor General's Speech at the opening of the

[English]
He said: Honourable senators, in rising to address
myself to this motion and to support it, I wish to pay my
respects to the Honourable Senator Muriel McQueen Fergusson, our distinguished Speaker. Not only is the honourable senator a good personal friend of mine and of my
family, but for many years on Waterloo Row in Fredericton she was almost our nextdoor neighbour.
As a fellow New Brunswicker, I was extremely proud of
the fact that she was elected to the high office of Speaker
of this house. My family rejoiced in that appointment, as
did all New Brunswickers. In performing the duties of her
high office she is a credit to the province of New Brunswick as well as to the Canadian Senate.
This maiden speech perhaps marks my age of political
majority, for 21 years ago, in 1953, I rose for the first time
in a Parliament, as the member for Kent County in the
New Brunswick Legislature. I was then, I confess, exceedingly nervous, because at the age of 26 I had never before
spoken in an august chamber such as the provincial legislature. I must admit that since then I have had a number
of years' experience in parliamentary procedure, and the
situation today is not quite the same as it was then.
To serve in this house is, for me, the continuation of a
privilege that started over two decades ago. I now have the
opportunity, hopefully, of being of service in a different
capacity, but nevertheless as a parliamentarian.
It is a matter of no small pride to me that I can again
rise and take part in public affairs, in Parliament and in
such distinguished company as that of the members of the
Canadian Senate.
I know that at times it is fashionable to question the
purpose and usefulness of this chamber, and as a Liberal I
entertain the notion that reform is not a nasty word per se.
However, I believe one of the principal roles of this house,
as envisaged by the Fathers of Confederation, is to provide
a body where the provinces can make themselves heard
and be defended if need be.
Honourable senators will not begrudge me the fact that
this is an area, particularly where New Brunswick is
concerned, in which I have some knowledge. In this spirit,
I propose to represent here, together with my colleagues
from New Brunswick, the interests of my province and its
people within the national framework.

Honourable senators, serving one's fellow citizens is a

pursue in this House a parliamentary career that began on
September 22, 1952, when I was first elected the member
for Kent in the New Brunswick legislature.
When the Fathers of Confederation created this chamber of the Canadian Parliament, they meant it to look
specifically after the rights of the provinces. It will certainly be understood that after being for so many years
premier of my province, I should not want to stop watching over its development and defending it when needed.
I had the honour to know and serve under three Governors General, the Rt. Hon. Vincent Massey, the Rt. Hon.
General Georges P. Vanier and the Rt. Hon. Roland D.

SENATE DEBATES

Michener. In paying tribute and extending my best wishes
to the new Governor General, His Excellency the Rt. Hon.
Jules Léger, I cannot help quoting from his inaugural
address delivered in this very chamber on January 14.
Like him, I am a descendant of "... generations of

honest and unassuming people who have always been
faithful to their homeland, having no other and seeking no
other".
The Acadians, established in their small part of the
country since 1604, four years before the founding of
Quebec, had what amounts to a difficult life. There is no
need to go over their history. However, it is worth noting
that, despite their hardships, not only have they survived
but they developed to the point where this minority has
made tremendous progress and has today by right a place
of its own within the Canadian society.
For the Acadians, the f ight for what they are entitled to
is far from over. There is no end in sight in their efforts
for the recognition and safekeeping of their vested interests. How much was accomplished, though, in a hundred
years? Today, in New Brunswick, not more than a handful
of retrogrades are still trying to turn back the clock of
history and bring us back to a long gone time.
As did the federal government, New Brunswick adopted
an Official Languages Act which, like the federal law, was
passed unanimously. I am most convinced that both laws,
which complement one another, were adopted in a spirit of
national unity. However, I know perfectly well that good
will cannot be legislated.
And yet, while the country as a whole accepts the
philosophy of official bilingualism, while there remains
but a small number of extremists who keep on arguing and
reviving old fears, we are faced at this time with another
dangerous concept which is just as pernicious, namely,
that of French unilingualism in a Canadian province.
Acadians are not the only ones who are threatened by
this dangerous concept; all French-speaking Canadians
outside Quebec are threatened, and these minorities would
be greatly endangered if Quebec were to adopt this policy.
I am well aware of the fact that in some circles in
Quebec-I underline, in some circles, not everywherepeople do not care much about French-speaking minorities
outside Quebec. They even predict their complete assimilation in a more or less distant future. However, I am also
aware of the fact that the survival of French minorities
does not depend on logic alone. If such were the case, they
would have disappeared long ago.
This survival is a survival of the heart, intensely sought
and paid at the price of extreme sacrifice; for, as every one
knows, "The heart has its reasons which reason knows
nothing of".
The disappearance of French-speaking minorities outside Quebec could be predicted and supported with the
most convincing scientific evidence, but I would continue
to believe that not only will they not disappear, but that
they will develop in a Canada more united and stable than
ever.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear!

Hon. Mr. Robichaud: I do not believe either in cultural
sovereignty-if I have well understood that term-nor in
any ghetto whatever, because I am convinced that if the

27601-2

rights of English-speaking citizens in Quebec were denied
and if the concept of a French unilingual Quebec was to
take root, then the cultural and linguistic future of more
than one million French-speaking citizens outside Quebec
would be seriously jeopardized.
Moreover, the French-speaking minorities outside
Quebec also belong to the great international community
called the "francophonie."
If the French-speaking minorities need a culturally
strong Quebec-and that is as it should be-we must not
on the other hand disregard their substantial cultural
contribution to the development of the francophonie.
Their customs, their background, their way of living, in
short everything which makes them different from
Quebec, are factors which are not always stressed
adequately.
Shall we start all over again these sterile discussions
presided over by prophets of evil for whom even the idea
of a parliamentary democracy in a bilingual federation is
an aberration? It would be better to remind them of the
words spoken by a wise Frenchman:
Friends who predict evil for you end up by wishing
you evil in order to prove they were right.
But I am not overly alarmed, because the proverbial
good sense of the Quebecers will take this into consideration and, furthermore, we must also take note that the
Quebec government is dealing with the matter in a levelheaded manner.
[English]
Honourable senators, it would be fitting, I am sure, to
ask for your indulgence and to devote a few moments to a
subject which was and is still very close to me, that of the
International Joint Commission. This very effective institution was created by virtue of a treaty signed in 1909
between Canada and the United States. The main purpose
of this treaty was:
-to prevent disputes regarding the use of boundary
waters and to make provision for the adjustment and
settlement of all questions arising in future between
Canada and the United States along their common
frontier which involve the rights, obligations or interests of either in relation to the other or to the inhabitants of the other.

Pollution of waters was dealt with briefly but unequivocally in Article IV of the Treaty:
-boundary waters and waters flowing across the
boundary shall not be polluted on either side to the
injury of health and property of the other.
The Commission is a permanent body composed of three
Canadians and three Americans. The current chairman,
who took my place in Canada a few weeks ago, is Professor Maxwell Cohen of McGill University. The other two
Canadian representatives are Mr. Bernard Beaupré, a sanitary engineer from Montreal, and Mr. Keith Henry, a
consulting engineer from Vancouver. As to their American
counterparts, the chairman is Mr. Christian A. Herter, Jr.,
the son of the former Secretary of State of the United
States. His colleagues are Mr. Charles R. Ross a professor
of law and economics at the University of Vermont, and
Mr. Victor J. Smith from Illinois, a publisher and
businessman.

SENATE DEBATES

The Commission always had staffed offices both in
Ottawa and Washington. As of last year, pursuant to an
agreement signed on April 15, 1972 between President
Nixon and Prime Minister Trudeau, we opened a regional
office at Windsor.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robichaud: I know that the Leader of the
Government in the Senate is very happy that this office
was opened in Windsor. There is quite a story behind its
location, and perhaps I will be in a position later on to
explain privately, if not publicly, the reasons why this
office was located in Canada rather than in the United
States.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Careful!
Hon. Mr. Robichaud: I am always careful.
Since the creation of the Commission, close to one hundred references have been submitted to it by the two
governments, and after extensive studies and public hearings it has recommended solutions that have been almost
always accepted and acted upon by the two governments.
It now has some thirty boards charged with the responsibility of monitoring the quality or level of water and
reporting twice a year in a formal way to the Commission
and once a month in an informal way.
* (1430)

In my opinion the most important issues ever submitted
to the Commission have been the harnessing of the
Columbia River, the construction of the St. Lawrence
Seaway, the water quality of the Great Lakes, the water
level of the Great Lakes, and the Richelieu-Champlain
water level. Others that have come close in the order of
magnitude have been the Skagit River reference, the air
quality in the Windsor-Detroit area, and the Lake of the
Woods reference. There have been hundreds of them.
The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement stipulates,
among other things, that "Programs and other measures
directed toward the achievement of the water quality
objectives shall be developed and implemented as soon as
practicable in accordance with legislation in the two countries. Unless otherwise agreed, such programs and other
measures shall be either completed or in process of
implementation by December 31, 1975."
I am afraid that a large number of people, both Canadians and Americans, interpreted that language as meaning
that, by December 31, 1975, the Great Lakes will return, or
will be returned, to their primitive condition, that is,
completely clean. That view is too optimistic. It will take a
number of years to achieve the objectives that the International Joint Commission bas set for itself, but these objectives will eventually be met. It will cost billions of dollars,
but the money will have to be raised and it will be raised, I
am sure.
As far as Canada is concerned, we are on schedule, even
perhaps ahead of schedule, and most of the credit is due to
the foresightedness of the Government of Ontario and the
Government of Canada for this situation. While, on the
United States side, eight states, some 160 municipal governments and hundreds of industries are involved, we,
however, are in the advantageous position that we have
only one province bordering the Great Lakes. The problem
[Hon. Mr. Robichaud.]

February 28, 1974

is thus much more complicated on the other side of the
border, but I am confident there is a sufficient amount of
goodwill and determination to conquer it.
Honourable senators, when I entered political life I was
motivated by two primary motives quite apart from the
ordinary anticipation of excitement which any New Brunswicker, or any Canadian for that matter, might seek in
politics. One was the hope of doing something, eventually,
toward a better material life for the people of my province.
The other was the chance to contribute something to the
unity of two peoples who, in my province, had lived side
by side from the very beginning of that jurisdiction: equal
opportunity within the framework of a unified Canadian
confederation. Those motives continue to be my guides as
I come into another atmosphere, or sphere, rather, of
national political activity. "Atmosphere" would fit just as
well there.
The two major groups in New Brunswick, which, for the
sake of brevity, may be designated as English and French,
created an electoral majority which gave me and my
colleagues a chance to move our province some considerable distance toward these two goals.
They gave us their confidence and for ten years-the
entire decade of the 1960s-we did things which I am now
proud to believe moved my province and its citizens into a
new era of economic and social equality.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robichaud: Honourable senators, the period
of reform was not an easy one and I will not now recount
the trials and the tribulations of that period. We had
considerable help from two federal administrations. I have
no doubt that today that continues to be the case. Those
administrations were sympathetic to the long-standing
needs and appeals of a province which was far behind the
others in sharing the prosperity and social advances of a
great and rich nation.
* (1440)

There remains a long way to go, but if I say that we had
a role in starting our fellow citizens along this road you
will understand that I say it not as a matter of personal
pride but as representing the pride of the people of New
Brunswick. Without their active participation, nothing
could have been achieved. We could not wait for circumstances to overcome the disparities of generations. If
reforms were to be made, we ourselves had to take the
initiative-and we took it.
Policies to overcome regional disparity have been central themes in political debate and government action for
decades. They are the very essence of what many Canadians think of when pondering national unity and national
purpose. All Canadians support fairness and equity, and
all Canadians can see the value of all efforts to provide
reasonable standards of services throughout our country,
and reasonable opportunities for our citizens both to contribute to and share in our economic progress.
The sometimes elaborate but effective techniques we
have devised to achieve our objectives have accomplished
much. Our system of equalization, the many shared-cost
programs, the diverse special agencies concerned with
problems specific to particular areas or regions, have
yielded an outstanding record of achievement. Central to

February 28, 1974
Fehruary 28, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES

these efforts today are the policies and programs of the
Department of Regional Economic Expansion. They are of
growing importance to all parts of Canada which are
lagging, and are of particular continuing interest and
importance to the Atlantic region. While equalization and
shared-cost prograns ensure an equitable allocation of
most public services, the policies and programs of DREE
are a positive investment in the future. They are the key
to the creation of jobs and the resurgence of hope. The
people of New Brunswick and those in the other parts of
Canada which receive DREE attention know that a conscious and concrete effort is being made to overcome past
neglect and to bring them into the mainstream of Canadian economic activity.
The policies and programs have evolved over a considerable period of years. They are still changing, as they must,
since there are no easy answers and no simple techniques.
Regional disparity is not unique to Canada and solutions
are not readily available anywhere.
We must build upon experience, and changes are being
introduced to regional development policies which should
prove a significant step forward. General development
agreements are being entered into with each province
except Prince Edward Island, which already has a comprehensive development plan. These new agreements, combined with continued regional industrial incentives, will
make it possible for the federal government and the provinces jointly to determine their development priorities and
the appropriate means to achieve them.
This new approach calls for the identification of development opportunities, the formulation of a plan of
action, the co-ordination of all public policies which can be
brought to bear, and implementation which focuses the
combined federal-provincial development effort to realize
on specific opportunities.
It is a national program which has great flexibility in
application. It recognizes that similar problems may have
different solutions in the various parts of Canada. It
recognizes the coincident responsibility of the two levels
of government and could well lead to closer working
relationships between them than we have experienced to
date. Problems of regional disparity cannot be overcome
by jealous governments working at cross purposes, nor
with one partner being more than equal to the other. No
one government has a monopoly on wisdom.
At this stage, perhaps I may be permitted a personal
note. Thinking back over the years when I had the privilege of being a colleague of the then Premier Robarts, I
considered at that time that Premier Robarts had the
Canadian people in his mind first and foremost, and not
necessarily just the people of Ontario. I thought he was a
great Canadian, and he proved it on very many occasions.
He wanted to share the national wealth, and he did it in a
superb way.
The introduction of general development agreements
and the subsidiary agreements for specific development
effort which will flow from them will require of each
party a great deal of patience and conscious effort to work
together. This will be a new challenge to those concerned
with federal-provincial relations, but one which I feel can
be successfully met.

27601-2!i

Our Confederation began as a co-operative effort, and it
is only by striving to work together to solve mutual
problems that our public institutions can dynamically
serve. I wish to draw attention to one example of such new
co-operative activities. I do so for several reasons: First of
all, because I played a role, perhaps, in promoting its
consideration; then it demonstrates also that the people of
the Maritime provinces are prepared to help themselves;
and it has great potential as a development within
Confederation.
I am sure all members of this chamber are aware that
the Charlottetown Conference of 1864, from which Confederation can be traced, actually began as a conference on
Maritime union. The subject was raised again, one hundred years later, in 1964, and resulted in a full-fledged
examination supported and financed by the three provincial governments. The outcome of the report, which recommended the serious consideration of intensive joint efforts
leading to union, has been the establishment of the Council of Maritime Premiers.
Unlike the occasional interprovincial consultations of
the past, the Council of Maritime Premiers has been formally established by an act of each of the three legislatures. Innovative solutions have been devised to enable
the Council to take executive action. In three short years
the Council of Maritime Premiers has become an effective
instrument for the consideration of regional issues, the
resolution of regional problems, and the development of a
regional position. Tangible progress is being made and
difficult issues are not being skirted.
This is clear recognition by the governments and the
legislatures of the three provinces that some policies must
encompass the region and that the solutions must be
devised jointly.
It is not easy to resolve the differences between governments or provinces or the various interests within them. It
is not easy to overcome the natural loyalties of Nova
Scotians, New Brunswickers, Prince Edward Islanders,
Cape Bretoners, Acadians, Haligonians or Saint Johnersyou name it, you have it.
Maritime union is not the issue. Effective and productive joint action in the interests of the Maritime provinces
is very much the issue. The work of the Council of Maritime Premiers, the joint select committee of the three
legislatures, and the various regional policies and agencies
being devised and established are important developments
within Confederation. They are a recognition of our growing interdependence in a complex world. They are also an
example of the efforts being made by the governments of
three small provinces to do all within their power to meet
the challenge of regional disparity.

e

(1450)

I now propose to seize this opportunity for some brief
comments on the energy situation in Canada and the
policies of the government designed to shelter our economy from rapidly escalating international oil prices and to
use our indigenous energy supplies for the benefit of all
Canadians.
Honourable senators will remember that on December 6
last year the Prime Minister outlined a new national oil
policy for Canada which recognized the creation of a

SENATE DEBATES

national market for Canadian oil as "one essential requirement." Others were: a pricing mechanism which provides
incentives to develop our oil resources; measures to ensure
that higher prices for oil contribute to security and selfsufficiency; establishment of a publicly owned Canadian
petroleum company to expedite exploration and development; early completion of a pipeline to serve Montreal and
more eastern points as required, and intensified research
on oil sands technology to achieve full and rapid development of a resource which potentially rivals the reserves of
the Middle East.
The future price of domestic crude is the central issue at
the moment in Canada's energy scene. We must allow the
price of domestically produced crude oil to rise to a level
high enough to ensure development of frontier supplies
which will be more costly than those from traditional
sources. That does not mean that they must go up at once.
The government has in place price restraints which
benefit the consumers of Canadian oil and a price control
mechanism for imported oil which has kept price increases
for Eastern Canada closely monitored so that the spread
between foreign and domestic supplies currently is seven
cents a gallon for fuel oil and gasoline. In effect, the
government's action avoided a 12-cent to 14-cent a gallon
price increase on these products in Eastern Canada and a
possible 20-cent hike across the country had international
prices prevailed.
By April 1 this year, about a month from now, the
government expects a one-price oil system in Canada
which will keep Canadian prices at less than international
prices but which will provide the revenues needed to bring
new resources on stream and offset the higher costs of oil
imported into Eastern Canada.
Contrast this situation with that of many other industrial nations which are far more dependent than Canada on
offshore supplies of petroleum. At the opening of the
energy conference on January 22, the Prime Minister was
moved to observe:
... current energy developments, affecting not only
Canadians but people throughout the Western
World-through their homes and automobiles, their
jobs and pocketbooks.
]IMore seriously, and perhaps quite tragically, the
current oil crisis is dimming the hopes of millions of
men and women in the poor and developing countries.
They see their economic aid and their hopes for
investment-to provide food, work and a better standard of life-swept away by staggering new costs for
the oil they must have.
The Secretary of State for External Affairs went to
energy discussions at Washington on February 11-the
so-called Kissinger initiative which brought together 13
consuming countries-and said that the meeting was
necessary because a world depression was possible if
methods were not devised to accommodate the fourfold
increase in international oil prices. Canadians in the past
could afford to shrug off Europe's higher gasoline prices,
but no longer. Italians today, and I was told this about
four or five days ago, are paying $1.50 a gallon for their
gasoline which means that to fill a gasoline tank they
would have to pay close to $30. In France and in other
[Hon. Mr. Robichaud.]

February 28, 1974

European countries the situation is the same. Japan is
similarly affected. Rising fuel costs have unleashed spiralling inflation in Japan and Europe, accompanied by
balance of payments deficits which may put renewed
strain on the international financial system in the next
few months.
As noted in the Prime Minister's address of November
27, 1973, and his statement to the House of Commons on
December 6, the federal government is especially concerned with the effects that the recent oil price increases
have on people of low income.
While the Canadian Constitution designates to the provinces the responsibility to administer social assistance
plans, the federal government has undertaken to contribute up to 50 per cent of whatever increases in Canada
Assistance Plan payments the individual provinces deem
are necessary to assist recipients in meeting their
increased fuel costs. I understand that a number of provinces, including Nova Scotia, have already introduced the
necessary legislation. I further understand that the legislation in Nova Scotia died because their house was dissolved two days ago. Other provinces are contemplating
similar legislation to fit in with the policies of the federal
government.
In addition, inasmuch as payments under the Old Age
Security, Guaranteed Income Supplement, and Canada
Pension Plan are tied to the Consumer Price Index, the
higher fuel prices will be reflected in higher payments
under these plans.
In other moves to establish self-sufficiency in energy by
the end of this decade, the Prime Minister announced
federal financial support for the first nuclear power unit
in any province and for a second unit if regional benefits
and security of supply result. At the present time the
Province of New Brunswick is negotiating for such a plan,
and I hope they will achieve it because it will involve the
expenditure of some $400 million made available to the
province from the federal treasury. I might also say to
those people who are afraid of the damage to the ecology
that a nuclear plant might create, that the International
Joint Commission held a seminar in July last at the Miner
Institute, Chazy, in New York State. At that seminar we
had the highest authority of the United States on nuclear
energy and the highest authority in Ontario on nuclear
energy, and it was the consensus of all the scientists that
there was absolutely no danger to the ecology or to anything else resulting from the decision of a province, state
or country to construct a nuclear plant. I believe this to be
the case and I do not consider that there is any danger
whatever to our ecology, to the quality of the air or the
environment.

Honourable senators will appreciate Canada's unique
position both as an importer and as an exporter of
petroleum. This has the twin goals of deriving appropriate
revenues from the export of this valuable non-renewable
resource for the benefit of all Canadians and the need to
cushion eastern consumers from the high-priced imports
so that broad disparities do not occur between regions of
the country dependent on foreign resources and those
served by domestic supplies of crude oil and petroleum
products.

SENATE DEBATES

[Translation]
Honourable senators, when I was appointed to the
Senate, I had decided to wait for two or three months
before saying one single word in this chamber. However, I
was unable to refuse the invitation of the Government
Leader in the Senate, Senator Martin, who asked me to
move the Address in reply to the Speech from the Throne.
I have just performed my duty. I wish to thank you all,
honourable senators.
I am pleased to move that the Address in reply to the
Speech frorn the Throne be concurred in.

[English]
Hon. Raymond J. Perrault: Honourable senators, it is a
privilege to be accorded the opportunity to second the
Address in reply to the Speech from the Throne. I use the
word "privilege" with good reason, because I have known
the mover of the Address for a great many years. He has
been a good friend; he has made a distinguished contribution to public life in this country, and his appointment to
this body is an event which can only redound to the
benefit of all Canadians.

[Translation]
Honourable senators, it is a very special pleasure for me
to take part in this debate today with my old friend and
colleague, Honourable Louis Robichaud.
Having been born and raised in British Columbia, the
large Western bilingual province-and I mean English and
Chinese, of course-I do not have the same ability as
Senator Robichaud in the other official language of
Canada. Therefore I am sure you will excuse me, honour-

able senators, for delivering my speech in one language
only.
[English]

A few days ago I visited Senator Robichaud's great and
historic province, New Brunswick. We were on the same
platform together in Moncton. I noted then something
which it may be appropriate to note on this occasion, that
down through the years thousands of New Brunswickers,
thousands of Maritimers, have made the happy decisionat least for British Columbia-to come to our West Coast
province and work with us to build our province. There
they continue to make a distinguished contribution.
One need only review the birthplaces of many of British
Columbia's and Canada's distinguished jurists, educators,
business people, professional people and others to be convinced once again of the valuable contribution of the
Maritime provinces to Confederation. As a British Columbian, I salute them. Members of Parliament-whether they
serve in the Senate or in the other place-are particularly
fortunate, because in the course of their duties and responsibilities they are accorded many opportunities to meet
Canadians from all the provinces and territories. They are
accorded the privilege of assessing the length and breadth
of Canada, and its grandeur, possibilities and potential.
In the Confederation Debates of February 1865, George
Brown described my home province as "British Columbia,
the land of golden opportunities." But only small-minded
people believe that their region or their province possesses
some kind of special monopoly on scenic beauty, industrious and talented people, resource potential, or even virtue.

Like other honourable senators, I have travelled the
length and breadth of Canada, from British Columbia to
Newfoundland and the Yukon. It is a magnificent country,
greatly privileged among the nations of the world.
Undoubtedly in Canada we have many problems, which
will be elucidated in exquisite detail by the members of
Her Majesty's loyal Opposition in this and the other place
in the days to come. Some of these problems do not lend
themselves to easy solutions, but when we compare
Canadian problems with the critical life-and-death issues
confronting three-quarters of the world's population, then
we must regard ourselves as being singularly blessed and
we must be prof oundly grateful.
It was Winston Churchill, I think, who said that the
parliamentary system is the most inefficient and ineffective governmental system in the world, with the exception
of every other. As we look around the world, and at the
traumatic political events which are occurring not only
abroad but among our dear and closest neighbours on this
continent, I believe that we see dramatized once again the
inherent strengths of our parliamentary system. So we
have a good deal to be grateful for.
Honourable senators, the Speech frorn the Throne
reflects the concern of the government about the problems
of Canadians, particularly the problem of inflation or
rapid price escalation. When Canadians-particularly
"unorganized" Canadians, those who have no economic
heft or weight-must pay prices rising by 10 per cent or
more every year without end, when the man who takes
less out of society than he puts in is chosen, as one writer
says, "to be the sucker and burnt offering on the altar of
official gods," it is time for governments to act.
So we have in the Throne Speech a number of measures
designed to mitigate the effects of inflation, insofar as it is
possible, especially in relation to those in a more vulnerable economic position.
It is all too easy for the Opposition to criticize the
efforts of the government in this area. I note a cynical
chuckle from the other side of the house. The fact is that a
worldwide shortage of commodities bas created serious
price inflation everywhere. Despite their distressing
nature, the effects of inflation in Canada have been less
onerous than in most other countries. While Canadian
prices have increased less than those in most other industrialized countries, they have most certainly exceeded the
recent experience in Canada, and Canadians are not
satisfied.
As honourable senators are aware, inflation of costs and
prices reflects the scarcity of many industrial materials
caused by rapid economic growth proceeding almost
simultaneously in most of the major industrialized
nations. In addition-and I cite these problems not by way
of offering excuses, but by way of setting forth the facts as
they exist-temporary world scarcities of feed grains and
food products have arisen while crop failures in some
major producing countries have coincided with rising consumer demand. Major currency realignments have contributed to rising prices of imports into Canada. Of course,
we are all acutely aware of the rising cost of petroleum
and the effect this has had on Canadian economic
development.

SENATE DEBATES

(1510)

Despite this escalation in costs, expansion and real production in recent months have been the highest for any
period since the mid-1960s and among the highest of any
industrialized country of the world. This growth, despite
our problems, reflects real strength in the major sectors of
the Canadian economy. The continuing decline in unemployment is another source of encouragement, which indicates that despite Canada's problems, very real and basic
progress is being made.
As was stated in the Speech from the Throne, our
Canadian system is closely tied to international trade and
markets. We are all aware of this fact. The principal
inflationary pressures have come from outside our country. In view of this, and under such conditions, it would
have been singularly inappropriate to have resorted to
general income and price controls, and the government bas
rejected them for those reasons.
At the same time, much has been done by this government to relieve the impact of rising costs on consumers. In
recent months we have seen income tax and federal sales
tax reductions, an increase in Family Allowance to $20 per
month, increased pensions for senior citizens, increased
pensions for veterans, and increased pensions for the disabled, representing a concerted and vigorous attempt to
protect those most adversely affected by the cancer of
rising prices. We now have assurances that Family Allowances, payments under the Canada Pension Plan and other
pensions will be increased regularly in line with increases
in the cost of living.
Those are the actions of a government concerned about
people, concerned about the escalation of prices.
There has been intervention to slow the increases in the
price of gasoline and home-heating fuel, and subsidies
have been provided to keep down consumer costs of meat,
milk, bread and other bakery products. This kind of record
hardly constitutes alleged "callous disregard" for the little
people of Canada. It is a record of a government concerned
for the Canadian people.
The net result of these measures is that when increased
prices are taken into account, real personal disposable
income of individual Canadians is more than 5 per cent
higher than it was a year ago. Few nations can make this
claim.
It is encouraging to note that the Speech from the
Throne states:
But in addition, and more immediately, the Government's policy in dealing with inflation will be to step
in, as it has done in the past, and take specific measures to increase the supply of certain goods and services, to protect those who are not able to protect
themselves against the effects of inflation, to cushion
consumers against sudden and disruptive price
increases of essential commodities, and to prevent any
group or groups from taking undue advantage of the
current situation at the expense of others.
Concern is expressed for individual hardship caused by
the rise in the price of oil and oil products, and the effect
of the increase on the economy. Action will be taken in
this area.
[Hon. Mr. Perrault.]

February 28,1974

Action will also be taken to increase Canada's production of food, with full consideration given to both the
consumer and producer: for the consumer, a sufficient and
balanced diet; and for the producer, an adequate return to
encourage production of food items which can be economically and efficiently produced in this country.
Predictably, the government's program to combat the
price spiral has been vigorously opposed by the Leader of
the official Opposition in the other place. He has condemned the Throne Speech as "vacuous" and he once
again opts for a program of short-term controls followed
by-and this can truly be described as vacuous-"followup measures." Those measures have not been specified and
no details have been given.
For two years now, the Leader of the official Opposition
in the other place has expressed his support for controls. It
is to be hoped that shortly he will bring himself to providing a detailed list of proposed controls, as well as a list of
the specific measures which should follow those controls.
Surely, honourable senators, he bas had adequate time to
do that.
The national leader of the party opposite speaks of
"relentless" price increases, and, in some sort of convoluted fashion, the government is supposed to be responsible
for these allegedly "relentless" price increases. Yet that
leader's own family business has been affected in a most
dramatic fashion by the inexorable upward spiral of world
prices, and those world prices in the light of Canada's
pattern of imports of wool and cotton. Since 1968 there bas
been a 76 per cent increase in cotton prices. Has that been
within the control of the Government of Canada? A 41 per
cent increase in wool prices has meant an increase in costs
for all those in Canada who manufacture undergarments.
Has this phenomenon been within the control of the Government of Canada?
Does anyone wonder why the cost of undergarments is
escalating so rapidly in Canada today? Does the Leader of
the official Opposition in the other place seriously suggest
that Canada should intervene unilaterally to turn back
this world tide? The policies of the Canadian government
have nothing to do with the price increases made necessary in the manufacture of Stanfield underwear over the
past few years.
An Hon. Senator: Shame!
Hon. Mr. Perrault: The state of the international commodity market has a great deal to do with the advance in
the cost of those items.
In fact, controls in the United States and in Britain of
the type advocated by the official Opposition, as well as
varying systems adopted by European nations, have
proved ineffective in controlling inflation.
What is the comparison with other countries? In January, if we compare statistics on a year-to-year basis, Canada's price index increase of 9.1 per cent compares with an
increase of 9.4 per cent in the United States, 12 per cent in
Great Britain, and 10.3 per cent for all OECD countries
and OECD Europe.
The official Opposition is critical of Canada's economic
performance. The United States is in the process of phasing out all price and wage controls, except in health care
and petroleum products, because they have not proved to

February 28, 1974

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

be effective. Indeed, they have had the reverse effect of
increasing inflationary pressures by creating shortages.
The British economy is threatened with nothing less
than disaster-largely as a result of widespread labour
strikes in opposition to wage controls-because of lack of
support necessary to make those controls successful.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: What does that prove?
Hon. Mr. Perrault: Again, it should be said that those
who aspire to replace the government, those who advocate
controls, should tell Canadians just how differently those
controls would be imposed from the way controls are
imposed in other countries.
Three years ago, on January 31, 1971, a well-known
Canadian political figure made a speech on the subject of
controls. His words should be borne in mind. He said:
Controls would cause untold resentment among
groups and individuals who felt unfairly done by, and
they would result in a climate of constant confrontation. In addition, of course, they would inevitably lead
to a highly centralized and therefore inefficient form
of economic planning.
The well-known political figure who made that speech is
today's Leader of the official Opposition in the other
place. He appears to have undergone a conversion second
in dramatic impact only to that of Paul's conversion while
on the road to Damascus.

(1520)

Hon. Mr. Flynn: Do you mean Paul Martin?
Hon. Mr. Perrault: Federal government policies have
stimulated, in recent months and years, a record amount
of housing construction, as well as providing assistance
for more home ownership. The federal fund of half a
billion dollars for land assembly and the establishment of
the Federal Residential Mortgage Agency will also make it
easier for more people to purchase homes. Just last month,
the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation reported a
record number of housing starts across Canada for the
third consecutive year. There were 265,000 housing starts
in 1973, an increase of 6 per cent over 1972. If housing
construction continues at its present record level, it will
help reduce housing prices, which is of importance to all
Canadians. As the Minister of State for Urban Affairs said
the other day, "Construction and production have exceeded for quite some years the rate of family formation in this
country. Obviously, if we can maintain this kind of construction, which I think we can, it will have a depressing
effect on prices."
The government is spending $100 million in each of the
next five years on a land assembly program to increase the
supply of serviced land to meet housing needs, and to
control land prices. Money is now available for the purchase of both new and old houses for low income housing.
This program has conferred benefits all across the country, but more improvements are needed, as is clearly
admitted.
There will be substantial assistance to rural and native
housing programs. This is one of the important statements
in the Speech from the Throne. Also, the sewage assistance
program will be revised to make it more effective as a
means of increasing the supply of serviced land, and the

15
15

government will introduce measures to increase the protection available to consumers in the housing market.
At this juncture I should like to say something about
alleged Western alienation. I am a Westerner. I was born
in Western Canada. Indeed, my mother was born in
Manitoba, raised in Saskatchewan, married in Calgary,
and I was born in British Columbia, so I think I have a
right to say something about the West. I am a Westerner,
and over the years I have identified myself with the
aspirations of those who live in Western Canada.
In my view, certain legitimate grievances exist in Western Canada, and I have stated them on many occasions, as
have other members of this chamber. I have attended
many meetings and conferences relating to Western problems and grievances. I welcome that section of the Throne
Speech which makes reference to the implementation of
certain proposals set out during the Western Economic
Opportunities Conference. I welcome the announcement
that a number of measures will be taken, in the larger
context, to ensure that Canada's transportation capabilities support the government's national goals and are safe
and efficient. Together with other Westerners, I welcome
the announcement that steps will be taken to end discrimination in freight rates and that a new ports policy
will be developed to ensure an effective and comprehensive ports structure in Canada, in a framework where a
high degree of local involvement and management can be
established. This kind of action is welcome. It is overdue.
I suspect, however, that despite these government initiatives, despite these efforts on the part of the federal
government to remove the source of many Western grievances, the political critics will be as strident as ever. The
fact is that no government ii history has been more
responsive to the needs and aspirations of Western
Canada than the present government. That is a f act which
cannot be distorted by Opposition efforts to say otherwise.
Despite the ranting and railing of the Opposition critics, it
is a fact that infinitely more has been done for Western
Canada by the present government than was done by
preceding governments.
There is still a great deal left to be done. No Westerner
would ever admit that perfection has been achieved,
despite the fact that Western Canada now enjoys its highest level of economic prosperity in history. Similarly, I
would not expect my friends from the Maritimes, Ontario,
Quebec, or any other province, to admit that they had
achieved perfection. I do suggest, however, that politically
motivated criticism of the federal government for its
alleged discrimination against Western Canada discredits
the entire Western position and does a great deal of
damage.
A few months ago, I had the opportunity to attend the
Western Economic Opportunities Conference in Calgary,
which was an unique event in the history of Canada. It
was the first time since Confederation that a Government
of Canada brought most of its Cabinet ministers out to a
sit-down conference, televised to all of the people in Western Canada, to discuss Western problems, hopes and aspirations, dreams and difficulties. It was never done by a
Conservative administration. I well recall a Tory "Roads
to Resources" program which resulted in British Columbia

SENATE DEBATES
getting $10 million to build a road north, but no one can
really recall what happened beyond that.
The Western Economic Opportunities Conference was
convened as the result of a federal government initiative,
the first such initiative in history. The achievements of
that conference
included agreement
with British
Columbia covering the expansion of the port of Prince
Rupert, and the CNR and BC rail facilities in Northern
British Columbia. The total cost, in one program alone,
will exceed $200 million. There was also a commitment to
construct a vital rail bypass in British Columbia to facilitate the movement of Prairie grain to market, and to
rationalize shipping by rail in southern British Columbia.
The conference also brought about a reference to the
Canadian Transport Commission of specific freight rates
perceived as discriminatory, and a commitment to add to
the reference further instances as requested by provincial
governments.
In the Speech from the Throne we find specific references to the removal of freight rate anomalies in Western
Canada. Despite all of this, one of the Western premiers
went on national television last night and said, "Well, we
are deeply disappointed because the Throne Speech terms
are too vague." Well, any premier knows that a Speech
from the Throne sets out the general program of the
government, with the specifics following later. That kind
of niggling criticism is not going to help Western Canada.
The Western Economic Opportunities Conference
resulted in a commitment to establish a joint federal-western provinces committee on transportation. Other results
of that conference were the imposition of an 18-month
freeze on unprotected branch lines; agreement on full
intergovernmental disclosure of cost data relative to railroad and trucking freight rates; an offer to Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba to share 50-50 the cost of updating their primary highway network to the same capacity
as presently pertains in the province of British Columbia;
an offer to Alberta to establish a jointly funded Alberta
coal resource evaluation program; a proposed agreement
for mineral development for northwestern British
Columbia and northern Saskatchewan; a commitment to
decentralize DREE, placing 70 per cent of the personnel at
regional and provincial offices and to delegate decisionmaking on regional development incentive grants to the
decentralized offices; the decentralization of the Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce, which is now
under way; and a commitment to propose an amendment
to the Bank Act that will permit a provincial government
to own, initially, up to 25 per cent of the voting shares of a
new chartered bank, with provision for reduction of the
holding to 10 per cent over a period of time.
In the light of these achievements, most of the people
who say that they are "deeply disappointed" and that the
federal government "still does not understand them" are, I
fear, pursuing political motives rather than motives which
might benefit Western Canada.
The Speech from the Throne talks in terms of guaranteed loans for farmers and fishermen; amendments to the
Export and Import Permits Act to provide the government
with better means to stabilize the Canadian market;
improved harbour facilities; measures for facilitating
agricultural stabilization; assistance to young farmers;
[Hon. Mr. Perrault.]

February 28, 1974

better veterinary training facilities; a prairie grain market
insurance plan; improvements in Canadian grain rail
transportation capabilities, and so forth. I wonder what
the game of the critics really is when they criticize one of
the most constructive programs for the West ever brought
before a Parliament of Canada?
& (1530)

As much as I am a strong advocate of Western development, I believe just as strongly that this government must
be given full credit for its remarkable efforts to consider
the legitimate problems and aspirations of the West and,
where possible, to provide appropriate solutions. I reject
out of hand, as do most thinking Westerners, the senseless
and patently political allegation that the present government "cares nothing" about Western Canada, the absurd
nonsense that surfaces in commentaries across the country
from time to time.
The fact is that Canada has never been an easy nation to
govern. It is very difficult to design programs that will be
equally effective in all parts of the country. Every region
has had its problems with Confederation. I have had many
opportunities to discuss with my good friends in the Maritimes some of their problems within Confederation; they
have been plenty, and they need attention. I think there
should be a maritime regional conference convened, if one
is not already in the planning stage, of the kind we had in
Calgary a few months ago. I have the deepest sympathy
with my friends in the Maritimes.
I have travelled in Ontario, Quebec and the Yukon, and
nobody regards Confederation as perfect, but we know
very well it is better to hang together, that Confederation
confers benefits that go far beyond any special regional
problems that we may have. Perhaps one of the greatest
miracles of all is the fact that Canada, despite its differences, and at times conflicting interests in its regions,
came into existence in the first place.
Despite our problems, Canada has probably made more
progress in the 106 years of its existence than any other
nation on the face of the earth. We have done this despite
some regional problems that we have had-some in the
West, some in the East, and some in the Central provinces.
We have achieved a great deal, despite what many feel to
be certain impediments to our progress.
Honourable senators, I expect to be a part of many other
Western delegations seeking more favourable consideration of some of our problems, but I do feel it is time to
state emphatically that this government has acted with
greater vigour to solve Western problems than any other
government in history, that much of the alleged "Western
alienation," to the extent that it exists, is in great measure
the product of politically hungry and cynical men.
Westerners want to see greater decentralization of
public institutions. This is one of our goals. We believe
that decentralization means more regional autonomy,
more policies tailored and attuned to local needs. The
question of rural depopulation and undesirable changes in
the social fabric of small towns in rural Canada is an
urgent concern in the West. There is a need for the West to
have a bigger share in national economic questions. When
the Speech from the Throne talks in terms of expanding
the petrochemical industry, as a Westerner I hope that
some of this expansion will take place in Western Canada

February 28, 1974
February 28, 1974

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

at the source of the oil, where it comes out of the ground,
and that not all will take place in Central Canada or some
other area. We need a broader economic base in the West,
and better transportation and national policies, so that the
West can become more economically stable, so that growth
is more steady.
In Western Canada we have moved beyond the time of
the old national policy. We want to rewrite that old
national policy devised by the Conservative Government
of Sir John A. Macdonald a hundred years ago. It was a
scheme to secure the growth and development of the
Central region of the country. That was perfectly reasonable in the 1870s, when the vast majority of Canadians
lived east of the Great Lakes. Under that original national
policy the great and empty northwest was to be a supplier
of primary resources for the flourishing industries further
east. Eventually, too, the West would develop into a sort of
captive market for Eastern manufactured goods. The tarif f
structure, economic development programs, population
projections and railway construction were all factors
geared to fit in with Sir John's national policy, and it
worked reasonably well. But Westerners believe that the
time has arrived for changes.
It is now a hundred years later, and Canada has outgrown that old design. The right policy of the 1870s is no
longer appropriate in 1974. The task begun at the Western
Economic Opportunities Conference was no less than the
redrafting of the national policy, and in the Speech from
the Throne we have fresh evidence of a government sympathetic to Western aspirations and needs, and our new
dreams. I find it disappointing that some partisans have
tended to take such a negative view of all the progress we
have made in the West over these past few months.
Stretching as it does over 4,000 miles, this nation of ours
requires a great abundance of tolerance and understanding on the part of all citizens, wherever they live. No one
has ever regarded Confederation as perfect, and it may be
a temptation for some to exploit regional differences for
their own narrow aims and ambitions, but it is to be
hoped, honourable senators, that most men and women
who serve in public lif e will follow the other more positive
course, that they will make a conscious effort to strengthen the bonds of national unity, and will attempt to emphasize the good and positive reasons for a united Canada to
continue in existence.
In conclusion, I want to make reference to the advances
proposed for the women of Canada. For some time I served
as parliamentary secretary in the department with a
responsibility for the Report of the Royal Commission on
the Status of Women, and I welcome the statement in the
Speech from the Throne that the women of Canada are
going to make further progress towards full equalityequality they have not enjoyed up to the present time. I
think Canadians will welcome the proposal to remove the
difference in treatment as between men and women presently in the Canada Pension Plan. Fair-minded Canadians
will applaud additional amendments, the purpose of which
will be to provide equal treatment for women.
The sense of frustration and injustice that has sparked
the virtual social revolution at present being supported by
women in Canada has its roots, perhaps, even in fields as
yet not too well known to the women themselves. The

failure of economists and statisticians to include as a
national asset, for purposes of assessing the national product, the value of unpaid services provided by women in
their own homes, and the failure to consider women working in their own homes as persons actively employed in
the labour force, have contributed to a state of affairs that
is somewhat paradoxical.
Let me illustrate with a tongue-in-cheek four-line verse
that appeared recently in the Canada Labour Gazette, a
publication well worth reading, in a column headed,
"From the Women's Bureau." It concerns the labour force
components.
Through women in labour,
Life keeps on its course;
But mothers don't count
In the labour force?
In so far as the omission of unpaid domestic services
from the calculation of national income is concerned, the
paradoxical state of affairs was illustrated by a noted
economist, A.C. Pigou, in his work "The Economics of
Welf are," when he gave the following example:
If a number of bachelors who were employing
housekeepers in the customary manner of exchanging
services for money, decided to marry these housekeepers, then the national dividend would be diminished.
Obviously the housekeeper, when assuming the role of
a wife, regardless of any additional services she
assumed by virtue of her marriage, continued to perform those services which she, as a housekeeper, had
been performing previously. In other words, the services continued but the value disappeared.
a (1540)

So there is a view, held increasingly by Canadians, both
men and women-and I share the view- that housewives
should be considered as members of the active labour force
while the value of their domestic services should be
included as part of the gross national product.
Social benefits as well as statistical and economic good
sense would grow from a revision of established procedures relating to the present methods of computing the
size of the active labour force. The belittling of the role of
the housewife or homemaker, however she is described,
has been responsible in no small part for many of the
dissatisfactions being expressed by women.
By being made part of the active work force, housewives
would also be eligible for certain social security benefits
such as the Canada Pension Plan. These are presently
reserved for those who decide to seek employment outside
the home. We have a paradox today in the case of a girl
who works on the so-called active labour force, and who
then becomes married and raises her family. During the
period when she is at home performing this vital social
work she has no opportunity at all to contribute to the
Canada Pension Plan. She returns to the work force when
the family is grown up, but as far as Canada is concerned
she simply was not in existence during that period when
she performed her contribution to society in the home.
I know that there may be certain actuarial problems
associated with the implementation of such a modification
of the Canada Pension Plan, but I hope that we are going

SENATE DEBATESFeray2,17

to be enlightened enough to endeavour to bring housewives into that plan, and to permit them to contribute
during the years when they are housewives. We require a
new concept that will recognize women as individuals
with economie responsibilities towards themselves and
their dependants, that will take into account the economc
nature of the role that women play in the family and in
society, how that role affects their earning capacity in the
labour market and their security for the future, and how it
forms a basic support sector of the economy and provides a
monumental contribution in very real terms towards the
support of all the fringe benefits that society off ers today
only to the paid labour force.
Honourable senators, Canada can be proud of the progress which has been achieved in difficult circumstances
during the past twelve months. That progress is the product of its people, wherever they live. It has been achieved
in part by governrnents, by the private sector, by labour,
and by those who contribute to this country in a multiplicity of ways. The Speech from the Throne, which His
Excellency the Governor General so graciously delivered
yesterday, gives promise of still greater progress in the
months to corne. It is a positive and optirnistic staternent

February 28, 1974

which expresses concern for the problems of the people of
Canada. It concedes that Canada faces serious and chailenging problerns, but it offers constructive solutions.
Thus I am pleased to second the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne proposed by rny friend and colleague, the Honourable Senator Louis Robichaud.

Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche): Honourable senators, I should like to thank the Leader of the
Government for having obtained in record time this information in reply to my most recent questions concerning
the CNR. I say it was done in record time because in my
view it has not always been easy to obtain information
from the CNR or, in many cases, from the CBC. I should
also like to point out that many of these questions have
been answered very negatively and the answers are
unsatisfactory and far from being complete.
I should like to remind those two corporations, the CNR
and the CBC, that these are not answers only to me; they
should understand that they are giving the answers to the
Senate of Canada. My latest Notice of Inquiry leads me to
believe that on most occasions we are being taken for a
ride. Perhaps they would like to tell the senators to mind
their own business.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Perhaps the CNR is being taken
for a ride.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Maybe they are being railroaded.
Hon. Mr. Walker: Touché.
Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche): My last
Notice of Inquiry goes back to 1972 and was concerned
with a derailment on the CNR at Monk. The total loss
incurred by the company at that time was stated to be
$655,270. The answer I received today in connection with
the same derailment, at the same place, on the same date,
is a loss of $968,315, which makes a difference of $313,045, a
big difference for one item. I just wonder if this is the type
of answer we can expect. I will leave this with you. I could
ask more of these questions but I wonder if we would
receive similar answers. I think it is terrible that we
receive this type of answer.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, February 28, consideration of His Excellency the Governor General's
Speech at the opening of the session, and the motion of
Senator Robichaud, seconded by Senator Perrault, for an
Address in reply thereto.
[Translation]
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, despite all
predictions, this 29th Parliament will thus have lived long
enough to see the opening of its second session.
Will it live to see the end of it? Might there be a third
session? That is difficult to predict, the government and
its temporary ally, the NDP, having shown until now so
much aptitude for opportunism, turnabouts, bows,
pirouettes, compromise; the government, to keep itself in
power, and the NDP, to avoid elections.
That truly is the picture the last session brings to mind
and doubtless what we can expect of the one which has

IHon. Mr

Martin.]

March 5, 1974

just started. The corner of the veil lifted by the Speech
from the Throne does support this conclusion.
However, before coming to the heart of my remarks, of
which you are doubtless now aware, I have just given you
a general idea, I should like to say how pleased I am with
the appointment of our new Governor General, His Excellency Jules Léger, an eminent diplomat whose career illustrates how talented, distinguished and devoted he is. In
every post held prior to entering Rideau Hall, he did
Canada proud.
In the performance of his duties, he has always had and
will always have the support and co-operation of his
charming, devoted and intelligent wife.
On behalf of the official Opposition, I extend to Their
Excellencies our wishes for a happy and fruitful sojourn
at Rideau Hall, confident that they will discharge the
duties of their high office with the same dignity and
competence they showed in their previous appointments.

Honourable senators, that a do-nothing Parliament such
as this should have lasted as long as it has is deplorable.
An Hon. Senator: A miracle!
Hon. Mr. Flynn: But there is one consolation. Since we
are starting a new session and not a new Parliament, it
means that Senator Muriel Fergusson will continue to
preside over our deliberations.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: And we are convinced that she will
continue to preside with all the patience, wisdom, charm
and wit that are so characteristic of her.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Senator Fergusson is an outstanding
Speaker. She has worked tirelessly and enthusiastically to
try to improve the Senate's public image. I want Madam
Speaker to know today that the official Opposition recognizes, and very much appreciates, her praiseworthy efforts
along these lines. She can count on our continued
co-operation.
Senator Fergusson's continued presence in the Speaker's
Chair offers, as I have said, some consolation. Senator
Martin's continued presence in the government leader's
chair offers, however, somewhat less. I hasten to assure
him that there is nothing personal in what I say. I, as do
many others, recognize him as a man of sterling qualities,
a man of outstanding ability.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I have often found myself envious of
his highly flexible personality. His career demonstrates
well what a great capacity he possesses for adapting to
different people, circumstances and programs. But even if
the grounds for disagreement between us should be, and
are, few, they are not unimportant. Basically, I have never
been able to adopt his perspective with regard to the
Senate, and as to the way in which it should discharge its
constitutional responsibilities. Senator Martin, I continue
to hope, will some day find a way to accept some of my
suggestions in this respect. Although I have always been

March 5, 1974

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

willing to co-operate, he has given no indication of any
enthusiasm for my help.
On a happier note, I would like him to know that the
official Opposition wishes him all that he has ever wished
for-the best. We are very happy to see him looking so
healthy, vigorous and young. Like Jack Benny, he never
seems to get any greyer.

[Translation]
Honourable senators, last Thursday we had the pleasure
of hearing the remarkable speech of our new colleague,
Senator Louis Robichaud. We could not expect less in his
case. His reputation had preceded him in this house.
His career in the New Brunswick Legislature and the
fact that he held the position of provincial premier in
Fredericton for ten years are proof of his qualifications
and assure us that his presence will be very useful during
our deliberations.
I congratulate Senator Robichaud on the manner in
which he acquitted himself of the relatively thankless
task of mover of the Address. This speech will probably be
only the first of several excellent ones and we shall look
forward to hearing him again.

[English]
Senator Perrault's speech, seconding Senator Robichaud's motion for adoption of the Speech from the
Throne, demonstrated amply well how conversant he is
with the many and complex problems confronting this
country. But his speech simultaneously revealed his
Achilles' heel. He can identify problems well enough, and
he sees most of their ramifications. It is in the area of
solutions that I detected a certain rather significant weakness. The senator is obviously of the opinion that unless
solutions flow from the collective genius of the Liberal
Party's pseudo-intelligentsia, they have no value.
Honourable senators, how many of you remember last
year's Speech from the Throne? How many of you can
remember, without scowling, the government's eloquent
resolve: its determination to see inflation controlled; the
rise in the cost of living arrested; unemployment reduced.
This year's Throne Speech does not differ substantially
from last year's. And if the same old, tired and overworked
promises, the leftovers, have to be reheated and served up
to us again, it indicates that nothing much was accomplished by Parliament in the last session. But we did not
need that kind of proof. The facts of life are proof enough.
The cost of living is higher now than it ever was. Unemployment has certainly not diminished. And though social
benefits may have been increased, there is very little more
in the pockets of the needy. Their lot has not been significantly improved since last year. They are still the helpless
victims of a skyrocketing inflation rate, and no amount of
fancy Throne Speech verbiage ever has or ever will change
that fact.
Canadians are angry and bitter. They are taking an
economic beating and there seems to be nothing they can
do to defend themselves. They turn to the federal government for solace, but find none. The whole country seems
to have lost its sense of order and purpose.
What happened? Why was this government's performance so poor in the last session? The answer is easy. The
administration was mainly preoccupied with maintaining

itself in power. Fear of being removed from office prevented this government from acting boldly and courageously.
It is sad and pitiful, but nevertheless true: this government does not have the courage of its convictions, or has
no convictions at all. It was satisfied during the last
session to accept any view as long as it served to guarantee its continuance in office.
Let me give you a few examples of how this government
has prostituted whatever principles it had. Let me show
you how it has, with incredible cowardice, refused to lead
this country.
In the field of social security, Bill C-147, which was
passed in May of last year, increased the old age security
pension to $100 a month. It also included a cost of living
adjustment which was to be computed on an annual basis.
This indexing of the increase to the cost of living was
itself a retreat from the 1972 position of this government.
In 1972, you will recall, they had refused to allow old age
security pensions to increase more than 2 per cent per
annum. Normally, Bill C-147 should have been the only
bill concerning the old age security pension in the first
session of this Parliament. But, threatened by the loss of
NDP support, the government presented a second bill on
this subject last September.
*

(2020)

With Bill C-219, the government said that the indexing
of old age security pension increases should be done on a
quarterly basis. Indexing on a quarterly basis was an idea
first suggested by the Leader of the Opposition in the
other place, but, when he suggested it in May of last year,
the government labelled the idea silly, too complicated,
impossible to administer. Then, in September, they adopted it as their own. Their action was obviously borne of the
instinct for survival.
The last session also saw introduced two bills on family
allowances. The government had indicated that it was
going to bring about a new system of family allowances
beginning on January 1 of this year. Yet, in September,
again because it felt a threat to its continued existence as
a government, the Trudeau administration brought in an
interim measure increasing the family allowance to a flat
$12 per month, pending the passage of Bill C-211.
Honourable senators will surely recall other instances
when the government indulged in some unprincipled
about-faces for the sole purpose of maintaining itself in
power.
Bill C-192 provided for a reduction in income tax payable by corporations involved in manufacturing and processing activities. Because of NDP objections and Conservative reservations with respect to corporate tax
reductions, the government agreed to include a provision
whereby 60 members of the other place could force the
government to bring in a measure to meet the conclusion
of any resolution voted by that house.
Think of it, honourable senators: the government was
agreeing, in advance, to bring in and support legislation to
which it was opposed. Moreover, it was doing so in the
area of fiscal legislation which is the prerogative of the
government, and the government alone. This was a unique
example of spineless capitulation; another sad example of
chronic weakness and lack of direction. It was a most

SENATE DEBATES
shameful abdication of this government's responsibility
and authority under the Constitution.
Honourable senators surely will not have forgotten also
the indexing of personal exemptions in the calculation of
an individual's income tax to counter the outrageous
increases in the cost of living. That had been proposed as
long ago as 1971 by the Leader of the Opposition in the
other place. The government had ridiculed the idea then,
but what seems ridiculous when you are firmly in command very often becomes the epitome of good sense when
you are in danger of losing power.
Every once in a while, this administration makes a
pitiful attempt at showing that it is still aware of what is
going on, that it is still in command of the situation. Last
week's Throne Speech is an example of that. But nobody is
fooled. Everybody simply feels sorry for this government-the way one feels for a washed-up actor who
doesn't know enough to retire from the stage.
As I said, the government acted in a spineless fashion in
the last session, and I don't expect them to rediscover their
backbone in this one. After all, the political pressure that
will be exerted on them in this session is likely to be
greater than it was in the last.
David Lewis is not yet ready, but soon he will be
looking for an issue to justify his parting company with
Pierre Trudeau. The NDP cannot afford to wait until the
government, of its own volition, calls a general election.
They must, for the sake of convincing their supporters
that they are really different from the Liberals, continue
to apply pressure. They must find some issue, sacred or
not to the Socialists, and upon which the Liberals could
possibly be unwilling to prostitute themselves once more.
It will become increasingly difficult for the Prime Minister to temporize.
The only way in which the governnent can hope to
resist the blackmail of the NDP is for it to be in a position
to call an election on its own initiative. The government
must appear, for all the world, as though it were ready to
call an election at any time. Now, if the government can
pull that off, if they can convince the NDP that they are
not afraid of going to the polls, they will deserve an
Academy Award, because if any government ever had
good reason for staying out of an election this is it.
With inflation running wild, with the employment situation no better than it was a year ago, and with the many
other problems torturing us-most of them brought on by
this administration's ineptitude-an election for the government would be suicide. It will be very interesting
indeed to watch the government squirm for as long as this
session may last.
Honourable senators, obviously inflation remains Canada's major difficulty. We are no better off now, at the
beginning of 1974, than we were at the beginning of 1973.
The cost of living rose by 5.1 per cent in 1972. It rose by 9.1
per cent in 1973. This represents an increase of 80 per cent
over the previous year. The present inflation rate is more
than three times what it was in 1971. It is four times the
average inflation rate for the past sixty years. We have
one of the highest inflation rates in the industrialized
world. Despite the government's claim that this is an
international problem, there is no doubt that a large part
IHon. Mr. Flynn.]

March 5, 1974

of that increase was domestically induced, and yet you
will remember that Mr. Trudeau in December 1971 spoke
of having licked inflation.
The inflation rate for the third quarter of 1973 was 8.2
per cent. Research has shown conclusively that 5.2 per
cent was domestically induced. So the government's claim,
repeated in last Wednesday's Throne Speech, that we are
inflating because the whole world is inflating is simply
not true.
For the record, I think it is useful to note that food
prices increased by 8.6 per cent in 1972 while in 1973 they
increased by 17 per cent-practically a 100 per cent
increase in 1973 over the preceding year. Housing went up
by 5 per cent in 1972, by 7.2 per cent in 1973. A house today
costs 72 per cent more than it did in 1968. Clothing was up
by 3.1 per cent in 1972, and by 7.3 per cent in 1973. Here
again we have an increase of over 100 per cent in the
inflation rate.
The OECD predicts that our 1974 inflation rate will
exceed the incredible rate we reached in 1973. That means
we are headed for an inflation rate in excess of 10 per cent
per annum. No economy can long survive that kind of
inflation. The economic bubble is bound to burst.
The OECD suggests that we need a concerted program
of price and wage controls. But this government, as you
will have noticed in the Throne Speech, stubbornly
refuses to accept that this approach has any validity. The
government continues to look upon inflation as a rather
theoretical problem. Not everybody is affected in the same
way by inflation, but surely no less than 80 per cent of the
population can escape being seriously and adversely
affected by an inflation rate which hovers somewhere
around 10 per cent per annum.
Nobody can escape being influenced by an increase of 17
per cent in the cost of food-25 per cent in the last two
years. Everybody has to eat, and the cruel part about this
is that those least able to defend themselves against
increases in the cost of living have to take their lumps just
like the rest. The poor, those on fixed incomes-no special
protection is afforded them. No wonder they are frustrated. No wonder they are angry and bitter. They have
nowhere to turn. And always this cancer of inflation is
eating away at their economic security.
A taxpayer having a taxable income of $12,000 in 1973
lost, for all practical purposes, a purchase value of
$1,092.00 on account of inflation. Yet, to add insult to
injury, the government comes along and taxes him on the
full amount of $12,000. This is true despite the amendments made to the income tax legislation providing for an
adjustment in the personal exemptions based on the
increases in the cost of living.
The only one gaining from this intolerable inflation is
the government. Indexing notwithstanding, the tax
moneys keep flowing in. We know, for instance, that last
year the Minister of Finance anticipated a deficit of some
$400 million, and despite the fact that he added over $1
billion for social security the deficit will be just over or
around $300 million this year.
Those whose incomes have kept abreast of inflation, as a
result of which they do not feel too victimized or threatened, should have a look at their savings. If their money is

March 5, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

invested in bonds, they will surely have noticed that they
have lost practically as much as they have earned. Inflation rates have consistently outpaced interest rates. And
that does not take into consideration the fact that they
have had to pay interest on their earnings.
Further, if by any chance their investment has increased
in value to a level equal to the increase in the cost of
living, they are bound eventually to pay a capital gains
tax. This is so despite the fact that the increase in value is
merely a paper gain.
It is estimated that Canadians lost 10 per cent in investment savings alone last year. Now, there is an alarming
situation! Mr. Average Canadian, who has sweated his
guts out for 20 years to build up a modest bankroll, is now
forced to sit back and watch his life's savings melt away
on the pyre of inflation. How long will Canadians have to
put up with that? How long must we be forced to watch all
we have worked for go up in smoke? And how long can
this government continue to refuse to take positive and
comprehensive action?
The only measures the government has taken to date
have been measures forced upon it by the Opposition. But
these increases in welfare payments and selected tax cuts
have been purely defensive measures calculated only to
lessen the effects of the skyrocketing cost of living. The
government has yet to offer us a comprehensive prograrn
of anti-inflation measures. I am not talking about palliatives. I am talking about a positive frontal attack upon the
roots of inflation.
The government has failed to deal with the root causes
of inflation. The money supply continues to inflate. It has
doubled since Mr. Trudeau took office. Excessive government spending continues unabated, as has been shown by
the tabling of the estimates for the year 1974-75. The total
is up 20 per cent in the current year alone. And oppressive
rates of taxation are maintained.
The Progressive Conservative Party has enunciated a
series of proposals to fight inflation:
(a) It would bring in tax cuts. It would remove the
federal tax on building materials and on clothing for
everyone. It would also reduce taxes on personal
income.
(b) It would make sure that all its policies on
economic growth, regional development, foreign
investment, international trade, science and technology, were devised with a view to creating a maximum
of new jobs. This would be a major consideration.
*

(2030)

(c) It would not shrink, if the cost of living continued to increase, from the responsibility to impose
temporary price and wage controls rather than impose
yet higher levels of unemployment.
I am aware of all the arguments which have been made
against price and wage controls. But the most significant
of these, I submit to you, are only valid if you believe that
an inflation rate of 10 per cent per annum is merely a
temporary phenomenon. There will be nothing temporary
about galloping inflation rates as long as we have this
kind of administration mismanaging the economy.
I remember a speech by Senator Everett in which he
argued that the mere enunciation of a policy of price and

wage controls would provoke immediate increases in
prices. I find this argument amusing because I look at the
same facts as Senator Everett and come up with a completely different conclusion.
I am firmly convinced that the present government's
attitude towards price and wage controls, its utter refusal
to even consider the possibility of such a program, is a
clearer and more direct invitation to price increases. The
producer doesn't feel at all threatened. He knows that he
can jack up his prices as much as he wants. The government will simply not intervene. I am convinced that this
do-nothing attitude of the government is doing more to
fuel inflation than anything else.
Senator Perrault is also against price and wage controls.
He points out that in the United States and Great Britain,
they have been totally ineffective. I disagree completely.
If these measures had not been resorted to in the United
States and Great Britain, we, who trade extensively with
these nations, would have been worse hit by that part of
our inflation which is imported. I want to remind Senator
Perrault and the rest of you that in Great Britain, not only
the Conservative Party favoured such controls but also
the Liberal Party.
Now, let us turn to the Speech from the Throne and see
how the government plans to control inflation. The Speech
from the Throne says that ".... the Government's policy
in dealing with inflation will be to step in, as it has done
in the past, and take specific measures to increase the
supply of certain goods and services." The operative words
there are that the government will "step in." That is the
story behind this whole sorry economic mess that we have
on our hands. This government has stepped in too often to
do precisely the wrong thing.
The business community is frightened of this government. It never knows what to expect next. The threat of
even greater, more frustrating and stultifying government
intervention always looms on the horizon. It is not the sort
of atmosphere that you would call encouraging to
entrepreneurs.
In the Throne Speech, the government informed us that
what was needed to control inflation was a healthy
increase in production. For once they are right. But these
are the same people speaking who just a few years ago
were paying Western farmers not to produce. It is amazing
what time and a near-defeat at the polls can bring about.
We have been saying it for years and I repeat it now: one
of the best methods of fighting the present inflation,
intensified as it is by rising energy costs, is expansion in
the ability to produce. Supply is what should preoccupy
us, not the demand side of the equation. Production can be
most efficiently and most effectively increased by simply
assuring the entrepreneurs a rate of return that makes
investment in expanded production worthwhile. That's
the key. Make it possible for the producer to turn an
interesting profit and he will produce all that is required.
Production is down today because there is not enough
money to be made. Producers are being strangled by taxes,
to say nothing of tiresome government interference.
If this government wants to fight inflation by increasing
production, why does it not proceed logically and reduce
corporate taxes? But, above all, let us have no more hypo-

SENATE DEBATES
crisy. This government bas a record of speaking with great
fervour of its concern for small business. But in the recent
past, it has turned around and increased income taxes by 7
per cent for 90 per cent of small businesses.
What we need are real honest-to-God decreases in taxes
for all productive industries. And we need tax decreases
also for the private individual. We must permit him to
retain more of his income so he can invest it in Canadian
industries and participate actively in relaunching our
marooned economy.
I repeat: if we are going to control inflation, the government must be ready to curb the money supply, drastically
reduce its own spending, and seriously reduce taxation.
But there are no commitments along these lines to be
found in the Speech from the Throne. All you find there is
a desperate wringing of hands. The government repeats,
ad nausearn, that it can do nothing about controlling the
rise in prices because all this is due to an international
situation over which it says it has no control. That is just
so much rubbish.
Now, let us consider a related problem: unemployment.
Here again we have a situation which is worsening. In
1973, the percentage of unemployed was 5.6 per cent, and
the projection for 1974 is 6.5 per cent. In December 1973,
unemployment in the Maritimes was 9.2 per cent and in
Newfoundland it was 14.8 per cent.
The unemployment insurance is costing taxpayers more
and more while at the same time becoming less and less
efficient. There is general agreement that the whole
system should be investigated and reviewed. During the
last session the government introduced Bill C-125, which
would have altered the qualifications to receive benefits.
But then it did not dare bring it to a decision by the house,
probably because it feared again that the NDP would have
withdrawn its support. The Minister of Manpower has
agreed that the system is open to abuses, and probably
that is why, while there are hundreds of thousands unemployed, employers still have trouble finding people to fill
jobs.
The only efficient way to fight unemployment is to help
create good-paying jobs. The only way people will be
enticed into working is if there is more money in it, after
taxes, than there is in unemployment insurance and
welfare.
It should be the task of government, in promoting Canada's economic growth, to encourage a climate in which
initiative and incentives can operate for the good of the
individual and society. It is essential, honourable senators,
that the level of Canadian economic activity be accelerated at a rate which generates the new jobs and production
required by our expanding labour force and increasing
population. It is essential to close the present gap between
potential and actual GNP. We must stop wasting the
potential and ability of all those Canadians who are presently unemployed.
Government must end its war of attrition against the
private sector. Our primary goal must be to encourage
initiative and productivity. There is nothing unholy about
profits, and nothing inhuman about the free market. Profits are what make the achievement of social and economic
goals possible. But I doubt that this government is the one
[Hon. Mr. Flynn.]

March 5, 1974

to create the atmosphere conducive to economic growth. It
alternately flirts with private enterprise and socialism.
Such an ambivalent posture does not serve to encourage
and reassure entrepreneurs.
a (2040)

I looked in vain through this Throne Speech for new
ideas with regard to f ighting unemployment. Apart f rom a
determination to see production increased, which is bound
to increase jobs, the rest is all window-dressing, the same
silly platitudes no more impressive now than they ever
were.
The Throne Speech speaks of " ... developing a community employment policy in a social security context for
those Canadians who have particular and continuing difficulty in getting and keeping employment." This sounds
like a cop-out.
I have the distinct impression that some statistics are
going to be swept under the rug. Those whom this government has been most unsuccessful in placing in jobs, it will
now try to have removed from the labour force. Very neat,
and completely in keeping with the Prime Minister's
philosophy that if some people do not want to work,
Canadians should be open minded and magnanimous
enough to agree to support them. This is not new as an
idea. Welfare statists have been peddling that notion for
years, and I am convinced that it is all wrong. both
morally and economically. We want to see everyone
actively engaged in bettering Canadian lives. The government's attitude, as I see it, will merely encourage those in
society who have parasitic tendencies.
I come to the problem of energy. The energy crisis or
so-called crisis has probably been welcomed by the government, and it would not surprise me to learn that the
government had exaggerated its importance. It had good
reason to want to direct our attention away from inflation.
Or maybe it was seeking to provoke a confrontation-one
which might ripen into an election issue. In fact, we have
not been short of oil or gas, nor does it appear that we will
run short in the near future. The problem which has been
highlighted by the decision of the Arab states is not new
to Canada. We have for many years considered the question of being self-sufficient by extending the crude oil
pipeline to Montreal. In fact, in 1967, the Progressive
Conservative Party suggested that extension, and repeated it a year ago. The idea was ridiculed by the government.
The federal-provincial
conference on the matter
revealed, without the shadow of a doubt, that the government has had no energy policy. It was unable to offer
leadership. It shirked its responsibility. It sadly lacked in
foresight. By acting on a day-to-day basis, the government
increased the climate of uncertainty and alienated the
West more than ever.
By the way, speaking of alienation of the West, the
Prime Minister said the other day that the main reason for
this was the absence of Liberal representation in the
House of Commons. In other words, the Prime Minister
says the alienation of the West is not due to him, but to the
West, which does not give him enough support.
If that is the only problem, then, quite obviously, what
is needed is a change of government, unless Mr. Trudeau
believes, as did Mackenzie King, that a Liberal govern-

ment is essential to Canada's welfare and that only the
present party-I am speaking of the present party of Mr.
Trudeau, because he had had another one before-is able
to give the country good government.
The government announced in the Throne Speech that it
". ..must ensure that a sufficient part of the funds generated by higher prices will be used for exploration and
development." That smells a lot like the threat of further
intervention on the part of this government-further selfdefeating controls with only nuisance value.
For the government to say that it will have to see to this
itself as though it might have to undertake to explore and
expand that particular industry, is utter nonsense. The
government has no expertise in this area. The Special
Senate Committee on Science Policy in one of its reports
warned against just that eventuality. Government bas no
business getting actively involved in the petroleum industry. The Throne Speech speaks of the government's wanting "...

to create a national petroleum company which

will assure greater Canadian presence and participation"
in exploration and development. That is more statist nonsense. Again the government goes into competition with
private enterprise. And again the taxpayer will be suffered to pick up the deficits as he has in the past. So
honourable senators will excuse me if I can't work up any
enthusiasm for the governme'nt's plan for solving our
energy problem.
I come now to the last part of my speech-the last but
not the least, since I wish to devote it to the Senate. We al
know that the Senate does not, in general, get a good
press. As a matter of fact, it gets very little press at all. We
are also aware that there is a body of opinion which holds
that an unelected Senate is an anachronism in modern
society. However, I am convinced that if the question were
put squarely to the Canadian people, a majority would
continue to favour reform over abolition of this body.
Reform is what we need, and good ideas are not lacking.
Many of the recommendations made in the report of the
Special Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Commons on the Constitution of Canada are excellent and
could be implemented without amendment to the B.N.A.
Act. One of these bas to do with the membership.
Recommendation 39 reads as follows:
All Senators should continue to be appointed by the
Federal Government: as vacancies occur in the
present Senate, one-half of the Senators from each
Province and Territory should be appointed in the
same manner as at present; the other half from each
Province and Territory should be appointed by the
Federal Government from a panel of nominees submitted by the appropriate Provincial or Territorial
Government.
Now, this proposition stemmed from the fact that two
roles were intended for the Senate by the Fathers of
Confederation: 1. Protection of provincial, minority or
regional rights; 2. The review of legislation by giving it a
"sober second thought." However, there was another and
much more important reason behind this recommendation.
The report did not spell it out because that might have
been considered indiscreet. The reason is this: for the past
30 years or more, the Senate bas been as close to being a
one-party bouse as is possible in a country which consid-

ers itself democratic. The Senate bas, for over a quarter of
a century, had huge Liberal majorities. There has been an
imbalance in the representation of public opinion, which is
dangerous for a chamber of this nature. Canadians of all
political persuasions should be represented in the Senate
in the same proportion, or as near to it as possible, as they
are represented in the House of Commons. At the beginning of the last session we welcomed to this chamber five
new senators. One of them was Senator Martial Asselin
and he was the first to take a seat with the official
Opposition since 1963. Since those appointments, five more
senators have been summoned to this place and seated on
the government side. The present standing in this place, I
remind you, is: Liberals, 75; Conservatives, 17; Social
Credit, 1; and Independents, 2. The point I want to make
again is that it is becoming increasingly difficult for the
official Opposition, as well as for the Senate as a whole, to
discharge properly its constitutional duties, and the main
problem is this lopsided membership.
*

(2050)

At one time it was thought that the present Prime
Minister had adopted a policy whereby a certain proportion of the appointments to this chamber would be supporters of the official Opposition and other parties represented in the House of Commons, or a number of
independents representing large segments of the population. Many in the ranks of the official Opposition resigned
in the hope that the vacancies created would be filled by
PC supporters. They were not. Some of those I lead would
consider resigning even today, if they could hope to be
replaced by someone supporting the official Opposition.
Honourable senators must also bear in mind that apart
from Senator Asselin all those sitting on this side were
summoned to the Senate more than 10 years ago. Therefore, our average age is higher than that on the government side, and this is an additional handicap to the huge
difference in numbers.
This problem would not be so acute if there had developed within the huge majority of government supporters a
real internal opposition. This would have helped the
Senate to look at legislation with a critical eye, a task
which it is the Senate's duty to perform. Some Liberal
senators have been known to "lose their cool" and disagree
with the government. But that sort of eccentric behaviour
bas always met with disapproving scowls from the government benches. Consequently, only very infrequent and
sporadic has been the criticism of government legislation
emanating from the benches opposite.
In the last 15 years or so, the Senate has assumed an
increasingly important investigative role. Our committees
have been very active and extremely efficient in this role,
especially when matters dealt with were of a non-partisan
nature. For example, the Senate bas done excellent work
in the areas of science policy, poverty, economic growth,
employment and price stability, the Constitution, the
study of tax bills, et cetera. We have the right to be proud
of what we have accomplished in this area. However, by
our giving too much importance to this investigative role,
the people may be led to forget that our first responsibility, and by far the more important, is the review of
legislation.

SENATE DEBATES
I have witnessed this myself. The public tends to forget
that the Senate has to pass all bills in the sane manner as
does the House of Commons. People know about the
reports of special or standing committees of the Senate,
but I worry that they do not know that we can amend or
refuse to pass any piece of legislation.
I have criticized the fact that we are always invited by
the Leader of the Government-and in this he is supported by the majority around him-to adopt quickly all of the
government's legislation. I am deeply convinced that we
are wrong in so doing. We are wrong in not taking more
time, in all circumstances, to consider the bills that come
to us. I do not mean that we should have ta debate
legislation for days and days, as they do in the other place.
Very often the debates in the other place do not, in
themselves, mean much, and it is a way for that house to
take time to reflect and make up its mind. We should give
ourselves time to think. We should delay for a few days,
and occasionally for a week or more, the passage of a bill.
Above all, we should always observe our rules.
I am becoming increasingly opposed to the idea of
giving leave to proceed with second reading of a bill
immediately after it reaches the Senate. I suggest that
leave to set aside the rules of the Senate should not be
granted except in situations of extreme urgency. Certainly
we should never again adopt the resolution which was
forced upon us at the end of last session, dispensing with
the two-day and one-day notice for second and third reading of a bill. This is a subtle form of closure which is
entirely out of place in this chamber. The question of
whether such a policy would require an adjustment in our
timetable is a minor consideration. I suggest that too often
we have appeared to be interested primarily in getting the
work over with and going home as quickly as possible.
Also, it is most illogical ta do what we have been doing
consistently in recent years-coming here in anticipation
of the passage of some bill by the other place in order to be
ready to rubber-stamp it. That is demeaning. It has always
annoyed me to see the government leader hold out the
carrot of an adjournment if we agree to pass government
legislation quickly.
i invite honourable senators to consider, as an example
of what I am suggesting, the case of the amendment made
to the wiretapping bill. I do not intend to discuss the merit
of the amendment which was made by the committee
headed by Senator Goldenberg. I merely wish to point out
that when the report of the committee came before the
Senate, following the practice favoured by the Leader of
the Covernment, the chairman moved that the report be,
with leave, adopted immediately.
Leave was granted-and I share in the responsibility of
the whole Senate for that mistake--and third reading of
the bill, as amended, was given immediately. The message
was sent that very day to the House of Commons that we
had passed the bill with one amendment-an amendment
which went squarely against the views of the majority in
the other place, even though it was favourable ta the
viewpoint of the government, and especially of the Minister of Justice.
I venture to say that the large majority here did not
know what the amendment was all about. If we had
followed our rules, the report of the committee would not
(Hon. Mr. Flynn.]

March 5, 1974

have been adopted on the day it came from the committee. It would have been printed in the Debates of the
Senate, and would have been considered by honourable
senators. Those senators who had not been at the committee meeting would have had time to assess the implication
of the amendment, and the Senate as a whole would have
had time to get some feedback from the House of Commons. The report could have been debated for a day or
two, or there could have been a postponement to the next
week, since there was no urgency about this matter.
Such a delay could have provided us with the opportunity to alter our report in order to make the amendment
more palatable to the House of Commons. I have in mind
the amendment which was proposed subsequently by
Senator Carter, and which apparently was acceptable at
that time to the Opposition in the other place, as well as to
the government. By proceeding as quickly as we did, we
merely provoked a confrontation rather than a conference,
and we lost entirely the merit that we would have earned
had we been able to amend the bill in a way that would
have made it acceptable to the other place.
The one thing I know for sure is that if the attitude of
the House of Commons towards the amendment made by
the Senate had been considered on any day other than a
Saturday, and without the deadline of having royal assent
on January 14, it would have been much casier to consider
the possibility of a conference. Such a conference would
most likely have resulted in acceptance by the House of
the amendment moved by Senator Carter, which was
debated on Friday and Saturday, January 11 and 12. The
amendment was defeated for fear it would not be accepted
by the House of Commons, and also because the Senate
appeared to believe that a decision had to be made no later
than Saturday, January 12. The safer course to follow, as
was suggested by the Leader of the Government and
others supporting him, was to advise the other place that
the Senate would not insist on its amendment.
For once in the session the Senate had adopted an
amendment to a bill. But we lost it. We were not overruled
by the Commons. We forced ourselves into submission by
our own ineptitude. This would not have happened-it
would never happen again, and we would be much more
inclined to make amendments-if we were allowed to
work at a more normal pace; if we were not always forced
to come here in anticipation of legislation and blackmailed
into going home as quickly as possible.
Of course, I am rather skeptical that my ideas will be
readily accepted by the government leader-or by the
majority of the government supporters, for that matter. I
have a hunch, however, that if there is a change of government, and if the majority is forced to sit on the left side of
the Speaker, that same majority will reverse its attitude. I
point out to honourable senators on the other side that if
they wait until then, it will only prove that they are now
more concerned with the fate of the government than with
that of the Senate.

[Translation]
Honourable senators, before resuming my seat-and I
am aware it is time to do so-I would like to come back to
the Speech from the Throne for a moment.

March 5,1974

EBATES
SENATE D:

In less controversial and contentious areas than inflation, unemployment and energy, the government has promised numerous pieces of legislation; for instance,
measures aimed at putting an end to any unfair distinction in rail tariffs-a rather vague term; a new port policy;
the creation of a centre for the development of urban
transport; numerous amendments to the statutes of
Canada in order to ensure equality of treatment to women,
and a host of amendments to various acts.
In the light of the experience gathered from the previous session it is difficult to imagine how the government
will succeed in having Parliament pass more than a handful of the bills mentioned in the Speech from the Throne.
The last session has shown that it is not the government,
but rather the NDP which takes the initiative and determines the legislative program of Parliament.
It is clear that Mr. Lewis wants to do again what he did
last session and to get angry at more or less regular
intervals in order to force the government to introduce
minor bills which will enable him to continue to claim
that a minority government under his wing is the best
solution for Canadians.
This situation remains nothing short of strange and
illogical. How long will the government let the business of
Parliament, indeed the nation's business, be controlled by
a slight minority of members? Will they let 31 members,
representing 17 per cent of the electorate, call the tune for
more than 230 members chosen by 80 per cent of the
electors?
A change is imperative in the House of Commons and it
will come only with a new general election. In the interest
of the country, I hope it will come soon.

[English]
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: Before the Leader of the Government rises to speak, I wonder if I may be allowed ta ask a
question of Senator Flynn.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Or two.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: Just one. The Leader of the Opposition, during the course of his address, made the serious
chargeHon. Mr. Asselin: Give your leader a chance to speak.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: I am merely going to
question.

Hon. Mr. Walker: Well, why don't you?
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: You are making a speech. Ask the
question.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: I have only just stood up. The
Leader of the Opposition has made a charge against the
government of serious mismanagement of the economy in
so f ar as f ood prices are concerned. He referred to the fact
that food prices rose 17 per cent during the past year. My
question is: Do I gather from the comments of the Leader
of the Opposition that he and his party begrudge the
farmers of Canada a return on their investment of capital
and labour that will finally give them adequate recompense, and make up for the many years when they sold
their products, very often, at less than the cost of
production?

27

Hon. Mr. Flynn: The interpretation put on my remarks
by the honourable senator is entirely wrong. I suggest that
he read my speech tomorrow, at which time he might
possibly understand it.
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, at the opening
of this new session of Parliament may I extend to Madam
Speaker our assurance of confidence in her and the charming and able way in which she presides over our affairs.
Madam Speaker, you bring honour and credit to the
Senate.
I agree with Cheryl Hawkes of the Canadian Press who,
in writing about our proceedings, said of Madam Speaker:
Close friends say she is obviously in her element,
meeting and bringing people together with ber warm
and likeable personality. She looks younger and
healthier as Speaker, they say, than she did when
serving on Senate committees, making trips to China,
Hungary, Africa or Washington with parliamentary
delegations and speaking to groups across the country.
Their Excellencies Governor General and Mrs. Michener
have departed from Rideau Hall after seven years of active
and dedicated service to the Crown and to Canada.
Roland Michener, a former Member of the House of
Commons, later its Speaker, succeeded the late Georges
Vanier as Governor General of Canada. He did not come
directly to the office of Governor General from the political arena. After he left the House of Commons he was
invited to join Canada's diplomatic service, and served
with distinction as our ambassador in Delhi, India.
Canadians have extended to the Micheners their appreciation and high regard for the service rendered while they
were at Rideau Hall. When we thank Mr. Michener, we
add our warmest thanks to his wife, whom we know for
her interest in so many enterprises and, more particularly,
if I may say so, for her interest in Thomistic philosophy as
a student at the Medieval Institute under the eminent
Professor Etienne Gilson.

[Translation]
The New Governor General, His Excellency Jules Léger,
delivered the Speech from the Throne at the opening of
the second session of the 29th Parliament of Canada.
Having been acquainted with His Excellency for many
years, I can speak advisedly about him. As pointed out by
the Leader of the Opposition, he has a wide experience in
several fields; he was a newspaperman; he filled several
key posts in the civil service, more especially in two
departments, External Affairs and Secretary of State. His
very extensive knowledge will be quite useful in the
carrying out of his new duties. He was ambassador of
Canada in Mexico, Italy, France and Belgium. In short, he
will fill with dignity the high office entrusted to him by
Her Majesty the Queen on the government advice.
Mrs. Léger who is well known for ber charm, her personality and her graciousness will be a valuable support
for her husband who will be called to travel throughout
Canada.
The former Governor General, the late Georges Vanier,
has shown the importance of Canadian unity. His Excellency the Governor General will contribute to the understanding and the greatness of our Confederation proceed-

groups making up the large Canadian family.
Canada is proud, and duly so, of the prominence and
authority of the Supreme Court of Canada. On the occasion of the early retirement of the Rt. Hon. Chief Justice
Gérald Fauteux, I wish to commend him. with gratitude
and admiration, for his truly great contribution to the
Supreme Court of Canada.

He has been succeeded by Mr. Justice Bora Laskin
whose work in the fields of civil rights and constitutional
law has given a special quality to his reputation. The
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, as Deputy
of His Excellency the Governor General, will command
our respect.
[Translation]
May I point out to you that there are now in the Senate
four former provincial premiers, two from Nova Scotia,
one from New Brunswick and another from Alberta. These
senators, with their vast experience, will make a significant contribution to our provincially oriented debates.
Surely this is one of the reasons that brought about the
establishment of this House. One of these honourable
senators, the Honourable Louis Robichaud served his
province for ten years; last Thursday, he moved the adoption of the Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne. His speech was a masterpiece as the Leader of the
Opposition called it, and I am sure that he made as good an
impression on you as he did on me. Therefore, I extend to
him my warmest congratulations and I am convinced that
we can depend on his active and constructive contribution.
The honourable senator, a native of New Brunswick,
belongs to that admirable group of Canadians, the Acadians, of whom he is one of the most distinguished.
[English]
Professor Kunz, whom I regard as the great champion
outside the Senate of this House of Parliament, when he
wrote his book on the Senate, said that some 37 per cent of
the Senate of that day had legislative experience in the
House of Commons or in provincial legislatures before
coming to the Senate. I should think that the percentage
continues to be approximately the same.
I have mentioned that Senator Robichaud was a provincial premier. The seconder of the motion before us, Senator Perrault, has had experience in the House of Commons, and as leader of his party he served with great
ability in the Legislature of British Columbia. In seconding Senator Robichaud's motion, Senator Perrault gave us
a vigorous account of government policy. He dealt-I
thought, frankly and completely-with what is called the
problem of Western alienation. This was not Senator Perrault's first speech in the Senate, but it was one of his best
and strongest.
The Leader of the Opposition clearly established this
evening that he does not agree with the Government of
Canada. Let there be no doubt that he stands foremost in
this house in his opposition to the government of our
country. He made that very clear in what he had to say
about unemployment, inflation, loss of income-indeed,
about almost every kind of action that a government these
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

March 5, 1974

days is obliged to consider. I want him to know that he
convinced me, without any reservation, that he does not
share my conviction that this government is not a bad
administration.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I am very happy.
Hon. Mr. Martin: He spoke of the economy and the loss
of income and I want to deal with these matters, not in a
political way but as factually as I can.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: You couldn't.
Hon. Mr. Martin: What is the real situation with regard
to the economy, with regard to the matter of disposable
income? The growth of the economy this year has been
stronger than at any time since 1956, despite its interruption in the third quarter by work stoppages. Real national
output increased at an annual rate of 7.1 per cent, well
over the long-term potential growth rate of around 5¼/per
cent.
Real personal income at the disposal of Canadians-that
is, income not before but after payment of direct taxes,
and after taking full account of the decline in purchasing
power of the dollar caused by inflation-increased by an
average of 6.8 per cent on a per capita basis, following
already substantial increases of 6.7 per cent in 1972 and 5.9
per cent in 1971. This, despite the sharp increase in the
cost of living that has taken place.
This significant rise in personal income is the result of
several factors. The substantial cut, equivalent to 12-13 per
cent, in personal income taxes, provided for in the budget
of a year ago, is one factor, although Senator Flynn made
no reference at all to that.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I did.
Hon. Mr. Martin: There is the extraordinary increase in
the number of Canadians at work, the sharply increased
farm income, the increased social assistance, and the
rising productivity of the economy as a whole.
It is significant that the increase in the per capita
disposable income for Canadians in 1973 was exactly 50
per cent more than that enjoyed by individuals in the
United States, and that since 1971 disposable income available to Canadians has increased at twice the rate for the
United States.
Senator Flynn spoke of employment. Let us examine
what the situation is. During this last year a greater
number of new jobs was created in Canada than ever
before in our history. Employment was up by 430,000, a
record 5.2 per cent increase over last year, which is almost
25 per cent higher than the previous peak of growth in job
creation of 4.2 per cent achieved in 1966.
In some regions of the country, notably the Atlantic
Provinces, Quebec and British Columbia, the growth of
employment has exceeded all previous records. It was
nearly 6.5 per cent in the Atlantic Provinces, which was
more than twice the employment growth in 1972 and more
than four times that in 1971. Quebec registered an employment increase of 5.8 per cent, more than four times the
rate of growth in 1972. The rate of increase in employment
in British Columbia was 6.6 per cent.
For a number of years Canada has had the fastest
growing labour force in the industrial world. During the
past year Canadians have been pouring into the labour

March 5, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

market at a considerably greater rate than ever before,
largely in response to the new job opportunities which are
being created by an admitted rapidly expanding economy.
There was a record increase in the labour force nationally
of 4.4 per cent, for a total of 388,000. This was significantly
higher than the previous peak increase of 3.9 per cent in
1957 and 1966. In the Atlantic provinces the growth in the
labour force was considerably higher than the national
rate at 6.3 per cent, leaving the level of unemployment
there virtually unchanged.
* (2120)

In every other region unemployment levels declined.
Nationally, the average rate of unemployment in 1973
declined to 5.6 per cent from an average of 6.3 per cent in
1972-admittedly still too high. No one wants unemployment, but no one can deny the buoyancy of our economy.
No one can deny that the work force bas increased to the
extent that I have indicated, and the prospects for the
economy in 1974 do not fit in with the pessimistic portrayal made by the Leader of the Opposition who, as I say,
stated unequivocally and demonstrably his opposition to
the present Government of Canada.
The growth in our exports, which last year increased at
a post-war record rate of 22.3 per cent compared to 9.9 per
cent in 1972, will be more moderate, admittedly, than was
otherwise expected, because of slower growth in the
economies of our major trading partners who are so
dependent-much more than we are-on imported energy.
But the prospects for 1974 certainly do not warrant the
pessimistic view taken by the Leader of the Opposition.
The same is true of the prospects for capital investment.
A substantial increase of capital investment in new productive facilities is needed to expand the output of equipment and material currently in short supply, and this is
taking place.
Business capital investment in 1973 increased in real
terms, after discounting price increases, by 11.7 per centmore than four times that in 1972. Housing investments
rose 20.9 per cent in value and 8.8 per cent in volume in
1973. A survey of 200 of the largest corporations published
in November projects a 21 per cent increase in investment
machinery and construction in 1974-a 46.5 per cent
increase for manufacturing alone.
These figures which were given out by Statistics
Canada a few weeks ago do not support the contention of
the Leader of the Opposition in the vigorous and comprehensive speech he made tonight. He spoke of inflationand one expected that he would speak of inflation-which
is perhaps our most serious problem, but not a problem
that is peculiar to us. Everyone in the world at the present
time is the victim of inflation. It is one of our first
concerns, and it is one of the great preoccupations of the
government and of Canadians generally at the moment. It
is a serious problem not only for developed countries like
the United States, Great Britain, France and Canada, but
also for the underdeveloped countries that are the
beneficiaries of so much of our external aid.
What has the government done to try to meet the problem of distributing as fairly as possible the burdens of
inflation? The Leader of the Opposition did not, I think,
do himself justice tonight, because one would almost conclude from what he said that the government was not

concerned about the problem; that it had done little to try
to provide even mitigation let alone something that might
approach a solution. Well, here are some of the things it
has done.
It has increased pensions and family allowances, and
has tied both to the cost of living. If that was a suggestion
made by the Leader of the Opposition in the other place, it
does not destroy the validity of what the government has
now done. Parties, no matter where they sit, whether they
are on the government or on the opposition side, are
expected to put forward good proposals, and a government
which accepts good proposals put forward by opposition
parties is only doing its duty-although I am not so sure
that that was the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition in the other place.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Very subtle!
Hon. Mr. Martin: We have given subsidies to reduce
increases in the price of bread and milk although, admittedly, there are indications today that there may be a rise
of perhaps three cents, or whatever is proposed, by some
bread companies.
The government has indexed personal income taxes. It
has protected the domestic pretoleum market from worldwide distortions. It has brought about a reduction in the
price of many goods to the consumer through tariff and
other trade policies.
The Prime Minister denies that the cost of labour has
been the dominant factor in the present rise of prices.
Certainly during the most recent period labour has not
used its power to impose an unjust economic burden on
the rest of the Canadian people.
The world economy, as I say, has felt the effect of this
current rise in the cost of living. Whatever may have been
our contribution to the cause of inflation, how could
Canada possibly be immune from this worldwide economic situation when it is realized that more than one-fifth of
our gross annual product comes from foreign trade? In
comparison with other industrialized countries, our record
has been a little better than the average during the past
four years. Our dollar is strong. Our currency is sought
after. This is a reflection of the strength of our economy.
Last week Statistics Canada published figures which
show that the rate of real growth in 1973 in Canada was
the highest in 17 years. Now surely that means something.
Last year in Canada more jobs were created, as I showed a
few moments ago, than at any time in our history.
There is no doubt that strong action-even stronger
action, if you will, if this is available-against inflation
has to be pursued along a wide front. We must continue to
help pensioners and low-income families, the most vulnerable, in their f ight against the effects of inflation.
The government will continue to apply selective measures intended to reduce the impact of inflation, if
required. I mentioned the indexing of income taxes, the oil
export tax, subsidies on certain consumer products such as
milk and bread, and controls on exports of certain products. We must continue, admittedly, to take appropriate
action to give the Canadian consumer an adequate, secure
and reasonably priced supply of those commodities. This is
certainly true of food and fuel, which we provide for both
our domestic and foreign markets. We will have to contin-

SENATE DEBATES
ue to pay top attention to removing unsettling fluctuations in the supply and price of our domestic products. The
Speech from the Throne provides measures that do these
very things.
We do not think wage and price controls will help.
Tonight again, just as the Leader of the Opposition in the
other place did, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate
came out for wage and price controls. He bas the right to
do that, but we have to examine what would be the effect
if we were to bring in a general system of wage and price
controls. Can we ignore the experience of other countries?
Can we ignore what the leading economists of the world
say about what we should do in this regard? Can we
ignore what a committee of this Senate found in 1971?
a (2130)

In the United States and the United Kingdom the
sources of supply were dried up by price controls. The
result was a temporary fixed price for scarce and sometimes unavailable products, followed by a breakaway rise
in price when the controls were removed. That is the fact.
We know from the political crisis in the United Kingdom
that that is the situation, as was admitted by Mr. Harold
Wilson two nights before the recent election in the United
Kingdom.
I have in my hand the report of the Standing Senate
Committee on National Finance entitled "Growth,
Employment and Price Stability", under the chairmanship
of Senator Everett, and the deputy chairmanship of Senator Molson. It will be remembered that a leading member
of the House of Commons, the financial critic for the
Opposition in the other place, was this committee's chief
economic counsel. This is what the committee concluded:
While we advocate one very special kind of incomes
policy for Canada we are in general deeply skeptical
about most varieties of controls, guide-lines and
incomes policies. Their historical record of effectiveness against inflation is poor, and they pose important
threats to personal freedom and economic dynamism.
They also tend to divert attention from more effective
anti-inflationary policies. Problems of public acceptability alone would militate against selective wageprice controls. The control system would likely be
either general in its application or a largely meaningless gesture. Controls are one of the least desirable of
all economic price stabilization tools. If they are used
at all in peacetime it should be on a short-term emergency basis.
That last sentence gives some comfort to my honourable
friend, but if he looks at the sentence carefully he will see
it begins, "If they are used at all..." The Committee
recommends against their use.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: That was in 1971, not in 1974.
Hon. Mr. Martin: All right. In 1971, nevertheless, we
were reminded in this very debate by the Leader of the
Opposition that inflation had been a serious problem for
some time, and that the government was doing little about
it.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: It was nothing compared to what we
have now.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Well, of course, the problem is serious.
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

March 5, 1974

I point out that the sharp rise that has taken place in
consumer prices over the past months is a matter of deep
concern to this government. We regard this as perhaps the
most serious problem facing Canada. We must, however,
look at the problem in the light of its world context, in the
light of the fact that we are a trading nation, in the light
of the fact that the Opposition and other political parties
and the people of Canada do not want us to resort once
again to tight money policies.
Although the results may be the same, the cause of
inflation varies considerably. The current inflationary
pressures are worldwide, as I said. They are worldwide in
origin, and they are generated by a unique combination of
international circumstances. For the first time, the economies of all the major industrial nations have surged forward simultaneously, and this in turn bas led to a rapid
and large increase in demand for a wide variety of internationally traded goods at a time when many of them are
in short supply as the result of various factors.
Food products are the most acute example of the adverse
impact of these forces. The output of many basic food
commodities was reduced substantially last year because
of poor harvest conditions in a number of countries. At the
same time, sharply rising incomes led to a substantial
increase in demand for foods of all kinds, particularly
wheat. Food costs, as a result, have climbed steeply,
accounting for some two-thirds of above average increase
in consumer prices among the 24 nations that make up the
Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition in his
speech.
In Canada and the United States the problem bas been
compounded by the significantly increased cost of many
imported goods caused by the substantial appreciation
during the past year of the currencies of a number of their
major trading partners. The problem has been further
intensified here in Canada by the adverse effect of the
renewed United States price freeze last summer, which
only served to reduce supplies and push up prices still
further, and by United States export controls on a number
of commodities.
It is the government's conviction-and it bas advice not
only from the Public Service but from other sources, such
as its contacts with other countries and other governments-that Canada, as a major international trading
nation, cannot expect to isolate itself from these worldwide inflationary forces by measures aimed at curbing
prices, which at the same time would not damage the
longer-term economic interests of the nation as a whole.
When the inflationary problem is caused by an international imbalance of supply and demand, the only solution
is to increase supply. This may not always have been
government policy, but it is now the right method.
Given the inescapable increases in the prices of oil, food
and other commodities, price stability might be partially
restored in the short run by lowering prices of other goods
and services. To achieve this by deflationary measures
would involve a degree of unemployment and a reduction
of real output which would be totally unacceptable to the
government and the people of Canada.
Long ago, I can tell the bouse, the government drew up a
plan for controlling prices and incomes as a matter of

March 5, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

contingency. Its assessment on repeated occasions has
been that controls, as suggested by the Leader of the
Opposition, could not be effective for any meaningful
period of time in holding back a worldwide inflationary
tide. They learned that in the most economically powerful
country in the world, the United States, where they have
abandoned their system of controls, as they did on Sunday
in Italy, and as they are doing in other countries. On the
contrary, the government concluded that by reducing the
supply of goods, controls could, in fact, do far more harm
than good by putting further upward pressure on prices.
This applies particularly to foods and industrial materials,
the major source of global inflationary pressures, which
are the least amenable to price controls.
Those who have tried controls have found them to be
significantly unsuccessful. The United States is now in
process of phasing out all price and wage controls, except
on health care and petroleum. They have proved to be not
only ineffective, but have had the reverse effect of
increasing inflationary pressures by creating shortages.
The British economy appears to be confronted by disaster
as a result of widespread labour strikes in opposition to
wage controls because of lack of adequate consensus.

In January, the year-by-year increase in the Canadian
Consumer Price Index of 9.1 per cent compares favourably
with the increase of 9.4 per cent in the United States and
12 per cent in Britain. In December, the rate was 10.3 per
cent for all OECD countries, illustrating beyond question
the international nature of inflation.
The Canadian government has already pressed forward
with those particular measures which are feasible in order
to slow the rise in prices and to provide relief for those
Canadians least able to protect themselves. It has already
implemented an impressive list of measures which fall
into this category and it has won commendation for
having provided the strongest and most solid program in
the estimation of the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development.
What has it done? Let me repeat.
It has indexed most of our social security payments,
including old age pensions and family allowances, to
protect the recipients against the effects of inflation.
It bas indexed tax exemptions and rate brackets to
eliminate the automatic tendency of taxes to take a
higher and higher fraction of people's real income
during periods of rising money wage rates.
It has reduced certain sales and import taxes, and
subsidized certain commodities of particular importance in the consumer budget thereby directly reducing their prices.
It bas set up the Food Prices Review Board to focus
public attention on pricing practices in food distribution. It has restrained the price of oil products sold in
the domestic market.
And above all it has encouraged an increase in the
supply of goods available to meet the extraordinary
growth in demand both at home and abroad, thus
attacking the problem at its roots.
Now, there are other matters I should like to be able to
deal with this evening but time does not permit. I have

asked Senator Langlois if he would mind, in his speech
tomorrow, dealing with the question of oil and he bas
kindly agreed to do so. I should like also to have dealt at
some length with the item in the Speech from the Throne
concerning the government's intentions in the field of
science. In this regard I would point out that on Friday
last, the Minister of State for Science, Mrs. Sauvé, paid
tribute to the work of Senator Lamontagne, Chairman of
the Special Senate Committee on Science Policy, and
other members of that committee. While I am sure that
Senator Lamontagne would hope that the government
would go further than it bas gone, the fact is that it has
made an important start, one that certainly reflects the
view of the committee itself, that is, that the government
must act as quickly as possible to eliminate uncertainty
and provide Canada with the federal institutions and
policies so badly needed to face the challenges posed by
technology and science for the seventies and over the long
term.
There are other matters dealt with in the Speech from
the Throne that one would like to mention, but as I have
said, time does not permit. However, during the course of
this debate I hope that other senators will take advantage
of an examination of the Speech from the Throne to see
the extent to which the government is prepared to act in
the interests of Canada. Now whether this is prodded by
the public or by the NDP does not really matter. Af ter all,
a Parliament made up of different political parties is
expected to receive contributions from those parties. If the
government is prepared to accept wise suggestions, no
matter where they come from, then, well and good.
There is a further matter I should like to touch upon
before I make a brief reference to my concluding points,
and that is a matter referred to the other day by Senator
Robichaud.
[Translation]
I should now like to deal briefly with a point which is
becoming a matter of concern for us and which will
remain so as long as it bas not been clarified; namely, the
cultural independence of Quebec. You are surely aware
that this was one of the main issues in the last provincial
election campaign in Quebec and that it cropped up again
recently when, in a forceful speech, the federal Minister of
Communications, the Hon. Gérard Pelletier, stressed its
ambiguity as well as its dangers for Quebec and Canada as
a whole.
Indeed, if one wishes to give to this expression not only
a symbolic value but a true meaning and a strict definition, it is a doctrine which will not be easily accepted by
those who, like us, have placed all their confidence in a
federalism which has always aimed at being economic,
social and cultural.
As a Franco-Ontarian who recognizes Quebec as the
spiritual home of all French Canadians, and in line with
the feeling expressed by Senator Robichaud, I am also
concerned about this uncertain situation in which Quebec
now finds itself, a situation which could seriously endanger the interests and the rights of French Canadians in the
other provinces. Although the separatist threat has been
diverted by popular verdict for the next four years, the
pessimists and defeatists continue their campaign urging
us to erect walls around and, even, within Quebec, under

SENATE DEBATES
the pretence of preserving the French language which is
disappearing. It is inconceivable to witness an intensification of this campaign at a time when the French language
is secure under the blanket of a legislative instrument
known as the Official Languages Act, at a time when
Quebec artists attain international and national recognition, thanks very often to federal grants, and at a time
when the economic and political future of French-speaking Quebecers is improving to such an extent that it is no
longer a case of survival but of complete achievement.
We can only hope that the Quebec government will act
in an equitable fashion in the area of languages, but with
the necessary tact and wisdom which circumstances command, never disregarding the rights of all their citizens or
the rights of French-speaking Canadians outside Quebec,
and remembering that the French-speaking community in
Quebec has always foiled the expectations of prophesiers
of evil and victoriously accepted any challenge.
To my mind, the senator was right in putting the question because I noticed this morning, in the newspapers,
that the Quebec Premier said that he did not intend to
encourage the extremists. I know the Quebec Premier very
well: he is a moderate man, who knows Canada well, who
has great confidence in the bilingualism program throughout Canada; I know full well that he is absolutely convinced of the merits of Confederation.

[English]
I agree with the statements of the Leader of the Opposition regarding the recommendations made by the Special
Joint Committee of the Senate and of the House of Commons for changes in the Constitution and, in particular, I
agree with him that most of their recommendations are
worthy of the support which he gave them tonight. He
himself was a distinguished member of that committee.
I wish to say that whatever criticism is levelled at this
body, let us not forget that criticism is levelled not only at
the Senate but at Parliament itself. One bas only to read
articles that recently appeared in the Parliamentarianto
see that all over the Commonwealth, particularly in the
United Kingdom, criticisms are made of the parliamentary
institution. They are also made in the United States and in
particular against the Senate of the United States. Many

March 5, 1974

believe that the parliamentary system and the deliberative
method is no longer valuable nor meaningful and has no
longer any relevance. However, we are here as a result of
the decisions made in 1864 and 1867 by the Fathers of
Confederation. We are a confederation, and almost every
confederation in the world has an upper house. I do not
fear for the support on the part of provincial governments
or of the people of Canada for this institution.
We, however, can make changes; we do not need to wait
for constitutional agreement nor for government decision.
We do not need to wait for action by Parliament, either in
one house or in the other. We ourselves, as senators, have
in our hands the opportunity of enriching our contribution
toward making this an even better place than we believe
fundamentally it is. Each of us knows that by observing
our obligations here, paying them not peripheral attention
but primary attention, we will perhaps be putting forward
the best reform. I have no doubt that that is the intention
of us all, as we begin this new session. That, at any rate, I
hope is the intention.
I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the nice things
he said about me; I am not used to receiving them. With
regard to the criticism he made tonight, there may be some
justification. I assure him that whatever I have done has
been with only the best of intentions, because I share with
him, as I share with everyone else here, the belief that, in
a confederation such as ours, an institution of this type
renders an important service to the country in protecting,
recognizing and discussing provincial rights-in the
national interest, of course, if they meet that test. I wish to
state as strongly as I can, however, that while I agree with
what Senator Flynn had, in the main, to say, I do not agree
with the nature of his political criticisms tonight. I found
little merit whatsoever in them. I commend him to read
the Speech from the Throne again.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: This time I will f all asleep.
Hon. Mr. Martin: My honourable friend said he would
fall asleep, but he should not fall asleep over a document
which contains such a good record and gives promise for
such constructive action for the welf are of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: You are making a good joke.
On motion of Senator Langlois, debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of
His Excellency the Governor General's Speech at the
opening of the session, and the motion of Senator Robichaud, seconded by Senator Perrault, for an Address in
reply thereto.
[Translation]
Hon. Leopold Langlois: Honourable senators, in taking
part in this debate, my first words will be words of warm
congratulations to you, Madam Speaker, for your outstanding performance in the discharge of your duties and
also for the honour that you bring to this chamber. Indeed,
you are a model for ail members of this august assembly.
I would also congratulate the Leader of the Opposition
for his part in the debate; as my leader put it yesterday, I
would add that he managed to convince us of one thing,

27601-3

that he is against the party in office. He has been most
successful in this.
I will also congratulate my leader, who would not want
us to compliment him, because his performance keeps on
being masterful, but still the speech that he delivered last
night 15 one of the best in his career.
I also wish to extend my warmest congratulations to the
mover and seconder of the Address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne, Senators Louis Robichaud and Raymond
Perrault. Both delivered very eloquent speeches and they
dealt with current problems with a broadness of mmnd that
makes them greater in our esteem in this house.
Although I do not hope to reach the summit of eloquence
of our colleague, Senator Robichaud, I welcome the view
he expressed on the Senate role and the linguistic and
cultural problems that the people of Canada are faced
with; they are views that meet my own, and that I already
expressed in this house and in the other place.
Indeed, when I took part in the debate on Senate reform
during the last session, I emphasized the Senate role as
that of a protector and a guardian of regional and provincial interests, even going as f ar as suggesting a greater
representation of the various regions and ethnic groups
which make up the Canadian mosaic.
I agree entirely with Senator Robichaud's views regarding bilingualism which is being implemented in Canada as
a follow up to the legislation passed both at the federal
and the provincial level, to promote its early and complete
development. As he did, I strongly oppose and condemn
any attempt to establish unilingualism, be it French or
English, in any area of our country. Also, I abhor such
expressions as "cultural sovereignty" and "mass Frenchification" which we find unfortunately too often in the
statements made by a number of political figures in my
province whenever they deal with the future legislation
concerning linguistic problems in Quebec.
First of all, I do not believe in any project aimned at
imposing this or that language on an ethnic group in
Canada. I feel it would be absolutely inhuman to encroach
in any way upon the parents' natural right to choose freely
the language of instruction for their children.
Furthermore, I feel that such action would prove detrimental to the development of the French language in this
country, both inside and outside Quebec. In short, I abhor
global solutions to problems as complex as those related to
instruction, language and culture. I believe very strongly
that all Canadian provinces should promote the cause of
bilingualism throughout Canada, a cause which is already
fairly well advanced and has been approved by most
Canadians.
Instead of discoursing on unilingualism on the pretence
that one or the other language must be saved it would be
infinitely preferable to lay down the basis for integral

SENATE DEBATES
bilingualism by legislation in order to give every young
Canadian the opportunity of being educated in the two
official languages of Canada.
By taking up such a legislative program in educational
matters the Canadian provinces would at the same time
ensure national unity in Canada while building up for the
young generations a more rosy future in this world whose
remotest regions are becoming closer every day because of
the speedy development of instantaneous communications
everywhere.
Like Senator Robichaud, I have faith in the proverbial
good sense of my fellow citizens in Quebec to avoid the
unilingualism reef and this faith is strenghtened, as he
said, by the poise shown by the Quebec government in the
consideration of such an important question.
Senator Perrault has succeeded in putting the emphasis
on the pragmatism of which the Speech from the Throne is
imbued, and more especially on what some English commentators referred to as the "bread and butter issues".
*

(1410)

[English]
Among the many measures proposed in the Speech from
the Throne, I should like to elaborate on the subjects of
urban development, housing, science policy and oil policy.
The Ministry of State for Urban Affairs was created, as
we all know, to respond to Canada's increasing urbanization and to resolve resulting problems. The tri-level conference, held in Toronto on October 21 and 22, 1972,
marked the first national meeting of the three levels of
government to focus on consultation and co-ordination of
activities to respond to the urban challenge. Senator Carl
Goldenberg was asked to preside at that conference, which
was, to my mind, a splendid recognition of the Senate and
of our distinguished colleague Senator Goldenberg.
The second tri-level conference, held in Edmonton last
October, reached a consensus on the need for managing
more effectively the unbalanced urban growth. This consensus involves a national approach and one which recognizes the specific regional elements of regional growth.
The federal government is committed to this two-phase,
integrated approach to managing urban growth-nationally and regionally-and is prepared to work closely with
the provinces in this respect.
This tri-level approach does not overlook the fact that
the municipalities are, under the Constitution, the creatures of the provinces. The government has agreed, within
this limitation, to the tri-level approach. This decision of
the government calls for priority federal urban goals, with
two phases:
First, to achieve a more balanced pattern of cities and
towns throughout Canada, with increased emphasis on
support for improving small and medium-sized communities; and for new communities where needed.
Second, to improve the physical and social environment
of the larger urban centres, particularly the core areas, or
the inner city.
That decision means that federal policies and programs
will be massively redirected and reshaped over the coming
years to make them more responsive to the needs of an
urban nation. The Throne Speech gives a good indication
of this emphasis. It means that the federal government's
views on urbanization are in the broadest possible terms[Hon. Mr. Langlois.]

March 6, 1974

not solely in terms of Toronto, Montreal or Vancouver, but
in terms, as well, of smaller communities and their place
in the Canadian economy.
This reshaping of policies and programs will affect not
just the policy development activities of the Ministry of
State for Urban Affairs or the programs of Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation but the redirection of policies and programs of many departments.
It means that increasingly the federal government will
join with the provinces and their municipalities to effect
beneficial changes in the evolving urban future.
The proposed measure is intended to apply to cities
where obsolete or under-used railway facilities-tracks,
yards, terminals and other properties-are formidable obstacles to planned and orderly urban development.
The provisions in the draft railway relocation legislation
are intended to modify the flow of traffic on lines in cities,
or to relocate lines entirely, in accordance with urban
plans formulated by the provinces and their municipalities.
Where a rail line is relocated, the property thus vacated
may be put to any number of uses. This could include the
provision of improved and expanded rapid transit facilitics. Railway rights of way will, in many cases, provide
excellent corridors for rapid public transit systems.
Honourable senators, I now turn to the question of
housing. The Speech from the Throne also mentions the
government's housing objectives. The year 1973 was a
record year for house construction-more than 268,000
units were started.
Before the end of March, somewhere in Canada workmen will begin laying the foundation for the one-millionth
housing unit to be constructed in Canada since 1970. On a
summer's day this year we will begin the four-millionth
housing unit started in Canada since the end of the
Second World War.
For the past five years we have been on target with the
housing goals of the Economic Council of Canada, the
Task Force on Housing and Urban Development, and the
federal government-as outlined in the Speech from the
Throne of 1969.
* (1420)

In 1974, housing production will be close to the 1973
level. The total dollar investment for new and existing
housing during 1974 will approximately equal the $6.5
billion made available last year. Mr. Basford thinks that
housing starts will also be close to last year's total, and he
expects that we will have a level of housing production
somewhat the same as in 1973. An annual output of 235,000
housing units is needed for the foreseeable future. Last
year's 268,000 starts demonstrate Canadian capacity both
to cover the yearly increase in the number of families and
the formation of non-family households and to replace
housing destroyed or abandoned.
There are still thousands of Canadians who do not have
access to adequate housing. Recent NHA amendments are
intended to meet this social housing need. Ten years ago
one in 70 units was slated for the low-income population
group. Today one in every seven units is intended for
low-income Canadians. In other words, vre have multi-

March 6, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

plied tenfold our ability to provide suitable housing for
low-income families and individuals.
I would point out that the substantial opportunities
created by the NHA amendments for co-operative and
non-profit groups offer a wide choice of accommodation
and tenure to lower-income families. Co-operatives are
capable of meeting the needs of many special groups of
people and they deserve all the encouragement possible.
There are still Canadians who live in deplorable housing
conditions, as I said a moment ago. Increases in housing
costs do not affect only low-income Canadians, however,
and all three levels of government-federal, provincial
and municipal-must work together to reduce costs.
The federal government is taking several specific
actions to reduce costs and improve the housing environment. These initiatives for the most part are directed at
land.
First, regarding land assembly, last year the government
committed $100 million per year for a period of five years.
As the result of provincial collaboration, $150 million has
been committed for the public assembly of land.
Second, sewage treatment. The present program for
assistance for sewage treatment will be continued past its
March 1975 deadline. The minister, Mr. Basford, will be
introducing new legislation in this regard.
Third, new communities. The creation of a new community on publicly assembled land provides cheaper land for
prospective homeowners as well as relieving demand pressure on land in our present cities.
Fourth, neighbourhood improvement. Over $40 million
has been committed under this and the residential
rehabilitation program.
Fifth, railway relocation. The Speech from the Throne
mentions that legislation will be introduced this year to
provide access to the most valuable under-utilized lands in
Canada, namely, the railway lands in the middle of cities.
Sixth, the government, in the Speech from the Throne,
mentions the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements that will take place in Vancouver in 1976. This
will focus world attention on what Canadian architects
and builders are capable of doing.
Now I pass on to our science policy. As honourable
senators know, the Special Senate Committee on Science
Policy, under the able and distinguished chairmanship of
Senator Lamontagne, last September submitted the final
volume of its report and recommendations for an appropriate policy on science and technology for Canada. It was
the consensus of the committee members that:
The government must now act as quickly as possible
to eliminate uncertainty and provide Canada with the
federal institutions and policies so badly needed to
face the challenges posed by technology and science in
the 1970s and in the long-term future.
The government has studied the recommendations of
the Senate's committee, and in order to meet these challenges a number of important decisions have resulted.
As was indicated in the Speech from the Throne, and
subsequently by the Minister of State for Science and
Technology, Mrs. Sauvé, the changes which the government indicated it was prepared to undertake at this time

27601-3l

are primarily of an organizational nature, but will substantially rationalize existing facilities. The goal is to
achieve more effective utilization of the scientific manpower and resources of Canada. In order that this objective may be reached, a strengthening of the Ministry of
State for Science and Technology will be effected so that
this ministry will exercise an enhanced advisory and coordinating authority. This involves the formulation of
national policies, objectives and priorities to guide departmental planning and to serve as a basis for evaluating
expenditure proposals.
On the basis of its study, the government has determined that there is an urgent need for changing the
granting council structure and ensuring better co-ordination among the granting councils. A reorganization is
proposed that involves separating the granting function of
the National Research Council from the laboratories of the
council and giving responsibility for grants to a new
council to be called the Natural Science Research Council.
Responsibility for financial support to the social sciences
and humanities will be removed from the Canada Council
and placed under the Social Sciences and Humanities
Research Council.
The rationale for the establishment of these two new
granting councils is briefly this: The government is concerned to ensure that the administration and guidance of
university research granting shall be under the direction
of councils composed of selected individuals who will be
in a position to give their undivided attention and the
benefits of their experience to the specific disciplines and
fields of research which are to be addressed respectively
by the two granting councils.
*

(1430)

The last of the existing councils, the Medical Research
Council, will remain unchanged. These councils will come
under a new inter-council co-ordinating committee, the
objectives of which are:
1. to advise on the allocation of funds among the
councils;
2. to ensure coverage by the councils of all recognized
disciplines;
3. to ensure standardization of granting practices;
4. to ensure that the needs of inter-disciplinary research
are met;
5. to co-ordinate and advise on council programs and on
federal government support of university research
projects.
In accordance with the government's policy of having
government research relate closely to national objectives,
the Defence Research Board's laboratory and analytical
functions will be integrated with the Department of
National Defence. The board's granting functions will be
absorbed by the three granting councils previously
mentioned.
To promote the better understanding of science policy
issues, the government intends that the Science Council of
Canada should adopt an active public information role.
This is felt to be an essential activity of the council.
Science policy-described in the Speech from the
Throne as "the rational generation and acquisition of

SENATE DEBATES
scientific knowledge and the planned use of science and
technology in support of national goals"-provides the
basic rationale for the enhanced responsibilities of the
Ministry of State for Science and Technology as well as of
the organizational course which has been outlined.
The need for over-all planning and consistency is great
if we are to understand, exploit and protect the resources
of Canada, take our place in the international scientific
community, and assist our scientists, engineers and technologists to better prepare us to meet the future crises
which we will inevitably have to face in this technologically changing world. This concern is reflected in the
many initiatives mentioned in the Speech from the Throne
and an effective science policy will be required. I would
suggest that the changes proposed by the government
would effect the required redirection.
Now I pass on to oil policy. The government, of course,
has a duty, as we all understand, to organize and administer the economy so as to more effectively reduce the
inflationary effects that followed the oil crisis. The government is exchanging views with the provinces in regard
to a domestic and export pricing structure. The objective
sought is to protect the consumer, to encourage more
production and discovery of the oil resources, and to give
the provinces that produce these resources a fair return on
what is theirs under the Constitution of Canada. The
government will insist on a federal share of the increased
revenue derived from higher oil prices. This is not an
intervention in the resources that belong to the provinces;
it is simply carrying out the obligation that the Government of Canada has toward all the people of Canada.
Here is what the Prime Minister said on the actual or
potential conflicts between the interests of the producing
companies and the individual consumers, or between the
producing provinces and consumer provinces:
... there is a clear and fundamental obligation of
the federal government to intervene in the over-all
national interests. To intervene effectively we must
have the financial capacity to direct the economy
toward national goals and to spread the burden of
higher prices evenly across the country.
This is not a quarrel about jurisdiction over natural
resources. Again, to quote the words of the Prime
Minister:
This is a duty discharged by the Government of
Canada to ensure that the kind of disorder and disruption, which has been brought upon the economies of
many nations which could not find within their own
borders policies to stabilize the impact of disruptive
prices, does not take place in Canada.
[Translation]
I want now to come back to my preliminary remarks
concerning the participation of Senator Perrault in this
debate and I want to underline especially his appeal for
Pan-Canadianism and for the unity of the nation.
Even if they are not prepared to admit everything he
said in this regard, not many colleagues in this house will
hesitate to endorse Senator Perrault's views on all the
things which can unite Canada rather than weaken
national unity.
[Hon. Mr. Langlois.]

March 6, 1974

Our colleague sees in the Speech from the Throne-and
here again there will surely be differences of opinion-a
complete work plan that must be preferred to the too easy
negative criticisms and incomplete cure-alls of those who
enjoy being prophets of evil and, to paraphrase a quotation by Senator Robichaud, always wish in the end their
gloomy prophecies will come true to prove they were right.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: You should recall Senator Martin in
the Opposition.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Unfortunately, I did not have the
advantage Senator Martin had of being in the opposition
when my honourable colleague was in power because it
would be easier to find out the differences of view he has
developed since then.
Nevertheless, I continue by saying that our colleague
sees in the Speech from the Throne a complete work plan
which must be preferred to the too easy negative criticisms and incomplete cure-alls of those who enjoy being
prophets of evil. Anyone who reads the Speech from the
Throne with any sense of objectivity finds it hard not to
notice the analysis of the causes of inflation and the
assessment of the appropriate means to deal with it without bringing about an inevitable slowdown in the Canadian economy which too drastic measures could necessarily
bring-the setting up of a Canadian oil policy to counter
the effects of the energy crisis which existed in the past
several months and ensuring the self-sufficiency of
Canada with respect to energy; assessing the interdependance-and this is important-of the economy of this country with international trade and markets which render
inappropriate and often inapplicable a general price and
income policy whatever the proposed period of duration.

In this regard, I would like to refer this House to the
recommendation quoted yesterday by the government
leader and made in the report of the Senate Committee on
National Finance on Growth, Employment and Price
Stability.
I do not intend to repeat such a recommendation which
denounced quite plainly the peacetime application of a
control policy on prices and incomes. But, I must again
point out something which a great many senators already
know, but of which the public is not aware, that this
recommendation by the Senate Committee on National
Finance was not made blindly. This standing Senate committee, to which I had the honour to belong, heard 45
witnesses before making its recommendations.
Hon. Mr. Asselin: In what year?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: In 1971.
I was saying that the committee heard 45 witnesses,
chosen not only among experts from the economics department of Canadian and American universities, but found at
large throughout the world. As proof of what I am saying,
let me give you a few names.
First, among the leading witnesses: Sir Roy Harrod of
the Department of Economics of the University of Maryland and ex-professor of political economy, Christchurch
College, Oxford; Dr. Arthur J. R. Smith, former Chairman
of the Economic Council of Canada as well as several
members of the Economic Council of Canada, namely, Dr.

March 6, 1974
March 6, 1974

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

Otto Thur, Dr. Sylvia Ostry and Dr. R. C. Bellan; Dr.
Richard G. Lipsey, professor at the Department of Economics at Queen's University; Dr. John Crispo, Director of
the Industrial Relations Centre of Toronto University, Dr.
Saburo Okita, President of the Japanese Centre of Economic Research. Then, and I skip over many others, Dr.
Raymond J. Saulnier, Dean of the Department of Economics, Barnard College, University of Columbia, and
ex-president of the group of economic advisers to the
President of the United States.
Several bankers also appeared as witnesses, including
Mr. René Leclerc, Chairman of the Canadian Bankers
Association, Mr. Currie, vice-chairman and economic consultant to the Bank of Montreal and several others. Then
Dr. Herbert Giersch, professor at the Department of Economics at Kiel University, West Germany and ex-president of the West German council of experts in economic
development.
Finally, there were among Canadians, Dr. André Raynauld, a former professor of the Economics Department of
the University of Montreal, then chairman designate of
the Economic Council of Canada of which he is now
chairman; another banker, Mr. Louis Rasminsky, Governor of the Bank of Canada and Mr. Bouey, then Deputy
Governor but now Governor of the Bank of Canada.
I think this simplified enumeration of the 45 witnesses
who appeared before the committee gives considerable
weight to the recommendations of the committee.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Not necessarily.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Necessarily, and I do not think that
just anyone in politics can proclaim himself an expert on
the matter today and make ex cathedra pronouncements.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Maybe not, but it does not follow that
because the committee accepted a witness its conclusions
are necessarily in agreement with the witness's opinions.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I was a member of the committee
and I followed its proceedings as closely or more closely
than my distinguished colleague.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Not more.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Then at least as much, but I agree
that the recommendations of the committee were in line
with those of expert witnesses, which again adds weight to
our own recommendations. In my opinion, the government
is justified in paying attention to the recommendations of
such a dedicated committee, made up of senators from
every political affiliation. I do not remember whether
there were considerable discussions on the recommendations made.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: May I askHon. Mr. Langlois: On a point of order. My honourable
friend keeps on interrupting me; I patiently listened to
him yesterday, although I did not agree with him. I understand that he cannot stand being contradicted, but there is
nothing I can do about changing his personality.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It is for the sake of clarification.
No Senate committee report expects dissidence on the
over-all opinion. But no dissidence is recorded in a
committee.

Hon. Mr. Langlois: If my colleague wants to make a
speech because he disagrees with what I am saying, well
he can take my place, but I did not talk about dissidence.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: No, about discussions.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I talked about recommendations. I
limited myself to that, to the recommendations made.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: You are hinting that everyone agreed.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Moreover, I noticed yesterday that
when my leader mentioned that the committee's technical
adviser is now the Opposition's financial critic in the other
House, he shook his head, showing to my mind that he
disapproved-I cannot be categorical for I only construe
his nod as meaning that it was not correct.
I have just received a note on my desk confirming that
the gentleman acting as the committee's technical adviser
was Mr. James Gillies, then professor at York University
and now Conservative M.P. for Toronto and the Opposition's financial critic in the other House.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: You know there are those who never
change their mind.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Go on, if you wish to make a speech,
I can yield to you.
Hon. Mr. Denis: We would be the losers.

Hon. Mr. Langlois: That is Senator Denis' personal
opinion.

Hon. Mr. Walker: When are you going to talk about
inflation?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I am talking about it, if the honourable senator would only listen. I am sorry, I was speaking
in French. I will carry on in that language, as it is my right
to do.
Hon. Mr. Walker: Will you be coming to inflation? Have
you a committee on inflation too?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I hope the honourable senator noted
the remark of his leader in the course of his speech
yesterday. He said that a good deal of inflation was
imported into Canada. I took note of it. I will not be
distracted by these light observations from the other side,
from people who are not prepared to see the truth. I hope
that some day they will.
[Translation]
Let us go back now to the speech delivered by Senator
Perrault. I continue with the enumeration of the main
measures announced in the Speech from the Throne, the
efforts of the Canadian government to maintain high
levels of income, production and employment in order to
overcome some of the supply problems which are causing
prices to rise; the passing of specific measures to increase
the supply of certain goods and services and to cushion
consumers against sudden and disruptive price increases
of essential commodities, and to prevent any group or
groups from taking undue advantage of the current situation at the expense of the Canadian consumer; the development of a policy on food based on the following
objectives: first, an adequate and dependable supply of

SENATE DEBATES

quality food for the Canadian people; second, reasonable
prices, for the consumer as well as for the producer, as
regards all foodstuffs produced in this country; and third,
a continuing supply and increasing production of those
food products in which Canada has a competitive advantage for export to commercial markets, and also for a
contribution to international food aid programs; for the
producer, the provision of a fair income for his work, and
for the consumer a fair value for his dollar and protection
against disruptive increases in the price of essential foodstuffs. Guarantees against unduly low prices to producers
must be coupled with guarantees against unduly high
prices to consumers. There must be continuity of domestic
supply through optimum overall land use in Canada while
taking into account the trend to diversify productive land
for non-agricultural purposes.
Furthermore, to achieve adequate supplies of food at
reasonable cost, the following measures directed in the
main at increasing food production are proposed: guaranteed loans and other forms of assistance to farmers and
fishermen to enable them to purchase or modernize their
equipment; amendments to the Export and Import Permits
Act to provide the government with better means to stabilize the Canadian market; increased availability of
manpower for food production; some assistance in the
construction of new storage facilities; research to make it
possible to increase production, improve quality, and
lower costs; improvements in harbour facilities to be used
by fishing fleets; incentives to increase Canada's catch of
unexploited stocks of fish; advance payments on crops to
assure producers of timely cash receipts; an agricultural
stabilization plan to encourage rational production decisions; financial incentives for young farmers; better
veterinary training facilities; a prairie grain market insurance plan; improvements in Canadian grain rail transportation capabilities; increased availability of reasonably
priced feed grains; finally, incentives to increase the production of livestock necessary to provide for Canadian
and export markets.
Honourable senators, the legislative program also contains measures to aid small businesses both financially
and by providing better counselling services, and by the
creation of a Federal Business Development Bank.
In addition to the encouragement given to the development of the petrochemical industry, the government will
propose amendments to the Bank Act to pave the way for
provincial participation in the ownership of banks.
The government also proposes to draw up a national
scientific policy, which I mentioned a while ago, as well as
a national transportation policy to promote regional
growth, including the elimination of any discrimination in
freight rates, and a port policy based on the highest possible local involvement in management and improvement of
ports.
To that general outline of the legislation can be added
the policy for the development of urban transportation,
the relocation of railway lines and stations in many cities
and towns, which I also mentioned a while ago, as well as
a policy aimed at providing Canadians with proper housing in a pleasant environment at a reasonable price.
What is more striking in this vast legislative program,
honourable senators, is the number of references to con[Hon. Mr. Langlois.]

March 6, 1974

sultation with the provinces for the development and
implementation of these various policies. Indeed, a hasty
examination of the Speech from the Throne reveals no
fewer than eight direct references to the desire to consult,
co-operate, make arrangements or otherwise confer intimately with all other government levels in Canada. This
wish for co-operation is very significant in my opinion,
and shows the complexity of the anticipated legislation. It
is to be hoped that the central power will be able to open
these discussions and exchanges in such a way as to obtain
the full co-operation of all provincial and municipal governments in Canada.
Honourable senators, this is vital for the welfare of
Canadians and the future of our country.

Hon. M. Grattan O'Leary: Honourable senators, my
first words, surely, must be to congratulate Canada upon
securing Mr. Jules Léger as our Governor General. Mr.
Léger is an old newspaper colleague of mine, whose recent
past in the service of the state has been marked by distinction and good renown. I do not know whether honourable
senators realize it or not, but when Shakespeare wrote
King Lear he merely made the mistake of dropping the
"y". Although a descendant of Irish kings, I must confess
at once I am not a passionate monarchist, but I will say
this: if we can get representatives of the Crown of the
calibre and character of Mr. Léger, I think we would do
well to go along with the monarchy.
I must also congratulate the Senate and Canada, too,
upon your continued presence with us, Madam Speaker.
All parties in this bouse and all persons in this house feel
inspired by your gentle wisdom, your dignity and your
dedication to your office. My wish would be, no matter
what happens in the future-and you know the sort of
thing I wish would happen-that you remain with us
regardless.
I would like to say a word, too, in congratulating the
mover and seconder of the Address in reply. They had a
very difficult job. Personally, I would not have liked the
task of having to condone, let alone defend, what was
given us and called the Speech from the Throne. We call
these pronouncements Speeches from the Throne, but
actually what we were given here was merely a formula
for survival. Arthur Meighen once said in the House of
Commons that if he had a project dear to his heart, the
worst fate he could fear for it would be that some day it
might get into a Liberal platform. For myself, I think I can
say that the worst fate I fear for anything dear to my
heart would be for it to be included in a Liberal Speech
from the Throne.
I listened last evening to two great debating speakers. I
thought the speech made by my leader, Senator Flynn, in
penetration, in eloquence, in relevance and in passion was
a great parliamentary performance.
Sorne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: I am afraid that an imperative call of
age compelled me to leave the chamber while Senator
Martin was speaking, but I read his speech this morning,
and I did so with continued admiration for his gigantic

March 6, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES

capacity to make bricks out of straw. He is excellent at
that sort of thing.
Now today I listened to my fellow Gaspesian speaking
on the Speech from the Throne and dealing in the future.
Everything is going to be sunshine for our grandchildren.
He omitted many things.
Speaking of omissions, I want to say just a word about
Senator Robichaud. I am an admirer of Senator Robichaud. I have known him in New Brunswick for years. He,
too, found it necessary to do a lot of padding when he
came to the Speech from the Throne. He gave us page after
page on what the International Joint Commission is about.
I am sorry to say that, either through forgetfulness or
something worse, he omitted to mention the fact that
when Elihu Root, the great American lawyer, sat down to
draft the terms of that Commission-he was the Secretary
of State then-an equally great Canadian lawyer, a fellow
New Brunswicker of Senator Robichaud's, the Honourable
William Pugsley, a member of Sir Wilfrid Laurier's Cabinet, had a hand with the great Elihu Root in drafting that
document. I do not know whether Senator Robichaud
knew about that, but I am afraid that the Honourable
William Pugsley bas not been given in this country the
things that are due him. He was a great lawyer, a great
man, and a great parliamentarian. We do not breed his
kind any more.
Moreover, Senator Robichaud did not mention the letters that Sir Wilfrid Laurier wrote to Mr. George Gibbons
regarding the International Joint Commission. Had he
done so, he would have found something contrary to the
general belief that Laurier was not a master of detail and
that he knew little about economics or international
affairs. Sir Wilfrid Laurier is one of my heroes of public
life, just one on that side of the bouse, that party, and if
one reads those letters he wrote to Sir George Gibbons in
criticism of some of the proposals made by our American
friends, it will be seen that he was a great, great Canadian.
These are things, I am afraid, that we in this country
forget.
I was just thinking this morning, the snows of 65 winters have melted from Parliament Hill since I first came
here. I have been in Parliament, in the Press Gallery. I
tried to become a member of the House of Commons. I was
not as good as my friend across the way, however, and I
failed to become the member for Gaspé, which he did, and
I thought of it while he was making his curious remarks
today. Everything was in the future. He spoke of housing.
Housing! Great heavens, who can buy a house now? What
can a young married couple do about a house? Here is a
government that bas been in office since 1968, and yet a
young married couple in this country today cannot get
shelter. He, himself, says that is true.
*

(1510)

He did not mention inflation. I do not blame him for
that, because his party bas no policy regarding inflation,
or certainly no policy about the consequences of inflation.
What we face in this country today are the causes of
inflation and the consequences, and nothing, nothing
whatever in a practical way bas been done about that. Oh,
they tell us, there is not much we can do. They say, why,
this is worldwide, it is international. Nonsense! That is not

true. Some 64, 65 or 70 per cent of everything consumed in
this country is of Canadian origin.
I would ask the senator tomorrow night, or Friday night,
to take his basket and go down to one of our supermarkets
and try to buy a supply of food for his family for the
coming week. Let him walk down the aisles and pick his
food from the shelves and fill his basket. And when he
takes his basket home let him examine the contents and
see how much of it did not originate in Canada. You tell
me that we cannot fix prices or control prices, because
these things come to us from abroad. All this is nonsense.
If I went to Rockcliffe today to buy a home, I would pay a
price for it 70 per cent more than I would have paid three
years ago. And that surely would have nothing to do with
the price of a bouse in Washington. We are not dealing
with external affairs-we are not dealing with foreignproduced goods. Our bread, our tea, our sugar, our bacon,
our meat, anything we buy bas its origin in Canada. And
the consumer in Canada is paying for goods produced in
Canada when he buys his goods at the store at inflated
prices. And the cause of that inflationHon. Mr. Langlois: Where do we grow tea in Canada?
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: It was a slip of the tongue if I said
"tea".
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Or sugar?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It doesn't come to us from the United
States.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: All right, I mentioned six items, let
us take the other six.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Sugar?
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: Sugar?
An Hon. Senator: Molasses?
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: Sugar? You had better read the
speech by your boss in the house the other night when he
said that the cartels of sugar were responsible for the price
of sugar.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: It does not come from Canada.

Hon. Mr. O'Leary: And what are you doing about it?

Nothing. What you are doing is pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into circulation. That is the principal and
main cause of inflation in Canada. And all you are trying
to do-and you are not trying to do much-is to cure the

consequences. What are the causes?

I have here with me the estimates. Do you realize that to
date the interest, not the principal but the interest, on the
public debt is reaching $3 billion a year? That is $3 billion

a year for the interest alone on the debt-and that is more
than the total deficit year after year. And how does that
come about? It comes about because not a minority government but a socialist-liberal coalition is dragging this
country down into the welfare state and is bludgeoning
this country into costs that mean this country will be

driven into bankruptcy if we do not stop them.

When I first came to the Press Gallery in 1911, the total
capital debt of Canada was $350 million. I well remember

Mr. Fielding making this announcement, which was grim,
and Sir George Foster, the financial critic of the other

SENATE DEBATES

side, getting up and saying that we were galloping hellwards because our debt was $350 million.
This government, with their welfare-statism, are spending that much now in two or three weeks. We have more
welfare-statism in Canada than in any country in the
world with the possible exception of Britain and Sweden.
And we know what has happened to Sweden. Sweden still
has 80 per cent of all her industries privately owned. Why
do they keep them privately owned? To get money
through taxes to pay for the welfare-statism. And they
have gone so far now that in the last election they were all
but defeated; only 40 per cent of Swedes voted for that
welfare-state government. They had 40 years of it and now
they know what it is. Apart from Sweden and Britain
there is not one country today, not one, with more welfarestate costs than Canada. And this is going on and on.
Money is being poured into the market and every time you
pour that money into the market you take something away
from private enterprise. You take something away from
me and from every man in this house, and I know what
they tell us. They say, "Don't worry too much about it; we
owe the debt to ourselves."
Honourable senators, that is a false and fallacious statement. We do not owe the debt to ourselves; we owe the
debt to certain people in the country and they will have to
collect. Owe it to ourselves? Do you realize that not 50 per
cent of the Canadian people own the government bonds?
Those bonds are not held by all of us. When those debts
come to be paid, and those obligations will have to be paid,
they will not be paid to me. I am not a holder of bonds.
They will not be paid to many people in this house. They
will be paid to a few people who will collect. The obligations will have to be paid and they will be paid out of your
taxes and mine.
These are the clichés of the welfare state-and they
have them in abundance-that this debt does not matter,
that it does not matter what we spend or what we owe,
that we owe it to ourselves. I venture to say that when we
come to pay, we will have to pay, not to ourselves but to a
few people in this country and some of them are still
holding interest-free bonds.
This is the trouble with this government. This is not, I
repeat, a minority government in the true sense of the
word. We have had minority governments in every state
for a hundred years. Some were good governments, and in
certain cases they could be good. This is a liberal-socialist
alliance with the socialists calling the shot.
My friend knows that very well. Why Mr. David Lewis
is not in the Cabinet I do not know, but he should be in
there as "Minister for Everything." The Prime Minister?
The Prime Minister goes around with Adam Smith in one
hand and Karl Marx in the other, but paying more attention to Karl Marx than to poor Adam Smith. I knew an
Irish politician who spoke for two hours on one occasion
and he ended up by saying, "Gentlemen, these are my
principles, but if you don't like them I have others." The
Prime Minister goes further than that. The Prime Minister
says "Gentlemen, these are our principles but if Mr. David
Lewis doesn't like them we have others."
That is the kind of government we are getting today.
This is a government of pragmatic opportunists, and my
friend comes today to list a whole lot of things that are in
{Hon. Mr. O'Leary.}

March 6, 1974

the Speech from the Throne. Someone once said that the
American Constitution was a collection of glittering
generalities. These are generalities but, God help us, they
are not glittering. They are in stilted and pedestrian English and I am sure Mr. Jules Léger, who is a very sophisticated man, must have often paused and said, "Can I
really speak that?"
This is true. I have seen many Speeches from the
Throne, but I have never seen such a conglomeration of
nonsense as there is in the Speech from the Throne that is
before us at the present time.
It is appalling that in a country like Canada with all
that we have, all that we hope to be, that a government
after three years-three years of inaction, three years of
failure, three years of defeat-comes to us now with a lot
of promises for the future. They say, "We cannot do
anything about inflation. It is impossible. This is a worldwide thing and we cannot do a thing about it, but you just
wait and see what we are going to do next year."
Honourable senators. I know you think I am partisan,
and I am, but so are you. Even if I were not partisan, even
if I were the most objective person in the world, I could
not sit down and stomach that Speech from the Throne. If
I were a socialist I would certainly want this government
to continue in office, but if I believed even a mite in
freedom, if I believed even a mite in free enterprise, I
could not understand or would not be able to understand
how any person believing in free enterprise, believing in
any kind of free system, would want this government to
continue in power.
* (1520)

Honourable senators, there is one other thing I wanted
to say and that I will come back to some other day. In the
Speech from the Throne they mentioned railways. Ever
since I have been around Parliament they have been going
to revise railway freight rates. We had the Turgeon Commission, we had the MacPherson Commission, we had the
Duncan Commission, and God knows what else. I want to
say this: I have made a bit of a study of railway rates and I
believe that railway rates in Canada are among the best in
the world. Don't forget that the railways today are not the
railways we knew 30, 40 or 50 years ago. The railways in
Canada today are subject to the most stringent competition, and that competition is growing. You cannot judge
today what the railways are doing or trying to do, or are
not doing, by what was happening 10, 20 or 30 or 40 years
ago. I do believe, myself, that railway rates in Canada,
considering the character of our country's geography, are
perhaps the lowest and the best in the world. So whatever
we do, let us not rush blindly along saying that we must
do something about transportation.
It is true that transportation in the Atlantic provinces is
something we might want to look at, but don't let us listen
to the pseudo-socialists and pseudo-liberals who come
along now and think that it is a good, vote-getting scheme
to say, "We are going to do something about transportation." I believe they said that on the eve of the election in
Nova Scotia. That is something I object to.
I object to the pragmatism of this government. They are
opportunists, nothing else. They have no principle, no
policies, no ideology even, but have merely a hand-tomouth existence. That is what we have been getting in the

March 6, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

past three years; that is what we are promised-or worsein the coming three years; and I am afraid that, if this
thing continues, this country with its "welfare-state-ism"
will eventually be driven to bankruptcy.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Laing: Would the honourable senator permit a
question?
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: Yes, indeed.
Hon. Mr. Laing: As I was listening to his vigorous and
remarkable speech I was wishing that I were 18 years
older so that I could talk like that.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: That will come.
Hon. Mr. Laing: The honourable senator said that
70-odd per cent-I think the figure is actually 76 per
cent-of the goods consumed by Canadians are produced
within Canada, and that it should be within the competence of the government, therefore, to see that those prices
are kept down. What he must be advocating is a two-price
system in Canada for every item, and I would remind him
that, if that is what he is suggesting, the only advocates of
that policy are Mr. Lewis and the NDP.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: My answer to that is quite clear.
What I am advocating is the policy enunciated by my
leader that we take a breathing spell and deal with those
prices we can deal with. Let us say three months. He bas
suggested three months.
But when your party says, and keeps saying- and they
have repeated it so often that I think they believe it-that
price-fixing has been a failure in Britain and in the United
States, they are not speaking the facts. The fact is that
inflation has grown faster in Canada than it has in either
America or Great Britain, and that is because we have
done nothing about it.
Hon. Mr. Laing: Honourable Senator O'Leary, dealing
with housebuilding, said that lumber is produced in
Canada and that the increase in the cost of housing had
nothing to do with it at all. He must remember that in our
province we used to sell cedar at $24 a thousand, but we
have had a flood of Japanese coming in and paying $500 a
thousand.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: I think the honourable senator
should ask that question of the Prime Minister, because
the Prime Minister stated in the House of Commons only
last week that wages had nothing to do with inflation. You
should find out what your leader thinks about these
things.
Hon. Mr. Laing: Is the honourable senator advocating
setting aside portions of Canadian production of all kinds
to be maintained at price levels in Canada, including
lumber, metals and everything else? Obviously, the
advocacy for that policy is the NDP.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: I did not say "all kinds" at all. I said
we should look at the situation to see what we can do
about prices in order to get at least a breathing spell and
to stop these runaway prices. Then we could sit down,
three months having gone by, and having stopped this
mad march of inflation, we could see what we could do in
the future. That is all. There is nothing very remarkable
about that.

27601-4

Hon. Mr. Forsey: Would the honourable senator tell us
what his party proposes to do when it has got its breath
after three months?
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: That is ridiculous! That is just
another of those damned clichés you have been using over
and over again that don't mean a thing. Nobody can sit
down and make a list. I said we would have to sit down
and see what we could do. We don't say, "Yes, we will do
this, that and the other thing." Governments do not work
that way and nobody knows that better than Senator
Forsey.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: What he says is always somewhat
"forcé".
Hon. Frederick Williarn Rowe: Honourable senators,
first of all I should like to express my appreciation, as
other senators have already done, and, I believe, the pleasure of all Canadians, at the appointment of His Excellency
the Governor General. Until last week I had not had the
pleasure or the honour of meeting that distinguished gentleman, although I had had the honour of meeting and
conversing with his distinguished brother. All Canada can
be proud that this nation, comprised of such diversity as it
is, has been able to produce such a distinguished family as
the one represented by our new Governor General.
To you, Madam Speaker, may I say that I concur with all
the compliments that have been made about you. I could
easily go on to add to them, but to do so would be almost
needless repetition. We all admire Madam Speaker.
I should also like to express my congratulations to the
proposer of this motion, our new colleague Senator Robichaud. I have had the pleasure of knowing Senator Robichaud for many years, including the ten years that he was
Premier of New Brunswick. I wish to say that, from
observing him over the years at federal-provincial conferences and at Atlantic conferences, I have had the impression and have developed the conviction that in addition to
being a dedicated premier of one of our historic provinces
he has at all times been a great and dedicated Canadian.
Nothing that has happened since his days as premier has
changed my mind in that respect.
I should also like to congratulate the seconder of this
motion. By his presence here Senator Perrault has brought
to this chamber one of the finest speaking voices I have
ever heard. Certainly, he has used his voice with great
articulation and eloquence, and that alone represents a
significant and valuable addition to this chamber.
May I also express at this time my good wishes to the
Leader of the Government in the Senate. I am sure I speak
for all senators when I say that we would like to assure
him of our continuing co-operation in his onerous duties.
In saying that I should also add that we appreciate the
onerous burden which rests on the Leader of the Opposition here. We all feel, on both sides of this house, I am
sure, that in the person of Senator Flynn we have another
distinguished Canadian leading the Opposition in this
bouse.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Rowe: I should like now to say just a word
about our distinguished friend and colleague Senator
O'Leary. As he was speaking a few moments ago my mind
went back to a time when I was 16 years of age and had

SENATE DEBATES

first come into contact with what is sometimes referred to
as Canada's national magazine, Maclean's. In that copy, the
first I had ever seen, the leading article was entitled,
"How I Made a Hole in One," and it was over the name of
Grattan O'Leary. I had never heard of him before. I read
the article with considerable enjoyment. It was a beautiful
piece of humour. At that time I had no idea what a "hole in
one" was. In Newfoundland 40 or 50 years ago we had not
too many golf courses. However, that article was certainly
intrinsically interesting and it gave me a keen desire to
meet its author.

It was a great pleasure to me when I came to this Senate
to find that Senator O'Leary was still here with us. I can
only repeat what I said here in recent months, that is, that
if I were given the choice of selecting a debating opponent,
the last one I would choose would be Senator O'Leary. Of
course, I do not go along with all of his views, but I will
say that whenever he speaks it is vastly entertaining and,
more than that, it is vastly educational.
I want to make a brief passing reference-and some
time I hope to deal with it more fully-to this nonsense
that we hear f rom time to time about age. There are people
who are over-aged, who are elderly, at 50, and there are
others in their 80's, as we saw here today in the person of
Senator O'Leary, whose minds and tongues are just as
active, just as alert, just as penetrating, as they were 40
years ago. That is manifested par excellence in the person
of Senator O'Leary.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear!
Hon. Mr. Rowe: Finally, on these introductory matters,
I would like, as a large "L" Liberal, and, I hope, a small 'T'
Liberal, to re-affirm my continuing confidence in the
present administration of Her Majesty's Government in
Canada and in the leadership of the Prime Minister. I do
not, as honourable senators may recall, make a practice,
and I have no intention of beginning to make a practice, of
talking partisan politics, in the narrow sense of the word,
in this chamber; but I feel that every senator bas the right,
on occasions such as this, in these historic debates on the
Speech from the Throne, to say where he stands on the
overriding issues confronting our nation.
The Speech from the Throne deals with some of the
major problems of our time in a cool and unexcited and
dispassionate manner. This is as it should be. The complex
problems of world energy supplies, of inflation and its
concomittant, the cost of living, unemployment, regional
disparity-these are all matters with regard to which
there is always a danger of someone appealing to the
emotions of our people, with consequent pressing of panic
buttons and of resorting to extreme measures which, in
the end, can be self-defeating.
The Speech indicates that, while aware of the seriousness and magnitude of these great problems, and while
equally aware that when confronted by them some action
must be taken, the government appreciates also the danger
of rushing off madly in all directions, frantically and
fruitlessly searching for solutions. That has happened
elsewhere with disastrous effect. We have to be, to some
extent, fatalists about some of these problems, in the sense
that we must face up to the fact that most of them are
international in scope and are therefore outside our
[Hon. Mr. Rowe.]

March 6, 1974

immediate and direct control. I am not using this argument as an excuse for inaction.
We must remind ourselves also of the fact that for some
of these problems there never can be a final and complete
solution, and that we would be fooling ourselves, we
would be guilty of childish conduct, if we convinced ourselves that there are final and absolute solutions to such
problems as inflation.
Inflation has always been present, ever since man came
out of the cave or down out of the trees, or wherever he
came from. It was present in Rome at the time of Augustus, two thousand years ago, no less than it is at the time
of our own Queen Elizabeth. It was equally as persistent
during the Napoleonic wars as it is today. We cannot
ignore it, but we should not lose our sense or proportion.
History bas shown that when potential dangers are recognized, and realistically appraised, and when appropriate
restraining actions are taken from time to time, it is a
disease that, while we cannot cure it, at least we can keep
in check. In short, it is a disease that need not be fatal.
This, I think, is the lesson of history in so far as inflation
is concerned. In my opinion, our preoccupation-one
might almost say our obsession-with these major and
immediate and urgent problems of inflation, of energy
crises, and the like, confronts us with the possibility of an
even more serious danger, which is that we might ignore
or fail to cope adequately with other basic problems
which, in the long run, could lead to a deterioration in our
way of life or, if not to a deterioration, at least to a state of
stagnation, which in the long view could be equally
disastrous.
Among the basic assumptions of democracy, as we know
it, must be numbered respect for the needs and aspirations
and rights of the individual. During the past year we have
seen, by way of the revelations in the United States, how
easy it is for powerful and unscrupulous agencies to erode
this principle. While we have watched with sympathy and
admiration the agonizing efforts that that great nation bas
made, and is making at this moment, to re-assert the basic
rights of citizens and to affirm that principle of the rights
of the individual, we cannot but have a feeling akin to
horror-as I am sure thousands of Canadians had-that
such insidious and, for a period at least, such undetected
inroads could have been made into the very vitals of the
democratic process and the democratic way of life, and all,
incidentally, done under the guise and in the name of
democracy.
We in Canada, while we sympathize, should do more
than that. We should watch the situation, and guide ourselves accordingly.
Another great assumption of our way of life is that by
goodwill and perseverance and determination, our way of
life can be improved. Here I fear I am going to have to
take issue with one or two of the points made by my
distinguished friend who just spoke. I say that another of
the great assumptions by which we govern ourselves is
that our way of life can be improved. That improvement
cannot take place, however, if we allow ourselves to be
distracted by the emergencies and the crises of the
moment.
Perhaps I can best express the idea that I have in mind
by referring to an incident which took place in the mother

March 6, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

country of many of us here, Great Britain, during World
War II. May I say at this point that while I recognize the
many defects, faults and shortcomings of the British
people, and the grave injustices that they have at times
perpetrated-as a student of history I would be very naive
and dense were I not to recognize that those things have
happened-nevertheless, I wish to say with equal emphasis, and without any tinge of racialism, that I have always
been proud of my British ancestry. I was especially proud,
of course, as were all other Canadians, and for that matter
all other people in the free world, during those years when
the only thing standing between a madman and world
domination was the character of the British people. I was
very proud of that. But the time that I felt proudest was
not at the time of Dunkirk; it was not when the British
people stood up under the might of the Luftwaffe; and it
was not when the British people coped with the Battle of
the Atlantic, with which we in Newfoundland were so
intimately associated. My proudest moment came at a time
when the fortunes of the British people were at their
lowest ebb, when everyone was predicting the imminent
defeat and collapse of Britain, and when the government,
with the complete approval of the people of Britain, decided that the time was appropriate to set up a commission to
study elementary and high school education so that the
educational welfare of the children of Britain could be
provided for in the years to come.
*

(1540)

To interject a personal note, I was in the Canadian
Officers' Training Corps at the time and I remember this
announcement coincided with a very great reverse in
Britain's fortunes-another one of those reverses. I
remember an officer in our corps saying to me privately
that this reverse only confirmed what in his opinion we all
knew at the bottom of our hearts, that Britain was about
to collapse and Germany would take over. I remember
that my retort to him-and I do not say this boastfully but
as a matter of fact-was that any people who at such a
time could be concerning themselves with the future education of their children could not be permanently subdued.
History showed, of course, that that conviction was
correct.
I have used an extreme case deliberately as an example
to illustrate the fact that while we are not faced, of course,
with a crisis of the magnitude of that which Britain faced
back in the early days of World War II, we are faced with
other crises and there is the danger that we can lose our
sense of proportion. I wish to state here-and I am not
thinking only of the federal government and Parliament,
but of all levels of government and our society generallythat I have felt in the last three or four years that because
of our struggle with those great problems to which I have
just referred of unemployment, inflation and so on, we are
not doing what we should be doing about a multitude of
other problems confronting us. This is a pity for, apart
from the inherent danger that this neglect holds for us, we
are by our sins of omission sullying a proud record in
social achievement which for a time put Canada in the
forefront as a world leader in social welfare matched only,
perhaps, by a handful-maybe only two or three-of the
smaller nations of the world. I think we have lost that
pre-eminent position.

27601-41

I shall not spell out in detail the nature or the magnitude of the problems that I think we are at this moment
guilty of neglecting and with which we must cope if we
are to recover that pre-eminent position, or even if we are
to hold our own and not slip back further, but I will refer
to a number of them although not in any order of priority.
First, there is the matter of our criminal laws-the
Criminal Code, if you wish-allied with which is our
penal system. In case I may be misunderstood in this
connection, allow me to say that some people must be
incarcerated in order to protect society, but they should
not be incarcerated as an act of vengeance. Any incarceration, or any conviction resulting in a penalty, should carry
with it the obligation on society to rehabilitate where
necessary and when possible.
The study recently concluded-I believe only last week;
at least that was the first time I read the conclusions of
the Centre of Criminology of my old alma mater, the
University of Toronto-has just confirmed something
which I and others, including Senator Hastings, have
stated before in this chamber. Most of those in jail in
Canada at this moment should not be there. Putting a
person in jail under our present system merely aggravates
the problem for the rest of us. It does nothing to solve the
problem, but makes the problem greater in the long run,
apart from the obvious fact that any lengthy period of
incarceration usually in turn makes the inmate a better
criminal-not better in a moral sense, but a better and
more accomplished criminal. This is apart from the fact
that it usually makes him more hostile to society than
when he was committed to jail. The fact is that we are
really compounding the factors which led to his antisocial
behaviour in the first place. We do not rehabilitate, and we
do not make it possible for any of the unfortunates concerned to rehabilitate themselves. Witness the difficulty,
for exampleHon. Mr. Walker: Would the honourable senator permit
a question?
Hon. Mr. Rowe: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Walker: Would he tell us what he would do
instead of putting them in jail? For instance, Rose was
freed recently. What would you propose as a substitute for
imprisonment?
Hon. Mr. Rowe: I appreciate the idea behind the honourable senator's question. I think I answered it partly at the
beginning of this part of my speech when I said I recognized, and would be foolish not to recognize, the fact that
society must be protected. Things being as they are, some
people must be put away. We cannot have criminal rapists
at large, we cannot have people attacking little children
and, for that matter, we cannot have people breaking into
banks every second week.
I should like to have more time to deal with that question. I cannot deal with it in the time at my disposal now,
which fact I am sure Senator Walker appreciates. This
whole vast field of criminology is one, of course, that
cannot be dealt with in detail in a speech such as this. We
can only make bald statements of principle, which is what
I am endeavouring to do now.
I was about to emphasize the fact that the average
person leaving jail finds it next to impossible to obtain

SENATE DEBATES
any kind of decent work. That fact in itself is an indictment of our whole system. What is the man to do? I wish
to say now unequivocally-there are many Canadians who
do not recognize this principle, but it is a principle and a
basic fact-that the majority of persons who are sent to
jail are handicapped persons. There are other types of
handicapped than those who happen to be blind, deaf or
mentally retarded. The majority of those who go to jail do
so because they are handicapped in other ways. It is the
responsibility of the society which puts them in jail to
undertake rehabilitation while they are there, and that is
not now being done in Canada.
*

(1550)

Certainly, when he comes out of jail, the state should
not lose interest in or concern for that individual, otherwise the problem will be compounded. He will be back in
jail again, and in the interim he may have done immeasurable damage to property and perhaps life. It is the responsability of the state to rehabilitate those unfortunates after
they come out of jail. I want to state now, as a profound
conviction, that for any person who is released following
incarceration in jail the state should bear the responsibility of providing meaningful employment.
I have spoken of rehabilitation in jail. This is really a
contradiction in terms, because if there is one fact that
should now be clear to all it is that rehabilitation or
reform cannot be accomplished in the all-corruptive environment of custody as we know it. I would interject a
question at this point: What is the explanation for the fact
that at this moment-I am told this by penologists-we
have a larger number of our citizens in jail than does any
other country in Western society? That surely indicates
something. Reform or rehabilitation can only take place,
in my view, in the community at large. Society has a
responsibility to support persons released from jail, and to
assist in undoing the damage caused while in custody,
which should never have taken place in the first instance.
I say again that the Criminal Code should be overhauled
to remove from it what we call, for want of a better word,
non-victim crimes. I could speak for some time on that
subject. Surely, in this day and age, common sense and the
lessons of historv indicate that the time has come for us to
remove from our midst this relic of our puritanical past.
Many people are in jail not because they have injured
anyone, but because they have offended our sense of
morality.
Another social problem about which little has been done
in recent years-and this may surprise honourable senators-lies in the field of child welfare. Increasingly we
have come to recognize that most problem adults, whether
young adults of 19 or 20 years of age or recidivists of 40
years of age, are the innocent victims of neglect and abuse
in early life. What is most frightening-and apparently
this is only now being recognized by society as a whole,
although it has been long known by those working in the
field of social welfare-is the number of helpless children
in this civilized country of Canada, many of whom are
infants of a few days, a few weeks or a few months, who
are physically battered and abused by either their parents
or other adults. This is something about which practically
nothing has been done in our enlightened society.
[Hon. Mr. Rowe.]

March 6, 1974

The latest statistics, which came out a week or two ago,
indicate that there are hundreds of such cases in every
province and, in Canada as a whole, the number is in the
thousands. In actuality, every year in Canada-this is not
rny estimate; it is the estimate of those who have made a
study in this field-several hundred children die directly
or indirectly as a result of the battering administered to
them by sadistic or perverted adults. Often it is administered by parents, many of whom-I say this as one who
has enjoyed the use of alcohol from time to time-are
under the influence of alcohol. Honourable senators, we
should think of this the next time an 18 year-old girl is put
in jail for smoking a marijuana cigarette, or a 16 year-old
boy is put in jail for trading a few marijuana cigarettes
with his chums.
This problem is tied in with our attitude in other areas.
Instead of training our police to be more efficient and
competent in dealing with such social evils-I am not
attaching any blame to the police; they are as much victims of this process as are some of the unfortunate people I
have been speaking about-instead of encouraging our
police to work in close association with medical and other
welfare authorities with a view to making an intelligent
and scientific frontal attack on the evil of child abuse, we
encourage them to dissipate their energies and resources
in utterly meaningless and stupid activities such as keeping a close eye on the so-called massage parlours of
Toronto, Montreal, and perhaps Ottawa, and in scrutinizing newsstands with a view to catching some of the publishers and distributors of girlie magazines.
All this is done in defiance, for example, of the findings
of the presidential commission set up in the United States
a few years ago on obscenity and pornography, in defiance
of the great bulk of psychiatric evidence available on
obscenity and pornography, and in defiance of the experience of the Scandinavian countries and other enlightened
and civilized countries of Europe. We continue to dissipate
our money and our resources in that ridiculous way.
Another major problem with which we have made some
progress, but which is still prevalent-so prevalent, in
fact, as to negate some of the assumptions of democracyis the lack of educational opportunity for so many Canadian children. I know that the program to remove regional
disparity has met with considerable success. I have seen
this happen in my own province. I was part of a team
which implemented such a program in Newfoundland, and
I know what is being done. But it is a long-term program,
and an attack on the lack of educational opportunity for
our children should not have to wait for the major program of regional disparity to be implemented. It should
not be outside the wit and resources of Canada to devise
formulae and programs such as those in several communist countries-and I hasten to add that I am not a communist-whereby every child in Canada-and when I say
"every child," I mean precisely that-will have the opportunity to realize his educational potential.
Equal in magnitude is the problem of the aged. More and
more of our people are living longer, and more and more
they are being encouraged, and indeed forced, to retire at a
relatively early age. It was one thing for a man to retire at
the age of 60 or 65 when, as was the case in my father's
day, the average span of life was 50 years. But it is another

March 6, 1974
March 6,1974

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

thing for a man to be forced into retirement at 60 or 65
when the average span of life is 70, and when so many
people live into their eighties and nineties.
This is another way of saying that an increasing number
of people find themselves with nothing to do for years and
years, with no resources or, at least, insufficient resources
to live on. Thousands of Canadian citizens, people who
worked hard and faithfully to build up this great nation
and make it what it is today-and it is a great nation-are
today living at or below the poverty line. I know I sound
as if I am preaching a sermon. I am not a preacher. Let us
remind ourselves that in this regard man or woman does
not live by bread alone. Thousands of people in their
sixties, seventies and eighties have nothing to do, nothing
to occupy themselves with, and, in many cases, insufficient resources to live a half decent life. This represents a
great Canadian problem.

e

(1600)

Incidentally, because of this policy of forced retirement,
people of the calibre of Senator O'Leary could be put out
to pasture prematurely. In Senator O'Leary's case he could
have been put out to pasture 20 years ago. Surely we need
no further evidence of the utter ridiculousness of such a
policy. This policy of forced retirement deprives the
nation of the knowledge, skills and dedicated service of
men of Senator O'Leary's calibre. Had Senator O'Leary
been a civil servant or bank employee he would have been
vegetating for the last 20 years, instead of making the
great contribution that he has made to Canadian culture
and Canadian civilization.
The fact that there may be unemployment in Canada in
no way invalidates the principle I am enunciating here. In
no way is that an excuse for the inhumane and stupid
approach to this evergrowing problem-and it is an evergrowing problem. Mathematically, it has to grow.
I must confess that it is only in recent years that the
seriousness of this situation has come home to me. For
some years I was deputy minister of the Department of
Public Welfare in my province and later the minister,
during which time I saw firsthand the needs of our elderly
people in what was then one of the most deprived parts of
this nation. I realize the value of institutions, but it is
worth noting here that Canada was one of the first countries, perhaps the first, to start institutionalizing the aged
on a large scale. I am told, too, that we do more of it today
than does any other country. There are, of course, good
aspects to institutionalization, but that, in turn, creates
problems and obligations to which we fail to face up. We
cannot salve our consciences by simply saying to our
elderly people by the thousands, "Here is a good institution. You will be warm; you will be well fed; you will
receive medical attention. Goodbye." We should not do
that in a civilized country.
We have made some progress in protecting the rights of
the consumer, but we have only touched the fringe of the
problem. The fact is that over and over again the Canadian
people-and we are not alone in this-are being exploited
by some of the great corporations in Canada, many of
which are merely the offspring of still larger corporations
in the United States or, for that matter, multinational
corporations. If there is one lesson we ought to have
learned from the past few years it is that the larger and

more powerful the corporation, the greater is its potential
for harm. I realize you cannot damn and condemn all
corporations, or paint them all with the same brush, and I
am not doing so. Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the
experience and the lessons of the last few years. The more
power a corporation possesses, the greater the likelihood it
will abuse that power in the interests of its own greed and
aggrandizement.
It is not an accident that those corporations in the
United States and, by projection, in Canada which have
been guilty of some of the most serious crimes against
society-and I am using these words deliberately-are
among the largest and most powerful in the world. We
had motorcar manufacturers knowingly putting out cars
with lethal defects; drug companies putting out improperly tested drugs, knowing that they had not been properly
tested; tobacco companies defying the legitimate findings
of medical and scientific inquiries by spending untold
millions of dollars to discredit those findings.
Two nights ago on one of our television stations the
head of one of the greatest tobacco corporations in the
world boasted that the tobacco interests combined are now
spending $25 million a year in a research program which,
he alleged, is designed to find out-and I am using his
words now-what, if any, harmful ingredients there are in
tobacco. They are very proud of that. He neglected to
mention that those same companies last year spent
between $300 and $400 million in a program to discredit
those medical findings and, more serious still, to seduce
our young people, our children, into a habit which they
know, and as you and I know, statistically must shorten
their lives. A significant number of children who are being
seduced into this habit through these magazine advertisements and other forms of advertising will, inevitably, die
from cancer of the lung induced by smoking.
Lest anyone think I am biased in this approach or that I
am against the big money interests, the great corporations,
let me say with equal emphasis that the power and activities of some trade unions in our North American society
must be viewed with suspicion and apprehension. In a
democratic society, or a society which calls itself democratic, no comparatively small group of men should have
the right or the power to do to an entire province what
was done to my own province last summer. I say that with
full knowledge that we have here in this chamber two
distinguished representatives of the trade union movement, and I say it with full knowledge of all that the trade
union movement has done for the betterment of human
beings in our society. Having said that, I repeat: No group
ot men should have the right or the power to do what was
done to my province, and what has been done to other
provinces, in recent years.
If there is one lesson which my study of history, which
has been fairly extensive, and my experience in politics,
which, again, has been fairly extensive, have implanted in
my consciousness it is that power, no matter where it is
found-whether in business, politics, organized religion,
or trade unions-is always a potentially highly dangerous
commodity, and one which must be kept under constant
scrutiny and over which there must be ultimate control if
it is not to lead to disastrous abuse of the democratic
process and to devastating corruption.

SENATE DEBATES

*

(1610)

The Canadian people are, by and large, reasonable,
patient and sensible. This nation has great physical and
human resources, but if we allow abuses such as we have
seen, for example, in the profiteering of recent monthsand is there anybody in this chamber who does not think
there has been profiteering in recent months; that the
ordinary people have not been exploited and taken advantage of-to continue unchecked, then there is always the
danger that our people, no matter how patient, no matter
how sensible, no matter how moderate, no matter how
reasonable, will resort to desperate solutions, to desperate
measures, to find solutions.
I am using again extreme examples, knowingly. It was
not Trotsky and Lenin or the handful of Bolsheviks who
made possible the Russian Revolution of 1917 with its
fateful consequences for so many hundreds of millions of
people; it was the corruption in state and in church-let us
never forget that-and in the landed nobility, the Establishment, of Russia. It was they who brought about the
communist takeover. In our own time, it was not Castro
who brought about the communist revolution in Cuba.
What we have seen happen in other countries, including
some democratic countries, in recent years should give us
pause. We are not immune in Canada. We must be on our
guard, we must be eternally vigilant, and we must continue to remove inequities, injustices and abuses wherever
they exist. This is the price we have to pay if we are to
remain a democratic nation in every sense of the word.
Hon. Mr. Walker: Would the honourable senator permit
a question? As he knows, I have admiration for him. I
know of his career in the Government of Newfoundland.
Everybody on the government side seems to have omitted
any discussion of our most pressing problem, inflation.
Would my honourable friend care to say whether he
agrees with the Prime Minister's announcement that there
is nothing that can be done about it by the government, or
would he like to speak on the subject at another time?
Hon. Mr. Rowe: Honourable senators, I would say that I
have normally refrained from making statements that are
economic in nature, for the simple reason that most of my
background has not been in that field; it has been in the
fields of education and social welfare and related areas, as
the honourable senator knows.
I do not see any serious reason to quarrel with the
attitude of the Prime Minister. I know that the Prime
Minister is a dedicated Canadian, and I know that he is a
very intelligent man. If I were to make an invidious
comparison, then from my own knowledge-some of it
personal and some of it indirect-of Canadian political life
and prime ministers I would say that the present Prime
Minister is certainly one of the most-and perhaps the
most-intelligent man ever to have headed an administration of Canada.
Having said that, I realize and appreciate the possibility
that his approach could be wrong. I do not know. But I do
want to remove the thought, in case it exists, that in
saying what I have I was for one minute ignoring the
seriousness of the growth of inflation and the increase in
the cost of living. It affects everybody. We must be concerned about this over-riding problem, and we must take
[Hon. Mr. Rowe.]

March 6, 1974

action against it. I find myself going back to what Plato
said about education-we may disagree about the nature
of it but we all agree on the importance of doing something about it. This is true also of inflation.
Hon. Mrs. F. Elsie Inrnan: Honourable senators, we
have entered the Second Session of Canada's 29th Parliament since Confederation.
I would like to extend my congratulations to Their
Excellencies, the Governor General and Madame Jules
Léger. His Excellency's ambassadorial appointments have
shown qualities that eminently suit him to represent Her
Majesty in Canada. We welcome Madame Léger with her
sincere charm and grace.
Our best wishes go to our former Governor General, The
Right Honourable Roland Michener, and to Mrs. Michener,
that they may have many happy and useful years ahead.
They were popular, beloved and highly respected by
Canadians everywhere.
I am sure all honourable senators wish at this time to
congratulate the Honourable Senator Fergusson on the
excellent and outstanding manner in which she has carried out the duties of Speaker of the Senate. We are all
very proud of our Speaker.
It gives us great pleasure to see the leaders and deputy
leaders in their accustomed seats.
I congratulate also the mover, the Honourable Senator
Robichaud, and the seconder, the Honourable Senator Perrault, of the motion for an Address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne. I listened to their speeches with the
greatest interest. They were interesting and informative,
and we look forward to hearing them speak often in this
chamber.
At this point I wish to extend a warm welcome to the
two new senators who have recently joined us. Senator
Robichaud is well known to all of us. For many years he
was a prominent member of the Liberal Party in New
Brunswick, and the former premier of that province for 10
years. It is a pleasure to see Senator Riley with us. He is a
Prince Edward Islander by birth. I knew his parents very
well, and I know it was the Island's loss when he moved to
New Brunswick. However, I think he retains a warm
feeling for his native province. These gentlemen will contribute much to the deliberations of this chamber, and I
wish them a successful and happy sojourn here.
Honourable senators, we are all familiar with the word
"progress", which means "going forward". I wish to speak
of some of the benefits which the federal government has
provided for Canadian citizens, as it has gone forward in
the path of progress and development.
An old dictionary defined "politics" as "the administration of public affairs in the interest of the peace, prosperity and safety of the state." That is a definition in the
broadest sense. There are many facets to our politics in
this age and one of the most important is the welfare of
the Canadian people, which includes health and all the
social benefits and security which we look for and enjoy
at the present time.
During the regime of this federal government many
important and far-reaching pieces of social legislation
have been introduced and become law. The human needs
of the individual Canadian and his family continue to be

the constant concern of the government led by the Right
Honourable Mr. Trudeau. We are pleased to hear that the
Throne Speech gives promise that the welfare of our
people is again very much the concern of the government.
I am especially pleased to note that the status and rights
of women will be given more consideration in the future.
Honourable senators, I should like at this time to tell
you something about Prince Edward Island, and its transportation problems. It will be remembered that by the
terms of Prince Edward Island's entry into Confederation
in 1873, the province was promised continuous means of
transportation to and communication with the mainland.
In fact, the provision of continual service is a Constitutional obligation. I shall give you a short history of our
communication and transportation service, leading up to
the present.
* (1620)

Until the establishment of the railway car ferry service
in 1916 the iceboats service provided the most reliable, and
sometimes the only, means of winter communication
between Prince Edward Island and the mainland, New
Brunswick and Nova Scotia. In the earliest days of our
history, travel by birch bark canoe in winter through
icebound conditions was the only method of travel. That
was a hardship beyond our imagipation today.
In 1827 the iceboats came into use during the winter
months. These iceboats were simply row-boats with steel
runners. They were hauled by men who had harness
strapped around them. When they encountered open water
they took to the oars. Travel by this means was often most
difficult. Later came the ice-breaking steamers, but even
then there were times when the ice boats had to be
brought back into service because the ice-breaking vessels
could not navigate through heavy ice in the Strait of
Northumberland.
I should like to recall the names of the ice-breaking
steamers which followed the ice boats. First came The
Albert, a wooden ice-breaking ship built in 1874. Then

came The Northern Light, followed by The Neptune, The
Landsdown, The Petrel, and The Stanley, the first steel ship
built by the dominion government in 1888. The Minto,
which was more powerful than The Stanley, was built in
1899. The Earl Grey was built in 1912, I believe.
The Prince Edward Island, more powerful still, was built
in 1915 to work along with The Stanley, The Minto and The
Earl Grey. In 1931, a new ship, The Charlottetown,was built
at Lauzon. She was the most powerful ice-breaker in the
world at that time, but she was lost off the coast of Nova
Scotia during the war in 1941. The Abegweit, a ship rated
at 15,000 horsepower, came next. She is still in service, and
was our only rail car ferry until recently.
The story of these ships fighting the ice fields and ice
packs of the Northumberland Strait, being caught in the
ice for hours and sometimes days, is long and heroic. It
took men of iron nerve to combat such conditions.
From the province of Prince Edward Island-sometimes
called "Canada's front lawn"-we export such products as
potatoes, turnips, fish and some fruits in season, all of
which must reach their markets without delay. These
products are perishable, and cannot be kept for long peri-

ods as is the case with wheat and other grains which can
be stored in granaries.
Honourable senators, I should like to tell you something
about the tourist industry in the Atlantic provinces, particularly Prince Edward Island. Tourism is now our third,
and may soon be our second, most important source of
income. We take a great effort to attract visitors to our
Island, but, unfortunately, they are then very often left
stranded for hours at the ferry terminals.
The importance of this industry to our small province
cannot be too strongly stressed. We have no large industries as do the other provinces, for several reasons. We do
not have easy access to the raw materials necessary for big
industry. We have not the population to supply the necessary labour for large factories, but our greatest problem is
in transportation for what we have to produce and export.
There are now three ferries crossing between Prince
Edward Island and Nova Scotia. We were most fortunate
in having the Northumberland ferries, as they are known,
operating at the eastern end of the province at Wood
Island during the days and weeks of the railway strike
last summer. The men operating these ferries are not
unionized, and great credit must go to Captain Hunter and
his crews for their tireless efforts in keeping their ferries
running day and night, thus helping to avert what might
have been in some instances a real crisis. In the busiest
part of the tourist season there are long lines of cars
waiting for the ferries. During the rail strike of last
summer, cars were lined up for over three miles from the
pier, and drivers almost always had to stay by their cars in
order to retain their priority on the boats.
This past summer, when all the ferries at the western
end of the province were tied up for weeks by the railway
employees' strike, great hardship was caused to many
people; for some it was a real calamity. Some of our
visitors lost their jobs on account of not being able to get
back from their holidays in time. Children were late in
returning to school, and there were even tragedies when
people could not get to sick and dying relatives. The
airlines, of which I will have something to say later, were
not able to accommodate all those stranded by the strike.
Altogether it was a dreadful situation.
There are six ferries running between the Island and
New Brunswick during the summer months; indeed for
almost eight months of the year. The great hardship that
ensues when our ferries are tied up for weeks at a time by
a strike can readily be visualized. Bef ore we suffer further
from crippling strikes, I appeal to those in authority to
devise some machinery by which it will be impossible for
the conditions of the summer of 1973 to recur in the
province of Prince Edward Island.
An adequate ferry service is also necessary to provide
Newfoundland with the necessities of life, such as vegetables, meat and milk. Owing to its terrain, Newfoundland
does not lend itself to agriculture on a large scale. As
honourable senators know, the same modes of transportation are used in getting to and from Newfoundland and
Prince Edward Island -transportation
by water and by
air.
Honourable senators, there has been a great deal of talk
of a causeway being constructed between Prince Edward

SENATE DEBATES
Island and New Brunswick. In fact, some time ago a start
was made on the construction of such a causeway, but that
has been abandoned for the present. However, I have often
crossed on the ferries in winter during storms and blizzards when no vehicle could possibly travel the nine miles
of Northumberland Strait on a causeway. So the Islanders
have mixed feeling about any proposal to link Prince
Edward Island to the mainland, whether it be by causeway, tunnel, or bridge, as they feel they would lose their
individuality and identity as Islanders. We are proud of
being Islanders.
Personally, I do not favour a causeway for we would
still have to maintain a ferry service. There would be
many times when crossing a causeway in winter would be
hazardous, and, indeed, at times impossible, as I have
mentioned-even for a train, although I believe rail service across a causeway was not considered at first.
Two surveys have been made which indicate that the
final clearing of ice west of a causeway would be delayed
in most seasons from four to twelve days. This could easily
cause a blockage that would last many more days-perhaps a month, some authorities say-thus impeding the
launching of boats for the fishing industry, an industry
vital to our economy. It is possible to build a causeway, of
course, but it is not feasible in the opinion of many people.
The two provinces, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland, are in a very different position from that of
any other Canadian province. We are surrounded by the
ocean. Water is the principal method of transportation of
our exports and imports-those necessities of life without
which we cannot survive. Again, I say the ferries are the
lifelines of our eastern island provinces. There is a great
need for more and larger boats to transport more rail cars
and automobiles between those provinces and the mainland of Canada.
Traffic has increased greatly in the past ten years.
Indeed, it has almost doubled, and our transportation
system has not kept up with the services required. It is
inadequate. On the Borden-Tormentine route, more than a
hundred automobiles can be carried at each crossing, but
at many times during July and August at least that
number are left at each side waiting for transportation. I
may say from personal experience that this is a very
annoying situation. On one occasion I sat in a car for six
hours at Tormentine before getting on the boat.
To one travelling to Prince Edward Island by train I am
sure it must appear that we have taken a backward step.
Formerly we had direct train service to various points on
the Island. Now it is necessary to detrain at Amherst,
board a bus and drive 34 miles to Tormentine, get off the
bus while crossing on the ferry, and return to the bus on
arrival at Borden to proceed to Summerside or Charlottetown. The buses have no washrooms. In winter they are
especially draughty and rough. It is not a pleasant trip at
the best of times. This discrimination is unfair. We are the
only province without passenger trains. I strongly urge
that passenger service be restored to Prince Edward
Island. Many people prefer to travel this way.

(1630)

At the present time tourist spending amounts to something over $16 million in Prince Edward Island, and with
greater and more convenient transportation facilities and
increased accommodation in hotels, motels, tourist nomes
and cottages, that amount could be quickly doubled-a
very significant factor in the economy of a small province.
More than 80 per cent of tourists to the Maritime provinces and Newfoundland arrive by automobile, because a
car is necessary in touring these provinces. It is the cheapest way for a family to see the scenery and get from place
to place. Over 500,000 came to Prince Edward Island last
year, the majority of them by the ferries.
Air transportation in Prince Edward Island is in great
need of improvement. The first air mail in Canada was
flown between Charlottetown and Moncton in the early
twenties. Air transportation has increased greatly during
the past years, but the service given is entirely inadequate
to meet the needs of those who use this method of travel.
The connections, even between Maritime centres, are
time-consuming and expensive. Eastern Provincial Airways gives a good service, but it is handicapped in giving
better service by several disadvantages. The airport at
Charlottetown is a travesty so far as airports go. It is a
real disgrace to expect a province to put up with the
accommodation provided for the people coming to and
going from this airport. It is far too small, very few seats
are provided for the crowds who arrive and leave, there is
no provision for food, and there is just nowhere for one to
rest during long waits.
On one occasion in August of last year I waited over
three hours for my flight to Montreal. There was not even
elbow room in the building. The conditions were appalling. Over 200 people were crowded into a space sufficient
for 75; the heat was stifling. The aircraft for which we
were waiting was in Moncton for repair, and no other was
available at the time. Flights were coming in from the
Magdalen Islands and Newfoundland with passengers for
Montreal. We were very crowded and suffered great
discomfort.
The staff work under conditions that in this day and age
should not be expected of anyone. Miss Helen Cox, the
manager, and her staff have no accommodation for their
outdoor clothing, except under their desks or over the
backs of their chairs. The working rooms are small, airless
and altogether depressing. Miss Cox and her staff are most
courteous and obliging, and do all they can to assist the
passengers who patronize the airlines. They deserve much
better working conditions.
I hope these problems will be overcome so that in every
way air travel to and from Prince Edward Island will be a
pleasure, and not just something to be endured as it is
today. In this year, when so much money is to be spent on
various projects, surely some of it can be spent on improving conditions at the Charlottetown airport.

Perhaps this is the year when wie Prince Edward Islanders should assess ourselves. We have just finished our
centennial year. We have looked back a hundred years,
and now we must look to the foreseeable future. We have
progressed from a dependent color'y bo the status of a
province in the Confederation of Canada. We merit the

consideration due us as such, and I hope our government
will provide us with adequate transportation services, so
necessary to our economy and development.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of
His Excellency the Governor General's Speech at the
opening of the session, and the motion of Senator Robichaud, seconded by Senator Perrault, for an Address in
reply thereto.
Hon. Fred M. Blois: Honourable senators, like those
who have preceded me in this debate I, too, wish to pay my
respects and good wishes to Madam Speaker and compliment her on the dignified and impartial manner in which
she presides over this chamber.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Blois: I am sure all honourable senators were
pleased when Madam Speaker was appointed to preside
over this very important office. I believe she is the only
woman presiding over a second chamber in North America.
We wish you, Madam Speaker, continued success and
good health during this second session of the Twentyninth Parliament of Canada. When you were appointed to
this high position all Maritimers were very proud of you.
Your appointment as Speaker of the Senate was a wonderful compliment to you, your own province of New Brunswick and to all the Maritime provinces.
I wish to express my thanks to the Leader of the Government and to the deputy leader, on behalf of the members
of my party in this chamber, for their co-operation with
us. Also, I should like to express my own appreciation and,
I am sure, that of all honourable senators, to the Clerk of
the Senate, the First Clerk Assistant, the Gentleman
Usher of the Black Rod and his staff, all of whom have
been very helpful to honourable senators.
I want to express my personal appreciation to the Liberal Whip, Senator Buckwold, who worked with me when I
had the pleasure of acting as Conservative Whip during
the necessary absence of our Whip, Senator John M.
Macdonald.
In passing on these few compliments, which are sincere
on my part, I am not forgetting the charming page girls

who have been most kind to all of us and who have
brightened this chamber with their smiles and deportment. I know these complimentary remarks are somewhat
unusual, but I feel they are deserved, and, as I stated a
moment ago, they are very sincere on my part.
I congratulate the mover and seconder of the Address to
His Excellency the Governor General in reply to the
Speech from the Throne at the opening of this second
session of the 29th Parliament. I think they did a very
good job, considering the fact that they had to work hard
at it. Naturally, I do not agree with everything they said,
nor with their interpretation of the things mentioned in
the Throne Speech. This is a country of free speech and
everyone is entitled to his or her own personal views.
Personally, I found the Speech from the Throne very
vague, forcing one to try to read between the lines to see
what the government had in mind.
Senator Perrault said that the Speech from the Throne
reflects the concern of the government about the problems
of inflation and rapid price escalation, because of which
seemingly all Canadians must pay prices rising ten per
cent or more every year without end. I remember that as
far back as 1970 Prime Minister Trudeau stated that the
government had inflation licked. In his speech Senator
Perrault said:
So we have in the Throne Speech a number of measores designed to mitigate the effects of inflation.
If we have inflation licked, I wonder why we need these
measures? For some time Mr. Trudeau has said that inflation in Canada is due to international factors, and that
there is little the government can do. In fact, Mr. Trudeau
bas said that if a government cannot cope with selfinduced inflation it deserves to be thrown out. I hope the
people keep that in mind a little later this year, perhaps.
What are the real facts? Sixty per cent of our current
inflation of 9.1 per cent is self-induced. International
inflation may account for little more than one-third of our
total inflation. Furthermore, the domestic or self-induced
component of inflation has been escalating continuously
since the last quarter of 1970, when Mr. Trudeau said that
inflation was licked.
One senator who spoke earlier in our debate referred to
the promises the government made in the Speech from the
Throne read by His Excellency the Governor General. I do
not recall one single definite promise. The Speech states
that the government intends to revise farm prices and
income structure, to guarantee farmers a stabilized income
through joint government-farmer funds. It intends to prevent unreasonable increases in oil prices. It intends to
establish a one-price oil marketing system, to set up a
national petroleum corporation. It intends to develop a
port policy. It intends to change the Bank Act, to facilitate
provincial participation in bank ownership. It intends to

March 7, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

end the discrimination in freight rates. It intends to end
discrimination against women. The details, of course, are
absent. Therefore, for all Canadians only time will tell
whether the intentions written into the Throne Speech
will be translated into the kind of action they appear on
the surface to promise.
e

(1410)

Frankly, I do not put too much faith in intentions. I
presume the government's intentions are good and reliable, but most of us have heard, among our families and
friends, such phrases as: I intended to do so and so but I
completely forgot. I intended to do that but it just slipped
my mind. I intended to, but I didn't have time. Sometimes
the use of "intended" is simply an excuse-and a poor one
at that-for not doing anything definite. We know the old
saying, "The road to hell is paved with good intentions." I
hope that is not going to be true of the intentions contained in the Speech from the Throne.
The Speech generated a very cool reception at best
across Canada, but Throne Speeches have never been
known to meet with widespread enthusiasm. The majority
of the Western premiers who anticipated it would contain
strong and positive responses to concerns raised at last
year's Western Economic Opportunities Conference were
disappointed. Both Westerners and Easterners alike could
hardly feel overly optimistic that their transportation and
energy problems were going to be tackled and resolved
satisfactorily.
Prime Minister Trudeau called the Throne Speech a
matter-of-fact program of action. Obviously it is intended
as a major weapon against escalating inflation, but unless
it is translated into legislation and policies far more effective than those applied to inflation thus far, it will please
very few.
Every other issue aside, the spiralling cost of living still
dominates public concern, and the government's response
to that will be seen as time goes on.
Senator Perrault criticizes the Leader of the Opposition
in the other place for opposing the government's program
to combat the price spiral. He criticizes Mr. Stanfield
because of his having a program of short-term control and
follow-up measures. Senator Perrault said, "These measures have not been specified and no details have been
given." I say to the Senate that surely as a businessman
Senator Perrault would not give away his plans to his
competitors if he were bringing out something new. And
Mr. Stanfield would not give away anything that would
help his political opponents; he would wait until the time
becomes ripe to detail his plans-that is, when he takes
over the government. This is what the senator said:
It is to be hoped that shortly the Leader of the Opposition in the other place will bring himself to providing
a detailed list of proposed controls as well as a list of
specific measures which should follow these controls.
I would gather that he, like myself, hopes and believes
that Mr. Stanfield is to be the next Prime Minister of
Canada and will be in a position to do this, and soon.
I realize that it is quite in order for any member of
Parliament to criticize the Leader of the Opposition in the
other place, but I was a little disturbed when Senator
Perrault mentioned the Stanfield Limited firm and the

price increase made necessary in the manufacture of
underwear over the past few years. I am sorry Senator
Perrault is not in the bouse as I am saving these things,
but that cannot be helped.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: He bas been away since he made those
remarks.
Hon. Mr. Laing: Senator Perrault is ill.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: He should be, after saying that.
Hon. Mr. Blois: I trust he was not suggesting that the
prices of Stanfield garments are unnecessarily high. It is
true that the firm in question is controlled by the Stanfield family, but Mr. Bob Stanfield is not, and never bas
been, an officer or director of that company. No doubt he
is a shareholder and probably quite a large shareholder,
but he has absolutely nothing to do with the formulating
of plans for that company. I am pointing out these facts
because I think Senator Perrault was trying to throw a
certain amount of blame on Mr. Stanfield and also perhaps
trying to degrade the company. Furthermore, apparently
Senator Perrault does not know that the Stanfield company bas been in business for over 100 years. Perhaps it
would be just as well, since he opened up the subject, if I
were to give Senator Perrault some information about this
company. They have constantly paid fair dividends to
their shareholders and any extra profits have been put
aside to purchase new equipment and construct new
buildings, et cetera. Today, as always, it is one of the most
modern and up-to-date textile plants in North America,
with exceptionally good working conditions. I am very
proud of that company, of which for 40 years I was the
general superintendent or mill manager in charge of
manufacturing. I was also a director for 29 years. I am
most proud of the fact that during my years with them I
put into effect the plan of paying equal rates of pay to
male and female employees. I believe I was the first to do
that in Canada, and, as a matter of fact, I think few in
Canada have ever done that, and I am quite proud of that
f act.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Blois: Someone bas asked me when that was.
If my memory serves me correctly, I believe it was in
1947-48.
The Stanfield company had the finest pension plan of
any manufacturing company in Canada, and for the last
few years they have had a guaranteed wage plan for all
their employees. This plan went into effect around 1966-67.
I only wish we had many such manufacturing plants in
Canada, which gives steady employment to 1,000 or more
persons. I repeat that I am saying this particularly for the
benef it of Senator Perrault.
Hon. Mr. McElman: Moreover, they turn out a first-rate
product.
Hon. Mr. Blois: I was not making these remarks for the
purpose of advertising. I was simply getting back at certain people for what I considered to be unfair remarks.
The company does not need the advertising.
Now, I should like to make a f ew remarks on the subject
of unemployment insurance. The Leader of the Opposition
in the other place bas called for a major inquiry into the
operation of the unemployment insurance program. I

SENATE DEBATES
believe that inquiry is necessary, and I will go into that a
little further. I should like to know, as would many other
people, whether there are in fact certain disincentives to
work actually built into today's unemployment insurance
plan. If there are, what are they and what should be done
about them? Is unemployment insurance really an insurance plan or is it a welf are plan in which the contributions
by the employers and employees are simply a new kind of
tax?
When the unemployment insurance scheme was originally set up, it was designed so that the amount assessed
against the employer and the employee would take care of
the payments to be made to unemployed persons, and for a
time such was the case, I believe. This assessment has
increased greatly, but even so the fund is far from carrying itself. In fact, the latest figure I could get shows that
the deficit is now estimated at about $500 million, which is
up from $174 million at the end of 1972. Insurance benefits
paid out in 1972 were $1.87 billion, and in 1973, $2.03
billion, and the unrecoverable overpayments amounted to
$1,064,000. Benefits increased by $15 million in 1973 over
1971, despite a benefit control program run by the Unemployment Insurance Commission that disqualified an
estimated 250,000 claimants.
*

(1420)

Who is paying this deficit under the Unemployment
Insurance Commission program? The answer, of course, is
very plain. It is the already overtaxed Canadian citizen
who is paying this extra arount of money. Therefore, it is
essential to all Canadians that this matter be thoroughly
investigated.
The goveriment does not seem to be worried about the
tremendous cost of the UIC program. You probably
remember the answer that Mr. Trudeau gave when asked
during the last election campaign to comment on the
report that the UIC account was running a deficit of
several hundred million dollars. His reply was, "I don't see
any scandal. What is it? What if it needs another $100
million, or $200 million? What is the magic in numbers?"
Now, that is hardly the type of answer, I think, that a
Canadian citizen should expect from his Prime Minister.
That is just my opinion, of course. As I said earlier,
however, everyone is entitled to his own opinion.
I would like to make a further reference to the 250,000
that the Unemployment Insurance Commission disqualified. I do not think that these persons should share all the
blame. I would now, however, like to mention a few cases
that were brought to my attention recently.
Last summer a businessman came to see me and told me
of two of his staff who were drawing unemployment
insurance payments. They informed him that they were
taking a month off. He explained that they were entitled
to two weeks' holidays with pay. This was the tourist
season when things were busy, and it would make quite a
hardship for him if they went away at that time. He told
them, therefore, that if they would stay on for a couple of
months before taking their holidays he would increase the
holiday pay from two weeks to three weeks. Their answer
was, "We've already been to the unemployment insurance
office, and it's all arranged for us to have four weeks'
holidays."
[Hon. Mr. Blois.]

March 7, 1974

Later I personally talked with these employees. They
said it was no trouble. All they had to do was to get a form
filled out by their boss, and it was no problem. I said, "Did
your boss give you this form?" They said, "No. He refused
to give it to us because he said he needed us. But we told
that to the manager of the unemployment insurance office,
and he said, 'Oh, all right.'" They told me this themselves.
They received four weeks' pay from the Unemployment
Insurance Commission. Now, that is a mighty bad abuse.
Another case brought to my attention a few years ago
was that of a man, a foreman in a plant for many years,
who was severing his long association with the company.
In appreciation they were paying him his regular salary
each month for a full year, and after that he would go on
pension. I talked with him to find out about it, and at first
he said that it was none of my business-and of course it
was not. However, he finally told me that one month
before he was due to retire he went to the unemployment
insurance office and told them he was going to be all
through, and about the years he had spent with the firm.
He did not tell them he was getting paid for a year. They
fixed everything up for him and he told me that he drew
unemployment insurance for 102 weeks. This was his
story. Hie did not tell them he was getting his pay for one
full year, nor did he tell them he was then going on
pension. In my opinion the Leader of the Opposition is
fully justified in asking for a full investigation. There is
something wrong which should be cleared up, not only for
the Leader of the Opposition but for other Canadian
citizens. I am sure that every member of this house,
regardless of politics, is equally anxious to see this business cleared up.
Hon. Chesley W. Carter: Honourable senators, I should
like to begin my remarks by associating myself with the
tributes and good wishes that have been extended to our
new Governor General, His Excellency Jules Léger, and
Madame Léger, as they assume the duties of this high
office. Next, I wish to join in the plaudits you have
received, Madam Speaker, for the great qualities you have
brought to your high office and for the gracious, charming
and efficient manner in which you preside over our deliberations. I should also like to associate myself with those
who have complimented the mover and seconder of the
motion for an Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne on the excellence of both the content and the
manner of their presentations.
The Throne Speech we are now debating focuses mainly
on energy and inflation-two areas of concern which are
global in scope and should be considered in the light of the
drastic changes which have occurred in the world situation in recent months. Every year world problems tend to
grow more serious and beyond man's wisdom and capacity
to solve. Peace and happiness, the two most cherished
desires of mankind, are in ever shorter supply. Social
unrest, crime, drug addiction and terrorism continue to
increase. World population keeps increasing at the rate of
over 70 million per year-much faster than the production
of food. Last year crop failures, floods, droughts, insects
and other causes reduced food production below normal
levels, and hundreds of thousands of human beings in
Africa and Asia died of famine, while countless millions of
others were brought to the brink of starvation.

SENATE DEBATES

The undeveloped countries of the Third World struggle
bravely to expand their economies to improve the unbearably low living standards of their people, only to have
their efforts frustrated over and over again by the everincreasing prices of the necessities they have to import,
coupled with a reduction in the prices of the products they
have to sell. Thus, the gap between the rich countries and
the poor countries continues to widen.
For the rich industrialized nations, inflation was probably the number one problem throughout the Western
World. In Britain, France and other European countries it
increased more rapidly than in Canada. Even in the
United States, with its huge domestic market, inflation
approached 10 per cent. In Japan and Italy it was higher.
Next to inflation, most industrialized countries were
plagued with the twin problems of balance of trade deficits and the instability of world currencies due in large
measure to the fluctuating value of the United States
dollar. This was due in part to the abnormal situation with
which our great southern neighbour has been plagued for
the past two years, and due also to the great distrust of
paper currency by speculators, including the rulers of
Mid-Eastern oil-producing countries, who have much more
money than they know what to do with and therefore try
to convert as much of it as possible into gold. The problem
of unemployment was also becoming increasingly severe.
However, in spite of all these problems, the rich industrialized nations of the world were expanding their economies and improving their living standards, and were in the
process of developing long-range policies and programs
which in time would bring these problems under control
and would enable them to give more help to the Third
World.
*

(1430)

These long-range policies and programs, however, were
predicated on an abundant long-term supply of oil energy
at stable prices. Then came the so-called oil crisis when
oil-producing countries decided to freeze or reduce their
production while at the same time increasing the price
from around $3 a barrel to around $10 a barrel delivered in
London, Tokyo, and Montreal.
The result of this sudden and exorbitant increase was to
disrupt completely the economies of all the industrialized
nations in the world. All their plans for solving inflation,
unemployment and trade deficit problems were knocked
into a cocked hat.
The world picture before this event was not at all pretty,
but today it is much worse. The industrialized nations
must now start all over again to try to put together the
different pieces of their shattered economies and to work
out new adjustments and devise new methods of solving
the new problems that have been created along with the
old ones which have now been rendered much more
difficult.
The Speech from the Throne, therefore, marks not only
the beginning of a new session but, in a sense, the beginning of a new era, because the world as we knew it 12
months ago has undergone permanent change, although it
may be some time yet before the full impact becomes
apparent. However, one thing is certain. Gone forever are
the days of cheap energy and low-priced goods. Many
commodities now cheap and abundant will become scarce

and costly. It is in this global context that the policies set
forth in the Throne Speech should be appraised, particularly those relating to inflation.
Inflation has many causes. There is cost-push inflation,
demand-pull inflation, inflation that results from profiteering or from low productivity when we fail to give an
honest day's work in return for an honest day's pay. And
there is imported inflation. To the extent that inflation is
caused by human greed, selfishness and dishonesty, we all
contribute to it in one way or another.
Inflation is the net result of a multitude of factors
acting together in different parts of our nation and in
different parts of the world at different times and resulting from different causes. There is an analogy between
inflation and the common cold. The common cold can be
caused by hundreds of different types of viruses, and the
remedy for a cold caused by one type of virus will have no
effect on a cold caused by other types. Inflation is not a
simple matter and has no simple solution. However, it is
the rate of inflation that causes concern rather than inflation itself. Two per cent inflation per year has been considered normal under our system for many years. In recent
years even 3 per cent has not been considered excessive,
but last year inflation in Canada approximated 9 per cent.
This is too close to the danger point to be comfortable,
because history has shown that democratic governments
do not survive if two-figure inflation is permitted to exist
over a period of years.
A large part of Canada's inflation is imported, however,
and therefore beyond our control. Canada is a trading
nation. Twenty-five per cent of our gross national product
and a corresponding percentage of our jobs depend upon
our trade with other countries. In 1973 Canada imported
$23.3 billion worth of goods, including $1.6 billion worth of
agricultural products, and there is no way we can escape
importing the inflation that exists in the countries where
these goods are produced.
Neither can we have any control over the changes that
take place in world currencies. For example, the Japanese
yen, the Australian dollar and the New Zealand dollar
have increased in price approximately 25 per cent, while
the German mark has increased approximately 40 per cent
in relation to the Canadian and U.S. dollar. This means
that Japanese and German consumers, as compared with
Canadian consumers, have respectively 25 and 40 per cent
more buying power in the world trading market. This
means, in turn, that Canada has to pay 25 and 40 per cent
more respectively for goods imported from these countries,
while on the other hand Japanese and German consumers
can purchase correspondingly more Canadian goods per
unit of their currency.
This results in a corresponding increase in the demand
for Canadian goods, so that an upward pressure is exerted
on the price of Canadian products for Canadian consumers, because Canadian producers will naturally sell where
the return is highest, and that may very well be the export
market. This has been the case with our wheat, which
went from $1.70 a bushel in August 1972 to $5.66 per bushel
on September 21, 1973. Top quality Durum wheat went
from $1.69 per bushel to $9 per bushel in the same period.
There are other factors, such as the increase in world
population-some 70 million people per year- and a 4.5

SENATE DEBATES
per cent decrease in world agricultural production in 1972
due to drought, floods and crop failures. In addition,
industrial countries are becoming more affluent and, as
their people earn higher incomes, they can afford a better
diet. For example, in 1972 Japan bought from Canada
wheat, fish and grain in quantities two and three times
greater than ever before. Canada's own consumption of
meat-beef, pork and broilers-increased from 144.6
pounds per capita in 1963 to 188.2 pounds in 1972. With the
possible exception of meat rationing, there is nothing that
any Canadian government can do to control any of these
factors. If they freeze prices, the farmers either hold their
products off the market or stop producing altogether, as
did the United States farmers last f all.
How much of Canada'a 9 per cent rate of inflation was
imported it is impossible to calculate, but having regard to
our total trade figures and the increased currency value of
the countries from which we made the purchases, a guesstimate of 50 per cent does not appear to be unreasonable.
On this basis, the amount of inflation generated here in
Canada would be around 4.5 per cent, and if we accept 2.5
per cent inflation as normal, or the irreducible minimum,
that still leaves 2 per cent which we must try to eliminate.
In the world at large inflation is much higher than here
in Canada, and now, on top of it all, comes this tremendous increase in the price of oil which can only make a bad
situation worse for every country. How much worse,
nobody yet knows. A lot will depend on how much wisdom
the industrialized nations can bring to bear on their problems and to what extent they will agree to co-operate and
take unified action to solve them. If they adopt the attitude of "each man for himself and the devil take the
hindmost," then a restriction of world trade is bound to
result at the very time when trade expansion is an absolute necessity. This could well lead to a collapse of the
economies of one or more of the industrialized nations
which, in turn, could bring on a world depression.
Although the grounds for optimism are not particularly
strong, these things may not happen. But we have a duty
to tell the Canadian people the facts as we see them, so
that they will be better prepared to do what they can to
prevent the worst from happening and be better able to
adjust if it does happen.
In Canada inflation has been most evident in the price
of food. As stated earlier, this has been due to increased
world population, world food shortage and increased
demand due to increased affluence in Canada as well as
abroad. The tremendous increase in the price of oil will
push food prices still higher, because the agriculture
industry is one of the largest oil consumers, not only in the
form of oil and gas to operate equipment but also in the
form of fertilizer, which is becoming increasingly scarce
and expensive. Higher priced oil means higher priced food.
We might as well face that fact at once, because there is no
way around it. At was pointed out earlier, the freezing of
prices simply will not work.
*

(1440)

Across-the-board price freezing is a very simplistic solution-too simple, in fact-but it does have a wide appeal,
especially to pensioners and those in the low income
brackets. But if you take time to examine it, you will see
[Hon. Mr. Carter.]

March 7, 1974

that the cure is worse than the disease. As pointed out
earlier, freezing farm prices only results in restricting the
supply. This is what happened in the United States last
year, and we would be foolish not to learn from their
experience.
Besides, a general price freeze without an income freeze
will only feed inflation. When an increased amount of
money chases after a fixed or reduced amount of goods,
the inevitable result is higher prices, either on the open
market or on the black market, which is practically impossible to control.
On the other hand, the only incomes that really can be
controlled are the wages of the blue collar workers. Salaried people can easily avoid income controls by means of
reclassification or salary bonuses. The incomes of professional or self-employed people are practically impossible
to control. Even if an effective means of controlling their
incomes could be found, they would merely curtail their
services. Nothing would be gained, and those depending
on their services would suffer.
A system of income controls would merely put the main
burden of fighting inflation on the blue collar workers,
while the white collar workers would escape with little or
no burden at all. This would be manifestly unfair and
unjust. Also, we must remember that to enforce a system
of price and income controls effectively would require a
greatly expanded bureaucracy, whose additional cost to
the taxpayer could well be as great or even greater than
the savings gained from the price freeze policy.
It is very unfair and very misleading to say that the
government has done nothing at all about inflation. It has
done a great deal. Only last fall the government took
action to stabilize the price of bread and milk. In addition,
a freeze was put on the price of heating oil and gasoline,
export barriers were placed on beef to keep the price from
rising to the U.S. level, and the price of oil was frozen at $4
per barrel. Also, to protect the weak-that is, the low
income consumers, pensioners and those on fixed
incomes-family allowances were adjusted upwards, pensions were indexed and heating fuel allowances were provided. In addition, amendments to the Income Tax Act
removed some 750,000 low income earners from the tax
roll. In general, the government has been pursuing a flexible combination of policies ranging from selective controls to subsidization, while at the same time attacking
inflation at its roots by encouraging Canadians to produce
more of our best commodities.
Controls treat only the symptoms of inflation, not the
causes. One of the best ways of bringing down prices is to
produce more goods and produce them more efficiently.
This is the basis of the government's food policy as
outlined in the following quotation from the Speech from
the Throne:
The Government is developing a policy on food based
on the following objectives:
-an adequate and dependable supply of quality
food for a growing population in Canada enjoying a
rising standard of living;
-reasonable

food prices:

March 7, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

-for the consumer, in not requiring an undue
proportion of income for Canadians to secure a
sufficient and balanced diet,
-for the producer, in providing a return adequate
to encourage production of food items which can be
economically and efficiently produced in Canada;
-a continuing supply and increasing production of
those food products in which Canada has a competitive advantage for export to commercial markets and
also for a contribution to international food aid
programs.
The Government's objectives will guide a re-assessment of existing programs in the areas of agriculture
and fisheries.
As a Newfoundlander, I am very happy to see that the
food prices policy applies to the fishing industry as well as
to agriculture. The government's food policy is designed to
protect the weak, cushion all Canadians against sudden
and disruptive price increases of essential commodities,
and increase production and supply. To this end, the
required legislative action, as outlined in the Speech from
the Throne, can be listed under the following seven
subjects:
-Income stabilization.
-Encouragement for young farmers.
-Upgrading of equipment.
-Incentives to be provided to increase the production
of livestock and to increase Canada's catch of fish for
both Canadian and export markets.
-Orderly marketing, which includes the construction
of new storage facilities for storable crops.
-An improved marketing system, including improvements in grain transportation facilities.
-Improving
the availability of manpower for food
production by co-operative arrangements between
Manpower and Immigration in order to bring job
applicants and employers together.
Honourable senators, this is a very comprehensive and
far-sighted policy. It ensures a fair income to farmers and
fishermen, which will encourage them to stay on the job,
and provides incentives for them to produce as much as
possible. This, together with orderly marketing, will
ensure a stable supply of food products, the consequence
being stability in food prices.
With respect to energy, the Throne Speech focuses chiefly on oil and gas, the two main policy features being the
creation of a nationwide single price market for Canadianproduced oil and the creation of a national petroleum
corporation. The price freeze on oil of $4 per barrel expires
at the end of this month, at which time a new arrangement
will have to be worked out in conjunction with the provinces concerned. It is not realistic to expect the price of $4
per barrel to be maintained indefinitely. The price of
Canadian oil must be permitted to rise to a level that will
enable the oil companies to carry on the necessary
exploration in Canada to find new sources. What that
level is must be determined by the experts. It could very
well corne close to the price of imported oil. But whatever
level is decided upon, the increase must not be sharp and
sudden, as was the case last year. The price rise must be

orderly, controlled, and at a rate that can be absorbed
without further disruption of the Canadian economy.
With respect to the national petroleum corporation,
although I am a believer in free enterprise I do not think
the government really has much choice in this matter.
World supplies of oil, as well as practically all other
energy sources, are controlled by a few large multinational
corporations. In Canada all the big oil companies are
foreign-owned, and big governments are also now getting
into the oil business, with the Arab governments leading
the way.
These oil companies are big monopolies. They have their
own market structures and their own carriers. Some even
have their own retail outlets, thereby controlling their
product all the way from the wellhead to the gas pump.
They set their own prices and can do pretty much as they
like. Though they call themselves free enterprise, their
performance since the oil crisis started bas proved they
are not responsible enterprise.
The government bas a duty to protect the Canadian
economy and the interests of Canadians generally, which
means stable supplies of oil at reasonable and stable
prices. The manipulations and performance of the oil companies during the past eight months have shown that
these oil monopolies cannot be trusted. The government
would be remiss in not taking whatever steps are open to
it to minimize the extent to which the Canadian people are
at their mercy.
*

(1450)

Also, since we will have to pay higher prices for Canadian oil and since we can now generate the necessary capital
internally, why shouldn't we own a chunk of the oil
industry in Canada and have some say in its decisions?
Whether this corporation will be 51 per cent owned or 100
per cent owned, or whether shares will be available to the
provinces, will not be known until the legislation is before
us, but the idea is sound, and in principle I think it will be
generally approved.
Canada really needs an overall energy policy embracing
all forms of energy sources-oil, gas, coal, hydroelectric,
tidal power, geo-thermal and nuclear sources. We must
remember it takes energy to produce energy. It is the net
amount of energy produced that is really important. We
must, therefore, search for ways of getting maximum
output with minimum input. We must also search for the
best mix of various types of energy having regard to the
different needs and the peculiar characteristics of the
Canadian economy. For example, it may be better to gasif y
coal and substitute it where possible for oil, which is
needed so urgently for the petro-chemical industry and for
the production of so many commodities, ranging from
plastics to acrylic paints, which have become so essential
to our everyday life. It is for this reason that I welcome
the emphasis which the Throne Speech places on scientific
research, technology and innovation.
In one sense the so-called energy crisis bas been a
blessing in disguise. It bas forced us to face the fact that
certain resources, such as oil, gas, copper and other commodities which we take for granted, are in limited supply,
not only in Canada but in the world at large. The need for
conservation bas been dramatically demonstrated, and we
have already begun to put it into practice-turning off

SENATE DEBATES
unnecessary lights, turning dlown thermostats and driving
at reduced speeds. We have not really suffered from this
slight modification of our life style. instead we have benefited, because we have done more walking and cycling, we
have created less pollution, and ail this is beneficial to our
health.
It seems to me that we now have a golden oppurtunity to
take a good look at our lit e style generally and ask ourselves some questions about it. Huw much of it is really
necessary or beneficial? Can we afford to go on wasting su
much of our resources when tellow human beings in s0
many parts of the world are suffering from lack of them?
What are our duties and obligations as custodians of these
resources for future generations? Is it sensible to waste
precious energy and resources building obsolescence into
our products and producing "throw away" goods, gimmicks and other things that we cuuld well do without,
while at the same time undermining our health and
destroying our environment?
Experience bas shown that once our needs are satistîed
an excess of material possessions does not add to our
peace, happîness or contentment. Reality, symbolized by
the oil crîsis, us geing to force a change in our lîfe style
whether we wîsh it or flot. Isn't it niuch better to do it
voluntarily at our own convenience rather than have
sudden readjustments forced upon us? I believe that if we
put this proposition to those Canadians who are well
above the poverty level, that challenge will be accepted.
Another biessîng of the oil crisis is that it has brought
home to us ail how wonoerfully fortunate we are to live in
a country like Canada, a country that is able to produce its
own food suppiy and can become sîcîf-sufficient in energy
resources. We should thank God for that, every day of our
lives. and impress it upon our chîldren.

They are ready to believe in ethics and hunesty. But
to improve our system, we must improve ourselves.
That's the challenge.
But just huw important is Lt to confront this challenge and begin to do something about it? 15 it something just nice to do or is it imperative? 1 submit that
corrupt politics, shabby ethies, and widespread dishonesty are deatb-dealing to human freedom and te
democratic guvernment. To reverse the downward
drift we have been witnessing for a decade of lawless
violence and lawless guverfiment wiil be life-giving.
One organization wbicb is setting out to do something about declining ethics in the U.S. us called
American Viewpoint Inc., and its premise goes to the
heart of the matter. It is: "Let's Make America Honest
Enough to Stay Free."
This is nut more rhetoric. Histury makes it amply
clear that the alternative tu a decent and workable
standard ut bonor and honesty in any suciety îs uîut
disorder; it is enforced discipline; it is repression; it is
the authoritarian state and, in the end, dictatorship.
That is wby the theme, "Let's Make America Honest

it is crucial to do sometbîng about il now. It may

The danger is plain to see. It us not an overstatement
tu say that it is as great a challenge te Amerîcan

hoýdone indivîdually to restore bigher ethical conduct

needed. I make this suggestion:
Shouldn't every major civic urganization in the
U.S.-like the League ut Wumen Voters, the Junior

I believe that if the government and we as parliamentaru-

March 7, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

ans have the courage to issue this challenge to the Canadian people they will accept it.
*

(1500)

Hon. Edward M. Lawson: Honourable senators, I felt
somewhat handicapped with respect to commenting on the
Speech from the Throne, but while I did not hear it when
it was being delivered here in this chamber last week I
now have the benefit of the neutral, objective and
unbiased analysis by the government leader, and I feel
better equiped to comment on it.
I want to say at the outset that I accept the excellent
presentation of the government's record made by the government leader. I think that it was an outstanding recitation of the accomplishments of the government, and an
excellent comparison of its record with that of other countries. The only question is: Is it a valid comparison? It is
like someone asking, "How is your wife?" and getting the
reply, "Well, compared with whose?" I wonder if it is a
valid comparison, or if it would be more valid to ask about
the government's record in relation to the problems that
exist in the country.
I see that the government is going to deal with the area
of inflation. I read with interest the sentence about the
government's developing "a policy on food based on the
following objectives," and the part about "enjoying a
rising standard of living." I am curious to know who these
people are who are enjoying a rising standard of living.
Certainly the people on fixed incomes are not enjoying a
rising standard of living. The pensioners are not, to take
one side of the spectrum. Judges, whose last increase was
approved here three or four years ago, have not had a
rising standard of living. On the contrary, as a result of
inflation eroding that increase they are getting 25 or 30 per
cent less today than they did two or three years ago.
Honourable senators, in the trade unions I have the
privilege to represent there is a kind of quiet revolution
going on, but it is ceasing to be quiet-certainly among
trade union members. In times past they would go with
the recommendation of the trade union officer that the
increases negotiated were reasonable within the total
framework. The off icer would make a f ew comments and a
recommendation about retroactive pay, and so on, and
generally the majority would agree with the recommendation and go back to work. When such an officer now
presents a recommendation to a group of workers he will
have difficulty completing the recommendation before
there are 50 people at each microphone, each with his own
private list. It will be said, "Two years ago you got me a
dollar an hour increase, which sounded like an outstanding increase. I netted 7 cents an hour out of it, and when
you negotiated an increase of 10 per cent last year that
hardly kept me even. We now have to talk in terms of
having at least 10 per cent to maintain our standard of
living. If we are to improve our standard of living, then go
and get us 12 per cent or 15 per cent, because we cannot
keep pace with inflation." Each one has his own handful
of statistics with predictions of what things will be like
for the future.
That is why today many contracts are being turned
down-the union members are concerned about runaway
inflation. Their concern is still a basic one of security, but
they also want the security of knowing that the increases

they negotiate, the wages they receive, which were considered fair, are not being rapidly eroded from under them.
That is why I think it is safe to say that the new thing that
will be negotiated and obtained, even if it takes strikes to
obtain it, will be a cost of -living clause. I think it is a fair
prediction to make that in the majority of contracts negotiated in the next two or three years, every collective
agreement will contain a cost of living escalator clause of
some kind as a means of protection or security for the
work force. The unions will talk in terms of this increase
in the cost of living. Those organizations that have bargaining power, that have recovery power, are able to
negotiate these kinds of clauses, but it seems that while
progress has been made in the area of inflation, it is
impossible to tell that inflation is solved, mostly solved, or
ceases to be a proolem.
It seems to me, if we follow what Senator Carter recommends, that there is going to be more honesty in government, and we should acknowledge that there are certain
percentages of inflation that we cannot eradicate and we
should develop a simple cure. Perhaps to every fixed
income we should attach a cost of living clause that would
keep pace with inflation, and thus maintain the standard.
We should encourage or develop, through the federal
Department of Labour, cost of living escalator clauses that
will be uniform across the country. That would be a more
honest approach than the present one.
I am pleased to see that there is concern expressed by
the government in respect of agriculture, in particular.
This is my interest. I wonder how they are going to go
about this. The best example I can give is that not so long
ago in the province of British Columbia there was a front
page news story of a feed lot that went out of business. It
was not a big one. The man put through about 5,000 head
of cattle a year-perhaps five million pounds of beef. He
announced that he was going out of business because he
simply could not afford to continue.
This gentleman is a friend of mine, and I went out and
talked to him. He told me that in the previous year he paid
$35 a ton for hay, and now it was costing him $90 or $100 a
ton. He said that molasses went up from $38 to $78 a ton.
There were all these additional costs, and it was simply
impossible, because of all these factors, to continue.
I would be more impressed with the government's statement that they are going to counsel people, talk with the
provinces and concern themselves about this, if I had not
got the answer that I did from this farmer. I asked him,
"Didn't the federal government come and talk to you
about this?" He said, "No." It was widely publicized,
although he was dealing with only five million pounds of
beef a year.
It seems to me, if there had been a genuine concern, that
someone from the federal Department of Agriculture
would have knocked on that man's door and asked how his
production could be kept going, what were the problems
and how the government could help. One of the problems
that that man talked about was that the price, which had
gone to over a dollar a pound, had dropped to 75 cents and
then settled at about 82 cents a pound. There was so much
missing-20 cents a pound-and he knew he did not get it,
and I know that the consumers did not get it. So there is
some mystery as to where that difference of 20 cents a

SENATE DEBATES
pound disappeared to. Again, if we are to believe what is
said in the Speech from the Throne, someone should have
been there checking to find the answer, to see how they
could keep this operation going.
I am delighted to hear that the government is talking
about encouraging new farmers. That is very important.
However, it seems to me that a first step would be to keep
those who are in the business, and who have many years
of experience, going.
There is an excellent study that I would refer the government to. It was prepared for the Greater Vancouver
Regional District, and it concerns the Delta farm lands.
The first thing they discovered about farmers was that
about 50 per cent were absentee owners. When each
farmer was interviewed as to whether he was going to
continue or leave, the answers went something like this: "I
am leasing this farm from the National Harbours Board,
and they are a tough landlord. I have a lease for three
years, I don't know whether I am going to get it renewed,
and I don't know at what rent I am going to get it." They
talk about the Hydro owning some land, and about all
these absentee owners. They talk about the concern there
is over traffic. There is more concern about moving people
than there is about preserving these farm lands. They talk
about the money being made available, and the programs
of farm assistance.
I am troubled because in the Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture, when we talked about that and asked
how much money was available, we found the government
did not have any available. They were going to guarantee
that the banks would make some money available. When
we check with the banks we find that they are going to
make money available only to the extent that they are
going to allow for a particular commodity which is helping
farmers, but if there are more attractive loans to make
they will divert the money there.
It seems to me that if it is talking about really helping or
encouraging farmers, the government should set aside a
fund. There should be some millions of dollars available to
legitirate farmers who want to be involved, and at fixed
rates of interest. It should not depend on the banks' desire
to make loans to more attractive borrowers. If we are
going to encourage young people to go into farming, if we
are going to help thern to make farming more productive,
we need to talk about making money available.
Farmers talk about equipment prices, which can be
traced partially to labour. The cost of labour is a major
factor in the production of equipment. However, it seems
to me that by way of taxation or long term loans greater
assistance could be given to encourage people to go into
farming. When that has been done, we will have a collective responsibility. We cannot keep talking about the
"romance of farming," and about all the things we are
doing for the farmers, while actually doing nothing for
them.
I am not talking about grain farmers in the Prairies. I
am not competent to talk about them. I am talking about
the small farmers, the beef farmers, in the area I come
from in British Columbia.

It seems to me that a genuine effort should be made to
really come to grips with the problem, and make the kind
of assistance available that would guarantee a reasonable
salary to a farmer. There must be a number of ways to
accomplish this. There must be some way to provide the
farmer with a pension, especially in British Columbia
where he cannot now sell his farm to provide his pension.
There must be some provision to allow the farmer to earn
a pension, in the same way as anybody else. Perhaps it
could be done by exempting the farmer frorn income tax
until he earns $15,000 or $20,000 annually. There are all
kinds of experts around to make the simple calculations to
determine a fair rate of return, to provide for a pension,
and to do the things necessary to make farming more
attractive, to make a greater supply of food available, and
to make the kind of things talked about in the Throne
Speech a reality. Each time that I talk to farmers about the
kinds of problems they have, however, it seems that not
much is being done in terms of coming to grips with them.
I must say that I agree with the federal Minister of
Agriculture, the Hon. Eugene Whelan, when he talks
about an increase in the price of milk. Here there is an
emotional reaction; we have some association and involvement. I state unequivocally that milk today is still the best
food buy. In 1944, which was the basis for the calculation
that we made, one hour's work at the average wage would
buy four quarts of milk. In 1974 one hour's work at the
average wage will buy eight quarts of milk. So it is a fair
statement to say that the cost of milk, related to wages, is
half its cost 30 years ago, and a quart of milk is still only
half the cost of a quart of beer. So if there is a price
increase on milk, there is little point in reacting emotionally. It is still the best food value, and the minister was
correct when he said that the price increase was a valid
one.
I see that they are going to do something about making
improvements in Canadian grain rail transportation
capabilities. That is good news for the people in British
Columbia, and certainly for Vancouver harbour. Some
people suggested that we finally had our third crossing
there, because you can now walk across the harbour of
Vancouver on the decks of ships. But that is not a new
experience. We have had the harbour filled with ships
before. The last time it was caused by a longshoremen's
strike, or a grain workers' strike. The longshoremen are
not on strike on this occasion, and the grain workers are
not on strike. There is lots of wheat available, and the
harbour is filled with ships.
If we had a longshoremen's strike we would have an
emergency session, and a measure, which I would support,
legislating them back to work, because we cannot interfere with the nation's commitments in world trade, the
shipment of wheat, and so on. But nobody has raised a
voice about the situation in British Columbia. Nobody has
inquired as to what the problem is, or what the cause of it
is. My information is that the CNR finds that it can make
a higher rate of return by making boxcars available for
other produce. So there are not enough boxcars available.
If that is true, or whatever the reason may be, I would like
to be told in the Speech from the Throne that something is
going to be done about it.

March 7, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

Let us have some federal representation in Vancouverwe should have had it last week, the week before and the
week before that while the ships were tied up-demanding
to know the cause of it. We should have found a solution,
moved this grain crop, and maintained our commitments
in world trade. We should have put additional people to
work, thus taking them off the welfare rolls. We do not
want a lot of words about this. We need some positive
action by somebody who is going to short-cut all the red
tape, go in, solve the problem, and get the ships moving.
Failing that, we should pave over the ships and have our
third crossing over Vancouver harbour.
Those are some of my concerns. I do not want to spend
too much time on this, but I do want to say that I thought
an excellent presentation was made by the government
leader, which was reinforced by Senator Carter, on the
question of wage and price controls. I endorse that presentation. I cannot think of anything more futile at this time
in the nation's history, in the light of the experience of
other countries which have clearly demonstrated that
wage and price controls will not work, than to adopt them
in this country. We have the American experience with
controls. As quickly as they accomplished them, they are
removing wage and price controls. They simply have not
worked. They are finding all kinds of problems and complicating factors.
I do not propose to deal with the energy crisis, but in the
United States, by cutting down the mileage and the speed,
they have, in effect, cut the wages of our people, of truck
drivers, across the United States by 15 or 20 per cent. They
have a perfect formula for getting a wage increase of 5.5
per cent per year, and not more than that, and yet a
separate issue, a side issue, has cut the wages by 15 to 20
per cent.
I have always said that the greatest thing that has
happened in this country is to have the United States as a
neighbour. They are good friends, good neighbours, and
yet we can look across the border and see a preview of our
future five or ten years from now. Surely the lesson
should not be how to make bigger and better mistakes
than they have made. I think that Senator Martin's outline
on the question of wage and price controls-that they have
been totally and hopelessly useless in dealing with the
problems we have in this country-is accurate and true.
They are not even worthy of consideration.
There are some other simple things that I think the
government should do. I notice that every time a minister
makes a speech, we get a copy. Instead of the minister's
writing to give me a copy of his speech I wish that just
once he would write to say, "I made a speech and I have
some very strong views, but I want to know your views on
how to solve some of these problems."
For example, there are housing problems. I do not know
it as a matter of fact, but I understand that federal moneys
are available for organizations, trade unions, clubs and so
on that can put up certain amounts of seed money. They
can build housing for "retirees." They can get financing to
the extent of from 80 to 100 per cent. They can do these
kinds of things, but not once in the 20 years that I have
represented a trade union have I ever received an inquiry
from the government asking, "Is your organization prepared to sponsor this kind of housing? If we made financ-

ing available, to the extent of 80, 90, or 100 per cent, would
you put up the seed money to start the project?" Not once
have I received such an inquiry, and I don't know of any
other organization of a similar nature in Canada that has.
I think there are many Canadians in and out of organizations who are willing to help, and who wish to participate
and be a part of the solution, and not just a part of the
problem. Instead of being asked what we can do to participate or help, we are being informed by the various
speeches of the ministers of all the solutions they have.
I am sorry I missed Senator Perrault's presentation. I
believe he had some things to say about the role of women,
and I am pleased to see that the Speech from the Throne
makes comments about that. I think that Senator Perrault
made an excellent presentation when he talked about
including them under the Canada Pension Plan as part of
the work force, but I think he did not go far enough,
because if under federal legislation workers are entitled to
paid statutory holidays, then it should also be provided
that housewives are similarly entitled. There should also
be a provision giving them paid annual holidays, perhaps
with the option of taking them with or without husbands.
Perhaps a break from the "old man" might make them
better equipped to deal with the problems of the future.
In concluding my brief remarks, I would only say with
respect to any program the government wants to present
that I am not interested in a review of the problem. We
know the problems. I am interested in a review of solutions or a program of solutions, and as one senator I stand
ready to support those kinds of constructive programs.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: I wonder if I may ask the honourable senator a question? I was interested in hearing him
discuss, in the earlier part of his most interesting remarks,
the general situation with which the Western world is
really confronted-the constantly rising inflationary process; the spiralling cost of living in the Western world, as
well as in the rest of the world; the increasing demands for
higher wages to meet the legitimate commitments of
people who are in the work force and who are on fixed
incomes; rising incomes for people who are not on fixed
incomes; and, indeed, to keep the machine going, the rising
profits in what we call the successful free enterprise
system.
*

(1520)

The honourable senator is somewhat of a philosopher,
and I compliment him when I say that, because he does
take a broad view of the society in which we live. I wonder
whether he has any comment to make about the fact that
there are many people-and I think I am included among
them-who sometimes get very depressed about the possibility that what we are doing, in the Western world and in
the developing countries, is pricing our system out of
existence.
I say frankly that I am not in f avour of state ownership
or state control, or of a socialist system that will dampen
down enterprise. That is the most disastrous kind of thing
that free people could have to contend with. But is the
honourable senator concerned about the situation that
may be put in this most simple way: We seem to proceed
for a while on a great boom and then, all of a sudden, the
bottom falls out and we have what is called, in the language of the street, a "bust." Where do we stand on

SENATE DEBATES

problems of this kind-particularly in a house that was
presumably set up to give serious consideration-second
thought consideration-to major problems?
Have we any concrete, positive solution to this problem
that is not simply a matter of inflation in Canada, thecost
of living, the cost of housing in Ottawa or in Vancouver, or
wherever it may be? Have we any solution to the larger
problem? Perhaps that is too difficult a question to put to
anybody, but what the honourable senator said was so
interesting that I thought I would put it to him.
Hon. Mr. Lawson: I will attempt to answer this question
as briefly as I can. I share your views on the situation,
senator. I am not a socialist, and I do not want to see a
socialist system come into effect. However, we have a
tendency to think that the free enterprise system is perfect and without fault, and that it will find a way, that it
is the most efficient system. I think there is too much of a
tendency to legislate. Everybody wants to legislate. We
should learn from the British experience. They had a real
problem of 2 million man-days lost per year. They legislated with respect to it, and now they have 20 million mandays lost per year, so obviously legislation is not the
solution. I therefore reject the suggestion that legislation
is the answer to every problem.
I do think that the federal government has an important
role to play at the grass roots' level, by going to that level
and giving research assistance, and those kinds of things,
to make the free enterprise system a better system.
I know, from contact with working people, no matter
what is said about everyone wanting to be on welfare and
social assistance, that the majority of people want to do an
honest day's work for an honest day's pay, but they want
to do it with the feeling of security that it will be there
tomorrow and the next day, and not with the thought in
their minds, "Will the company be in business? Will it
succeed? Will I have pension provisions?"
If we attack the problem on the basis of security, and
give the working man security so that he can devote more
of his working hours to being a better workman, and being
more efficient so that the company is more successful,
then the company will benefit and it will be able to pay
for the kind of security the workman wants, and the
country as a whole will benefit through increased productivity. We do not need a whole lot of legislation, but we do
need somebody who listens, and somebody who really
cares, at that level-the foundation level.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: May I put a question to the bonourable senator? I was interested in his encouragement of
a built-in cost of living escalation clause in labour contracts. During my experience as a negotiator at the
municipal level, at a time when wage increases were really
ahead of cost of living increases, such a suggestion was
anathema. Whenever we said, "Well, why don't you link
your wage increases with the cost of living?" the unions
rejected it. Is it possible tc do it when things go against
negotiated increases because of the higher cost of living,
which escalates too rapidly, and not do it in the reverse
situation?
I would be interested in Senator Lawson's comments,
not from a critical point of view but just to see whether in
[Hon. Mr. Connolly.]

March 7, 1974

fact it is fair to expect this now. when it is not acceptable
when things are reversed.
Hon. Mr. Lawson: I think you know, Senator Buckwold,
from your negotiating experience, that timing is very
important, and when it was previously proposed it was not
the right time. I am totally convinced, because of the
run-away inflation in the country and the fear in the
minds of working people, that they will not only accept,
but will demand, cost of living escalation clauses. So I
think this is the right time to introduce them, and if they
work fairly then their acceptability will be established,
even should there be a down-turn, and it will be a better
way to deal with the future.
Hon. John Morrow Godfrey: Honourable senators, I
wish to speak on the subject of social security. So far I
have not been able to speak on any subject in this chamber
without feeling that I had to declare my special interest or
bias, and today is no exception. For over two years I was
co-chairman, with Dr. Gerald Fortin of the University of
Quebec, of a Task Force on Social Security appointed by
the Canadian Council on Social Development. This task
force presented its report to the council at its annual
meeting in September 1973.
The members of the task force represented a broad
spectrum of special expertise on this subject. As co-chairman I was in one respect unique, in that I could not be
considered an expert in any way in this field, so that it can
be said that my contribution to the representative nature
of the task force was by representing the general public. I
had, however, one strong plus factor in that my interest in
the subject far exceeded my ignorance, and after reading
a great deal of literature on the subject-including the
reports which had been previously issued by various committees-I eventually felt qualified to express an opinion.
I might say that my original "bible" on the subject was the
Report of the Special Senate Committee on Poverty,
chaired by Senator Croll. Its background material, statistics and recommendations were invaluable, We also found
the Castonguay-Nepvew report very helpful.
The task force did not have the resources available to
the Senate committee, or to Messrs. Castonguay and
Nepvew. I do not think our report suffered to any great
extent because we had to rely heavily on the research of
those committees and others rather than on our own original research. There was no particular advantage in having
that research duplicated. We got along very nicely, in fact,
with the assistance of Dr. David Ross, a member of the
staff of the Canadian Council on Social Development, who
was not always available full time.
Due to the generosity of the Nuffield Foundation, we
were able to call upon and benefit from the knowledge and
opinions of a group of foreign experts who met with
Canadian ones and members of the task force for a threeday conference at Ste. Adèle. These foreign experts came
from all over the world-Australia, New Zealand, the
United States, Great Britain, France, Switzerland, West
Germany, Yugoslavia and Israel.
It would take hours for me to discuss all the problems
we considered while preparing our report. All I want to do
this afternoon is touch on one particular aspect.

March 7, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

During the two years the task force was engaged in its
activities, and since, I have been strongly impressed by the
woeful ignorance of the public generally-and, might I
say, of my friends and acquaintances in particular-as to
the type of people who receive social assistance payments
in Canada. I believe that education of the public in this
respect is the single most important thing that must be
done before we can have a politically acceptable and
adequate social security program.
*

(1530)

After I had become educated on this subject myself, I
used to say that a reactionary can be defined as a person
who honestly and sincerely believes that 80 per cent of the
people on welfare are no-good bums who could work if
they wanted to work and who, when you tell him that all
the statistics are to the contrary, honestly and sincerely
does not believe you.
When I gave the foregoing definition to the president of
one of our largest financial institutions, his answer was,
"Well, what about 70 per cent?" I usually get a good laugh
when I tell this story to those particularly knowledgeable
in the field. When I tell it to many of my personal and
business friends, however, the more typical reaction is
that which I had from the chief executive officer of
another very large financial institution. He said to me,
"Surely it must be at least 50 per cent."
Now all this is very disturbing. The Senate committee
report set out the situation clearly. It showed that in July
1970, 84 per cent of the adults who depended on welfare:
-require
assistance simply because they are not
capable of earning a living. They are the ones left
behind by our economic system-the elderly, the sick,
the disabled, and women in charge of families which
require their presence in the home. A few others,
about three per cent of welfare recipients, are members of the labour force, but work at jobs which do not
pay them enough to live on.
The study done by S.G. Peitchinis in October 1968 on
the employability of social welfare recipients in Calgary
who were out of work showed that only 5.4 per cent of
assistance cases involved employable people. The Honourable Marc Lalonde delivered a major speech pointing out
that the very large majority of people on welfare are not
rip-off artists and, as the Senate report points out
-the
number of poor who "beat the system" is
extremely small, almost certainly less than two per
cent, a rate which compares favourably with institutional chiselling on expense accounts.
While many reactionaries just do not want to know the
truth, there are many other people, not all of whom I
would describe as reactionaries, who have been so brainwashed and have so swallowed all the old clichés about
people on welfare, that they are not receptive to facts and
will not accept the Senate committee's and other statistics.
These people would be more sympathetic to helping those
on welfare if they could be persuaded as to the true
situation. That is why it is so important that the true facts
about the type of people on welfare-that over 80 per cent
are unemployable for reasons beyond their control-bear
repeating on every possible occasion, so that they may get
through to the general public.

Unfortunately, an issue bas arisen in the last year and a
half which accentuates the problem. I am referring to
unemployment insurance. I am convinced that the situation has been grossly exaggerated, but the fact is that
there have been legitimate complaints and there have been
rip-offs. It seems that everyone knows or, what is more
likely, hears of some particular case of abuse of the
system. Unemployment insurance is certainly being
blamed, although often unjustly, for difficulty in obtaining labour, in spite of the high rate of unemployment. It is
very easy for people to assume, particularly those who
want to, that if there is abuse of the unemployment insurance scheme there is similar abuse by welf are recipients.
It is a real tragedy that unemployable poor may suffer
substantial injustice because of abuses of unemployment
insurance by groups of people who, by no stretch of the
imagination, could be regarded as poor. I am referring to
many youths, well compensated seasonal workers and, of
course, middle-class housewives, who are very happy to
take protracted rests on unemployment insurance from
time to time.
The task force, from the very start, was oriented toward
a guaranteed annual income, and some of us certainly
were initially under the impression that this would
replace most other types of social assistance. The greatest
impact made by the Nuffield Conference was in convincing us that the guaranteed annual income was not a
panacea, and that its introduction would not eliminate the
need for the continuance of social service and insurance
programs, as well as social assistance programs such as
family allowances and old age security pensions.
We were very conscious of the problem I have already
referred to-that the public is less than enthusiastic about
schemes which help the employable, while professing full
sympathy for those who cannot work because of being
sick, disabled or old. This was one of the reasons the task
force parted company with the Senate committee report,
and was much more influenced by the recommendations
in the Castonguay-Nepvew report.
The Senate committee would have set the basic allowance rates under the guaranteed annual income initially at
70 per cent of the poverty line for each family, and
reduced it at the rate of 70 cents for every dollar of other
income. The underlying philosophy of the Senate committee report of establishing a negative income tax at 70 per
cent of the poverty line is to provide an incentive for
people to work. It seemed to the task force, however, that
it was unfair that unemployables, who are not able to
supplement their basic allowance through earnings,
should be treated in the same way as employables and,
furthermore, that they should receive allowances that
were below the poverty line.
The Castonguay-Nepvew plan, on the other hand, provides for a negative income tax scheme which is divided
into two stages. Stage one is essentially for the employable
and provides for a smaller basic allowance with the first
$2,500 of earnings taxed at a rate of only 33 cents on the
dollar, compared to the Senate committee's rate of 70 per
cent. Stage two is essentially for the unemployable, and
sets the basic allowance at a higher level, and any earnings are taxed at a rate of 100 per cent.

SENATE DEBATES
A signiificant feature of the Castonguay-Nepvew plan is
that the decision as to whether a worker belongs in stage
one with the lower allowances, or stage two with the
higher, is left to the individual himself. Here is where the
task force parted company with the Castonguay-Nepvew
plan. The task force felt that the entire higher support
plan for the unemployables could be jeopardized if the
general public thought, as they certainly do about unemployment insurance, that there would be rip-offs by those
who could work if they wanted to by their electing to
draw the higher allowance. Unlike Castonguay and
Nepvew, we recommended that stage two, providing for
the higher income plan at the poverty line, be available
only for those for whom it was intended, namely the
unemployable, and that there must be some standard set
as to who was entitled to it. Stage one, for the employables, would be two-thirds of the poverty line, thus being
slightly less than the Senate committee's 70 per cent of the
poverty line for everyone.
After we had reached our conclusions and the report had
been written, but before it was made public, the Honourable Marc Lalonde brought out the government's Working
Paper on Social Security in Canada. The Lalonde plan and
the task force proposals, although arrived at independently, have much in common in that they have similar income
support programs. They both recommend a higher level of
basic support for those unable to secure employment, and
a lower level of support, but with built-in w ork incentives,
for those who can secure employment.
While I have the greatest respect for the sagacity and
wisdom of Senator Croll and the members of his committee, might I suggest that, in this one instance, the judg~
ment of the task force and of Mr. Lalonde and the federal
government was more in keeping with the political realities in Canada today, and that the two-tier system suggested by them is not only more equitable, particularly for
those who are unemployable, but has much greater hope of
public acceptance and implementation than the uniform,
one-tier system recommended by the Senate committee.
* (1540)

Hon. Mr. Carter: May I ask the honourable senator a
question? He referred to the Poverty Committee's report
and recommendations. If I recall the honourable senator
correctly, he suggested that the Senate committee's report
treated unemployables the same as employables. He omitted to state, however, that the Poverty Committee's report
included a formula whereby pensioners and unemployables, as well as employables, would have their income
increased as Canada's gross national product increased, so
that they would share in Canada's improved standard of
living and increased wealth. Would that not compensate
for the fault that the honourable senator found in the
report?
Hon. Mr. Godfrey: I appreciate that there was that
suggestion, that the government should eventually be able
to afford more than 70 per cent suggested in the report.
[Translation]
Hon. Renaude Lapointe: First of all, I should like to
join my colleagues in congratulating our new Governor
General and his wife, as well as our dynamic Speaker and
the distinguished mover and seconder of the Address in
reply to the Speech from the Throne.
[Hon. Mr. Godfrey.]

March 7, 1974

At the beginning of the first session of the 29th Parliament, on January 4, 1973, only diehard optimists thought
that a government with such a dangerous minority could
survive. Today, even its most ardent opponents must
admit that during this session, which was one of the
longest and most fruitful of all our history, the government showed remarkable realism, flexibility and strategic
sense, especially when we consider that 1973 brought
several developments completely beyond its control which
caused serious effects in our country and the rest of the
world.
Not only have we succeeded in coming through these
crucial periods, but throughout the year we have also
developed, perfected and passed an impressive number of
bills, including several important measures which will be
useful for the country and for the welfare of Canadians.
That same year, another extremely significant event
took place, this time in Quebec: it rejected unequivocally
the separatist option and proclaimed strongly its confidence in a profitable federalism as proposed by Mr. Bourassa. There is no doubt that the advantages and the
protection provided by several existing federal laws, as
well as the relatively satisfactory-for Quebec-fashion in
which most of the federal-provincial conferences evolved,
including that on energy, contributed considerably in persuading the people that it had every reason to stay in
Confederation.
Of all those laws, that on the official languages continues to have a powerful psychological impact on
Francophones.
Still, as a result of the unpleasant reactions voiced
mainly in the Ottawa area, considerable flexibility was
introduced last June into the regulations governing the
linguistic requirements in the Public Service; a large
number of unilinguals can now be promoted to jobs classified as bilingual, provided they express, in writing, their
will to become bilingual. Not only do they earn then a
higher salary, but they study the other language for 12
months while a bilingual public servant is often doing
their work. Furthermore, on their return, can we say that
they are truly bilingual, except for some rare cases? We
wonder whether the examinations that they must take
then are really serious and whether the knowledge and
previous use of English and French are really considered
in the selection of applicants to bilingual positions as
provided for in paragraph 14 of the Treasury Board guidelines. The conclusion is that, through generosity toward
unilingual people, they considerably decrease the chances
of bilingual applicants interested in these positions while
significantly increasing government expenditures.
There is also paragraph 20 which allows the unilingual
holder of a position identified as bilingual to keep his job
after having refused to study the other language or failed
his examination or refused a transfer. Treasury Board
must then take what it calls "proper administrative procedures". In clearer terms, this means hiring another person,
which is also costly.
Of course, these guidelines have been called provisional
by Mr. Drury and perhaps it is too soon to make an
objective and global appraisal because, obviously, we hear
only about cases of injustice or somewhat illogical
situations.

March 7, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

If, in addition, we consider the complaints found in the
annual report of the Official Languages Commissioner, we
can detect the unwillingness of some departments and
Crown corporations as compared with others that are
better intentioned. We realize to a larger extent still that
the establishment of institutional bilingualism is a task
both huge and delicate. However, we feel that it is worthwhile and that it may be unreasonable to expect growing
results before a new, better prepared generation has access
to the higher positions.
However, according to Keith Spicer, bureaucratic medicines concocted in Ottawa will not by themselves totally
and forever allow us to win the linguistic wager taken up
by Canada. It is in the minds of today's children and
adolescents that must germinate the idea of the coexistence of two societies which mutually respect each other.
This is the task of the provincial Ministers of Education
who do not all work on it very honestly. What do they do
with the millions distributed to them by Ottawa for teaching the second language? Mr. Spicer feels that this teaching remains a catastrophe. Complaints still arise. He
insists that many provinces use this money for other
purposes than language training. Obviously, if the provinces do not want to co-operate, the federal activity will
dangerously slow down.
Can we leave this topic aside without expressing, for
our part, the hope that the Government of Quebec, which
is about to legislate on the matter of language, will also be
able to resist extremist pressure as did the government in
Ottawa, and this for the welfare of Quebecers and of the
French language. Any drastic action aiming at penalizing
Quebec Anglophones can have nothing but harmful consequences on the promotion of French at the federal level
and on the treatment of francophone minorities in other
provinces.
In this debate which once again impassions public opinion in Quebec, I share the opinion of Mayor Drapeau
according to whom French, far from regressing in Montreal as is claimed by the alarmists, on the contrary constantly affirms itself owing to the co-operation of numerous English-speaking organizations.
For example, I did an investigation in 1960 in Montreal
for the newspaper La Presse on the use of French in
commercial institutions. I go back to these institutions
today and I marvel at the changes which were willingly
operated as far as signs and various services are
concerned.
I also think there is a way for Quebec to pass certain
security-oriented measures in the linguistic field without
for that matter encroaching upon the acquired rights of
the English-speaking minority and also without, on the
pretence of cultural sovereignty, wanting to take away
from the central government any possibility of getting
involved in Quebec activities such as theater, cinema,
literary works, dance, sports and so on, and subsidizing
them in the same way as in other provinces. To act otherwise would be not only playing the game of separatists
always ready for a major confrontation which could serve
their cause but would go against the very will of the
majority of the people.
Quebec has all the necessary powers to meet specific
problems in the area of education and that of the working

language. There is absolutely no need for it to claim
absolute autonomy in the cultural field.
I think that the most serious threat hanging over
French-speaking Quebecers is the sharp drop in their birth
rate which is already felt in schools. Cultural sovereignty
will not remedy that situation nor will the sole importation of prefabricated citizens who will willingly or reluctantly have to learn French.
We have great faith in Education Minister Cloutier who
stated Tuesday in Paris that a language policy should not
divide society. He said that would be a mistake peculiar to
ultra-nationalists. In a Quebec that went quickly from a
rural life style to integration into the American industrial
society it is understandable that the teaching of English
would meet resistance with nationalists, but it must be
recognized, he added, that if yesterday diplomacy was
carried out in French, today technology is carried out in
English.
I think for my part that the prospect of making French
the official language with English getting the priority as
the second language, provided it would be better taught
than now, should not create too many perturbations
within and without Quebec. Apparently, that will be the
proposal made in the next session of that provincial
legislature.

[English]
Thousands of Canadians who have strongly criticized
the Unemployment Insurance Act have heard, with satisfaction, that the government, as part of a comprehensive
review, intends to amend it in the light of the experience
of the last few years. The government has also stated that
it will provide employers with improved access to Canada's manpower.
One of the problems which disturbs the active population of Canada-and here I disagree somewhat with Senator Godfrey, who preceded me in this debate-resides in
the fact that more and more of our resource industries are
suffering from manpower shortages. The large number of
unemployed does not justify that situation. Disturbing,
indeed, is the sight of these loafers unwilling to move from
their armchairs, from their towns, from their provinces,
unwilling to accept a new challenge in a country still half
developed, and which has so much to offer to men of
courage and imagination.
"Has the spirit of adventure gone from that land?" asks
a journalist in analyzing a report from four basic industries-those being mining, agriculture, petroleum, and
pulp and paper. According to that report, the mining
industry could use between 2,000 and 3,000 men right now.
More money is not the answer, they say. People simply do
not want to live in the remote parts of the country. One
gold mining company has gone as far as paying two cents
more per shift every time the international price of gold
goes up $1.
For the last several years the agriculture industry also
has had chronic shortages of manpower. It is even suggested that farmers may have to pay workers more than they
themselves are teing compensated just to keep men down
on the farm. In addition, we are all aware of the situation
in the tobacco, fruit and vegetable industries.

SENATE DEBATES

As it gears up for the boom years ahead, the petroleum
industry is feeling the same squeeze. Projects such as the
Syncrude development will also be in desperate need of
skilled personnel.
There are also shortages of both skilled and unskilled
personnel in the pulp and paper industry. That industry is
always looking for electricians, steamfitters, boiler attendants, and so forth, to work in isolated areas, and though it
is said that there are hundreds of electricians unemployed
elsewhere they cannot attract them to those areas.
It appears that the lure of frontier life has gone from
Canadians at a time when some of the best hopes of our
country are situated precisely in its remotest parts. Other
people will have to be found to fill the demand, and the
Immigration Act will be adjusted to meet these specific
needs.
The fault is not entirely that of the unemployed themselves. Here, as in other industrialized countries-and
Senator Rowe had a few words to say about this yesterday-people over the age of 40 are often considered too old
for a new job, and their prospects become dimmer as they
grow older. Manual labourers are usually hit first and
hardest, but office workers and executives are also affected, and many give up after a difficult struggle, according
to a survey by the International Labour Organization.
There is no justification for such discrimination and prejudice. Countries such as France, Britain, Spain, Sweden,
Belgium and the socialist states have taken steps to
redress the balance. Canada should do better than it does.
Even though the Minister of National Health and Welfare, Mr. Lalonde, denounces as a myth the idea that
Canada is full of lazybones and parasites, there are
enough, in my opinion, to impose a burden on the economy
and to frustrate the efforts of the active citizens. The
Minister of Manpower and Immigration, Mr. Andras, said
in Quebec City early this month:
I have to confess to alarm at the tendency for some
people to think that cheating the Government is an
amusing and profitable game. I don't know how widespread this tendency is, but it is certainly significant
enough to have given, and to continue to give, the UIC
quite a headache."
We must, however, acknowledge the work done by the
UIC president, Mr. Guy Cousineau. Mr. Cousineau succeeded in eliminating 77,000 fraudulent beneficiaries in
1972, and in 1973 as many as 258,000. He has also succeeded
in recovering overpaid benefits to the extent of $9 million
in 1972, and $16 million in 1973. This checking job is
continuing, and is to be completed by the end of March.
[Translation]
Well, on to another subject. Usually it is up to us more
than to our male colleagues to make a short review of
achievements in the area of the rise of women and to
measure the road that remains to be covered. But, this
year, we have had the pleasant surprise of being preceded
by an honourable colleague, Senator Perrault, who presented with conviction the case of women in general and
that of wives and mothers in particular. We congratulate
him and thank him for it. The word "at last" spoken
Tuesday night on the same subject by the Leader of the
Opposition has warmed our hearts.
[Hon. Miss Lapointe.]

March 7, 1974

Very recently, his leader, Mr. Stanfield, began te court
Canadian women by promising them, if he is given the
power, to take several positive steps on their behalf. We
appreciate his good intentions. But the government, with a
good many achievements as it is, has announced that it
intends to actively carry out its task.
Among its recent initiatives, let us first of all take note
of the appointment of Mrs. Pauline McGibbon as Lieutenant Governor of Ontario.
Next let us note the creation, last May, of the Advisory
Council on the Status of Women chaired by a sociologist
and including 29 other personalities recruted throughout
our country. According to a study prepared by this advisory council, approximately 50 out of the 120 recommendations which were made by the royal commission and
which fall under federal jurisdiction have been fully
applied and 30 others only partly.
Third, let us mention the establishment last year, within
the civil service, of an Anti-Discrimination Branch, where
20 per cent of grievances submitted are based on sex. Of
course most of these grievances are submitted by women
and, apparently, 2 out of 3 are settled to their satisfaction.
Yet these measures are not enough because if female
civil servants have at least a recourse, such is not the case
for women working in industries, services or even in the
home. The most crying cases of discrimination apparently
occur in the areas of communication, transport and banking, and it is high time to amend, among others, the
statutes concerning the acquisition of citizenship.
0 (1600)

The advisory council bas advocated the creation of a
Canadian Commission on Human Rights. We are pleased
to learn that a bill along that line will be tabled for the
setting up of a Federal Commission on Human Rights and
Interests and for the inclusion of provisions to protect
women from discriminatory practices. As for regulations
governing government employees, they will be amended to
remove all possible inequities based on sex.
Finally, millions of women will welcome the announcement of an agreement between federal and provincial
ministers for the removal of the provisions in the Canada
and Quebec Pension Plans which accord differential treatment to men and women.
They are, however, concerned with two other matters,
namely, day nurseries and family courts. In the case of
day nurseries it might become necessary to convene one of
these days a federal-provincial conference, as women
workers consider this question of prime importance.
As for family courts where problems resulting from
divorce or separation could be solved; that is, the custody
and maintenance of children, alimony, the assets of the
spouses or the guardianship of minors, etc., they would
also be instructed to recover amounts due by spouses who
did not meet their obligations. As those courts should be
established in every province, a federal-provincial agreement would be necessary as would financial support from
the federal government to train the necessary staff for
their efficient operation.
At the present time, the practices, procedures and structures of the courts are too complicated, too slow and costly

March 7, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

and they often contribute to increasing the pressures due
to the breaking up of the marriage and family.
The Law Reform Commission of Canada bas studied
that serious problem in its first research program; it feels
that a single provincial court having full jurisdiction
could settle at once the above-mentioned family problems.
Those reforms are not expected for the near future, but
they would represent a major step of social progress and
deserve to be taken into consideration without delay.
There are several other matters I would have liked to
deal with, but in conclusion I shall say this: the Speech
from the Throne, termed a "practical document for a
responsible Parliament", has gained in substance what it
lost in rhetoric, and the government was wise to feel
concerned first and foremost about the Canadian producer
whose increased production will give consumers some
hope for a more heartening future.
In his speech of February 28, the Prime Minister said:
We will not hesitate to go after the so-called big guys
in the marketplace if action is necessary to protect the
Canadian consumer.
I hope it will not be only the big guys of the oil industry,
but also the powerful middlemen between producers and
consumers who must be watched very closely. In short, the
program of this government is quite realistic. For this
reason, it deserves our whole attention as well as our
complete co-operation.

[English]
Hon. Arthur Laing: Honourable senators, I should like
to join with the other senators who have expressed their
gratitude to Madam Speaker for the service she bas rendered to us and our country by the splendid way in which
she bas conducted affairs here.
We hope, Madam Speaker, that you will long have the
health to continue to serve Canada in the way you have
served thus far.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Laing: Honourable senators, I want to pay
special attention today to the problem of energy in
Canada, but first let me remark that I have heard a great
deal of very generalized criticism from the other side of
the bouse about the activities of the government in these
difficult times of worldwide inflation. I contend that there
is not a government in the world that has endeavoured to
give as much direct individual attention to these problems
as the Government of Canada. The protections that have
been given various people, hopefully needed only in the
short term, by way of indexing pensions, increases in
family allowances, and looking after our veterans, are
such as not to warrant the generalized criticism and condemnation that we have heard from the other side of the
bouse. It is not justified at all.
Let me get down to the problem about which I am
concerned. Over a period of years I have attempted to
make an assessment of our resources position in Canada,
and I think there might be some merit in putting one or
two views I have on record at this time, because the
matter is still very much before us.
I am rather astonished that the energy problem in this
country bas assumed the importance it bas, because

27601-5

energy enters into the cost of products in Canada today to
the extent of 12 per cent in only one or two places. It is a
fact that in 80 per cent of all production in Canada the
energy component is less than 6 per cent.
Our difficulty, of course, arose from the very sudden
increase in the price of oil imposed by the OPEC countries, and the fact that petroleum is not only a source of
energy but has become one of the key components in so
many petrochemical lines. As a result of this disturbance,
in certain sections of the petrochemical industry in the
United States costs have increased in one year by $17
billion.
I could give the example of a small key plant in the
province of British Columbia, which brings in raw material for the production of glues and chemicals, which are
so important in our plywood industry there. They were cut
off from a local source. They scrambled and obtained other
products from Korea. They got three partial shiploads, but
a fourth ship did not leave Korea because it could not get
bunkered there to come to Vancouver. This kind of disturbance is occurring in many places, and when it is
multiplied thousands upon thousands of times there is a
threat to our industry, a threat to production, and a threat
to employment in this country and so many other countries around the world.
The Ottawa Valley line was established by the previous
government, very wisely at that time, so that Western oil
could be marketed as far east as the Ottawa Valley. For
the rest of Canada we bought oil in the cheapest offshore
markets of the world, which turned out to be not the Arab
countries but Venezuela. I think that policy served us
well, and probably would not have been interfered with
had it not been for the action of the Arab countries.
We also face a constitutional issue, because these
resources lie in the Western provinces, principally in
Alberta, but to the extent of about 20 per cent in Saskatchewan. While the conduct of interprovincial trade is a
responsibility of the national government, I think everyone here will understand the jealousy of the Western
provinces in respect to their retaining the benefits of those
resources for themselves.
* (1610)

Honourable senators, the Government of Canada, acting
for the short term, very wisely and most competently
imposed an export tax on that oil. Had it been possible for
the Americans to buy our oil at $4 or $5 a barrel less than
they were able to buy oil offshore, they would have
thought that we were rather ridiculous people in Canada.
Secondly, as late as 1970, when Mr. Connally was Secretary of Commerce of the United States, be abruptly told us
one day that we had 250,000 to 300,000 barrels of oil that
they did not want at any price at all. So, when they want
oil badly I think they should be content, and I think most
of them are content, to pay the same price to Canada as
they would pay for offshore oil.
The Government of Canada arranged a freeze on oil
prices at the time, which enabled buyers of those products
in Western Canada to continue to buy them at substantially the prices at which they were buying before the action
of the Arab countries. There was an undertaking givenand this is going to be misunderstood by some people-to
compensate the oil companies in Eastern Canada for the

SENATE DEBATES
difference that they were required to pay for imported oil
as compared with what they had paid before. This
involves a considerable sum of money, but that undertaking was given and that undertaking must be fulfilled. I
have no doubt at all that the most consummate and careful
study will be made by our auditing staffs here to see that
the conditions under which that guarantee was made are
fulfilled, and that no more money is paid than that
required to maintain the prices during that period of
February and March.
I said this was an extremely competent act on the part
of the government to provide for these things, and I
compliment it on it, but because we are a prodigious
trading nation we cannot permanently modify the home
value of goods in a world market. Approximately 27 per
cent of the goods we produce goes into the world market.
The Arabs will pretty soon find out that their outrageous
modification of oil prices is unjustified-and untenable,
too.
As to the constitutional issue that is before us, the
jealousies of the provinces over control of their resources
are fully understandable. The efforts of the Prime Minister and his government have been directed solely to minimizing what could be very serious distortions in our
economy, accompanied by rising unemployment. It is one
of our misfortunes that resources are in one place, and
manufacturing in another. I find that 67 per cent of the
work force of Canada lives in Ontario and Quebec. I
suggest that the people who live in Western Canada are as
concerned as the people of Central Canada to ensure that
unemployment does not rise in Central Canada.
There has been some decline in the economy of Europe,
and there could be a very serious further decline. When I
read that Volkswagen have to lay off 125,000 employees,
that means something to me, and it means something to
every other country in the world. We cannot isolate ourselves from that sort of condition in the world. It is all
very well for Canadians to say they are unusual, and are
going to be exempt, but if the economies of other countries
go down, we will not be exempt.
I am concerned about what our American friends are
doing with automobiles. At Wayne, Indiana, there is a
plant which in December of last year was producing for
the Ford Motor Company 560 LTDs per day. The Ford
LTD is a large car. They got to work and ripped out the
inside of that plant, working around the clock including
Christmas Day, and now they are producing 650 Mavericks
per day, and in a few months they are going to produce 950
daily. The Ford Motor Company and General Motors have
put together $375 million to recondition plants to build
small cars. I do not know when the demand for small cars
is going to be filled, but when it is I can see a danger of
our producing fewer small cars in Canada.
On the constitutional question there have been abrasive
words on both sides. It is to be hoped that they are the
product of a desire to establish a negotiating position in
both cases, and I think they are. This nation cannot afford
a constitutional war over energy. The issue is not that
important, in the first place, and the so-called crisis promises to be very shortlived.
Man's illimitable ingenuity assures us a world of plenty;
not of want. We were extracting oil where it had most
[Hon. Mr. Laing.]

March 7, 1974

easily come to hand. Now we have word that Britain by
1980 will export oil to the value of $1 billion annually.
Long before that Norway is going to be exporting $3
billion worth of oil annually. We also hear that China last
year provided Japan with one million metric tons of oil,
and their contract this year calls for three million metric
tons, and in 1979 nine million metric tons. The Soviet
Union has issued a statement of its oil resources, covering
almost 20 per cent of the world total, in addition to 3,000
trillion cubic feet of gas. In our most ambitious moments
in Canada we never claimed to have more than 720 trillion
cubic feet of gas. Indonesian oil is about to come on the
market, and also Nigerian oil. It is not to be wondered that
the Arab nations are giving thought to removing the
expert embargo, and talking about lower prices.
There is a suggestion that we should have a national
petroleum corporation. I want to make the point that we
already have one, to the extent of 45 per cent in Panarctic
Oils. I would hope that the corporation that is set up will
be restricted to exploration and development, and will not
get into the petroleum business. We will never be large
enough, in terms of total world oil production or consumption, to justify our getting into the oil business, because
we will be able to buy from others at a price lower than
our cost of production. I think that before the end of the
century oil will not be sought as a source of energy. I
would expect that by that time we shall have fusion
power. I was assured of that by the Soviets. I was told that
by their partnership in London, where the technicians and
scientists are working as a group. The American Can
Company, which happens to be the American end of it,
and which is doing a great deal of work there, says we
shall have fusion power in fifteen years.
Other sources of energy are rapidly being found. Our
American friends, who are tremendous in their technology, have bored down through the Salton Sea and found
that they can get a liquid coming up at a temperature of
7000 Fahrenheit. In Montana they have gone down only
two kilometres and found molten lava. When you put a
little water down a hole like that you are going to get a bit
of steam, and when you get steam you are going to have
power. Amazing things are going on. There is the gasification of coal, and there are discoveries of alternative
sources of energy. We should not worry a great deal about
either prices or shortages.
It is important to look after our security. That is why I
support the building of a pipeline to Montreal, but only on
the basis of security. The cost, which will be about $180
million, is a high premium to pay, but it is worth paying. I
would expect that for many years ahead it may be a dry
pipe.
a (1620)

Honourable senators, there are certain things I am concerned about and which bother Western Canadians today.
The Minister of Industry and Commerce in Quebec, Mr.
Guy Saint-Pierre, bas stated that they must have oil delivered to Montreal at the same price as it is laid down in
Sarnia-presumably at the expense of the consolidated
revenue of Canada. Referring to Mr. Saint-Pierre, Harvey
Shepherd of the Globe and Mail said on February 13 last:
Given the single-price formula, Mr. Saint-Pierre
believes Montreal manufacturers of petroleum-based

March 7, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

chemicals will be in a good position to benefit from
the competitive advantages Canada has as an oil-producing country in the current world situation.
Montreal is in a good position to serve markets for
chemical products that should open up in Europe and
New England as a result of the world oil shortage.
The people who live in Central Canada, although they
have not visited Western Canada, will understand me
when I say that Western Canadians are concerned that
that petrochemical plant will not go to the source of the
oil. Instead of the petrochemicals being shipped, the raw
material might be transported through a pipeline 3,000
miles long, to the advantage of persons who will manufacture the product and claim the market. This is the position
that the leaders of Western Canada are taking today, and I
must say that in large part I sympathize with them.
Western Canada wants to develop. It is unfortunate that
67 per cent of the work force in Canada resides in the two
central provinces. We should have done something about
Sir John's great national policy before this.
I was a little concerned, too, over a statement made by
Mr. Mitchell Sharp that Canada has no extra oil. The one
redeeming feature was that he said "conventional" oil. We
have the tar sands. The tar sands are the biggest piece of
oil property in the world, exceeding even the total Arabian
oil reserves. But people say that we have to get $8 a barrel
for tar sand oil or it will not pay. I do not think that is
correct. Those oil people who went in there and did all the
hard work should have a medal struck for them in Canada,
because they did all the pioneering and lost $80 million.
But I am reliably informed that at $4.25 a barrel they were
getting around the corner, and starting to make a little
money.
Another minister, Mr. Macdonald, said that the Japanese
wanted to come in with $6 billion. He said, "They wanted
to come in there, and I sure cooled them off". Well, frankly, I don't want, and I don't think any Canadians want,
anybody who comes to Canada with money cooled off. As
a matter of fact, their technology might have been worth
more to us than their money, because the trouble out there
is lack of technology. As technology improves the cost of
the oil extracted from the tar sands will decrease rather
than increase. We have enough oil in the tar sands to
supply the entire continent for the next 40 years, and to
supply Canada alone for 350 years at our present projections. So we should move on this as rapidly as we possibly
can, using all available devices to develop this resource.
I was delighted with the statement of the Prime Minister that he and his government would support the building
of the Mackenzie Valley gas line. Here is an opportunity
for us to provide a pathway through Canada for American
gas, tying in the gas that we have in the Mackenzie delta,
which is a considerable amount now but which is going to
be just enormous in the future. The required investment
of $5 billion is so great that if we were to think about
moving our own gas on that basis we would simply put
that whole area into cold storage for another 20 or 30
years. There would be absolutely no hope of doing it by
ourselves.
We should be frank in these matters. The resources of
Canada, at the rate at which we want to develop them,
cannot be developed solely by Canadian capital. Moreover,

27601-51

in respect of a number of these things, the scale at which
we have to develop them for the benefit of Canada is such
that we require not only the Canadian market but export
markets as well. That is a frank assessment of the position
we are in, and we should look at it from that point of view.
There has been much talk about transportation, a subject I am also interested in. The statement was made this
afternoon that Vancouver Harbour is full of ships. There is
one ship waiting for two and a half million bushels of
wheat, and there are about 20 other ships in the harbour.
I have been thinking about this for a long time, and I
have concluded that our difficulty, as Canadians, is that
too few of us in one place have the opportunity to speak to
those in other parts of the country. For years I have been
saying that 84 per cent of Canadians live within 200 miles
of the United States boundary. I received a correction the
other day. Do you know what it is? It is that 84 per cent of
Canadians live within 150 miles of the border now,
because Canadians are rushing to the urban centres. Our
country is 4,000 miles wide, but reckoned by our economic
and social interests it is only about 150 miles deep. We
have to do something to change that.
What can we do about transportation? Some day, and I
hope it comes sooner than later, there will be a railway
system operating with unit trains, right from the Head of
the Lakes to Calgary. Those trains will move the substantial freight between those two points in ten hours, instead
of the two or three weeks it is taking at the present time.
If you send a boxcar from the Head of the Lakes out to
British Columbia you will find that it takes two or three
weeks to come back.
New road beds are needed to handle unit trains. That is
a fact that they have discovered in British Columbia. The
railway company put a unit train on an old road bed out
there, and found that the road bed was not adequate to
handle the unit train. It cost them some accidents and an
awful lot of money to make the discovery.
I have an idea that we could compress the economic
geography of Canada if only we were to put a proper
railway between the Head of the Lakes and Calgary. I
believe we could compress it by about 40 per cent. Afterwards, we should think about electrifying it and burning
that cheap, brown coal of Saskatchewan that is just lying
on the surface waiting to be burned.
The Soviets are rapidly electrifying the Trans-Siberian
Railway. Of course, their country is ten time zones wide
and about 6,500 miles long. I understand that they are
saving 35 per cent in operating costs by electrifying the
railway. The saving due to electrification there is largely
because of winter conditions and adverse weather.
That is one of the things I believe could be considered
when the provinces and the federal government come
together to discuss the advantages which can be visited
upon the Western provinces in return for a more openminded attitude in respect of oil.
Another point I should like to make with respect to
transportation is that we should have a second TransCanada Highway. It should go from Winnipeg right
through Saskatoon, which is the most beautiful city of the
plains, on through Edmonton, and tie in with the Yellowhead route through British Columbia. When I was Minis-

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES
ter of Public Works, the projected cost of such a highway
was $88 million. That would have fixed it up to transCanada standards. Such a highway would tend to develop
the northern parts of not only Alberta but Saskatchewan
and Manitoba as well.
*

(1630)

Honourable senators, let me turn now to agriculture.
The only cure for shortages and high prices is production,
and I doubt very much if we are going to get high production out of areas outside the Prairies. All you need on the
Prairies is rain. If you get rain, with the remarkable
competence of prairie agriculture today, you can increase
output enormously.
I am worried about meat, and the input cost of meat at
the present time. Senator Lawson talked about Guert Ker,
a man who went out of the feeding business because he
lost his shirt. I know another feeder in Vancouver; I have
his figures, and they are accurate. Even with the fantastically high price of meat that we have had in recent
months, he still lost $161 per head. If ibis continues, in a
couple of years we will not have any meat at all in
Canada. I do not know any man who would love to look
after cattle, which is a 24 hours a day job, when he could
put in wheat and take it off in 37 days and get $5 a bushel.
This is an enormous distortion in the country.
There is one thing to which I should like to draw the
attention of our Prime Minister and the Premier of Alberta--and ibis goes back to the days when Senator Manning
was the premier. We signed an agreement at that time
with his government, and with the governments of the
other Prairie provinces, in respect of the Nelson River. We
contributed, I think, 50 per cent of the cost of a study in
that connection, which was more than $6 million. It was an
exceedingly valuable study, and it led to the development
of the Nelson River. But the Nelson River is water that
flows out of the Rocky Mountains, and Alberta, under
Senator Manning at that time, and under his successor,
had a study done as to what they could do in respect of
putting in a number of small dams for irrigation in the
province of Alberta. There is a considerable amount of irrigated land there now-land of tremendous productive
capacity, with ideal growing conditions in the way of
climate, growing season and so on. Most important of all,
there is soil that can take water.
When we were once talking about the Diefenbaker lake
and the Gardiner dam, one of the provisions was that we
would irrigate a lot of land there. That is gumbo soil, and
you cannot put water on gumbo soil because you get
bricks. But in Alberta there is a very considerable amount
of land--probably between four million and six million
acres-with enough sand in it to take irrigation, and with
a productive capacity in respect of fresh frozen and
canned foods that would make the area close to where our
bouse leader lives just look silly. That area could feed all
of Canada, and quite a few other countries as well.
Recently, in the province of British Columbia, one of the
universities reviewed the Columbia River treaty, and I am
going to continue to press the leader of the bouse here to
wind up that debate, beceause the review is going to be
published later. It is a meaningful review, because that is
the kind of treaty that we can expect more and more of
in respect of our neighbour to the south. This is a review
[Hon. Mr. Laing.]

March 7, 1974
March 7, 1974

of what I consider to be a most competent and successful
consummation of the development of that river to the
benefit of both our countries.
One of the very important things about the area of the
Columbia basin-an area which bas only six inches of
annual rainfall-is the development of irrigation and the
production of food there. In the summer 36,000 people are
employed in the various canneries, in the provision of
fresh frozen food, and so on, from land that without
irrigation would be totally worthless because it has only
six inches of precipitation annually.
In the Alberta area that I am speaking of you have the
soil, you have the climate, and you have the irrigation. A
review of that could be undertaken, so that we might build
up there a kind of agriculture that would be of great
service to Canada as a whole, and be beneficial from the
point of view of our exports as well.
Honourable senators, I am a believer in the North. I
have been advocating for a number of years that more
attention be given to the area north of 60, as this would be
very important to us at this time. I have come across a
book called The Soviet Far East, by an Englishman named
Kirby. It should be required reading for ail senators. It
deals with Siberia, in which the Soviet Union is doing
some courageous and important things with regard to
development at the present time-some things which we
could copy to our advantage.
Mr. Kirby, speaking of Siberia, says:
This gigantic domain-which spans a quarter of the
earth's circumference and is larger than all North
America, with natural conditions broadly resembling
those of Canada-has correspondingly enormous
natural resources with prodigious economic and
political potential... Not only was the Soviet position
in Central Asia consolidated but effort and investment concentrated notably on industrialisation in
Siberia.
This eastward shift stood the Soviet Union in good
stead in the Great Patriotic War of 1941-5 ... The
movement continues; looking ahead, the possibility
must clearly be considered that ultimately this may be
one of the great economic areas of the world. Perhaps
the balance of world power may in the next epoch
come to be centred in this great "heartland of
Eurasia", one of the last great "challenge" areas cf the
world.
What be says there of the Soviet Union can be said with
equal force of Canada. The obvious potential north of 60 is
just beginning to unfold itself though, of course, we have
the same difficulties in our area that the Soviet Union is
having. They have provided wages that are three times as
high as the wages in Moscow, and yet they lose help. They
have a climate that is much worse than that in our
Canadian North. They have recorded temperatures of 102
degrees below zero. Ahl the windows have three partitions
on them, not two. We have difficulties in our Canadian
North, but we are overcoming them by transportation. We
now have jet planes right down to the Arctic. A man can
be on the Arctic Ocean, and arrive two and a half hours
later in Edmonton.

I have noted that those companies wh'ch have gone in
there of late are aware of the cost to them of losing men,
and this is the main trouble with the Canadian North. A
man goes in, he is a pretty good workman and he improves
his capacity, and then he gets fed Up, or his wjfe does. and
they go back south again. One company has assured me
that every time they lose such a man, it costs $2,000 just to
bring in another man and start ail over again. We must do
something about this.
e(1640)
In the Canadian North there is one outfit at a place
called Faro-faro was a jackpot game that they played in
the early days in the Yukon, and they named the town
after the game. That company was very clever. It established such a magnificent townsite and facilities there
that people do flot wish to leave. In that littie place the
company invested $870,000 in a social and recreational
centre for approximately 360 employees and their families.
Such programs are necessary. Perhaps they can be supported by governments, but I stili think the first responsibility lies with the corporation itself to look after its men.
If such programs were established as a pattern throughout
the North, we would flot
experience
manpower
ciifficulties.
There are concerns in the North in connection with
goverfiment. Mr. Chrétien, the minister, has assured the
people there of changes in the administration, to give them
more authority. This is very necessary, because times are
changing. Twenty years ago a man went up there to make
a quick stake in two or three months and get out back to
Southern Canada, but that is not the case now. Families
are being raised and educated in the North, and the children return to live there. We are moving in the direction
of permanent residence in the North, and any assurance
we can give the residents of an increase in their capacity
to handle their own affairs, rather than have it all done
from Ottawa, is very good. It is a wise move on the
minister's part.

I do ask that an increasing amount of attention be paid
by members of this bouse, and by the Canadian people, to
our Canadian North, because I attach to the Canadian
North the same importance that Kirby attaches to Siberia
in the Soviet Union.
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: I wonder if Senator Laing would
permit a question? It is always a delight to hear him on
these subjects, which he has studied so carefully. They are
alI big subjects. He spoke of energy, but I do flot think he
expanded completely on a point which intrigues me. I
wonder if he could touch again on what I thought was a
warning in connection with the discussion of energy,
when he said that huge payments, running to millions of
dollars, would be transferred to someone in February or
March. He also referred to an audit. Who would be audited
and to whom would the payments go, in bis
contemplation?
Hon. Mr. Laing: I do not know. I believe the item is in
the supplementary estimates. I suggested that the most
explicit and careful audit should be made by the government to see that the conditions under which the guarantee
was made by the government to the companies would not
be exceeded, and I am quite certain that that will be done.
In other words, this is an actual change in the proven
cost of their oil before February and March. In the case of
February, the oil would have been bought in January. A
commitment was made by the Government of Canada, and
I can tell Senator Benidickson that assurances have been
given to me that the most meticulous care wilI be exercised to see that compensation will cover only prices that
were maintained by the companies in the Eastern area.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, March 7, consideration of His Excellency the Governor General's Speech at
the opening of the session, and the motion of Senator
Robichaud, seconded by Senator Perrault, for an Address
in reply thereto.
Hon. David A. Croll: Honourable senators, I take this
opportunity to offer my congratulations and good wishes
to His Excellency the Governor General and his lady, and
to congratulate the mover and seconder of the Address in
reply to the Speech from the Throne. They were exceptionally fine speeches by competent people, who were
clear, eloquent and convincing, naturally, on a subject that
was close to their hearts, and close to the hearts of all of
us.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: You mean the Speech from the Throne?
* (2010)

Hon. Mr. Croll: Madam Speaker, we all admire your
good spirits and your dignity and charm, and we appreciate the manner in which you look after the affairs of this
chamber.
Honourable senators, in the last session I had an inquiry
on the Order Paper calling the attention of the Senate to
"the work ethic," and how to make it work. During the
latter part of the session the energy crisis was the issue
above all others, and it held the total interest of the
country. I did not think it was wise at that time to speak
about the work ethic, but that is not true today. It appears
that some understanding will be reached, that an arrangement will be made, between the dominion and provincial
governments. The purpose of my reference to the work

March 12, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

ethic flowed from the Report of the Special Senate Committee on Poverty in Canada, which recommends a basic
or guaranteed income for all Canadians.
Honourable senators, the report of the Senate Committee was presented to this house in November 1971. It bas
now been before the public for two years. It has been
considered, examined, criticized and praised, and very
widely endorsed. The words "guaranteed income" have
become household words. The idea and the concept have
captivated the minds and the imaginations of Canadians.
The polls have indicated that at least 60 per cent of the
people are in agreement-and that is a very excellent
return for a new measure which would cost the Canadian
public some money.
The endorsement is expressed from all sides. The latest
one was from the Department of the Church and Society
of the United Church of Canada. Of course, other churches
have given their endorsement from time to time. Another
endorsement came when the Minister of Agriculture
announced that the federal government would propose a
form of guaranteed annual income for farmers. The Federation of Employers' Organizations in the Province of
Quebec, when asked by the Premier of the Province of
Quebec to consider an increase in the minimum wage law,
suggested that the guaranteed income was the better
approach.
Church groups, welfare groups and voluntary organizations have shown their support. In the minds of all these
people, however, there still remains some concern about
the work ethic, and some lack of understanding. The
guaranteed income will not provide a choice of whether to
work or not to work, but whether to work harder and keep
most of the earnings.
The Americans have been experimenting with this for
some six years. I have been told that they assembled a
most expert group to study the problem. The American
government had the opportunity of putting their finger on
any man they wanted, and they did. They got some from
the University of Wisconsin, and some others from other
universities, to spend six years in a study of this problem.
In their most recent report they said that their experiences
indicated that the guaranteed income did not cut back
individual work effort. They used the government grants
to supplant low earnings and kept on working. They cut
the administrative costs by two-thirds.
Well, whatever you hear about the guaranteed income
across the country, let me just put you completely in the
picture by telling you that the provincial premiers are
tripping over themselves to be the first to introduce guaranteed income for the working poor. There is almost total
agreement that the present welfare system bas failed. It
was useful in another day, but it is a policy whose time
bas passed.
The essential step now is to bring under one umbrella
the different kinds of social assistance that fit into a
guaranteed annual income plan. There is a compelling
argument for segregating income payments under such
social insurance systems with an actuarial foundation as
unemployment insurance, workmen's compensation and
the Canada Pension Plan and the Quebec Pension Plan.
But this still leaves ample room for action. We have the
Canada Assistance Plan, family and youth allowances, old

age security, guaranteed income supplement, occupational
training allowances and about 40 other special allowances.
The guaranteed income is not a panacea, nor was it
suggested that it would be. Family allowances and old age
security are a symbol of our concern for our fellow men
from the cradle to the grave. They are untouchables. In
this country they represent the mother's milk of social
welfare. But, on the other hand, in the guaranteed income
concept a buck is a buck, and if you draw from one you
cannot draw from the other. If one prefers to draw from
the guaranteed income there is no reason why he should
not, but these two services remain. I am not suggesting for
a moment that integration is simple, but it should not be
used as an excuse for procrastination or lassitude. This
will be a step in the right direction in the meaningful
redistribution of income.
We are now providing a basic guaranteed income for
those not in the labour force: the blind, the crippled, the
maimed, the aged, and women who have children. It is not
adequate, mind you, not by any standard, but at least it is
reaching towards adequacy.
Looking at the other half of the coin, provision for those
in the labour force, the guaranteed annual income bas
finally emerged as a feasible, social and political proposal.
But there is a "but," which has now become something of a
hang-up. What about the work ethic? Will the recipient
work or will he sit? There is a feeling in the country that
the work ethic is much misunderstood, little appreciated,
hardly ever defended and is being slowly eroded.
*

(2020)

The question is: How can we preserve the work ethic in
the modern sense and orientation? I am one of those who
believe that it is vital. I have no words of praise for
idleness, whether by affliction or imposition.
In 1964 the Economic Council defined full employment
as when three per cent of the labour force is unemployed.
In an earlier day it used to be two per cent. Now they talk
of five per cent or six per cent. The new definition could
make some officials feel better but the unemployed feel
worse.
It was the report of the Economic Council in 1969,
inviting the Senate to undertake a study of poverty, which
resulted in the Senate report, "Poverty in Canada." The
Economic Council, in its tenth report, and that is this
year's, advised the government to cut back increases in
welf are spending for the next two or three years. I had no
idea that we in the Senate had done our task so well. The
inference of the tenth report was that transfer payments
to the poor were responsible to a great extent for inflationary tendencies. We spend approximately $7 billion in
social programs in this country. Of that, $2 billion is spent
especially for the poor, and $4 billion is spent on old age
security and family allowances-which is not exclusively
designed for the poor, nor is unemployment insurance.
At the federal-provincial conference of health ministers
held in Edmonton, the minister was asked to comment on
the report. He said that the report was "naive" and, he
added, to satisfy the Economic Council:
You would have to erase the last four years to reach a
suitable rate, which would mean dismantling some

SENATE DEBATES

programs and reducing the payments of thousands of
recipients.
When I read that and I saw the word "naive," I thought he
had put them down in rather soft fashion. Then I went to
the dictionary and looked up the meaning of "naive." The
dictionary says: "Marked by unaffected simplicity; showing lack of informed judgment." I felt much better after I
read that definition.
And I did not forget the advice that the government
received on another day from the experts who were asked
what steps we ought to take to fight inflation. They said,
"Why, some unemployment would do it!" We were suckered into that program. We wound up with unemployment
and inflation at the same time, and we very nearly lost the
election as a result.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: The government was naive then.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I have always been a bit suspicious of
some of these views that come from on high. I think we
have to be more careful in considering the views of some
of our overeducated economists, highwire intellectuals
and elitists who keep discussing supply and demand, balance of payments and balanced budgets. I think they had
meaning in another day. But these experts succeeded in
one thing-they succeeded in having their salaries raised
from $40,000 to $60,000, without any unemployment.
Honourable senators, there is no longer a single force of
unemployed in this country. They are now fragmented. We
have the young, we have housewives, we have those with
little training and education, and we have immigrants. As
post-secondary students flood the labour market it will no
longer be a case of the "haves" and the "have-nots," but
rather a matter of the "haves" and "those who can only
hope to have."
We live with the paradox of a high unemployment rate
together with a high number of unfilled jobs. Manufacturers say they are forced to limit production because they
cannot find enough workers to staff their enterprises.
Economic growth is being limited by the difficulty of
matching the labour supply to the jobs available. And,
honourable senators, the young suffer most. Unemployment among the young under 25 years of age runs to
almost 10 per cent, and the forecast made by Statisties
Canada is that there may be one job for every two secondary school graduates available for work between now and
1980. What a prospect!
We have to ask ourselves: Is it that the young people do
not want to work at all, or do not want to work at the type
of job available? Is it that they are no longer prepared to
take traditional jobs in factories and offices, but are looking for more interesting and rewarding jobs? They say
that they are tired of the uninspiring, repetitious, monotonous type of job involved in being, for example, a machine
attendant. They seek challenge; they seek interesting and
rewarding jobs, with good wages and good working conditions. And they are prepared to give an honest return in
work.
It must be appreciated-and I am sure you do, honourable senators-that many young people think differently,
act differently and live differently from the way we did a
few generations ago. They seek jobs that have not only a
[Hon. Mr. Croll.]

March 12, 1974

present but also a future with, as I said earlier, good wages
and good working conditions.
In February this year Robert Nielsen of the Toronto Star
travelled across Canada in search of a job. He subsequently related this experience in a series of articles which
appeared in the paper frorn February 5, to 9. Robert Nielsen is an exceptionally talented reporter-socially minded,
middle-aged. In the pictures taken of him in rough clothes
he appeared to be the sort of man who would be out
looking for any kind of work. He is full of integrity, a keen
observer, and completely trustworthy. In the course of
going across the country he worked as a janitor, a sweeper
in a fish plant, a night cleaner, a warehouse labourer, a
clothing factory worker, a beverage room bouncer and a
logger. He is a good-sized man, and could take care of the
job of a beverage room bouncer very well.
*

(2030)

In the end his opinion was that work was available for
unskilled men. Jobs were available, but they were mean
jobs, at mean pay, and they were drudge jobs. A man who
took such a job and relied on it for a living would be in
poverty, or worse. He could not possibly provide for a
family if he were the only breadwinner in that family.
In the Globe and Mail of November 6, 1973 there
appeared this report:
The Manpower people found, in counselling employers, that nine times out of 10 the employers were
offering poor working conditions, low wages, shiftwork, or the plant was not on a main public transportation line. They found that employers who were prepared to improve conditions and pay higher wages for
dirty jobs could find workers.
It is well to know what others think about this, because
we hear so much about young people who will not work.
In so far as the guaranteed income is concerned, I do not
think the Canadian people are worried about the cost, or
the method of providing it. They are concerned about the
work ethic, and they ask time and again: Will they work?
When we see that thousands of jobs are available-almost
all of them unskilled, low wage jobs, which begin at a dead
end and finish at a dead end-and thousands of people are
without jobs, we have still to ask ourselves: How can we
have these jobs f illed? What can we do to make them more
attractive to those people who need jobs, because the
country needs the production of as many people as possible? When we talk of the work ethic, we must also talk of
the pay and work-condition ethics, and the responsibility
of the government to provide opportunities for jobs to
those willing to work or, in the alternative, a basic minimum income. We need very much to put a present and a
future in low wage jobs for a livelihood today and security
tomorrow.
In our country the extremes of poverty persist. They are
difficult but not impossible to defend in an enlightened
country. Equality of opportunity and status are morally
unassailable. Inequality persists despite the demands of
both morality and equity. How long can we endure a
national condition that is 75 per cent affluent and 25 per
cent squalor?
What progress is being made in achieving a more equitable distribution of incomes? Statistics Canada throws

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

arch 12, 1974
March 12, 1974

light on this. Despite a total expenditure of nearly $7.5
billion on social security, an increase of 185 per cent in 10
years, five million Canadians live in poverty. They receive
a smaller share of the nation's wealth than they did 20
years ago. In 1951, the 20 per cent of Canadians at the
bottom of the income ladder received 6.1 per cent of the
total income of the country, while the 20 per cent at the
top received 41 per cent.
Statistics Canada reports that in 1965 the bottom 20 per
cent of the income scale for ail family units received 4.4
per cent of the total income, and the top 20 per cent
received 41.4 per cent. Six years later, in 1971, the share of
the bottom 20 per cent fell to 3.6 per cent, while the share
of the top 20 per cent rose to 43.3 per cent.
This is bad news. The gap is widening. The fat cats are
getting fatter-particularly so if they are multinationals. I
have in niy hand a table headed "'Nation's Income", which
indicates these various figures. I would ask your permission, honourabie senators, to have it incorporated in my
speech.
Hon. Mr'. Flynn: What is this table?
Hon. Mr'. CroUl: It shows the figures to which I have
referred.
Hon. Mr'. Flynn: Have you calculated what it would
mean if you distributed that weaith equaiiy among al
Canadians? I am interested in this.

Hon. Mr'. Croll: While incomes advance to the priviieged, they lag f ar behind at the bottom levels of the
working poor. It calîs into serious question the sincerity of

27601-6

national policies directed to greater equality. There is a
caîl to conscience in this land of ours.
Speaking further to the distribution of income,.it seems
to me that no matter how we redistrîbute-whether b3'
taxation, fiscal arrangements, capital gains, transfer payments, or tariff s-in a very short time the same people end
up with all the marbies. I do not know whether it is
because they are smart, swif t, or iucky. I have no answer
to that.
Hon. i. Flynn: We have had a Liberal government for
most of the time. They get ail the marbies-at least, the
power.
Hon. Mr'. Croli: The resources to wage an internai war
on poverty and inequity must be f ound if we accept the
priority of the poverty fight. At the federal-provinciai
energy conference held recently in Ottawa, the Prime
Minister in opening the conference described the problem
for consideration as: "How do you share a pack of wealth
which wili be realiy of stupendous magnitude?" Those are
the words of the Prime Minister. Not too many countries
in the worid are troubled in that fashion. In the course of
my speech I take advantage of that "stupendous magnitude" in suggesting some ways in which he can spend a
few dollars. I hope you wiii agree with me.
* (2W4)

I speak again of the guaranteed annual income. The
social security system in Canada has developed piecemeai
over the years. Its patchwork quaiity was inevitable
because of its origin as responses to different pressures at
different times from different directions. It became government by reaction. The time has come when concerned
action, long deferred, must replace reluctant, grudging
responses to pressures.
Our programs in the past have reiied on service strategy.
We are now changing to job and income strategy. The task
is for making things work, not for changing for the sake of
change. New and ingenious plans for the relief of poverty
are the need; the concept of a guaranteed annuai income
now has firm roots. It has been accepted as a feasibie,
social, and political proposai. Its great vîrtue is by way of
distributing money to persons and families. Money that
would be less stigmatized than weif are would go to people
and to workers. It wouid, in a challenging way, lift people
some part of the way out of poverty without imposing the
current damage to families and the work ethic that the
weif are system imposes. Instead of providing services, let
the people "buy" what they need in the open market.
There is a politicai plus in doing something inventive
about bringing the millions on welf are back into the mainstream of Canadian lif e. Ail of us have realized the urgent
need for a new national effort to re-make a system that is
as destructive of the people it is designed to help as it is
irksome to the taxpayer.
It is inconceivable that the present state of affairs can
continue much longer. The Canadian people have a right
to require the acceptance and application of the work
ethic. But have not those who compiy with the work ethic
the right to ask for a decent job with a living wage? There
is a minimum of haîf a million persons working today who
could receive more on welfare for themseives and their
familles than they earn in wages working a five-day-

March 12,1974

SENATE DEBATES
40-hour week. That is a startling statement, but it is true.
Every Canadian citizen who hears it and who reads it
should be troubled. It should be repeated as of ton as
necessary until the condition is remedied.
How can we ask people to respect the work ethic when
we see hefore our eyes haîf a million Canadians working
and abiding by all the rules that we have made for them,
yet drawing less money than they could receive by staying
at home and drawing welfare? The wonder is that they
work at ah. That is not my statement, but the statement of
Mr. Marc Lalonde, the Minister of National Health and
Welf are, who told a meeting of the Canadian Manufacturors' Association in Toronto last fali:
The wonder is that anyone in poverty does work ...
The marvel is that so many do. Certainly thore is no
botter answer than this to those who dlaim that the
work ethic is doad or dying.
Comparing a person on welf are with a person who is
working, assuming they are both receiving the same dollar
amount-and that isn't always so, as I shall indicate in a
f ew moments-the two incomos are flot comparable. Again
I quote Mr. Lalonde:
The fact remains that the two incomos are flot comparable, even if they have the same dollar amount
attached to them. The salary is subject ta numerous
doductions-for tax, for tho Canada Pension Plan, for
unemployment insurance-but the wolf are choque is
not. Health insuranco, free undor wolf are, must be
paid for when a person is working. In addition, there
are tho costs of working: transportation, tools and
uniforms, day caro in the case of mothors who head
their families. All those oxpensos throw that gross
oquality betweon incomos into gross net imbalanco.
Again, no incontive is present.
The Spocial Sonate Committeo on Poverty, which
brought in the report ontitled Poverty in Canada, first
puhlishod that statement. That statement, more than any
othor, shocked the Canadian people. But it did not shock
them onough to bring remedial action. Consequently, we
have to keop bringing it to the attention of the Canadian
people. The statement is supported by the Minister of
National Health and Welfare, Mr. Lalonde. Something
must be done. Have they not the right, as workers, to be
compensated and, moreover, rewardod for thoir oxpensos
in transportation, clothing, food and wear and tear,
beyond that which is available to those not in the labour
force in ordor that they may stay in the labour force?
I have a Toronto-Ottawa examplo, but it could be repeatod in every province. Let us for a moment examine the
working poor versus the welfare poor. In Ontario the
maximum welfare payment for a family of four is $375 a
month. A person working at the minimum wago of $2 an
hour in Ontario earns $80 for a 40-hour week or $344 a
month. That person is not oligible for any supplemont
from the Ontario Ministry of Community and Social Services to raise his income up to tho welf are level, no matter
how many children he has. In most parts of Ontario,
cortainly in Toronto and Ottawa, welf are rocipionts
receive free dental care, free eyeglasses, f ree prescription
drugs, and modicare. In addition, the welf are recipient can
supplement his income by working and oarning up to $24 a
month, plus $12 for each depondant without deduction.
[Hon. Mr. Croll

John Alexander, formerly the Metro Welfare Commissioner, now Deputy Minister of Community and Social Services for the Province of Ontario, said that for every
person on welf are in Metropolitan Toronto, two persons
work and take home less than they could get from the
welf are department. That is a very important statement. It
is a truism, and there are statistics to support it. Yet they
continue to work, and in a littie while I will indicate to
you why I think they continue to work.

Who can dispute the need for society to look after the
handicapped poor? It does not matter whether the handicaps arise from physical or mental disability, or age or a
broken family life. Communities have accepted this
responsibility since the beginning of time, even though the
welfare system, as it has existed in Canada, has become
archaic and discredited. Attitudes have changed dramatically and rapidly, and now the accepted view, as stated in
the Speech from the Throne in January 1973, is:
The social security system must assure to people who
cannot work, the aged, the blind and the disabled, a
compassionate and equitable guaranteed annual
income.
It is both simple and better to provide the handicapped
poor with enough money so that they can live in dignity.
But this is not enough.
I have extended the poverty line table for the year 1971
and for 1972. The poverty line table which appears in
'Poverty in Canada" is for the years 1961, 1965, 1966, 1969
and 1970. Thus the new table will be for the selected years
of 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1972. Also, in the table will appear
the Economic Council poverty line for 1972. 1 would ask
permission to insert that as part of my speech.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is that agreed, honourable
senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.

SENATE DEBA TES
SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Mr. Argue: This is your own opinion.
Hon. Mr. Croll: No. This is the poverty line that
appeared in the book Poverty in Canadaextended.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: You mean extended by you.
Hon. Mr. Croll: The criteria used is the same as that
used in Poverty in Canada.
It is one-half the average income level as corrected to
family size subject to inflation, as indicated by the consumer price index, and incorporating the quality of life as
indicated by the improvement in the gross national product. The Economic Council used a different criteria. Their
poverty line also appears in the table.
There are very many others, not nearly so visible, who
bear a dreadful burden of poverty. These are the working
poor. We ask, "What is the difference between the working
poor and the welfare poor?" Is it that the working poor
have jobs? So do many of the welf are poor. In neither case
is there much chance that work will lead the worker out of
poverty. Both are working for about the same rate, but the
jobs are low paid and lead to nowhere. They can often
meet their minimum needs for shelter, food and clothing,
but their lives are threadbare. Their problem is not unemployment but low wages. They work hard and long, and
still they are poor and effectively denied an acceptable
level of material wellbeing. For the working poor it is
always catch-up task victims of social and political muggery. They lack economic power, for one thing. Partly for
this reason, their earnings are at or near minimum wage
levels, and in some cases, such as domestics and farm
workers, they do not even have the protection of the
minimum wage law. They are the low people on the economic totem pole. For the most part, the working poor are
not organized. That is the crux of their problem.
Organized labour has, in my view, a social and moral
responsibility to the working poor which for too long has
not been fulfilled. Thirty per cent of the labour force in
this country is organized, and has been organized for a
number of years. It has been of great benefit to those who
belong to organized unions. It is not easy to organize those
presently unorganized. But it was not easy to organize the
automobile workers, the steel workers, and others who are
benefiting from trade unions. The social wages and fringe
benefits which organized labour bas negotiated for their
members are, in the main, denied to the working poor and
the unorganized. I thoroughly approve reading that those
automobile workers who were laid off would be drawing,
after one week, 95 per cent of their wages for a period of 26
weeks, and maybe 52 weeks, if they had enough seniority,
and that after 30 years of work in one of the automobile
plants could retire at 55 with a pension of $500 a month.
That is a fair reward for years of work.
Hon. Mr. Deschatelets: Was this before any collective

I now turn to social wages, fringe benefits, minimum
wages and study of work ethic. Social benefits came into
vogue after World War II, when unions began to assert the
right of workers and added the new dimension to wagessocial wages. So began a trend in which wages consisted of
money plus fringe benefits. This came about as a result of
collective bargaining by the unions, picket lines and some
lobbying, but some benefits came. Fringe benefits grew in
importance, dimension and size, and soon became a very
important part of the workers' security. At the present
time they are of considerable number and of great benefit
to the workers. Presently, fringe benefits are extended to
those on welfare, who usually receive medicare, dental
care, prescription drugs, sometimes glasses, and sometimes
other extraordinary items; fringe benefits that trade
unions have bargained for in the private and public sector,
which I will enumerate later, and fringe benefits which
are granted to keep unions out.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Out of what?
Hon. Mr. Croll: Out of plants. The labour unions fought
long and hard for fringe benefits-social wages. They now
are a vital element in many labour contracts. To the
working poor, these fringe benefits are something they
read about. But they have become an essential aspect of
modern industrial society and they cannot continue to be
denied to those who work at or about the minimum wage
level and have no collective bargaining strength and
power. This is to say that some of the fringe benefits
should be universally available. There is a package of
commonly acceptable fringe benefits which should be
available to all workers in the minimum wage area or
below the poverty line. Under law there is now available
holidays with pay, vacation pay, severance pay and other
benefits, but nothing at all like that which is available to
union members.
Is there a direct attack that might help? I believe the
most useful tack for new social programs at the present
time is to consider the problem of low-paid unstable work
with poor or no fringe benefits, to see what can be done to
make it more stable, to attach fringe benefits, increase its
security and, in effect, make low income work, which at
present supports and must be the major support of lower
income population, more rewarding and more attractive.
a (2100)
Here is one great area in which social inventiveness is
needed, and, surprisingly enough, the one in which the
least effort has been made. The game plan for the working
poor is social wages-fringe benefits.
We have to ask ourselves: Can we devise a job for the
worker-a job which offers a minimum wage, a guarantee
of that wage so long as he is willing to work, and does
work, with medical and health insurance, disability insurance, dental insurance and prescription drugs, all attached
to the job-all the benefits his unionized brother has?
It is automatic-work, produce. It is much better than
welfare, it has present and future security for the worker
and his family, and the country benefits from his production and saves money on welfare. It is not just a job; there
is enough in it to make it a career. It can be built into
something of substance, of quality-a job of some class he
may be proud of.

SENATE DEBATES
Much of our ingenuity in recent years has gone into the
effort to provide more money to the family without a
worker, and the family with a worker who provides less
than a poverty income. We have made non-work more and
more attractive in most of our provinces because our
minimum wages are far too low. We try to maintain a
decent standard of welfare, but it is spartan because we
keep our welf are at the minimum wage level.
Is it possible to do something now for workers? While
there are few incentives for employers to provide the work
benefits that go with standard jobs to those less qualified-primarily in the service occupations-it should be
possible for the government to set up something like a
minimum job standard guarantee program. The government does not have to provide the job, but it could provide
the common fringe benefits and the security that makes it
a real job.
In any event, the government will be paying it out in
supplemental income if they do not earn enough. I am
talking of universal and uniform basic benefits fitted to
family size, paid out under the Canada Assistance Act.
Thus we would provide the means for people to lift themselves out of the mire rather than requiring that they do
so.
Fringe benefits came about when employers recognized
that production and profit were not enough, that there
was a social obligation to the worker, that in addition to
his hourly wages there were other things that were beneficial to the employee-and the employer. The worker bargained hard for fringe benefits, and many times gave up
wage increases to gain them, and fringe benefits have now
come to be accepted where the worker bas bargaining
capacity. This is not true of those in the minimum wage
syndrome.
What the working poor need is a substitute for the
market power of the trade unions, for the politicai and
economic muscle which they possess. Big business can
look after itself, and big labour can look after itself, but
the rest cannot and they need help. This help can only be
supplied by the government-not to bargain with employers, but to bear the cost of the commonly acceptable fringe
benefits-in return for production that saves on welfare
and unemployment insurance payments.
Honourable senators, I have already indicated what benefits are available to the welfare poor. For those in the
trade union movement the benefits with the highest rate
of prevalence are:
1. Paid vacations, statutory holidays, Canada (or
Quebec) Pension Plan, bereavement/jury duty leave,
private pension plans, and group life insurance at 100
per cent.
2. Workmen's compensation and educational subsidies at 97.2 per cent.
3. Hospital, surgical, and medical benefits at 95.3 per
cent.
4. Non-occupational sickness and accident benefits
at 89.6 per cent.
5. Unemployment insurance at 88.7 per cent.
6. Rest periods at 84.9 per cent.
7. Safety clothing and equipment at 73.6 per cent.
[Hon. Mr. Croll.]

March 12, 1974

8. Medical supplies and service, parking and transportation at 71.7 per cent.
9. Service awards at 70.8 per cent.
10. Uniforms and/or laundry thereof at 68.9 per cent.
Then there is another classification, that of the enlightened employer. In that I include the Government of
Canada, the provinces and the municipalities. At one time
they were behind the private sector, but now the public
service has pulled ahead with 35 possible fringe benefits
available in the master government contract. There is
some cost sharing. I have here a list of the 35 fringe
benefits, as follows:
1. Medical and hospital coverage.
2. Disability benefit, public service management
insurance plan.
3. Pension plan.
4. Death benefits.
5. Supplementary death benefit.
6. Salary for month of death legislated benefitsunemployment insurance, workmen's compensation,
Canada/Quebec Pension Plan.
7. Absences from work.
8. Vacation leave.
9. Holidays.
10. Sick leave.
11. Special leave.
12. Rest periods.
13. Injury-on-duty leave.
14. Court leave.
15. Maternity leave.
16. Overtime.
17. Shift differentials.
18. Wash-up time.
19. Travel time.
20. Dirty work allowance.

22. Pay guarantees.
23. Call-back pay.
24. Reporting pay.

29. Parking facilities.
30. Subsidized food services.
31. Uniforms.
32. Recreational facilities.
33. Legal aid.
34. Memberships.
35. Credit union or loan association.
Unions achieve for their members, apart from wage
ncreases:
Supplementary hospital benefits.
Sickness and disability incomes.

March 12, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

Group life insurance.
Retirement plan contributions.
Accidental death and dismemberment insurance.
Extended vacation pay.
Dependents' insurance.
Dental coverage.
Job security, and other benefits.
These are not common to all union agreements, but most
are. The common ones in more than 50 per cent of the
union agreements should be applicable to the unorganized
in some form.
Can anyone argue seriously that such aids to weathering the minor and the major storms of life are not needed,
or should not be extended to all minimum wage
employees? Surely, their desirability for the disadvantaged is even more logical and evident. For the welfare
state, born from the mass impoverishment and misery of
the world depression of the 1930s, has helped the poor least
of all to break out, and has failed badly in redistributing
income. This is the paradox of our age, that poverty should
have grown in Canada when more and more billions of
dollars have been spent than ever before on forms of social
assistance. We have been successful and reached beyond
our means. Yet the poor of today are often the children of
the poor who missed the political and social gains of the
1930s.
We ask ourselves: How can fringe benefits be applied
with any degree of consistency to the working poor? We
are hardly so lacking in information on averages established by unions as not to be able to work out a formula
for action. Of course, there are administrative and technical difficulties-so there are in the collection of taxes, and
in this case no effort is spared to achieve an efficient
system, complete with giant computers and a highly
trained bureaucracy. Should anything less be expected of
the machinery that is needed to handle an integrated
payments scheme to deal with one of the major social ills
of our time?
Employee benefits are not handouts; they are regarded
as employers' social obligations in our society today.
Applying them to the working poor is no more than a
recognition that all of us face the same kind of economic
hazards in our round of daily living.
The working poor get sick, become riisabled, and even
die without the benefit of the kind of group insurance
systems which the trade unions have. The working poor
are often excluded from credit unions and, in fact, find it
difficult, and often impossible, to get consumer credit of
any kind, and then only at the highest rates of interest. It
is a clear responsibility of the government to see that the
fringe benefits which make life easier for the affluent
workers in private employment, and even more so in
public employment, are also provided to the poor in minimum wage employment, so that the work ethic by which
they abide has meaning and purpose.

e

(2110)

You may well ask: How do the working poor get by, if
they receive less from working than others receive from
welfare? They get by by having more than one breadwinner, and more than one pay cheque, in the home. The

breadwinner usually moonlights, working for any wage
just to earn some extra money, and he is prepared to work
overtime at regular rates rather than at double time or
time-and-a-half. The wife works part-time or full-time.
The children work part-time and sometimes full-time, and
their education suffers; they become school drop-outs for
family reasons. Sometimes at the end of the month they
have to practise dieting, and they hunger a little. The
wonder is that they work at all.
Since employee benefits are estimated by the experts to
represent a portion of industrial pay-rolls, depending upon
the fringe benefits that are available which differ almost
from contract to contract, it is ascertained that the gap
between the real income of the organized employee and
the working poor is actually much wider than comparisons
of their dollar incomes would suggest. Moreover, the gap
in benefits is in the most crucial areas of distress and
family crises. Reasonable minimum fringe benefits which
are common to trade union contracts, and to federal, provincial and municipal employees, will make it a real job
and not just a temporary interlude. There is a pattern of
fringe benefits commonly accepted which is not now
available to the unorganized. It is the intention that the
minimum common fringe benefits should be attached to
the jobs of the working poor who are in the minimum
wage bracket. This will have the effect of strengthening
the work ethic, and redistributing income and wealth with
greater equality.
You ask: Is the work ethic dead? Half a million Canadians can't be wrong. They are working. But people are now
demanding more interesting and constructive work. Is the
conventional concept still applicable? Some plants are
seeking to reorganize production so that workers can vary
their labour and learn new skills. There are movements
for worker participation in management, and for coownership of companies.
It is time now for the Senate to make a study of the
work ethic in order to explore changing work attitudes in
the light of modern times, modern jobs, modern pay and
benefits; in order to take evidence from those with complaints and ideas; and in order to make recommendations
on how we can enlarge the framework of liberty and
democracy in the work place.
This country could profit from an "in depth" study of
the work ethic as it applies in modern times to both work
and the worker. It would be a study by a committee that
would spend most of its time away from Ottawa seeing for
itself and hearing directly from persons most concerned;
rubbing shoulders with the world of realism and seeing
labour in the raw. It would give explanations and educate
the Canadian people with respect to what should be done
in addition to what I have already suggested, in order to
induce those who are reluctant to assume the role of
worker and producer, thus benefiting both themselves and
the country.
We are witnessing the paradox of high unemployment
going hand in hand with industries crying for help and, in
many instances, being forced to curtail operations because
of staff shortages. Why? We haven't the answers, unfortunately, but we could try to f ind some of the answers. There
are people who will tell you that welf are payments and
unemployment insurance are the chief reasons why people

SENATE DEBATES
do not want to work. That is a threadbare myth which has
been exploded repeatedly only to pop up again, and it is
about as true as the "welfare bum" myth.
It is obvious that work as an integral part of average
existence no longer commands the respect of a large part
of our society. The mechanization of industry with its
consequent monotony has made people into attendants of
machinery-turning knobs here, pulling switches there,
and doing the same dull chores over and over again. So
many things that once called for human skills are now
performed infinitely better by the machines we have
created.
This is the era of rising expectations in a consumer-oriented world. For many of us the work we do not only
bores us but fails to provide us with the means to acquire
what the media drums into our minds are the good things
of life.
Is the work ethic worth salvaging? Of course, it is. The
short work week is here to stay, but where does the
responsibility lie to make the hours of labour more meaningful? If the daily grind is to continue just that-a joyless, funless package-then we are headed for serious
trouble. Social welfare has not robbed people of their
initiative or their desire to improve their lot, but computerized society, and technology in general, makes work as a
means to any worthwhile end, other than putting food on
the table and paying the bills, most uninviting.
We need very urgently to do something about the minimum wage. It is inadequate and disgraceful in most sectors of this country. At the very least the minimum wage
should be sufficient to bring a man and his family above
the welfare and poverty line. We need to reconstruct the
low wage labour market which is without benefit of
unions, and which could do a much better job if the
opportunity were there.
While we are at it, the old canard, that if we raise the
minimum wage some industries will close down, is not
true. The history of raising the minimum wage in Canada
is that it seldom affected a job. I checked in the richest
province of Canada, the third richest and the seventh
richest, all of which had recently raised the minimum
wage. It is a myth; it is just not true. No jobs were lost.
The message comes through loud and clear-more needs
to be done if the stain of poverty is to be removed. The
trend to greater inequality in the distribution of incomes
must be reversed. Liberal and innovative methods are
vital to cope with the spectre of local unemployment.
Nothing must stand in the way of decisive action to
implement an integrated guaranteed annual income
system now. The discrimination that now exists cannot be
tolerated. For the working poor who are denied fringe
benefits, the government must step in to provide a minimum job standard to see that the job is one of quality, one
that the worker is proud of, and one that he can make a
career of. In that way we can preserve the work ethic.

[Translation]
Hon. Maurice Riel: Honourable senators, it is with a
deep feeling of apprehension and humility that I rise to
speak in this house where so many senior politicians full
of experience and wisdom have preceded me in this
[Hon. Mr. Croll.]

March 12, 1974

debate. But I know I can count on your indulgence. I need
it and I thank you in advance for it.
I should like to say first of all, Madam Speaker, how
pleased I am to have been called to the Senate under your
chairmanship.
The appointment of a lady to the head of one of the two
legislative bodies of this Parliament is indeed an outstanding event and a sign of the times. It is a step that now
seems normal toward the recognition of the equality of the
female and the male mind-I should say recognition of the
parity of any human mind because I do not like at all the
expression "equality of the sexes". As I was saying, the
appointment of a lady to the chairmanship of the Senate is
a step which seems normal today but which is still an
aberration in the mind of some. However, I am sure,
Madam, that those latecomers who have not yet come
around to the thought of parity of the female and male
mind would do so readily if they had the privilege we have
in this house to see you chair the Senate with so much
competence, dignity and authority. It is with the utmost
respect, Madam, that I extend to you my compliments as a
newcomer.
May I be allowed to add that it is also with great
pleasure that I have found in this assembly where I have
been called, a number of ladies whose contribution to the
debates of this place I have listened to carefully to my
great intellectual enrichment. I have always felt that the
wisdom developed in the home by women throughout the
ages of the history of mankind had a unique pragmatic
depth, and very foolish were those who neglected to make
use of it throughout the centuries. The wisdom of women
was once described as intuitive and that of men as logical.
I believe that they are only appearances, for what seems to
be intuition in women is only, to my mind, the result of a
long and silent maturation which expresses itself spontaneously and effortlessly when called upon. It is simply
because this reserve of wisdom was built up through the
ages and is always ready to spend itself given the opportunity. I add, without hesitation, that it always does so for
the greatest benefit of all.
Honourable senators, if you hear me speak with such
conviction of my confidence in the wisdom of women and
of their fundamental contribution to human destiny,
which I readily acknowledge, it is because I speak from
experience. Indeed, I had the good fortune to have at my
side, throughout my career, the silent-yet how full of the
soundest judgment-presence of a wife who gave me
children of whom I am happy and proud and who, by her
patient understanding and strength of character, contributed as much as I could myself to my presence in your
midst.
I would like to make another remark, honourable senators, and it is the following: When I was approached for
my appointment to the Senate, I must say that I knew
very few of its members. Like everybody, I had read in the
papers over the years and heard quite often some rather
unkind jokes on this assembly and its members. So, I had
a certain idea-since the expression is still in fashion-of
the Senate which was not very favourable. Then, when I
was appointed, I had for a while an uncertain and vague
reaction, neither fish, flesh nor fowl. But after taking my
seat and having the opportunity to meet my new col-

March

leagues, to hear them and see them at work, I can tell you
that my feeling toward the Senate and its members is not
either uncertain or vague any longer.
I found here an active chamber, busy committees, a
government leader with a wide experience, ably seconded
by the deputy leader, a devoted whip and assisted by
colleagues who are all most worthy.
I will be fair also to our friends on the other side, even
though I do not always agree with their claims. I think
that no one in this chamber will contradict me when I say
that the Opposition is led by a gentleman who has at his
side some very distinguished colleagues.
Allow me to refer especially to Senator O'Leary, whom I
did not know before, whose ringing and lofty eloquence
won my admiration right away.
Finally, I want to thank all my colleagues without
exception for the efficient support they have been giving
me so simply and so naturally since my arrival here. I
know I will make deep friendships here and what is more
important in life, especially when we can put them at the
disposal of our country!
Honourable senators, the newcomer among you finds in
this house skill, experience and work. As an example I
want to suggest not only the brilliant contribution of the
movers of the Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne, but also the debate on capital punishment and,
just before the Christmas recess, the debate on the Senate
amendment brought to the wiretapping bill. The people
who took part in these debates expressed themselves,
especially in the last debate, very strongly and with great
ponderability. What was described by newspapers and by
other information media as a big confrontation with the
House of Commons was considered by the Senate only as a
normal and habitual exercise of its duties; that is, to move
an amendment which seemed reasonable, a daily practice
apparently ignored not only by the public but also by
those who must inform the public.
This gave me the opportunity to see how the Senate
could be treated in some circles where they want to abolish it for reasons I still do not understand very well. There
is a French saying which goes like this:
Give a dog a bad name and hang him.
Experience taught me that when someone wants to play
a dirty trick, he begins by saying that he is doing it on
principle. I understood that the principle invoked against
the Senate was that it is a non-elected house. A newspaperman even wrote that this was against electoral democracy. I had always thought that we had a system of
parliamentary democracy.
We have in Canada, thank goodness, the British parliamentary system which maintains a delicate balance
between various elements of government, namely the
Crown, a non-elective higher chamber, and an elective
lower chamber to which the government is answerable.
Those who want to find out how favourably the British
system compares with others in the world need only look,
and they will realize how quickly the British crisis was
recently solved by a general election, while the United
States government seems to be undergoing for over a year
now a national loss of confidence which may very well
turn into a major constitutional crisis which is not likely

to reassure anybody, especially when the country involved
is one of the two great world powers.

Our political system, copied from the British system,
having in my opinion proven its superiority beyond question, I must admit that I was surprised to hear members of
Parliament who clamour for everything that is Tradition-with a capital T-Monarchy-with a capital M-and
Institutions-with a capital I, even as far as the lettering
on postal boxes or the colour of the boots of the RCMP,
turn suddenly against the Senate. Do these people not
realize that if the Senate were to disappear, the monarchy
would not survive long in this country? Do we have to
remind them that in France, in 1875, the republic was
proclaimed by only one vote and by a single house? Honourable senators, I am not afraid of words nor even of
things, but I do think people have to be consistent.
I do hope that those senior and experienced members of
Parliament who have made that mistake were only guilty
of momentary levity.
I must also say that I was amazed at the attacks directed
against the Senate in the mass media.
I wonder if there is one specific grievance against the
Senate? Can it be said that the Senate has ever done a
single thing against the interests of our nation?
On the contrary, if one recalls the history of the Senate
and checks all its actions, it is evident that the Senate has
always acted with wisdom and prudence even when its
opinion differed from that of the House of Commons.
Moreover, even those whose bills have been delayed,
amended or put aside by the Senate did not complain, at
least publicly, and did not use this as a pretext to ask for
its abolition. Since when, I ask the question, can anyone
propose the abolition of an institution that, during one
century, has rendered many services and against which no
reproach can be made?
I remember one day, at the Montreal Bar Associationthat is 25 years ago-certain people demanded the abolition of trials by jury for civil matters. A lawyer well
known for his picturesque language stood up and told this
story: My uncle Moïse who lived on a concession road in
the country had a big yellow dog. For many years, the dog
had been lying on the porch all day long and was never
heard barking. One of his neighbours asked one day:
"Moïse, for fifteen years I have been coming to see you
almost every day, and your old dog is still lying in the
same place and I never heard it barking. Didn't you ever
think it would be about time for you to get rid of it?" To
this my uncle Moïse replied: "Maybe it never barked, but
thieves never came. If thieves should come, it might bark
and perhaps no thieves come precisely because they see
my big yellow dog lying on the porch." Won over by this
quite simple argument, the members of the bar voted to
retain trial by jury in civil matters.
This story reminds me of the quatrain from an old
Quebec legend, that of the Golden Dog:
Je suis le chien qui ronge l'os
En le rongeant je prends mon repos
Un jour viendra qui n'est pas venu
Où je mordrai qui m'aura mordu

SENATE DEBATES
Honourable senators, I then read some newspaper items
demanding the abolition of the Senate because senators
are flot elected. Some of you remarked in December-and
rightly so-that a great many positions in our system are
flot elective and it does flot follow that such positions
should be abolished, or that the incumbents should be
elected.
Some have talked about judges, others about government officiais who in some cases have more influence on
legisiation than many members of Parliament. But to that
list 1 would like to add members of what is called the
Four-th Estate. Who would deny that today because of
developing means of communications, editorial writers,
commentators, news editors, speakers-as they say in
France-that is, announcers, even mere reporters or panelists and dise jockeys are more influential in pulîtîcs than
clected members of Parliament?
Everyone knows that a columnist who once or many
times a week writes a political column in several newspapers throughout Canada and who condemns or approves
measures or bis is more likely to influence the legisiatien, the minister or the public than ten members duly
elected and sitting in the House of Commons.
I had the opportunity a few years ago to invite a goverfimient minister in my province to a meeting of people as
revolutionary as myseif and for quite innocent purposes.
He replied: 'Should Le Deroir learn that 1 agreed to meet
your group. I would be hauled over the cuais. Therefore I
cannot accept your invitation.
Everybody knows that politicians or their assistants
anxiously read the newspapers every morning to find out
how they have been treated or how their statements have
been criticized. We say that it reflects public opinion.
Sumetîmes this reflection precedes public opinion, sometimes it foIlow s it, sometimes it misses the target and
soinetimes there are abuses. Who can be 100 per cent rîght?
However, I think that in our political system as a free
country the "Fourth Estate" is useful and even necessary
in spite of all its shortcomings. And yet, none of its
members f rom the bottom up is elected.
And if I can go a little beyond that, may I invite you to
listen to the radio and look at, television at any time of the
day, and you wîll realize that polîtîcal, social or even
religicus problemis are deait wîth as by a court of last
resoi t by an airay of non elected people. You hear them
prescrnt ail kînds of ideas, serious, preposterous, prejudîced or hiased, whîle the duly elected member of Parliamient cannot express hîmself through such mass media
preciscly because he has been elected and that broadcastîng and T.V. lime is restrîcted by law to very short periods
for the elected representatîves of recognîzed politîcal
par tics.
This is part of our polîtîcal system. Furthermore, some
even go as far as to say that it is normal for the mass
media to broadcast the views of the opponents to our
system, to the party in power, to the legally establîshed
authorîty since the opponent is the "underdog" and that
the "under-dog" needs help. Is this not evidence that we
lîve in an extremely free country when any government in
power considers such thîngs as normal regardless of the
mîsuses?

I say "misuses" because we really are under the impression sometimes that our radio and television are available
only to our Soljenitzyns.
Perhaps I dealt a lîttle too long wîth that subjeet, honour-able senators, and I apologize. I wanted sîmply to poinst
out, with examples from cveryday lîfe, the truthfulness
of the Gospel's words that it is easier to behold the mote in
une's brother's eye than to see the heam in one's own eye.
Honourable senators, it seems to me there is su much to
be done to help this country survive, in order that its
people may enjoy the highest standard of living, considering our possibilities, that we should not reject help from
anybody. If we determine the priorities as to the most
serious problems this country bas to cope with, I believe
the reexamination of our parliamentary system is not at
the top. There are other fish to fry.
The Oppositioni leader in his speech, along wîth soine
uîîtair things, undoubtedly dictated by a wrong vîew of
the situation, stated the main duties of the Senate. protectiun of the rîghts of the provinces, mînorîties and areas,
the îîght to re-examine legîsiation fromn the House of
('tutiîimons on second thought, investigation work in comn
n1îttees, about long-termi polîcies in science, poverty, econoii gr-o%&th, employment and prtce stahîlization cunstit ut ion aocd taxation.
Such is what we caîl our jurîsdiction. On the other hand,
we have before us an extremely heavy legîslative program
laid out for us by the government in the Speech from the
Throne.
Contrary tu Senators Flynn and O'Leary, I believe the
Speech from the Throne is extremely interesting.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Surprise!
Hon. Mr. Riel: When the guverfiment states that it bas
taken and will continue to take steps to improve the status
of women in Canada, I applaud and I think that thîs
bouse miust welcome the fact that we will finally be
grantîng the samne status to aIl Canadians. We are nu
longer in the stone age to treat women as inferior beings.
The honourable senators who have studied law in Quebec
will remember that famous phrase in the Civil Code which
we learned at the university and which ended with these
words:
-mnors, interdicted individuals and married women.
As mentioned in Les Plaideurs of Racine, il is better to
cut it short.
1 would have liked our friends in the Opposition ta take
the necessary tinme tu dwell îlot unly un that part of the
Speech from the Throne where the government intends to
(1(o justice to women, but on aIl the progressive and constructive measures stated in that Speech. However, our
two colleagues were only concerned with a commun fixed
idea, we are, according to them, in the abomination of
desulation and guing from bad to wurse. They see dragons
on the walls and the government through dark glasses.
Yet you who have travelled know very well that Canada
is une of the countries where it is always pleasant to live,
at ail times, in every season and in every regbon. Like ail

March 12, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

the other countries, Canada is fighting inflation; this is
nothing new and it will be the same tomorrow. Inflation is
a world-wide contagious disease and it is useless to deny
the influence that countries have on each other in this
respect. It is not the only factor, but it is a very important
one. It is unfortunate that we cannot go to the corner
drugstore to buy medicine for inflation, like we purchase
aspirin tablets for headaches. There is no patent medicine
to cure economic illness. A democratic government rarely
takes strict measures to fight inflation, like our government did in 1969 at the risk of harming its popularity. The
government acted with decisiveness and courage. The disease may not have yielded as anticipated to the remedy.
However, since then, the government has tried other medicines. It never gave up. It is because of its constant and
continuous efforts that our country has one of the lowest
inflation rates in the world.
I should like to remind my colleagues that during four
years, from 1969 to 1973, I had the privilege of sitting on
the Bank of Canada Board. I can testify that we have
there the most qualified experts who are a credit to us in
international meetings. I had the opportunity, during my
visits to Europe, to hear them praised. I am pleased to
state it publicly. This also applies to experts of the Department of Finance.
It is true that it is the government who is responsible for
an anti-inflationary policy but the government, in such
area, acts only after taking advice from its advisors. It is
not easy, as you will appreciate, to take decisions in this
area. The point is not to make big headlines in the papers
when one plays with the economic situation of a country,
when this policy may affect millions of people in their
everyday life. It is a huge responsibility. I saw Governor
Rasminsky looking 15 years older within two years, without ever complaining, without ever failing in his responsibilities, and this man, one of the greatest minds of our
country, was worn out when he retired.
It is easy to say afterwards we could have done this or
that, we could have applied Friedman's theory instead of
Keynes'. The laws of economy have not yet been defined as
those of physics or chemistry. Since Archimedes, as you all
know, schoolboys throughout the world learn that any
body immersed in water loses a weight equal to the weight
of the water displaced by the body. In economics, it is not
so well-defined and the reaction that takes place is only
known afterwards. This is often disappointing. Sometimes
it comes close to a disaster. It seems that at present,
throughout the Western World, the system no longer
answers in the anticipated way to usual orders.
Let me quote a few lines from a leading article in the
New York Times, business and finance section, of Sunday
last, March 10. The title is:

•

(2150)

[English]
Inflation! It's bad but not cataclysmic.
Prices seem to have taken leave of their senses and
most thoughtful men are filled with fear and trembling that the economy they thought they understood,
and in which they earn their bread, is in the process of
inflationary disintegration.
Existential fears of inflation do not spring alone
from what the price indexes are doing. There is in the

world economy a sociological and political whiff of
Germany in the 1920s or Brazil in the 1950s. In the
United States, the distribution of the life-fluid of the
economy, gasoline, has been in a state of chaos. In
Britain and France, economic woes have brought governments to grief, and Japan is threatening to go the
same way.
The article goes on to say:
Why are prices, particularly commodity prices, rising
so rapidly?

There is a general reason and a number of specific
reasons.
And the columnist emphasizes:
Prices are rising faster now, because central bankers have allowed money to grow faster over the last
five years, on average, than during the preceding
decade.
The specific reasons that commodity prices, rather
than other prices, have been severely affected by this
new permissiveness on the part of central bankers,
who are presumably paid not to be permissive in
monetary matters, are basically four:
Here, I quote only the headings:
1. It's partly a matter of catch-up.
2. It's partly a matter of worldwide prosperity.
3. It's partly a matter of bad luck on the supply side.
4. It's partly a matter of speculation.
Then, the article goes on to say:
Will inflation accelerate?
This is partly a question of luck, of how random
events will affect prices. But it is mainly a question of
how central bankers will behave.
To divine the answer to that question, a survey of
eight key countries has been conducted.
I should say that Canada is not among those countries.
Each was asked for data on recent monetary growth
rates, as well as for projections to mid-1975, if
possible.
Their numbers, assembled in the accompanying
table on monetary growth rates, indicate they expect
the world monetary authorities to behave about as
badly (or as well) as in the years since 1967.
On this assumption the economists prepared the
accompanying forecasts of both wholesale and retail
prices. These forecasts show that world inflation will,
in general, be at its worst in the first half of this year.
Prices will continue to rise, but by the second half of
1974, the pace of increase will be back to its trend rate.
What will governments do about inflation?
When a football team is not sure how to proceed, it
ordinarily punts. Central bankers can be expected to
do the same thing about inflation.
The policy equivalent of punting is to decide in
favor of a rate of growth of the money supply that
rationalizes the existing trend rate of inflation. An
examination of the money supply forecast for the
eight countries in the table indicates that most central
banks will opt for policies that are consistent with

SENATE DEBATES

prevaiied iii tbe past.
Centrai bankers long for direct wage and price controis because these off er a way te avoid responsibiiity
for inflation. But gevernments around tbe world bave

QUEBEC PROVINCIAL POLICE
FINANCIAL COMPENSATION FOR MAINTENANCE-QUESTION
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I have a question for the deputy leader
of the government.
Can he tell the Senate whether the Solicitor General
took a decision with regard to the request addressed to
him by the Quebec Minister of Justice concerning financial compensation for the maintenance of the Quebec
Provincial Police? If not, can he tell us when a decision
will be reached?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, I have no

Hon. Martial Asselin: I should like, first of all, to
congratulate His Excellency Jules Léger on his appointment as Governor General of Canada. I had the privilege
of knowing His Excellency when he was in Paris under
circumstances which required of him great diplomacy and
ability in reducing the tensions that existed between
France and Canada. He managed to do well, ably seconded
by Mrs. Léger.
He was therefore well prepared to assume his present
responsibilities.
[English]
May I say to you, Madam Speaker, that we are always
proud to have you as Speaker of this chamber and, as a
French Canadian, I am pleased to see the courage you
demonstrate every day by learning French. This is clear
evidence that you believe in a bilingual country.
[Translation]
Honourable senators, let me offer my congratulations to
the movers of the Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne.
Senator Robichaud will undoubtedly make a significant
contribution in our debates, especially since he has
acquired remarkable parliamentary experience in the New
Brunswick Legislature.
I am also pleased to salute Senator Perrault, a friend
with whom I had the opportunity of working in the other
place. I am sure that because of his eagerness, his public
spirit, and his qualities as an experienced parliamentarian,
he will be a very active member of our institution.
I do not wish to be in disagreement with the recent
appointment of new senators for I am happy to congratulate them on their appointment to the Senate. All had the
aptitudes and the qualities to sit in this house. However,
if only to repeat what the Leader of the Opposition so
rightly said in the masterly speech he made in this
debate, it seems to me that the appointment of too many
senacors on the government side further upsets the existing imbalance. I admit that traditionally the Prime Minister appoints to the Upper House personalities from the
political group in power. But since our party has not been
in power for such a long time, it would be advisable to

March 13, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

point out to the government leader that in following that
practice he is distoring the play of democracy.
*

(1410)

You will admit as I do that the official Opposition in the
Senate is not strong enough and does not fully represent
the main areas of Canada; several provinces have not even
one representative of our party in the Senate. You will
undoubtedly say that an exception was made in my case.
However, such an exception during the past 20 years does
not seem to me a convincing indication of a departure
from a policy followed so far for the appointment of
senators.
It is impossible for us, in spite of an efficient organization, to make up a real Opposition. A change of policy in
the appointment of senators would bolster the credibility
of this house and ensure, in my opinion, an excellent
process of sound democracy. Talking about democracy,
last night I listened to the excellent speech that my friend
Senator Riel gave in this house. I wish to congratulate him
on it. However, I had the impression, while listening to his
speech, that he was confused about the concept of democracy. When he referred to the speeches delivered in this
house by the Leader of the Opposition and by Senator
O'Leary, he seemed surprised about the fact that we in the
opposition often criticize government policies.
Honourable senators, this is the basis of a healthy
democracy. We must have the opportunity to criticize the
policies and the pieces of legislation introduced by the
government in order to improve them and give our interpretation to the population.
As I have just said, honourable senators, I have read the
Speech from the Throne very carefully. I have noted that
it contains good legislation designed to meet the crucial
problems of all Canadians. However, I do not think that
the solutions advocated in this speech are best suited to
meet the critical situation in which we find ourselves,
either on the social level or the economic level.
This Speech seems somewhat timid; I would even say
that it shows a certain incapacity of the government to
introduce short term remedies to fight unemployment,
curtail inflation and give to the poor of our society the
means to improve their lot.
Over the years, Canada never had such a challenge to
meet. With so much wealth available, Canadians have
never been in such a precarious position. It is all very well
to say that this government created more jobs this year;
the fact remains that the real level of unemployment is
unacceptable in a society such as ours.
It is all very well to say that inflation is mostly due to
external factors that are beyond our control and the government's control, but it is not possible to see such spiralling food prices without considering the implementation of
short term measures to stop it.
The government had every right to reject our proposals
for wage and price control legislation, but when this same
government in its Speech from the Throne fails to come up
with short term measures to fight this unrestrained escalation in the cost of living, I say that it shows to all
Canadians its helplessness to deal with this situation.

[English]
Honourable senators, the government has done virtually
nothing to stop inflation. In February 1973, Finance Minister John Turner presented a budget to the House of Commons which he said was "aimed at increasing the real
income and improving the standard of living of all
Canadians."
Opposition Leader Robert Stanfield predicted at the
time that Mr. Turner's budget proposals would not work
and put forward an economic stabilization plan incorporating a short freeze to be followed by a temporary
period of more flexible price and income controls.
The government, supported by the NDP, rejected the
plan outright and used vague references to the United
States experience to support their arguments. The same
arguments have been used by the Leader of the Government in this chamber to defend the policies of the government in this field. Meanwhile, honourable senators, we
must admit that the real losers are the ordinary Canadians
who suffer most the increase in the cost of living. As Mr.
Stanfield stated in the House of Commons on September
10, 1973:
The real losers are not the members of my party
who may lose motions of confidence from time to
time. The real losers are the Canadian people of ordinary means, because the ordinary Canadian cannot
ride things out. This is a tragic situation, all the more
tragic because there is an alternative.
* (1420)

Senator Martin, in his speech two weeks ago, said that
the government cannot accept the proposals put forward
by the Conservative Party for a temporary freeze on
wages and salaries, because this policy did not work well
in the United States-but Senator Martin must admit that
the United States had significantly lower inflation in 1972
and 1973 than had Canada.
It is impossible to find in the Speech from the Throne a
short-term policy to fight inflation. The present government has not only become indifferent to inflation, it has
encouraged it through excessive government spending,
which is up 20 per cent in the current year alone, and
through the increase of our money supply which has
doubled since 1968.
The average wage earner lost $5 per week in purchasing
power during 1973 as his wages failed to keep up with
inflation. A home buyer in our cities must now pay 72 per
cent more for his home than he did in 1968. Mortgage
interest rates have soared. Persons on a fixed income, and
persons with savings, have seen their dollar devalued by
over 30 per cent since 1968. A food basket of 15 items that
cost less than $10 three years ago now costs over $15, a 50
per cent jump. Yet the government's Throne Speech deals
only with the peripheral aspects of inflation; it does not
deal with the root causes of our current inflation which is
two-thirds home grown. The government seems to be so
preoccupied with the retention of power that it has neither
the time nor the will to control our inflation. Prime Minister Trudeau stated, "What is the point of being right and
being out of power." But surely the nation must ask,
"What is the point of being in power and not being right?"

SENATE DEBATES

Honourable senators, it is obvious that the present government has lost its will to deal with inflation. A Progressive Conservative government would accept as its first
challenge the containing of inflation in Canada. Through
sounder money management, better control of government
spending and the use of income and price controls, inflation can be controlled in Canada. We in the Progressive
Conservative Party have the will to take such action.
Specifically, we would take such steps as reducing or
eliminating the federal government's inflationary sales
taxes on building materials, energy products and clothing.
Our program has been put forward for over a year now,
and still the government says that we have no policy to
fight inflation.
Speaking about unemployment, Senator Martin said
that more jobs have been created in the last two years, but
he did not say that a great number of Canadians are still
jobless. Unemployment too is alive and well in Canada.
Unemployment in this country is running at an annual
rate of 5.6 per cent-that is, for December 1972 to December 1973, seasonally adjusted. This means, in human terms,
that 528,000 Canadians were out of work in December 1973.
During the first week of December 1973, Statistics
Canada revealed a special analysis of a survey taken in
1972 which showed that about a fifth of all unemployed
individuals came from families with an annual income of
less than $4,000, and a half from families with incomes
between $4,000 and $10,999. Heads of families accounted
for more than half of the total labour force. The survey
taken to examine the economic hardship to families,
during a year when the annual average unemployment
rate was established at 6.4 per cent of the labour force,
showed that about 52 per cent of all heads of families who
experienced unemployment were living on incomes of less
than $7,000. Only about 6 per cent were from families with
annual incomes over $15,000.
We, on this side of the chamber, cannot accept this
serious situation and, therefore, we ask the government to
find means and ways to bring about solutions to the
important problem of unemployment.
Senator Langlois said last week that we will find
everything in the Throne Speech to solve Canadian problems, but he did not say that the government had found
any specific measures to solve the problems in the short
term.
There are many deficiencies in the Throne Speech.
There is no provision for a public inquiry into unemployment insurance and the administration of the Unemployment Insurance Commission. There is no mention of the
reduction or elimination of federal sales taxes on all clothing and building materials; no mention of a reduction in
personal income taxes; no mention of an annual inquiry
into oil profits; no mention of an inter-city rapid transit
policy. There is also no provision for an immediate antiinflation program. The measures proposed will very likely
be inefficacious in dealing with inflation over the short
term.
[Translation]
Honourable senators, government members may be
right in saying that the Speech from the Throne contains
an impressive list of pious intentions on the part of the
[Hon. Mr. Asselin.]

March 13, 1974

government to legislate in several fields. But this speech
shows clearly that the government has abandoned the idea
to take short term measures to reduce inflationary pressures, especially as regards food.
By putting emphasis on long-term farm production
planning, by asserting that the main causes of the current
inflation have international connotations, the government
leaves very little hope to the consumer.
It is true that the Speech from the Throne mentions the
need on the part of the government to protect the consumer against an excessive food price increase. But considering the recent speech of the Minister of Agriculture, it
seems that the government will not substantially increase
its subsidies to consumers and that the Canadian people
will have to absorb higher prices which, according to the
minister, have become necessary in the agricultural field.
That Speech from the Throne is surely not one to quell
the anger of housewives whose budget is sharply eroded
every week by ever rising food prices.
Sugar yesterday showed skyrocketing prices, bread will
get its turn tomorrow and milk the day after tomorrow,
which drives to despair the small wage earner.
It is not in a year or two from now that action should
take place, as provided in measures in the Speech from the
Throne; it is right now. Moreover, I challenge the government members to show me in the Speech from the Throne
a clear indication that the government is planning to act
now. The Prime Minister was certainly right when he said
that this speech was flat and dull. It is high time the
government stopped listening to the NDP which is trying
to blackmail it into passing all sorts of socialistic measures
to deprive the private sector of all initiative.
There is only one way out for the Canadian people. They
must turn to the platform of our party which presents the
only alternative to many of these problems. Be it in the
areas of energy, regional development, inflation or tax
policy, our party has proposed honest solutions which this
government would be well advised to apply if it wants to
demonstrate its credibility to the Canadian electorate.

Honourable senators, I am sure that Quebecers will
remember, come election time, the firm and vigorous position the Conservative leader adopted towards them when
he forced the government to accept his plans for solving
the energy crisis in the Eastern provinces.
Mr. Stanfield was the first political leader to request
fiscal relief for the Eastern provinces to protect these
Canadians against discriminatory treatment with regard
to the rising cost of oil.
Honourable senators, this is the kind of quick decision
that we would like to see the present government take to
solve urgent problems which we are facing in other economic areas of this country.
To conclude, I would like to say a few words about the
controversy now taking place between the federal government and the government of the Province of Quebec as
regards cultural sovereignty.
We heard Senator Robichaud, Senator Martin and Senator Langlois appeal to the Quebec government to clear up
this situation that they say is ambiguous.

March 13, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

Of course, we heard these appeals, but we ask ourselves
a question. Why now? Why were they not made instead
during the election campaign when one of the main topics
of the Quebec Liberal government happened to be cultural
sovereignty? Of course, this was designed to obtain the
votes of Quebec self-righteous nationalists, and they
succeeded.
There again, we ask ourselves other questions. Do they
raise this matter of cultural sovereignty just before a
federal election to win the confidence of English-speaking
voters or are they using these old tactics of the Liberal
Party, which are obsolete and outmoded in my opinion
and which have been used so many times in the past, that
is, "divide and rule"?
However, may I be allowed to say to those senators who
alluded to that matter that no province in this country did
as much to protect the rights of its minorities as the
Province of Quebec.
If French-speaking minorities in the English provinces
had received the same treatment as the English minority
in the Province of Quebec, the right to speak their language and to preserve their heritage would have been
recognized long ago. When one considers that in 1974-I
repeat, in 1974-in New Brunswick a fight is still going on
for the right to plead in French before the courts of that
province, I wonder about the remarks made by some senators warning the government of the Province of Quebec
about the decisions it will have to take in the linguistic
and cultural areas.
I leave it to the experts on constitutional law, Senator
Goldenberg and Senator Forsey, to define the rights of the
provinces and the federal government in the field of cultural sovereignty.
Personally, I will not take part in that polemic. However, I say that it is time for the government of the
Province of Quebec to have the necessary legislative
instruments to protect the French language and ensure the
cultural survival of the six million French Canadians.
It is needless to remind you in concluding, honourable
senators, that the greatness and prestige of this country,
Canada, lies in the fact that its people is made up of two
majorities with different languages and traditions.
And added to the many ethnic groups, that diversity
makes up, I think, the strength and the greatness of this
country.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: On a question of privilege. Honourable senators, I did not want to interrupt my good friend,
Senator Asselin, during his speech, but I thought I heard
him say that during my intervention in this debate I
argued that the Speech from the Throne held the remedy
to all the problems existing in Canada.
I do not remember having ever expressed such a view
and I am even sure that I did not. On the contrary, I said
at least twice that I had no faith in global remedies and
answers or even in the most imaginative panacea.
Furthermore, as regards cultural sovereignty, I did not
take part in any way in the provincial elections last

October, but I do not find in the honourable senator's
speech anything that could disagree with what I said on
this matter last week.

Hon. Mr. Asselin: Honourable senators, to answer the
question of privilege raised by my honourable friend, I
may have said that when Senator Langlois gave the list of
all those pieces of legislation, during 20 minutes I think,
he enumerated all the legislation contained in the Speech
from the Throne. He was looking at us saying: Are those
measures not enough to deal with our problems?
That is the way you did it. Of course, you made an
inventory of all that, so I concluded that you were very
satisfied. I was impressed by the way in which you recited, the list of the bills included in the Speech from the
Throne. Then I said to myself: Well he seems satisfied and
believes that the government has done everything to deal
with our problems.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I did not know I had impressed you
all that much.
Hon. Mr. Asselin: As to my reference to cultural sovereignty, I think the senator touched on it. I am convinced
that he will agree with me that Quebec has a right to
legislate on linguistic matters.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I agree.

[English]
Hon. Mr. McElman: Would the honourable senator
permit a question? You mentioned that the people of New
Brunswick are trying to get access to the courts in a
particular language. Are you aware that it was Senator
Robichaud's government, when he was Premier of New
Brunswick, that brought in the Official Languages Act for
that province, which provides the access of which you
spoke?
a

(1440)

Is the honourable senator further aware that the statutes of New Brunswick, going back a very long time in the
history of Canada, have been, over the last several years,
under translation into the second language, so that the
courts can be accessible to all New Brunswickers, no
matter which of the languages they use? Is the honourable
senator aware that these things are in progress?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: This is not a question.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Is it a question or a speech?
Hon. Mr. McElman: I am asking a question of the
honourable senator; I am asking if he is aware of these
things.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: You can make a speech by asking
whether someone is aware of things.

Hon. Mr. Asselin: I am aware of this legislation, of
course. What I said was that in 1974, before the Supreme
Court of New Brunswick, some Acadian students were
denied the right to present their case before the court in
French, and they had to appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada to get an answer to their problems. The honourable senator will recall that a year or two ago a student
tried to plead his case in French before the court in New
Brunswick, but he did not have permission to do so. What
I said was that the situation in New Brunswick, and also
in other provinces, must be improved regarding the use of
French.

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. Mr. Prowse: I am not familiar with what goes on in
Eastern Canada, but am I not correct in thinking that
there is now a Conservative government in the Province
of New Brunswick?
Hon. Mr. Asselin: Right now, yes, and it is doing very
well.
Hon. Mr. Prowse: In the second language?
[Translation]
Hon. Eugene A. Forsey: Honourable senators, first I
wish to join fully and wholeheartedly in the warm tribute
paid so eloquently by the previous speakers to His Excellency the Governor General and his gracious and charming wife, also to the Speaker of the Senate and the staff of
this house who help us so ably and always so willingly at
the same time, and finally to the honourable senators who
moved and seconded the motion now under consideration.
My congratulations and my good wishes to all those
people. There is no need to repeat what others have
already said much more eloquently than I could myself,
but I would like to comment on what has been said.
I have no intention of going over the various measures
set forth in the Throne Speech. I should rather wait until
they reach the Senate. I shall instead address myself to
matters of a general nature, some of which have already
been raised in the speeches of Senators Flynn and
O'Leary.
I should have liked to continue in French, however
deficient it may be, but I want to quote several English
texts. Since I am not qualified to do instantaneous translation into French of any speech or part of a speech delivered in English, I shall spare honourable senators my
clumsy translations. I shall now proceed in English.
[English]
I should like at the very beginning-and I trust this will
appeal to my honourable friends of the Conservative
Party as a sign of grace on my part-to underline very
emphatically nearly all of what the Leader of the Opposition said on the subject of the desirability of increasing
the number of Conservative senators in this house. I have
said this before and I say it again. I trust that it may make
some impression in the proper quarters. I endorse almost
everything he said. He will soon see what the exception is,
and it is one to which I think he will take no objection.
He referred to the recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Constitution, which on this subject I think
were of excellent good sense, well founded, and of a
character to add to the efficiency and value of this chamber. I cannot see why something has not been done about
those particular recommendations. The general recommendations covered, of course, an immense amount of territory, and it would obviously be very difficult for any government to act quickly on the whole body of
recommendations. Indeed, there were some on which I
hope no government would act. I took strong objection to
certain of the recommendations. But here is a very simple
recommendation for the reform of the Senate, which I
think would be generally approved by the mass of the
people in the country, which has not been acted on, which
I venture to think would be passed very quickly by both
houses with a minimum objection from anybody at all,
except possibly the members of the New Democratic Party
[Hon. Mr. Asselin.]

March 13, 1974

in the other house, who simply manifest a Pavlovian
reaction of resentment and condemnation and malediction
at the mere mention of the Senate. However, whatever
their powers of obstruction, I do not think they could
exercise them for very long or very effectively on this
subject.
The only point on which I took exception to what the
Leader of the Opposition said on this subject is where he
said it was desirable to have representation of all shades
of political opinion in this chamber. I do not disagree that
it would be desirable, but I am afraid it is quite impossible
to have representation of the New Democratic Party in
this house because of the entêtement, the obstinacy, the
prejudice that that party has on the subject of this bouse.
Indeed, I have some reason to believe that the present
government did try to get a member, and a very prominent
and very distinguished member, a very learned member of
that party into this house, but that he declined, and
declined, partly at least, on the ground that his party
intimated that he would be cast into outer darkness,
excommunicated, if he ruined his reputation by coming
into this chamber.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: The same observation would apply
to the Parti Québécois also, I imagine.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Yes, I should imagine so. I am not
absolutely sure. I feel rather less confident in making
statements about that party than I do about the New
Democratie Party, with which I had a brief association
after its formation, and with whose predecessor I had a
long association.
The other thing I should like to emphasize in what the
Leader of the Opposition said on the subject of the Senate
and the conduct of affairs in the Senate is what he said
about our following our rules, and not hurrying through
consideration of legislation. I endorse what he said on that
in general. I endorse particularly what he said on the
subject of our dealing with the wiretapping bill. I think
this is where we made a rather serious mistake. Indeed, I
think that in the course of our discussion of the amendment and whether we should insist on it I made that point
plain.
I must confess that I was unfortunately absent when the
matter came before the Senate, but it was dealt with so
quickly, with such extraordinary, such flashing, such blazing celerity that, although I was back here at about a
quarter after two, within a quarter of an hour of our
proceedings starting, it had whizzed through and was on
its way back to the House of Commons with the information that we had struck out this clause. I think that was
unfortunate. I think there should have been more discussion here. We should have made some attempt to make
plain to the House of Commons why we felt as we did
about that particular clause which we decided to strike
out.
I might remark in passing that there has recently
appeared in the CanadianForum a most ill-informed-and
that is putting it mildly-a most biased, most partisan, a
most foolish denunciation of this chamber, to which I have
just penned a fairly stiff reply correcting some of the
misstatements of fact, and arguing certain other points. I
regret to say that I was obliged, in correcting one of the
statements of fact, to point out that our distinguished

March 13, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

colleague Senator Choquette was not in fact the leader of
the Conservative Party in this chamber. That is no disrespect to him, but the fact remains that, as far as I know,
the Honourable Senator Flynn has not yet made way for
him, however much he may intend to do so at some time in
the future.
*

(1450)

Hon. Mr. Choquette: That is nothing. The Canadian
press always says "Liberal-Ottawa."
Hon. Mr. Forsey: We would expect that the author of
this article, a professor of history, would be a trifle better
informed. This was the least of his errors, I may say, but
that is by the way.
Honourable senators, I want to emphasize, first of alland I trust I shall not be accused of partisanship in this, at
least-I want to emphasize, first of all, how heartily I
agree with the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition on
this subject, in general and in particular, with the one
exception that I have mentioned: that the best efforts of
any government to put NDP senators into this house will
always be frustrated. If the NDP ever gets a majority in
the other house, it will presumably have to appoint somebody here of its own party, unless it can get someone from
one of the other parties to be kind enough to introduce and
second its legislation, and unless it can persuade enough
members of other parties to support that legislation. But
that consummation, devoutly to be wished by the New
Democratic Party, is, I venture to say, not something to be
expected in the immediate future.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: No risk.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: I hope that the day when the New
Democratic Party will assume power in this country is
somewhat distant. Even if I live to be as old as one of my
Newfoundland ancestors, who lived to be a hundred years
and five months old, I strongly doubt whether I shall live
to see a New Democratic Party government. But I am a
very bad guesser about elections, so perhaps I shall be
proved wrong in this also. I confess, I hope not.
Now I want to turn to something that I suggested I
should be talking about when I was beginning my remarks
in my somewhat halting French: certain general considerations which have emerged from the debate so far. There
are a great many things which have been said and which
need to be repeated, but I am not going to repeat them.
There will be ample opportunity for others to do so. What
I want to deal with, rather, is certain attitudes which have
been made manifest in at least some of the speeches from
the Opposition side in this house and also in Conservative
speeches elsewhere.
Frankly, they have somewhat surprised me. I had not
realized quite what the basic philosophy of some of these
members of the Progressive Conservative Party was. I
thought I knew it in general but I am surprised that they
would go to the lengths that they apparently do. Both
Senator Flynn and Senator O'Leary-for whom I hope I
need hardly say I have the greatest respect; indeed, sometimes when I listen to their speeches I feel that whatever
the deficiencies of the Conservative representation in this
house in numbers, its quality makes up for a great deal of
that deficiency; and I mention Senator Flynn and Senator
O'Leary not out of any disrespect to their colleagues but

89

simply because I am about to comment on their particular
speeches.
They are a host in themselves. Senator O'Leary particularly, the dean of the Conservative senators in this house,
at least in age, delights and instructs us on many occasions
with his eloquence, his wit and his unparalleled knowledge, his unequalled knowledge of Canadian history. But I
agree-again, en passant-that even with such distinguished Conservative senators as we have here, it would
be desirable to have a few more to lighten the physical
load, the nervous load, which rests on their distinguished
colleagues.
There was an apparent theme in the speeches of Senator
O'Leary and Senator Flynn to the effect, first of all, the
country was really being run at the whim, at the dictates,
of the New Democratic Party, a small party which won
only 17 per cent of the votes in the last general election. I
take the figure, as one of them gave it, but I think it is
substantially correct. This has been one part of their
theme song. Another part of it has been that the government is utterly without principle, that it is merely being
kicked around, pushed around, wheedled around by this
minority party in the House of Commons, that the people
of Canada are being governed, contrary to their expressed
will, by a collection of unprincipled opportunists who just
bow to the dictates of this minority party.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: You have said it better than I would
have said it.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: I am sorry, I cannot overhear all the
interventions. I trust I shall be able to enjoy them when I
come to read Hansard tomorrow and I must be forgiven at
the moment for failing to make the replies which they
might seem to call for.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: The Leader of the Opposition was
just complimenting you on phrasing the situation so well.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: I suspected something of the sort. But
he had better not crow too soon or he will find he has to
express a note of dissent or discord before very long. I
noticed, for example, certain passages on page 27 of Hansard and also certain other passages on pages 39 and 40 of
Hansard which I shall not take the trouble to quote now
but which I think amply substantiate what I have said
about the attitude of the Opposition on this matter.
The trouble with this, it seems to me, is that these
honourable gentlemen simply do not understand what
modern liberalism is like.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: I know what is coming now, I know
what is coming now.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: That is the best joke I have heard yet.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: I never before saw people so
enthusiastic about applauding a statement of their own
misunderstanding and ignorance.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Coming from you.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: For them, Liberalism apparently
means nineteenth-century Manchester Cobdenism, nineteenth-century Manchester laissez-faire. That was Liberalism at one time. All I can say about that is that it has
long since, both in Great Britain and in this country,

SENATE DEBATES
ceased to be Liberalism. If you look at the history of the
Liberal Party in Great Britain, from the days of the
Asquith government and Lloyd George's unemployment
insurance and health insurance measures, right on until
the eclipse of the Liberal Party in Great Britain, and if
you look at a whole series of measures which have been
passed by the Liberal governments in this country, with
the general assent of the population and even of the
Conservative Party, I think you will see that this idea of
Liberalism as pure Manchester laissez-faire theory is completely superannuated and out of date.
In listening to the Conservative speeches, it seems to me
that the Conservatives or some of them have put on the
Liberals' cast-off, nineteenth-century old clothes and have
taken on the "Manchestertum," as the Germans called it,
the Manchester laissez-faire theory, of the last century. I
am reminded, by some of those speeches, of the preface to
Dicey's Second Edition of his Law and Opinion in England,
which is a long series of lamentations about almost everything that has happened since 1885. It is all dreadful, the
sins of socialism: unemployment insurance-aie, aie, aie!socialism, pure socialism. Health insurance-aie, aie, aie!pure socialism, et cetera, at cetera. Everything that had
happened since that laissez-faire time was abominable
beyond description.
I should like to ask the honourable gentlemen of the
Opposition which of the measures of the last session were
the socialist measures. I do not know. The NDP, which
ought presumably to be some kind of authority on this,
doesn't seem to feel that we have entered the socialist
promised land as a result of the pressure which it exerted
upon the government. I should like to ask which of the
measures in the last session was not in accordance with
modern Liberalism. Which one? Of which of these can you
say, "This was socialism, foisted upon us by these NDP
doctrinaires, these people who carry Karl Marx in the left
hand"-I suppose, not the right. The Honourable Senator
O'Leary accused the Prime Minister of carrying Adam
Smith in one hand and Karl Marx in the other; I presume
he would not accuse Mr. Lewis of carrying Adam Smith in
either hand. Which of the measures passed in the last
session of Parliament can be described as a socialist measure, let alone a Marxist measure? I can imagine the comments of anyone who calls himself any kind of Marxist, on
a proposition of that sort.
The Conservatives seem to think, some of them, that a
Liberal should be a conservative with a small "c', and a
very small "c" at that. When we don't fit into this narrow
pigeon-hole which they have constructed for us, they say
we are a lot of unprincipled scoundrels, that we have no
principles at all.
*

(1500)

I must say I don't see why we should allow ourselves to
be forced upon this, if I may change the metaphor, Procrustes' bed, where the Opposition will have the opportunity of chopping off either our heads or our feet in order to
make us fit the thing.
Incidentally, I notice that one of the honourable senators-I think it was the Leader of the Oppositionreferred to the legislation of the last session as consisting
of "minor bills". Well, this surprised me very much. Some
of them appeared to me to be of some importance. Some of
[Hon. Mr. Forsey.]

March 13, 1974

them at least were discussed in this chamber by members
on both sides as if they were of some importance. If these
are minor bills, I don't know what major bills would be.
But if they were minor bills-if the NDP pushed the
government, as this honourable senator said, into passing
a series of minor bills-if they were minor bills, what
becomes of the argument that the NDP has been pushing
the government and the country down a steep place into
the sea? It seems to me that you cannot have it both ways.
Either they were major bills, in which case they may have
been good or bad, or they were minor bills, in which case it
doesn't really matter very much, and there is no use
talking about the NDP hurrying us all headlong into
bottomless ruin and combustion. In one breath the legislation is unspeakably awful; in the next it is "minor".
I venture to think that what we have been witnessing
since the last election is a salutary restoration of the
power of Parliament. In a Parliament where nobody has a
clear majority it bas been possible for parties on the
Opposition side to produce some real effect upon legislation. This has been possible not only for the Progressive
Conservative Party, but also for the NDP. They have both
contributed to this process. Indeed, certain of the speakers
of the Progressive Conservative Party in this bouse have
underlined the fact that certain ideas, like the indexing of
the income tax, have in effect been stolen, unblushingly,
from the proposals of the Progressive Conservative Party.
That does not worry me very much.
If the Progressive Conservative Party bas good ideas, or
if the NDP bas good idesa, and the government adopts
them, what is important is that the ideas are good. True,
you can make game of the government by saying, "When
we first put forward these ideas they pooh-poohed them;
they laughed them to scorn. And now they are eating
humble pie; they are donning a white sheet, in effect. Now
they are accepting our ideas." This is a good debating
point and it is good party politics, but is does not really
worry me very much that the government bas been willing
to adopt good ideas from the other parties in the house,
whether they are from the NDP or from the Conservatives, or from the Créditistes, for that matter. I cannot
think of anything that the Créditistes have especially
contributed to legislation. But they may have, and it
doesn't worry me if it came from them.
I think it is a good thing that we are getting, in a sense,
something more like consensus politics, something more of
getting sensible things done and not worrying too much
about who does them. And if our friends, the Progressive
Conservative Party say, "That is all very well, but most of
the borrowing bas not been from us; most of it bas been in
the direction of this dreadful abyss, this yawning chasm of
socialism," all I can say is that I think that on occasion the
Progressive Conservative Party bas not only contributed a
number of positive ideas which have been accepted, but it
has also helped to prevent things from happening which
the government did not want but which the NDP did
want.
I think a signal instance of that is what was done with
the corporate tax proposals. Whether one agrees with
those or not-and I must confess to some slight skepticism
about those measures-nevertheless the fact remains that
the NDP did not get its way on this, and it did not get its

March 13, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

way partly because the Progressive Conservative Party
declined to go along with it and insisted that these things
should be treated in the way that they were treated. Again
the Progressive Conservative Party did not get its way
wholly either, but I think it exercised what probably most
of its supporters, in this house anyway, would agree was a
salutary influence on that particular piece of legislation.
Just in passing, I should like to make one minor comment on a statement of the Honourable Senator Flynn
about unemployment. I can only assume that his advisers
were insufficiently cautious in this instance, but I was
astounded to hear him say that the "unemployment has
certainly not diminished", and the context appears to
mean over the last year.
When I looked at the latest figures on the subject, and I
admit that the latest ones have come out only since Senstor Flynn spoke-at least to the best of my recollection
they have appeared only in the last day or so-but when I
went back a little bit in order to be fair to what Senator
Flynn had said, I found that the seasonally-adjusted percentage of unemployment in December 1972 was 6.7 per
cent, and.in December 1973 it was 5.4 per cent. I am not
conversant with the new mathematics. That has come
since my days as a school boy. But I should have thought
that 5.4 was less than 6.7
Then if you look at January 1973 you see that the
seasonally-adjusted percentage was 6.7 per cent, whereas
in January 1974 it was 5.5 per cent. Well, again to my
unsophisticated mind, this appears to indicate some
diminution.
If you look at the February figures, which I think have
appeared since Senator Flynn spoke, you will find that in
February 1973 it was 5.9 per cent, whereas in February
1974 it was 5.5 per cent.
Now, I admit at onceHon. Mr. Flynn: Where did you find that in my speech?
I don't know where you got those figures.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: On page 21, column 1, near the bottom-about ten or eleven lines frorn the bottom-you are
reported as saying, "Unemployment has certainly not
diminished."
Hon. Mr. Flynn: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Well, I have just given you the percentages. Now, I must admit that if Senator Flynn was
talking about absolute figures he may possibly have been
right. But, after all, you cannot just take absolute figures
as an index of unemployment, because the labour force is
growing all the time and the economy is growing all the
time. It is the proportion of the people who are unemployed which is significant.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I am taking the figures of Statistics
Canada, not those of Martin's bureau of statistics.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: My dear colleague, I am also taking
the figures of Statistics Canada, and I have the whole
collection of documents here on my desk, and, if necessary-it would take me a moment or two to find them-I
can produce the pages.
I am not taking anything from anybody over there on
the treasury benches, if I may so express it. I am taking it
from Statistics Canada, and those are the figures. I

rechecked thern shortly before I came into the chamber to
make sure that I had not copied them down wrong.
Now, I agree at once that the existing level of unemployment is far too high and that every effort must be made to
get it down. I think efforts are being made. The Opposition,
of course, will say that they are inadequate. Perhaps they
are, but the fact remains that some progress has been
made and I think further progress is possible-probable,
unless, of course, we get a major financial and economic
catastrophe resulting from the energy crisis and connected
matters.
Some things that are happening on the economic scene
are rather disquieting and we may well find ourselves in
the position where, as some experts say, we shall be worse
off than we have been for a very long time, and I mean not
only in this country, but internationally. But at present
there has been a diminution in the level of unemployment,
even if it bas not been as great a diminution as it should
be.
Now, inflation. Senator Asselin waxed very indignant at
allegations that the Conservative Party had no policy on
this. I don't blame him. I think such allegations are unfair.
It bas a policy on this subject, and that policy was set
forth, notably, by the Leader of the Opposition in his
speech here. Some of it, I think, is official Progressive
Conservative policy; some of it may be rather the expression of the particular views of the Leader of the Opposition in this bouse in supplement of the official policy. I
don't know. Perhaps some of what he said was simply an
expression of personal opinion.
*

(1510)

But what is that policy? There is a policy, yes, but what
is it? What kind of policy? What would it do?
Before I examine that in any detail, I want to make it
very clear that in my judgment inflation is a very difficult
and intractable problem. A very few years ago, any economist worth tuppence would have said, "Oh, it's a perfectly
easy thing to deal with. You just raise the rate of interest
and cut down the money supply, and you produce some
unemployment and do a few simple things like that, and
this sets matters to rights. You simply counter inflation by
orthodox deflationary measures-monetary and fiscaland there you are. The problem is solved. True, a certain
number of people get it in the neck in the process; true,
there is a certain amount of unemployment. But in the
splendid, self-regulating system which we possess, that
won't last long, and people won't suffer very severely, and
if you have a little of that disgusting and abominable
socialism in your economy, you'll have unemployment
insurance to tide them over the short-term difficulties
they face, and don't worry too much about it."
But we've found, and I think it's true to say that other
countries have found, that the orthodox remedies against
inflation-the simple deflationary remedies-don't work.
You can produce extra unemployment, and it doesn't stop
the inflation. As various honourable senators have pointed
out, you get inflation and unemployment raging at the
same time.
I am not, therefore, disposed to be unduly critical of any
proposal which anybody has for dealing with this situation. On the other hand, it seems to me quite clear that a

SENATE DEBATES
very large part of the rise in prices-and I'm not sure that
"inflation", with the shade of meaning that that word
carries, of something being blown up, as it were, deliberately, is quite the right word-it seems to me quite clear
that a very large part of this rise in prices which is taking
place across the world is the result of shortages in relation
to demand, and indeed, the honourable Leader of the
Opposition said as much in his remarks, as reported at
page 23. He was not prepared to say that that was the
whole thing, but he did say quite definitely-and let me
see if I've got it here:
We have been saying it for years and I repeat it
now: one of the best methods of fighting the present
inflation, intensified as it is by rising energy costs, is
expansion in the ability to produce.
He recognizes that the problem is partly, at least, one of
shortages, and I think we all do. I think possibly some
people are not willing to recognize the extent of the part
that that plays.
Well then, what is the Conservative policy? First of all,
and this appears to be official Conservative policy, we find
at page 23 of the Leader of the Opposition's speech, this:
The Progressive Conservative Party has enunciated
a series of proposals to fight inflation:
(a) It would bring in tax cuts. It would remove the
federal tax on building materials and on clothing for
everyone. It would also reduce taxes on personal
income.
(b) It would make sure that all its policies on
economic growth, regional development, foreign
investment, international trade, science and technology, were devised with a view to creating a maximum
of new jobs. This would be a major consideration.
(c) It would not shrink, if the cost of living continued to increase, from the responsibility to impose
temporary price and wage controls rather than impose
yet higher levels of unemployment.
Well now, first of all, to deal with (a) tax cuts. I
venture to suggest that tax cuts, on any considerable scale,
might further fuel the fires of inflation, partly because,
unless they were coupled with massive cuts in public
spending-which is something the honourable senator
comes to later, and which I shall comment on in a moment
or two-unless these tax cuts were coupled with massive
reductions in public spending, they would probably lead to
very large deficits, which it seems to me might have a
serious inflationary effect.
It is true that on the next page the honourable senator
says this:
-if we are going to control inflation, the government
must be ready to curb the money supplyAnd I will come to that in a moment, too.
-drastically reduce its own spendingSo he apparently envisages massive cuts in public spending. But that brings me to the question: Massive cuts in
what public spending? Senator O'Leary held forth with
enormous eloquence on the size of the debt and the debt
payments. Well, I'm afraid no government can do very
much about that unless it is prepared to go in for some
debt repudiation, and I'm quite certain that neither a
[Hon. Mr Forsey.]

March 13, 1974

Conservative government nor a Liberal government
would do that. So that's ruled out.
What else can be cut? What other things can be cut?
Well, I suppose the social services could be cut, but I
gravely doubt whether any government would dare make
drastic cuts in the expenditures for social services and
social welfare. If that is the kind of thing the Progressive
Conservative Party envisages, then the people of this
country are entitled to know about it, in very plain terms.
Perhaps it is necessary, and if they can prove it is necessary, very well, though I think they may have a considerable job doing it.
Then the second proposal in these three is that of
making sure that its policies were devised with a view to
creating a maximum of new jobs. That is like a resounding
declaration in favour of motherhood. Everybody believes
in that. I don't care what government you have, it would
subscribe to that one hundred per cent. They would say,
"Of course, that's what we want to do, and we assure you
that's what we're going to do," and the moment they
brought in anything specific, all the opposition parties,
whoever they were, would proceed to point out all the
deficiencies in the thing.
The third item is this temporary freeze on wages and
prices. I notice that Senator Flynn said that the party
"would not shrink, if the cost of living continued to
increase," from imposing a temporary freeze. But judging
from what I have read of the pronouncements by one of
the two eminent financial critics of the Conservative
Party elsewhere, it would seem that this is something that
is a little more precise, and that in fact the Progressive
Conservative Party, if it took office, would impose temporary wage and price controls for three months; and
indeed, that seems clear from what Senator O'Leary said.
Well, that sounds very nice, and of course it makes a
brave show: "We have the will. We will act. We won't be
supine. Let us have action." They have, of course, in their
party an eminent member who was the founder and head
of something called "Action Canada".
"Action" sounds very good, but one has to ask what sort
of action, and what kind of effect it is likely to produce.
Senator O'Leary said it would be a breathing spell of three
months. Let me quote exactly what he said. I think I have
it here. Let me see how it goes. He said
We should look at the situation to see what we can do
about prices in order to get at least a breathing spell
and to stop these runaway prices. Then we could sit
down, three months having gone by, and having
stopped this mad march of inflationIt might or might not do that, judging by the British and
American experience.
-we could see what we could do in the future. That is
all. There is nothing very remarkable about that.
Indeed, there is nothing very remarkable about it. Presumably, the Opposition has been so exhausted by its titanic
exertions to overthrow the present government that it has
got completely out of breath, and has been very short of
time to think about more permanent remedies for inflation. So it asks us to accept the view that if it gets into
office it will slap this three-month temporary freeze upon
wages and prices-a pretty large order, incidentally,

March 13, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

administratively and otherwise-and then it would sit
there and think.
Some of us remember Mr. Pearson's famous "Sixty Days
of Decision." This would apparently be-I shan't go so far
as to say "Ninety Days of Indecision," but "Ninety Days of
Meditation"-a sort of Yoga exercise on the part of the
Conservative government. Well, I have a high regard for
meditation. Meditation has played a very important part
in religious and psychological history, and I don't wish to
decry it for a moment. But what would emerge from this
meditation?
e <1520)
If you look at some of the other things that Senator
Flynn said, it becomes fairly clear that what would
emerge would be, for one thing, corporate tax cuts. Now,
isn't that lovely? Isn't that just lovely? We are told elsewhere that what we need is an opportunity for people to
make money, to make profits, because they are not now
getting "interesting" enough profits. I like that word "interesting". I have not been an assiduous reader of the
financial press, but I have seen a fair number of figures
published which struck me as showing profits that would
"interest" most people, and if they don't "interest" the
people who are getting them, some of these large national
and multinational corporations, then all I can say is that
they apparently need something extraordinarily powerful
to rouse them from their meditations when they are apparently incapable of doing very much because they are not
getting "interesting" enough profits.
So there would emerge from this period of meditation
corporate tax cuts and higher profits. That is what is
needed! Just look at this, and I quote from the speech of
the honourable Leader of the Opposition, at page 23, where
he says that the key to getting more production is:
Make it possible for the producer to turn an interesting profitYou see, I was not misquoting him.
-and he will produce all that is required. Production
is down today because there is not enough money to
be made.
I just wish I had bothered to get some of the figures. I
have seen them over and over again-we all have-huge
figures, enormous increases over the not insignificant or
inconsiderable profits of a year before. "There is not
enough money to be made. Producers are being strangled
by taxes"-that reminds me of the days when the "quiet
revolution" was raging in Quebec, a revolution which I
think the Honourable Senator Flynn at the time characterized as being rather noisy-"tapageuse", I think, was the
word he used, and very correctly.
I remember in the course of that discussion seeing a
statement by one of the more advanced revolutionaries
that the province of Quebec and French Canadians were
being "stifled," and I thought to myself, "Well, if they can
make all this noise when they are stifled, they certainly
would make a considerable racket, noise, if they were
released from the stifling." Similarly, if the big corporations can make the profits that they are making now while
being "strangled" by taxes-how delightful this must
sound to Mr. Lewis; it is the counterpoint, shall I say, to
his song about the corporate rip-off-if they can make all

this money while being "strangled", what would they do if
a Progressive Conservative government came in and loosened the noose which is now, so we are told in effect,
around their necks?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: May I, at this point, put a question to
the honourable senator?
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Might I ask if he read the Speech from
the Throne, particularly the part where it says that one of
the main objectives set out in the working paper and
agreed on by federal and provincial administrations was
to strengthen the incentive toward and the reward for
productive self-reliance on the part of all who participate
in economic af f airs. What does that mean?
Hon. Mr. Forsey: I venture to say that it does not mean
an appreciable cut in corporate taxes. If you cut corporate
taxesHon. Mr. Flynn: What does it mean?
Hon. Mr. Forsey: I don't know. I am not a Privy Councillor-even in opposition. I am not privy to the designs
which the government has in mind. When we see the
legislation, it will be another situation. We may get a
budget which will delight the hearts of honourable gentlemen just to my right here because it will cut corporate
taxes all over the place. I am a little doubtful about that,
but we shall see.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: That is what you said last year.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Then the next thing that would
emerge, apparently, from this period of Yoga meditation is
"curbing the money supply." That appears on page 24:
-if we are going to control inflation, the government
must be ready to curb the money supplyThat is the classical remedy for inflation; that is sheer
deflation and the kind of thing that would produce massive unemployment. There is no surer prescription for
massive unemployment than cutting the money supply,
especially if it is coupled with drastic cuts in government
spending and cuts in corporate taxes to improve the profit
figures for corporations.
I am sure that the Progressive Conservative Party will
disclaim any intention of cutting social services, but if you
read Senator O'Leary's denunciations of the welfare state,
you will begin to cherish doubts on this subject. I was a
little surprised that Senator O'Leary, of all people, should
engage in these denunciations, because it seems to me that
some part of the welf are state which we now enjoy is the
creation of the Progressive Conservative Party itself. It is
true that its f irst effort to introduce what we might call the
welf are state on a massive scale, by the Bennett New Deal,
came a cropper in the courts. But if you look at the
Bennett New Deal legislation, you will see that it is a very
far cry from Manchester laissez-faire, from hymning the
glories of free enterprise; and if you look at some of the
legislation that Mr. Diefenbaker's government passed, you
will see that there is also a good deal of welfare state-ism
in that and certainly a considerable number of interferences with free enterprise.
I cast my mind back farther, when I hear about the
wickedness of government interference and the necessity

SENATE DEBATES
for more free enterprise, and I ask, "Who was it who
introduced the protective tariff in this country?" It was
done for what I consider to be perfectly good reasons, and
I am not criticizing the Conservative Party for this. But it
is not free enterprise. Who was responsible for the building of the CPR, which was done by a massive interference
with free enterprise in the form of huge government
subsidies and, again, for what I consider to be perfectly
good reasons. But if it had been said to the capitalists of
that day, "Go ahead and build the Canadian Pacific Railway on your own; you are not going to get any help from
us; you are not going to get any monopoly clause in your
charter"-which they got-"you are not going to get any
subsidies; you are not going to get any help with loans, or
this or that; you are on your own, boys, this is free
enterprise. Look at Cobden; read Bright; read the other
apostles of Manchester laissez-faire Liberalism; go ahead,
the field is yours," we would not have had the CPR yet.
Well, we might have had it by this time, but we would
have waited a very, very long time for it. "The National
Dream" we should have gone on dreaming for a great
many decades before we ever got it. But that is by the
way, perhaps.
But when I asked my question of Senator O'Leary as to
what would emerge from this period of three months of
cogitation and meditation, he said, "That is just another of
those damned clichés you have been using over and over
again," and the Leader of the Opposition chimed in with,
"What he says is always somewhat "forcé"-a flight of
imaginative wit which I admire greatly.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I would repeat it today.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Very well. I am sure you would,
several times, and with gusto, fortissimo. It doesn't disturb
me in the least, I might add.
I am not accustomed to using the adjective "damned,"
and I shall refrain from doing so in this case, but it seems
to me that one might reasonably go so far as to say that
many of the things that have been said in this house by
Conservative speakers about free enterprise and welfare
state-ism could be described as dangerous clichés. As I
listened to some of these speeches, and as I listened to my
journalistic friend, Mr. Charles Lynch, the other day on
the progran Cross-Country Checkup where we were colleagues on the air, and listened to some of his conversation
at moments when we were not on the air, I couldn't help
saying to myself, "Progressive Conservative, Progressive
Conservative-where is the progressive part of the thing?
The conservatism is plain for all to see; it shouts from the
housetops. But where is the progressive part of it?" Puzzle-find the progressive in some of the Progressive
Conservatives.
With that I just wish to conclude-and there will be a
sigh of relief and muttered te deums, no doubt, from more
than one honourable senator-by saying that as I listen to
some of the speeches, and as I contemplate some of the
views expressed by some members of the Progressive
Conservative Party, I cannot help wondering whether Mr.
Stanfield, who is, I think, a genuinely progressive Conservative-not one who sighs for the age of the dinosaurs-I
cannot help wondering whether as he surveys some of his
troops he may not feel inclined to echo the words of the
Duke of Wellington as he surveyed his troops, "I don't
[Hon. Mr. Forsey.]

know what effect these men will have upon the enemy,
but, by God, they terrify me."

e

(1530)

Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, I rise on a question of order. Rule 28 of our rules provides that:
A senator shall not speak twice to a question before
the Senate except in explanation of a material part of
his speech in which he may have been misunderstood,
and then he shall not introduce new matter.
Well, I have been not only misunderstood, but my speech
in its material parts has been distorted. However, it would
be too time-consuming to speak in explanation and I shall
leave the responsibility to Senator Forsey for having completely distorted what I said.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Honourable senators, if I have distorted the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition, I am
extremely sorry. I read the words and I put upon them the
construction which they seemed to bear. If I have been
mistaken, I suppose the honourable Leader of the Opposition can simply put it down to a double dose of original sin
and invincible ignorance, or total mental incapacity. However, I leave it to honourable senators themselves to read
what the Leader of the Opposition said and read the
construction that I put upon it, and ask themselves whether in fact I have distorted it. If I have distorted it, I am
very sorry and it was without any intention. I am afraid,
however, that I am unable to place upon it any construction except that which I did place upon it.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I do not doubt that.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: I am sorry also that time was lacking
for the honourable gentleman to point out the apparently
numerous errors which he contends I have made.
Hon. Mr. Carter: Would the honourable senator permit
a question? I was interested in my honourable friend's
reference to the wiretapping bill. As I listened to him I
gained the impression that there was not very much
debate on the report of the committee, and it was rushed
through with little consideration. He probably did not
intend to convey that impression, but my recollection is
that there was a reasonable amount of debate on the
committee's report at that time. However, I agree with him
that we did not handle the report in such a manner as to
convey to the other place our reasons for the amendment.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: There was no debate.
Hon. Mr. Carter: In my opinion, the matter was debated,
and it was not rushed through without consideration.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: With leave.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: With regard to that point-I do not
think it can be called a question exactly-I simply said
that the amount of time devoted to it was small. My
recollection may be at fault when I say that I was back
here by about a quarter past two; it may have been 20
minutes past two. However, I think there is little question
that that debate was a brief one.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: There was none.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: And my recollection is that the Leader
of the Opposition is perfectly correct in saying that we

March 13, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

proceeded to receive the report of the committee, and give
third reading at the same sitting.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Yes; and without debate.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: If I am mistaken in that, I am again
very sorry, but my impression is that the report of the
committee was accepted and the third reading given on
the same day, after only a very brief debate.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: No debate.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: So in this case I have the support of
the Leader of the Opposition.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: You are in bad company.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: He is a reluctant dragon in my
defence, but he is a dragon nonetheless.

[Translation]

Hon. Paul Desruisseaux: Honourable senators, how
could anyone who has listened to our speeches and verbal
exchanges this afternoon say that the Senate is not very
much alive? Today's debates have shown that it is, very
much so. Moreover, one is always impressed by the fact
that everything is done in a friendly way.
I highly appreciated this afternoon the remarks of Senator Asselin, the rejoinders of Senator Flynn and the usual
high oratory, in French as well as in English, of Senator
Forsey. I admire his eloquence and I wish I could do as
well, but I believe you will have the antithesis this
afternoon.
Hon. M. Forsey: Oh, no!
Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: Honourable senators, I would
like briefly to join all those who spoke before me and
extend sincere thanks, congratulations and best wishes
to his Excellency the Right Honourable Roland Michener
who ended a brilliant seven-year mandate in the service of
Canada, as well as to his successor, the Right Honourable
Jules Léger who, after a very successful public and
diplomatic career in many countries, is destined for a
brilliant future here in Canada; his appointment is a
judicious and first rate decision.
It is almost needless now to point out the tireless work
of the Speaker of the Senate, the Honourable Muriel Fergusson, during the First Session of the 29th Parliament. I
commend you especially, Madam, for your mastery of both
official languages which you keep on showing in all functions and which distinguishes you so well in this higher
chamber.
The appointment by the Prime Minister of ten new
senators during the previous session, with an average age
of 53.8, was in my view clever and appropriate. Their
participation will be, of course, an important contribution
to the Senate's affairs and achievements, thanks to their
qualifications, their experience, their understanding of the
needs of our people and knowledge of our economic
problems.
I was pleased to hear the Leader of the Opposition and
the Government Leader refer to the question of representation in the Senate.
I agree with them. Ideally, all political parties which are
properly represented in the House of Commons should

also be properly represented in the Senate. Perhaps some
Liberal senators will want to suggest that we do not hold
in the House of Commons all the seats that we want.
The spirit of fairness and equity shown by the Prime
Minister during his mandate and demonstrated by several
excellent corrective appointments, five I believe, could
lead him to make other important ones in order to balance
more properly our representation in the Senate.
During the parliamentary terms of the King, St. Laurent, Diefenbaker, Pearson and Trudeau governments, 164
senators were appointed. The Liberals appointed Liberals
except 2 Conservatives, 1 Independent Liberal, 2
Independents and 1 Social Creditor. Except for 1 Conservative, 1 Independent, and 1 Independent Liberal
appointed by Mr. St. Laurent, all others were appointed, I
believe, by Mr. Trudeau. No other Prime Minister had
appointed so many citizens outside his party. From 1957 to
1963, Mr. Diefenbaker appointed 37 Conservatives and one
Independent Conservative. The Leader of the Opposition
in the Senate bas pointed out the situation of our current
representation. It is not an adequate and acceptable
representation in our modern framework. It does not
reflect the judgment rendered by the people.
I should like to criticize something, if I may.
The time-honoured "custom" of keeping ministers and
honourable members of the House of Commons on the
other side during certain official functions-as was the
case on the prorogation of the last session-in a crowded
area, standing, with hardly any elbow room in spite of the
inevitable overflow into the anteroom of the Senate is, in
my opinion, outdated, in spite of the fact that I am aware
of its significance. It is an antiquated and useless custom.
We must change it to provide House of Commons representatives with the same comfort we enjoy ourselves on
those occasions. I think that this could contribute to the
elimination of a number of causes for irritation which are
sometimes quite visible.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: And audible-not only visible; they
could be heard.
Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: I could certainly not blame
them, under these circumstances.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I do not blame them either.
Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: The mover and seconder of the
Address in reply to the Speech from the Throne, Senators
Robichaud and Perrault, as well as the previous distinguished speakers, have made an impressive analysis of the
Speech. I appreciated especially the observations made by
Senator Martin, our leader, and Senator Flynn, Leader of
the Opposition.

[English]

I shall try to avoid repetition, and will limit my remarks
to inflation and the energy crisis. In commenting on some
of our present problems and the measures proposed to deal
with them, I shall endeavour to be as brief as possible. I
appreciated what the Leader of the Government, the Honourable Paul Martin, said about inflation. Inflation is not,
of course, a Canadian phenomenon; it is worldwide. Industrialized nations are witnessing it to a higher degree than
are developing nations, but nevertheless it is worldwide.

SENATE DEBATES
I have here a table indicating the gross national products of 26 of the most important nations, their rate of real
growth and rate of inflation. Lt will be seen that Canada is
in a most favourable and enviable position. For the sake of
expediency I request that the table, prepared by the
Department of Economics of McGraw Publications and
released last July, be printed in today's Hansard at this
point in my speech.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable
senators?

Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: The figures for Canada, as compared with those for Common Market and other countries,
indicate that the problem of inflation is not as severe in
Canada as it is in most of the other 26 nations.
IHon. Mr. Desruisseaux.]

March 13,1974
Mrh1,17

Some highly-organized and tightly-controlled nations
have strongly attempted through legisiation to stop, or at
least regulate, the spread of this cancer. Bold restrictive
measures were passed without apparent positive effects.
Inflation has continued its course. Socialistic nations are
not exempt from inflation. Why is this so? Why is inf lation s0 general, and why is Canada so affected?
The subj ect was touched upon briefly by previous
speakers, particularly by the Leader of the Government.
In a simplified way I believe that inflation is caused
basically by shortages of supplies which seem, in turn, to
trigger the higher demands of consumers wanting to protect their needs, thereby adding to the shortages. Because
of the scarcities thus created, prices have skyrocketed in
the search for the highest markets and strongest demand.
Despite controlling legisiation, no one has been able to
replace the operation of the basic law of supply and
demand, which influences prices and national economies.
Many of the measures mentioned in the Throne Speech
have the intelligent objective of encouraging the rapid
increase of our agricultural supplies and commodities.
Similar encouragement is essential with regard to our
other natural resources, the supply of which will have to
be expanded as quickly as possible.
The lessons of today fully justify measures which will
provide methodical improvement in a number of peripheral areas of policy and basic reform, where their impact
will be f elt for many years to corne.
In the areas of agriculture and agricultural commodities,
neglected as they have been in recent years by most
countries, there is now great promise in proposed legislation to expand food production, provide stability of
income to farmers through sale volumes, encourage the
storage of surpluses for future lean years, and end the
flight from the land. These proposals provide, in effect, a
total reversal of the policies of the last decade, in Canada
and in many other countries, which promoted cutbacks in
f ood production, instability of farm income, the depopulation of rural areas and the destruction of prime farm land
by urbanization.
Present marketing facilities for Canadian farmers,
except in the case of Western grain, appear to be inadequate, inefficient and disorganized. There does not appear
to exist enough computerized information on instant
inventories, availability, trends and prices, on cither a
national or world scale. We should study the ideal marketing set-up, such as that found in California. The wide
price-spread between the producer. the intermediary and
the consumer seems in many instances to be out of line
and unjustified.
0 (1600)
I strongly appeal to the Senate to institute immediately,
while the facts are stili fresh in our minds, an in-depth
study of these rumoured unjustified discrepancies, as well
as the runaway prices on commodities which we import,
such as tea, coffee and sugar, the last of which rose
anywhere from 6 cents to 36 cents a pound in no time at ail.
The increases were flot the same in Canada as they were
in many other countries. Why? The same applies to fruits
and vegetables, and other exotic foods and herbs, and the
whole of our present marketing facilities. This periodic
"price raiding"' in the name of shortages, some of which is

March 13, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

created by news of some important shortage which later,
because of factual statistics, has to be denied, should be
investigated. Someone is using these figures. We should
find some means by which to have those responsible for
"fleecing" the consumers criminally charged.
The Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture should
be fully empowered to help remove some of the abuses we
are witnessing today with respect to food prices, and the
price-fixing of certain commodities. In this respect I am
not putting the blame on the supermarkets. Something has
gone wrong with the whole system. It is immoral, as far as
I am concerned.
Let us break the back of inflation of food prices in
Canada, not by price controls or restraints, but by making
the public aware of the facts and misrepresentations.
Public exposure of the greedy ones, and prosecution whenever a crime has been committed, is needed at this time as
never before.
The Canadian government has, thus far, acted wisely in
respect of the world inflation crisis. In my opinion, the
recent policies of moderation in the economic field will do
more than artificial controls and restrictive measures have
done south of the border, and in most of the other countries where such measures were instituted. Canada will
reap more benefits as a result of this wisdom.
I fully agree that the overall problems resulting from
shortages of supplies, however created, are the principal
causes of spiraling prices. The same holds true in respect
of our supplies of other natural resources. Eventually, this
will have to be taken into account, since the corrective
measures are the same. Basically, more supplies are
needed to bring down prices. The policy based on preservation-or should I call it the "hoarding of natural
resources,"-for posterity inflates prices. The same is true
for manufactured products, since there are also some
shortages in that field. The remedy is to create, as quickly
as possible, adequate supplies for our needs and, in so far
as possible, for the needs of the other nations of the world.
But this must be done intelligently, and we must know
when to stop.
I should like now to make certain comments on the
energy crisis. Again, the situation here is one of worldwide
shortages. The worldwide shortage of energy has been
brought about, principally by the studied, concentrated
action on the part of some important overseas major oil
producing countries.
Personally, I have never looked on it as a long-term
problem. At the present time, two-thirds of Canada's
energy needs are satisfied by two fossil fuels, those being
crude oil, which is produced by conventional rhethods, and
natural gas. Canada is blessed with abundant reserves of
these two fuels, most of which are as yet quite untapped
or untouched. These reserves can, predictably, last until
such time as technology and science provide us with
economical, usable alternative energy sources.
Uranium is increasingly being used as a source of
energy. Ten years from now, 30 per cent of our energy
supplies could well be derived from uranium. There are
fantastically large untapped reserves of hydro power,
especially in the northern parts of Quebec, Labrador, and
the Bay of Fundy area of the Maritimes. In addition, there

27601-7

are immense known surfaces of visible untouched coal
reserves that can be used directly to produce power, or
indirectly by the extraction of oil.
Technology has made rapid progress in enabling us to
extract oil from huge shale and tar sand deposits more
economically. In today's newspapers, there is an article
about the selling of very large holdings of shale in the
United States to oil companies, which means that they are
preparing, because of the progress in technology, to
extract oil from shale deposits. There is no doubt in my
mind that our resources will multiply when we look below
the surface.
Science has given us full access to nuclear fusion, which
is the process by which the sun produces energy. This is
an undepleting energy resource. Breeder reactors are rapidly being built, and they will supply much of our energy.
Perhaps the most important technological development in
recent years is the mastering of hydrogen. Hydrogen is a
safe, undepleting source of energy which creates no problems, and is usable wherever gas and oil can be used. The
sun, the winds, volcanoes and the thermal heat found in
the bowels of the earth can meet more of our needs when
science and technology further masters the economical use
of hydrogen in producing energy.
*

(1610)

We can even use wood, surpluses of crops-almost any
of them-to produce economically wood alcohol, industrial
alcohol derivatives, which can be mixed with petrol in
certain percentages to provide a much higher quality, and
a more efficient fuel, than we now use. More than anything else, fear, created mostly by bad news and exaggerated reports, has caused most of the decreases of our
present supplies.
Most of the shortages were man-made. In the years to
come, we will look back at present times and wonder as to
the "why" of it, for I really believe man always will have
sufficient imagination and technological and scientific
knowledge to develop, as he surely will, many alternatives
that will more than f ill our needs in the future.
Let me recount briefly a history, which evidently does
not support the predictions some have been making. The
first reported energy crisis occurred during Paleolithic
times as a result of man's too heavy reliance on a "hunting-and-gathering" economy that exploited them. Faced
with a shortage of animal food, man had to move, die, or
change the basis of his economy. Those who followed the
last course developed agriculture. Anthropologists believe
that the scarcity of animals precipitated the neolithic
revolution.
Thousands of years later, it was the Romans meeting an
energy crisis-a manpower shortage-by developing her
waterpower. As the population of the empire plummeted,
waterpower was put into general use. Twelve hundred
years later, a shortage of wood laid the foundation for the
industrial revolution.
During the Renaissance, wood was employed to an
astonishing degree. Virtually everything was constructed
of wood-buildings, furniture, implements, containers,
ornaments, ships, carts, industrial machinery and weapons. Wood fueled every domestic and industrial f ire. The
demands of a growing population for lumber and fire-

SENATE DEBATES
wood, plus the requirements of commerce for trade goods
and conveyances, forced up the price of wood more rapidly
than the price of any other goods for which statistics are
available. From the end of the sixteenth to the middle of
the seventeenth century, prices in general multiplied three
times; the price of firewood multiplied eight times. High
quality wood for industry increased in price even faster.
To meet the crisis, conservation measures were imposed.
Eventually, as a result, coal was substituted as a power
source. Coal was cheap and plentiful, and had qualities
that recommended it to everyone bedevilled by the costliness and scarcity of wood. Early in the seventeenth century, coal replaced wood fuel in the home, and began to be
increasingly used in industries.
Perhaps we are now on the brink of yet another technological revolution. The energy crisis may even be a blessing in disguise. The immediate shortages that face some of
the nations of the world may also bid fair to stimulate new
scientific discoveries and new inventions that will project
new prosperities. I believe we should have no fear of any
heralded depletion of our energy resources of whatever
kind, or for that matter of our other natural resources.
The single price policy for petroleum across Canada, the
country with the greatest problems caused by distance,
makes political sense, and appears to me to be at this time
a practical economic necessity.
It is of importance for Canada's future that the country
establish urgently the announced countrywide hydro
power grid. It is even more essential than the projected oil
link pipeline. I believe the hydro power grid will eventually enable the "have" provinces to feed the "have not"
provinces with all the hydro power they wish to obtain.
It is my view that the federal government should have
assisted rather than, as it appears, indirectly hindered the
James Bay development of hydro power sites. We should,
at all times and in all places, use the right of expropriation
to obtain power sites wherever necessary, regardless of
objections and claims, as we did in the case of the federal
airport sites or the seaway canals. I believe that federal
moneys, indirectly and extravagantly spent to support all
kinds of territorial objections in Quebec, were uncalled
for, unjustified, and distasteful, and that the Quebec provincial government should have been backed in its plans
of development for the common good, not only of Quebecers but of Canada. I say that because the intention was
always to proceed equitably and justly by way of expropriation, as the federal government itself did when it took
Indian land for the seaway.
I believe the myth of conserving or hoarding natural
resources for posterity, at a time when technology facilitates and demands their use in the present, should not be
encouraged. It is negative, restrictive to our development,
and against our best Canadian interests. The export of oil,
gas, hydro power, water and possibly some of the other
natural resources, such as uranium, should be licensed, but
such export should be allowed as liberally as Canadian
conditions permit at all times.
Mr. T. S. Dobson, general manager of the Royal Bank of
Canada, recently made the forecast that capital to the
extent of $120 billion was needed for energy and utility
development in the next ten years. Only through the
co-operation of all levels of government, and comprehen[Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux.]

March 13, 1974

sive consultation and planning in the private sector, can
Canada meet this huge capital demand. That is $12 billion
a year for each year of a full decade, and this demand only
in the field of gas and oil development.
I believe a policy of nationalization of oil firms, or of
any other industrial set-up-be it steel, where many more
billions of dollars will have to be invested directly and
rapidly, or any other-would he the gravest economic and
political error or our times. I have no fear, however, of
such happenings presently, for I believe the good sense
and good judgment of the majority to our representatives
in both houses will continue to prevail, and influence our
long and short term policies.

[Translation]
Finally, those who have known the Quebec Premier, Mr.
Robert Bourassa, well refuse to believe in his alleged
support of a French unilingual policy in Quebec. Mr.
Bourassa is not an extremist. He is not likely either to
restrict individual rights of anyone who wants to come
and live in Quebec. Not at all! We know his election
mandate. It is very clear. I have confidence that he will
carry it out fully.
It is with some satisfaction that we heard him make
further assertions that were more reassuring than those
unfounded rumours which prematurely gave rise to discussions in federal circles. Of course, it would not be
responsible on the part of Quebecers to disregard the
ethnic survival of our own people in other provinces. Their
traditional concern for the opposite proves where they
really stand.
I agree that we must avoid in Canada the creation of
any form of ghetto. Those who have lived this type of
experience, those who studied its effects throughout the
peoples' history, those who were able to witness its effects,
the misery, the poverty, the narrow-mindedness in
thought and action that these ghettos created everywhere,
understand how important it is to keep this type of prejudice away from education everywhere in Canada, which
would undoubtedly lead to this situation.
According to his basic rights, any individual is free to
speak and be educated in the language of his choice.
The Canadian Constitution guarantees, in my opinion,
this freedom of choice. In addition, I believe that immigrants who settle in the province of Quebec also have the
same choice for themselves and their children.
Any Canadian, regardless of the province where he lives
or of his ethnic origin, should be, everywhere in Canada,
equally and without any reservation or restriction, entirely free to choose one or the other of our official languages.
Whatever his choice may be, he should be given the assurance that everywhere in Canada he will be free to receive
the linguistic culture and knowledge of the other official
language he did not choose but ta which he is entitled. It
would thus be a much more serious guarantee than it is
now within Quebec as well as outside the province.
In short, the individual right is a natural right and,
whatever one may say, it transcends the collective and
common right that must guarantee and substantiate the
individual right. That is part of our Christian philosophy.

March 13, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

It is opposed to that of Karl Marx which holds the
contrary.
The role of the federal government is as stated by the
Prime Minister, Mr. Trudeau, when he said, in substanceif my interpretation is correct-that should it become the
way of thinking and the plan of a Quebec government, he
would not have the alternative of overlooking a violation
of the individual constitutional rights of Canadians wherever it may occur.
The existence of a sovereign culture in Canada was
never acknowledged as a fact. Those are nothing but
high-sounding words voiced by a small group of Quebec
nationalist and extremist would-be intellectuals, who
want to exert pressures on certain cabinet members. They
are actual heresies.
In short, a real culture is never complete, or good, if it
has not been given the opportunity of knowing the other
culture, also official. I am referring here to Canada. From
now on a true Canadian must know the two official
languages and the two official cultures of his country, in a
more serious and better way than before.
I have come to the end of my speech; it has been long,
and I apologize for it. We are sometimes inclined to say

27601-72

more than we intended at the outset.
I had another point I wanted to deal with.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Rightfully so.
Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: If you insist, I will add it. I do
not know if you will like it.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: It's in English.
[English]
I cannot resist adding an observation. I do not think any
one here is inclined to rate me as a lover of the NDP, its
philosophy or its methods. Everyone has heard the rumour
about an NDP member being appointed to the Cabinet. We
have seen flirtations, and we have seen a concubinage
which is still going on. Now there is finally a question of a
marriage of convenience-an NDP in a Liberal Cabinet. At
this stage, in spite of the distaste, I would not even object,
but that is because I would thereby see the end of the NDP
as a party, and its death by slow strangulation, within the
Cabinet set-up. It has happened before.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: With Mr. Trudeau.
Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: It could happen again.
On motion of Senator Quart, debate adjourned.

Motion agreed to.

THE ESTIMATES
REFERENCE OF SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES (B) TO FINANCE
COMMITTEE-QUESTION

Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, I should like to
ask the Deputy Leader of the Government if it is the
intention to refer the supplementary estimates (B) for the
fiscal year ending March 31, 1974, to the Standing Senate
Committee on National Finance before the appropriation
bill reaches us.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, as soon as the
report which I have presented has received consideration,
it is our intention to move that the estimates be referred to
the committee.

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of
His Excellency the Governor General's Speech at the
opening of the session, and the motion of Senator Robichaud, seconded by Senator Perrault, for an Address in
reply thereto.

Hon. Josie D. Quart: Honourable senators, at the beginning of each session there is always a delightful opportunity to express friendly greetings and good wishes to all
our colleagues on both sides of this chamber. I assure you
these are more than just words from my lips: they come
from my heart.
I realize my good wishes are repetitious; nevertheless, I
cannot deprive myself of the great pleasure of adding my
voice to the chorus of deserving praise extended to Madam
Speaker in wishing her continued success in presiding
over our debates and keeping law and order in this
so-called, but not always, chamber of sober second
thought.
To His Excellency the Governor General and Madam
Léger I extend, with my colleagues, every wish for success
in carrying out the important functions of their new role.
It is also very delightful indeed for the feminine element in the Senate to have the Leader of the Government,
Senator Martin, and the Leader of the Opposition, Senator
Flynn, seconded so graciously by two charming ladiestheir wives, of course-in the performance of their social
duties. To the Honourable Senator Martin and to his
deputy, the Honourable Senator Langlois, I am very sincere in offering my best wishes for health and the endurance to withstand the onslaught of criticism from the
Opposition-until they have their innings when they sit
on this side of this honourable house.
It is encouraging to see my own leader, the Honourable
Senator Flynn, and his deputy, the Honourable Senator
Choquette, in tiptop form, health, vim and vigour to continue to enter the fray as defenders of Her Majesty's loyal
Opposition. All honourable senators must admit that it is a
frustrating and tiresome task, due to the limited number
of Progressive Conservative senators to participate in the
debates.
Congratulations are also in order to the mover, the
Honourable Senator Robichaud, and to the seconder, the
Honourable Senator Perrault, who made eloquent
speeches on the motion for an Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne. These gentlemen were well
known long before they were appointed to the most exclusive club in Canada. Of course, this august chamber has
been called many other less complimentary names.
Honourable senators, there is a definite advantage in
speaking on this debate, for one is not restricted to the

March 14, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

Speech from the Throne and one can wander hither and
yon, which I propose to do.
I was very happy to hear Senator Perrault's references
to the advantages proposed in the Throne Speech for the
women of Canada. I agree with him that this is a step in
the right direction. But many women's groups reacted
cautiously to the government's promise of legislation to
end discrimination between the sexes. They want action,
not promises. However, it was regrettable that the reference to women came at the end of the Throne Speech; it
was almost like an afterthought. Even Dr. Katie Cooke,
chairman of the government's own Advisory Council on
the Status of Women, said, "The Throne Speech is not
strong enough. The government has to say not only 'It is
not nice to discriminate against women,' but, 'We'll take
you to court if you do'." The government also should
improve the lot of middle and lower level female public
servants, not just push more women into the higher level.
The federal and provincial governments have agreed that
there should be amendments to the Canada and Quebec
Pension Plans, the Speech said, including the addition of
housewives. I hope to speak on the Canada Pension Plan
at a later date.
Honourable senators, in the story of Adam and Eve it is
a fact of creation that Eve was tempted first, but Adam
was a willing victim and lustily ate of the forbidden fruit.
In any case, the ultimate blame is put neither on Eve nor
Adam, but on that devil of a serpent who started all this
male and female sex discrimination controversy.
Now, as time marches on, changes are taking place in
our way of life. The older a person is, the greater these
changes appear because they have occurred since the turn
of the century and are drastic and astounding. Disaster,
shock, violence-everything seems to be topsy-turvy and
going wrong with our world, and it is beyond contradiction that women, as well as men, have to put their shoulders to the wheel and play a dual role.
Personally, I have never recognized any difference
between men and women in public life; and men and
women working together for the general good can help one
another in a complementary way. But woman has a personality of her own. For this reason she has a truly
specific and important role to play in modern society and
in the business world. Many women would be quite happy
to leave things as they were years ago, but no woman
should be made to f eel guilty for wanting to adhere to the
more conventional wife-and-mother role, and a woman
should never feel inferior by being labelled "merely a
housewif e or mother," for motherhood is one of the noblest
and most rewarding professions for a woman. Also a
woman can be a wonderful wife and mother and still be a
career woman.
Have we ever given a thought to what might happen if
mothers decided to call a strike? Remember, science has
created electronic brains to replace manpower and has
invented artificial hearts in order to prolong life, but
science will never succeed in inventing a machine to
replace motherhood.
* (1410)

However, all women are not called to the married state.
It requires the co-operation of a man to sign a marriage
contract, for a woman may say, "I do," but if the man says,

"I won't," there is just no marriage, and single women are
as free as the air to follow a career, as are widows without
any family responsibilities. It is ridiculous in our business
world and in the professions that society attaches a stigma
to the woman who f ails, by the age of 30 or 35, to marry or
to form some kind of durable attachment to a man, or at
least a visible love affair. Even very clever women panic
and marry in haste to avoid ridicule as unclaimed
treasures.
In my opinion, there are a great many women who do
not realize that the obstacle to advancement is in their
own attitude. They do not aim high enough. What men in
their egoism constantly mistake for intellectual deficiency
in women is, in reality, but a lack of interest on the part of
women.
Many employers pay lip service to the principle of equal
pay for equal work, equal consideration for promotion-in
short, opportunity for women on an equal basis with men.
These employers know that they can get away with discrimination by ignoring the issue. This works a hardship
on women, single or married, heads of families, and results
as well in incompetence in industry. And it is frequently
the woman worker with family responsibilities, who
depends upon her salary for survival, who is generally the
most exploited and is treated with the least courtesy
because she is no longer young or attractive. These women
lose confidence in themselves when they realize how impossible is the impasse.
However, I do not subscribe to the policy in industry or
government of setting quotas for employment or promotion of either men or women. This should be decided solely
on the merit and qualifications of the individual.
The principle of equal pay is one which is extremely
difficult to achieve, as long as off icially appointed boards
and trade unions look upon the equal pay legislation with
a blind eye; and it is expecting too much from human
nature to hope that employers will abide by it if not forced
to do so.
Now, in advocating women's greater participation in
public life, I do so, not as a militant suffragette or a
member
of Women's
Liberation-Heaven
forbidalthough I am 100 per cent in favour of equal rights, equal
pay for equal work and full equality for women. But my
pet theory is: You can catch more men, and women, with
honey than with vinegar. And I would add that a warm
smile, a ripple of laughter and a spontaneous wit will get a
woman further in this man-dominated world than all the
women libbers or the sizzling "battle of the sexes." Men
and women should not be waging war against each other.
That is a war that neither side can win, because there is so
much delightful fraternizing with the enemy. Men and
women are component parts of our modern world and
must learn to co-operate. Men and women should be like a
lock and a key; they are of equal worth, but fulfill a
different purpose.
For the sake of argument, I agree that there have been
many harsh voices raised to defend the pros and cons of
the Women's Lib movement, and I admit there are extremists on both sides. However, I cannot agree that women
libbers should classify men as "male chauvinist pigs," and
that all the ills of women should be blamed on men.
Neither can I agree that men should discriminate against

SENATE DEBATES
women because of their sex and the delusion of masculine
superiority. Most women are fed up with being looked
upon as sex symbols; they want to be appreciated for
something else than their physical equipment.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: Don't downgrade the equipment.
Hon. Mrs. Quart: In fact, most women have a sharp and
accurate perception of reality in discovering the kernel of
truth in the husk of delusion. Men call this woman's
intuition. In years gone by men's motives may have been
sincere when they endeavoured to protect their womenfolk from the harsh realities of public life, but I do not
believe women ever wanted that paternalistic mollycoddling. In this day and age, women want to participate
fully, without any preferential treatment but also without
any underhanded discrimination.
My main objections to the Women's Liberation group
are the undertones of sex war and male hatred. In fact,
since Women's Liberation has come into being, I find men
are becoming increasingly defensive. So, it is not surprising that a group of men called "Men's Lib" has recently
been organized in the United States and in England.
Unquestionably, this is a counter-reaction to Women's
Lib, and men are now invading what was formerly traditional female domain in occupations such as those of
nurses, airline hostesses, telephone operators and receptionists, just to mention a f ew.
So now with the Men's Lib a new element of competition has developed, and one wonders how this change of
roles between men and women will fit into our future way
of life. Maybe we will end up with a sort of neuter gender.
Anyway, I hope I shall never live to see the day when the
saying "vive la différence" becomes obsolete.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I doubt that.
Hon. Mrs. Quart: At my vintage I do not resent being
labelled old-fashioned, so I am expressing a hope that
women of today will become a little more feminine so that
men can be a little more masculine. Being feminine does
not take away a woman's personality, but rather enhances
it. In my opinion, being treated with chivalry by a man
can make a woman's day, and surely the normal man
should feel flattered when he can make a woman happy.
AnyWvay, looking back over the years, believe me, I have
always found that being a woman has been very nice. It
was Lilly Daché, the famous French fashion designer, who
said, in answer to Women's Lib, that the most precious
accessory of a woman is a charming man.
To avoid any further controversy or battle of the sexes, I
shall resort to a quote from Oscar Bean, who said: "Hens
can lay eggs, which is all-important to the chicken worldbut all the poor rooster can do is to strut and crow."
Madam Speaker, I leave it up to you: should a good hen
deny her rooster that pleasure?
This is a relaxing speech.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Quart: Honourable senators, as we shall not
be sitting on St. Patrick's Day, I wish to pass on to you
this St. Patrick's Day greeting, which I received this
morning from a very nice young man:
Wishing you always walls for the wind
And a roof for the rain
[Hon. Mrs. Quart.]

March 14, 1974

And tea beside the fire
Laughter to cheer you
And those you love near you
And all that your heart may desire.

Hon. Margaret Norrie: Honourable senators, Senator
Quart's speech will be for me a hard one to follow. I am
afraid that during the course of my speech honourable
senators might wish to go to sleep. However, I should like
to take this opportunity of joining with others in this
chamber in expressing my sincere congratulations to His
Excellency Jules Léger upon his appointment as Governor
General of Canada. To His Excellency and Madam Léger I
wish a happy and fulfilling tenure of office.
I wish also to welcome Senator Louis Robichaud and
Senator Daniel Riley to the Senate. Both honourable senators are from my native province, New Brunswick. Senator Robichaud, while Premier of New Brunswick, introduced, along with other strong legislation, an equalization
program in the fields of education, social and medical
assistance that was revolutionary. He will long be remembered for his courage, vision and success in connection
with this splendid and daring legislation. I am sure he will
display sound thinking in the deliberations of this
chamber.
Senator Riley, who has been a prominent businessman
and politician for many years, has a diversity of talents to
bring to the deliberations of the Senate. He has always
taken an important part in the work of his province and I
welcome him most cordially to the Senate.
It has been a great joy throughout the past year to
watch our Speaker, Senator Muriel Fergusson, perform
her duties so ably. She has won the admiration of the
members of this chamber and of countless people elsewhere. I should like to add that I knew this would happen.
I congratulate you, Madam Speaker, and I am very happy
for you in your success.
Honourable senators, I should like to speak mainly
about agriculture and land use. Women play a part in that
but not as vital a part as one might wish. The previous
speaker referred to their role in other fields.
Most agriculturalists have for several years been aware
of the fact that Canada's agricultural production must be
increased. A state of emergency exists in many parts of
the world, millions are starving, and we in Canada are
seemingly helpless in averting such tragedies as famine
due to crop failure or the ravages of civil war.
We in Canada are well fed, but international market
pressures have forced our food prices upwards, causing
hardship among those with modest fixed incomes.
The federal government is aware of these pressures
which cause hardship to groups of vulnerable people, and
it has made adjustments in the field of social security to
help ease their predicament.
In the Debates of the Senate, and in the Halifax Chronicle-Herald, the daily newspaper of Nova Scotia, Senator
Blois of Truro is reported to have said that 60 per cent of
domestic inflation has been self-induced by government
policies.

March 14, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

In reply, I quote from the speech of the Minister of
Finance, the Honourable John Turner, on March 5, 1974.
Part of that speech has already been quoted by various
members of the Senate. He said:
Over the course of last year the real, personal disposable income of Canadians per man, woman and
child in this country, that is to say, the income available after taxes, after discounting the erosion of inflation and adding back transfer payments such as pensions and family allowances and after taking into
account the reduction in personal income taxes
equivalent to between 12 and 13 per cent as provided
in the last budget, rose, in 1973 over 1972, by 6.8 per
cent. That is the size of the average, real increase in
disposable incomes of Canadians. This follows already
exceptional increases of 5.9 per cent in 1971 and 6.7 per
cent in 1972.
The strong growth in personal income last year was the
result of a combination of factors: record expansion in the
number of Canadians productively employed; sharply
increased farm income; reduction in personal income tax
provided in the budget equivalent to 12 to 13 per cent and
increases in social assistance benefits, such as old age
pensions, family allowances and social security payments.
Again, I quote the Honourable Mr. Turner:
This increase in real, personal disposable income per
capita last year in Canada of 6.8 per cent was half
again as much as that in the United States. Since 1970,
the average, real disposable income of Canadians has
risen by 21 per cent, which is nearly twice the increase
in the United States.
To sum up, Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives in February, 1973, were totally wrong in their conclusions
about where the economy stood and they remained
totally wrong throughout the year about where it was
going. But, as I will indicate to the House later, that
error of judgment was probably the very least of their
follies.
Mr. Turner continued:
I said at the beginning of my remarks that one of
the main objectives of the estimates was to do anything reasonably possible to limit the spread of world
inflation. Canada did not escape-it could not at any
rate in view of the important position it holds in
world trade-the effects of this international evil
which has taken over the past 12 months such proportions that even the most pessimistic observers had not
envisaged them. In spite of our vulnerability to these
world inflationary pressures, our price structure has
reacted rather better than that of most other countries. Compared with the same period in 1972, our
consumer price index showed in December 1973 a rise
of 9.1 per cent compared with an average increase of
10.3 per cent for most OECD countries and 9.5 per cent
for members of the European Economic Community.
He goes on to say:
As Minister of Finance, nothing bothers me quite so
much as the negative effects of inflation on the budgets and savings of Canadians. This affects all Canadians. Inflation is the No. 1 economic problem of this
country, a problem which has been and continues to

be a matter of great and serious concern to this government. The leader of the Progressive Conservative
Party and his colleagues have tried to convince the
Canadian public that our only policy has been one of
passive complacency. The truth is something quite
different: Canada has taken more concerted and vigorous steps than any other country to limit the effects
of inflation, to try and protect the real purchasing
power of the people who are the last in a position to
protect themselves against the cost of living increases,
and do whatever is in our power here in Canada to
strike at the root of the evil with legislative measures
likely to increase the amount of goods available to
satisfy the needs of an expanding economy.
Throughout all this pressure, the Honourable Mr. Turner
maintained his stand against controls.
At this point I should like to make a few comments on
the remarks made by Senator Perrault, in his speech
seconding the Address in reply, in relation to the price
increases over the last few years of products of the Stanfield Company. I take strong exception to his statements
in that connection. We,-and I am speaking as a private
citizen of the Truro area-regardless of partisan politics,
are proud of that industry and the manner in which it is
run. The Stanfield Company is an honoured, privately
owned company of long standing. I think Senator Blois
said it was over one hundred years old. The country has
benefited greatly from the company's stability, and I will
not stand by and have adverse remarks made concerning
the fact that its products have increased in price in recent
years. I challenge Senator Perrault to name any successful
manufacturing company that has not had to resort to a
rise in the price of its products in recent years.
Senator Blois said he was not trying to advertise for that
company, nor does the company need to advertise. Nevertheless, I would like to add that it is a well-known fact
that the National Hockey League Teams and baseball
teams equip their players with Stanfield Company shirts,
et cetera. Athletes buy them, not because they are made by
the Stanfield Company but because they are the best
money can buy. Perhaps some senators know, from experience, the worth of these products.

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): At least senators
from the cold regions.
Hon. Mrs. Norrie: Honourable senators, the Speech from
the Throne, opening the Second Session of the 29th Parliament, on February 27, 1974, gives leadership in the field of
food policies. It says:
The Government is developing a policy on food based
on the following objectives:
-an adequate and dependable supply of quality food
for a growing population in Canada enjoying a rising
standard of living;
-reasonable food prices:
-for the consumer, in not requiring an undue proportion of income for Canadians to secure a sufficient
and balanced diet,

March 14, 1974

SENATE DEBATES
-for the producer, in providing a return adequate to
encourage production of food items which can be
economically and efficiently produced in Canada;
-a continuing supply and increasing production of
those food products in which Canada has a competitive advantage for export to commercial markets and
also for a contribution to international food aid
programs.
The Speech goes on:
The Government's objectives will guide a re-assessment of existing programs in the areas of agriculture
and fisheries. The Government will wish to consult
with provincial governments, consumer groups and
producers.
The producer must be ensured a fair income for his
work. His confidence in long-term market opportunities is an essential element in the Government's
policy. ...

In the long term the continuity of domestic supply
must take into account optimum overall land use in
Canada and especially the trend to diversion of productive land for non-agricultural purposes. The Government intends to enter into discussion with the
provinces since they are vitally involved in this
question.
That is a part that I find very important. The Throne
Speech gives us great scope in which to work for the
upgrading of agriculture.
In Agrologist magazine, published by the Agricultural
Institute of Canada, July-August 1973, Norman Pearson
states:
The preservation of our best farmland is now a
national imperative.. .. The stage is set for danger in
Canada.
So very few people, and people of influence, know this,
or rather, will believe this. The big task for us who do
realize it is to try to bring about quick, vital, stimulating,
revolutionary legislation to come to grips with the
immediate problems of farming and to the aid of those
interested in farming. We must save the farmland for the
future.
He continues:
The lands that agriculture needs for concentration,
specialization, and for adjustment are very limited,
and directly in the path of urban growth....
Since it takes about 20 years to effect any permanent change in social institutions, we could lose 50 per
cent of our best soils while just thinking and talking
about it.
I repeat what I have said elsewhere: Unless the agriculture industry receives better treatment, the country will
face a food crisis that will make the current energy crisis
look mild.
The time has long since come when the opinions of the
farmers should be treated with the consideration and
respect they deserve. They, the farming community, have
been the backbone of our society all through the years and
always should be. Until the rest of society places the
farmer and his real problems at the top of the priority list
{Hon. Mrs. Norrie.]

for immediate help and action, we will have real hunger
trouble.
In the Annapolis Valley recently, the premier and his
cabinet had an open hearing of briefs and questions concerning a big highway, which can go through good farmland and small towns and villages or another route skirting this rich area about a mile or so further awaythrough stony hillside and poor soil, but a scenic route.
The motel and restaurant owners cried doom and gloom
and disaster. The more dignified farmer presented a splendid picture. The former could not see that without the
farmer and related businesses the valley would die as an
agricultural and, possibly, as a prosperous area for years to
come. We must develop our natural resources. Food is a
natural for there, and nothing should interfere with its
continued and increased production.
The land base for agriculture
instance, is very low.

in

Nova Scotia, for

The total size of Nova Scotia is 13,057,000 acres. Less
than 25 per cent of Nova Scotia has agricultural potential
under present or foreseeable economic conditions.
Canada has in farmland 160 million acres, which is
one-twentieth of Canada's total acreage. From Canada's
physically very restricted land resource base must come
the farm production, not only to meet domestic needs for
Canadian-grown products but also to provide for our very
important export trade.
In 1968, Canada exported $1.4 billion worth of agricultural products. In the same year, Canada imported $1.1
billion. This is a good sized industry.
G. D. V. Williams, of the Plant Research Institute,
Ottawa, states:
Where former agricultural land is left idle, re-forested
or utilized for low intensity outdoor recreation, it
could readily be returned to farming when needed.
Land that is taken over for urban use and built on,
however, would probably never be returned to
agriculture and it is this type of irrevocable farmland
loss that is of particular concern here.
Our only top, No. 1 grade farmland is found in the
Niagara Peninsula. When the Queen Elizabeth Way was
built from Toronto this sounded the death knell of this
number one agricultural producing area. All along the
Queen Elizabeth Way, towns and villages grew up like
mushrooms and ate up top agricultural soil. It seems
impossible to check the urban encroachment in that area
unless some very drastic measures are taken.
The Ontario Federation said the situation is so critical
that if present losses of farmland continue at current
rates, within 50 years all of that province's top food-producing land will be under concrete.
This author, G. D. V. Williams, is of the opinion that far
too little attention is being paid in Canada to the loss of
agricultural land to urban encroachment. The cause of this
lack of attention may be similar to the situation in
Sweden, where regional planning is done by staff trained
in urban problems, and agricultural aspects consequently
tend to be neglected.

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES

All of this research will take time and, in the meantime,
our farmland is being gobbled up by ruthless land speculators, industry, highways, airports and the like.
The Speech from the Throne at the opening of the
Prince Edward Island legislature shows that the premier
is taking a positive step to check this disastrous movement. He has or is going to set up a seven-man commission
to check on such actions. Let us hope more provinces will
follow his positive example and take some action immediately. I congratulate Premier Campbell.
I believe that in British Columbia there is a freeze on
the sale of their choice Okanagan Valley farmland. Also
Saskatchewan has embarked on a land bank program.
The advice given in Britain by Stapledon in 1935 is that
people should consider themselves "tenants for life" in
planning land use and should try to anticipate needs over
the next 100 to 500 years. As he remarked:
No matter if it costs 10, 20 or 30 times as much to build
an aerodrome, a reservoir, a suburb or a city on land of
little or no agricultural value as on good land, it is the
duty of "life tenants" to choose wherever possible, the
poor, even if relatively unsuitable, land ...

(1440)

J. D. Hilchey, Supervisor of Land Use Planning for the
Nova Scotia Department of Agriculture and Marketing,
states:
In many parts of Canada, rural economics are largely dependent upon an agricultural area for their existence. Factors that tend to weaken the agricultural
sector have a multiplied destructive effect on the rural
economy. This carries through to the supporting urban
centres as well.
At another time I wish to speak more fully on the problems and hopes for the future of the small family farm,
and what it means to the economy of our country, especially the Maritimes.
Mr. Hilchey adds:
This will include a study of the production of small
grains as a major enterprise in the Maritimes. This
enterprise does not require a complete restructuring
of the agricultural industry, but can be introduced and
expanded with existing farm units. Further, the availability of crop insurance for grain production now
makes possible the development of grain farms of
substantial acreage without the risk to the operator of
catastrophic losses.
I also believe that grants should be made available to
part-time farmers. There is a ready market for small vegetables and fruit, and growers of these should be
encouraged to supply large quantities for our freezing,
canning and processing plants. Small woodlots should be
attached to every small f arm unit to supply winter work.
As you know, the Prime Minister has encouraged a plan
to offer to our youth, both male and female, summer work
on farms as apprentices in order to find out if they really
would enjoy becoming either farmers or farmers' wives.
He is also advocating that courses in agriculture be off ered
in high schools. Agriculture must no longer be a low-paying, menial job for the ignorant, untrained person. Such a

27601-8

stigma must be removed if we are to feed the world at
reasonable costs.
Honourable senators, there is a serious situation with
respect to non-resident land ownership in Nova Scotia, and
probably elsewhere in Canada. In this respect I have been
very much impressed by the position of the Citizens'
Alliance for the Preservation of Nova Scotian Land. This
Alliance is comprised of a group of four young men and
their wives, most of whom are teachers and college graduates who have devoted their time for many months to
gathering data to which I will refer in a moment. These
young people, who are unpaid, have been doing this
research for the love of their province.
Dealing with non-resident land ownership in Nova
Scotia, then, the following is the position of the Citizens
Alliance for the Preservation of Nova Scotian Land:
The Citizens' Alliance was formed by a group of
citizens in Annapolis County in September, 1973, for
the purpose of presenting a brief to the Select Committee of the House on the Non-Resident Ownership
of Land. A brief was prepared and presented to the
Yarmouth hearings of that Committee on October 12,
1973. Since that time, the Citizens' Alliance has been
continuing its investigation of the problem, focusing
particularly on the Counties of Annapolis and Digby.
Let there be no question of our stand on this issue.
We believe that the unrestricted buying of land by
non-residents is a serious problem which is a threat to
the heritage and to the future of this province.
Our Premier, Mr. Regan, has stated that our views
are rather strong. We are happy to agree. We believe
that strong views are just what are needed to combat
this problem. Moreover, we are convinced that our
position, as well as being strong, is entirely responsible and that it is based on fact.
However, we are content to state our position and to
let you be the judge.
As stated in their brief, the position of the Alliance is:
Why do we Nova Scotians ever remain in this
Province?
It seems a wonder, particularly when one considers
that while we exist on some of the lowest income
levels in North America, we also face one of the
highest costs of living.
As you may have heard broadcast last night, our food costs
are the highest in Canada.
Of course, we believe Nova Scotia offers us and our
families a number of things that dollars cannot purchase: firm roots in a distinctive past and heritage, a
strong sense of community, a unique quality of life.
All this is possible on the small mass of land called
Nova Scotia.
The land is fundamental to everything that is
unique in the Nova Scotian way of life. But our heritage is fast disappearing because the land itself is
being sold to the highest bidding non-resident, at
prices with which the average Nova Scotian cannot
compete.
Why is there this sudden interest in our land?

SENATE DEBATES

The essential reason is that areas like Nova Scotia
are very scarce on the rest of the continent. People are
suddenly discovering the value of our way of live and
our unspoiled land. But Nova Scotia itself is small and
has only a given amount of land.
And so, what it has taken Nova Scotians hundreds
of years to preserve and build is being ripped away
from us.
"Is this actually occurring?" they ask.
For the purpose of our study we have defined a
non-resident as anyone whose principal place of residence is not Nova Scotia.
In Annapolis County in the period 1966 to 1974, the
number of non-resident landowners increased from
299 to 1027, an increase of 343 per cent. The number
increased from 885 to 1027 in the past year, a change
which represents an annual increase of 16 per cent.
In Digby County in the period 1966 to 1974, the
number of non-resident landowners increased from
864 to 1807, an increase of 208 per cent. In the past
year, the number increased from 1589 to 1807, a change
which represents an annual increase of 13.7 per cent.
What are the effects of this non-resident buying? First,
there is unfair competition.
The most noticeable effect is that non-resident
buying has driven property values beyond the reach of
the average Nova Scotian. In rural Nova Scotia, these
exorbitant prices do not in any way reflect Nova
Scotian income levels. Out-of-province buyers are
purchasing properties for recreation and speculation,
at prices which most Nova Scotians cannot even
consider.
Let us look at three of the many examples in
Annapolis County which have been brought to our
attention. The assessment rolls reveal many cases like
the following one: A farm property was in the most
recent assessment year assessed at $7,400, yet the
market price for the f arm was $35,000!
Then they mention the case of an Annapolis County
farmer who repeatedly attempted to buy a farm, but each
time a non-resident outbid him to purchase the farm as a
summer home. The third case they mention is that of a
three-acre parcel of land on the Annapolis River for which
the asking price is $30,000.
"What does this demonstrate?" they ask. They proceed
to answer the question by saying:
It shows that Nova Scotians cannot compete with
buyers from outside the province, where incomes are
higher. It demonstrates that there is increasing
demand from these outside buyers.
The effect is that Nova Scotians are being denied a
fair opportunity to participate in the growth and development of their own Province.
Is this just? Are Nova Scotians who are spending
their lives building up this province going to be forced
to stand by while outside buyers strip it of the best it
bas to offer? These non-residents are deriving the
benefits of the pride, heritage and labour of generations of Nova Scotians. And our own residents, the
[Hon. Mrs. Norrie.]

March 14, 1974

people who are contributing the most to this province,
are benefiting the least.
The second aspect of this non-resident buying is that it
is selective.
As we suspected before conducting the study, the
pattern of non-resident buying has been very selective, focusing mainly on the choicest areas. High concentrations of non-resident owners occur along the
Fundy Shore, along the lakes in the south and west of
Annapolis County, and the farmland flanking the
Annapolis River. In one 18-mile stretch of land there
are 208 non-resident properties.
s

(1450)

Inequitable taxation: It is clear that the market
price of land is being grossly inflated by buyers from
outside the province. The tax assessors are forced by
law to evaluate properties at market value. Consequently, assessments have skyrocketed, and thus
taxes have risen. As these values and taxes have
increased, what has happened to the pensioner or the
low income family who possesses such a property and
wishes to retain it? They are being squeezed off their
properties.
Do these higher taxes reflect higher productivity
and higher income levels? They most certainly do not!
When someone on a f ixed income cannot pay his taxes
and is forced to sell to a non-resident, no one is
coming to bis aid.
Short-term benefit: The money being obtained by
the sale of properties is only a one-time, short-term
benefit to Nova Scotians. No one is warning Nova
Scotians that the apparently "big money" being lined
up by the realtor will never be able to replace what
they are giving up. Once the land is gone, almost all of
the benefits which arise from it thereafter move out of
the province.
The long-term effect-bankrupt future: What is
happening to this land which is being sold?
In the majority of cases it is remaining idle. It is
either tied up by speculators for resale, or is being
kept by non-resident vacationers who use it for
recreation only a few weeks each year.
Productive farm and woodlot land lies unused.
And what about our tourist industry? It is almost
our "number one" industry-an industry with a
future of great potential. But what growth can this
industry experience? Instead of maintaining control
of our land so that year after year it will attract
visitors from outside the province, we are selling our
best recreational land-a short-term benefit.
And what about the life of our rural communities?
It is very difficult to develop a community without
people. Yet in many areas, we already have
entrenched seasonal communities-active in the
summer, vacant in winter. Under such circumstances,
how can rural areas be expected to develop into thriving, growing and productive communities.
It is a serious problem now. If this buying is not
restricted, what kind of a future will be left for our
children? Will they be strangers to most of their own

March 14, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

land, working for and paying rent to absentee
landlords?
Speculation is a serious problem.
The totally unrestricted sale of land to non-residents has caused a wave of speculation in Annapolis
and Digby counties. Literally thousands of acres are
being bought up and held for resale. It is clear that
much of this speculation is entirely irresponsible-the
individuals and companies involved obviously care
nothing about the development or the future of this
province. Their sole objective is to manipulate prices
so as to maximize their profits, regardless of the
consequences to our counties.
In our study, we quickly noticed that many nonresident owners in Annapolis and Digby counties own
more than one property-one individual owns 31. A
second interesting fact was the rate of increase in the
number of non-residents who owned more than one
property.
In 1973, 88 non-residents owned more than one property. By 1974, 114 owned more than one property-an
increase of 29.5 per cent in one year. Either an increasing number of non-residents have a hobby of collecting land parcels, or they are speculators!
Of course, we have our own home-grown speculators as well. Certain real estate companies operating
in these counties are setting up numbers of associated
companies which they are using to manipulate prices
and to cut income taxes.
All of this effort, of course, is not provided to serve
Nova Scotian buyers, but to cater to the demand from
outside the province. Many realtors are advertising
Nova Scotian properties only outside the province.
The notorious Land Auction Bureau in Boston owns
3,383 acres in Annapolis and Digby counties. The
resale of this land occurs at auctions in locations
where no Nova Scotian is present, or is intended to be
present.
According to the press, Medlee Ltd., a Torontobased real estate firm, is also involved in similar
transactions. It is interesting to note that a number of
letters which have appeared in Nova Scotian newspapers supporting non-resident ownership have been
written by a partner in this very firm. Here is a case
of a non-resident firm which is exploiting a Nova
Scotian market but contributing nothing. Yet this
same firm has the gall to try to make us think that
such exploitation is good for us.
The land boom has definitely begun in Annapolis
and Digby counties. The land sharks have gathered
and they are rejoicing because the only ones in Nova
Scotia who can control their activities are the members of government.
Therefore we urge that an immediate and complete
moratorium be placed on sales of land to non-residents of Nova Scotia until a comprehensive analysis
and investigation has been done.
There was a rural development seminar at the Collège
Ste. Anne, Church Point, Nova Scotia, which I attended,
on February 22 to 24, 1974. There were two big topics that

27601-8!

were brought up. The same group of people was attending
this seminar, plus 68 others.
One topic was the non-resident ownership of land; the
second was land use planning. These are all vital topics.
The following points were those which were agreed to
by all the delegates who attended the seminar:
We do not want to be told that non-resident land
ownership is not a problem. It is a serious problem
now to every segment of rural Nova Scotia-to our
farming communities, to our fishing communities, and
to our forest communities.
We have affirmed and we believe that every Nova
Scotian must affirm that land is not just a commodity
to be bought and sold; it is a resource which is the
very essence of Nova Scotia, and it must be protected
for the future of this province and its citizens.
We are not against any individual who wishes to
move into our rural communities to become a fulltime, contributing citizen.
We strongly agree that individual speculation and
speculative companies must be restricted immediately.
We commend the government for its present program of acquiring land for recreational use but we
believe that this program must be accelerated and
expanded to protect sufficient recreational land for
future generations of Nova Scotians.
We have recognized that the one serious problem in
restricting sales is that we must protect those
individuals who have invested their lives in their
property, and who wish to sell. They must be assured
of getting a fair price for their land. For this reason,
such solutions as land banks must be most seriously
considered, to ensure that there is a fair price, and
also that the land remains circulating among Nova
Scotian residents, and does not fall under the control
of non-resident interests.
We have agreed that non-resident land ownership is
just one of a series of fundamental problems which
are facing our rural communities. Other things must
be considered, such as: Responsible land use planning;
conservation of our natural resources; preservation of
our unique culture; and development of industry compatible with rural communities.
However, we do not want the question of non-resident land ownership to be lost among other issues. We
do not want to see attempts to mislead public discussion of the issue. We do want to see some concrete
evidence of action now, while there is still land left to
save.
Land use planning is poorly understood by citizens,
and even by many members of the government. If it is
carried out responsibly, we see that it can greatly
benefit the general good. However, we recognize that
if it is done poorly it can be used for manipulation and
for exploitation.
I have a list of acreages in Annapolis and Digby counties
here. I will not read it, because the figures are better to
look at than to listen to. For the sake of expediency, I

Hon. Mrs. Norrie: In dealing with these questions on the
vital segments of our rural economy, I f eel that the Speech
from the Throne shows that the federal government wili
wish to consuit with provincial governments, consumer
groups and producers to ensure proper use of our agricultural land, and to encourage greater productivity for a
hungry world. Dr. Gordon MacEachern, President of the
Agriculturai Economic Research Council of Canada in
1968 said:
Above ail, what we need and what ail of us have
been neglecting is a sense of rural community. Farming, no matter how efficient, won't succeed long without a community structure around it. To rebuild this,
we must demand of our elected representatives a
policy for rural Canada that wili rebuild not just
places or things, but a quality of if e that will enhance
the spirit of ail Canadians. To pursue this goal vigor[Hon. Mrs. Norrie.]

ously and with conviction we must believe, as I do,
that such a rural life-style is vital to Canada's
survival.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Will the honourabie
senator allow me to ask a question at this point?
Hon. Mrs. Norrie: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Perhaps I should
preface my question by saying that the problem of nonCanadian ownership of land in Nova Scotia is primarily a
problem for the province itseif. It is not a matter which
f ails within federal jurisdiction, and will not do so until
such time as it becomes-and it may very well become-a
national problem.
In this connection, Senator Norrie has indicated that a
great many sales have gone through, and I presume she
means private sales. I should like to ask if she has any
information as to whether there have been any forced
sales or sheriff's sales where the successful bidding was
done by foreigners, or non-residents of Canada.
My second question is this: Could Senator Norrie say
how many acres of land have been taken out of agriculturai production as a resuit of the continued purchase by
non-residents of such agricultural land in Nova Scotia?
Hon. Mrs. Norrie: May I take notice of those questions,
and answer them on another occasion?
Hon. Mr. Cortnolly (Ottawa West): Certainly.
Hon. Richard J. Stanbury: Honourable senators, I hesitate to intrude a maie chauvinist into this ladies' day.
I should like to begin by thanking all my honourable
colleagues who were so kind as to convey gond wishes, in
one form or another, during my recent and, happily, very
brief stay in hospital. I can assure you that your kindness
worked to good effect, and I am happy to say that now I
f eel f ine-except f or a slight head cold which I suf fer f rom
today.
I regret that I was not able to be present at the opening
of this session to see and hear our new distinguished
Governor Generai in his first appearance hefore both
Houses of Parliament. Naturaily, I join with ail my colleagues in congratulating hlm and assuring him of our
support.
I regret also that 1 was not able to hear the excellent
speeches of Senator Robichaud and Senator Perrault,
when they moved and seconded the motion that is presentiy before us; and that I was not present to welcome
Senator Robichaud and Senator Riley when they took
their seats in this chamber.
Fortunately, I can personally express to Madam Speaker
my profound thanks for the excellence and the charm with
which she conducts the business of this bouse; for the
kindness and friendliness with which she deals with each
one of us.
I appreciated the remarks of Senator Norrie in connection with agriculture because I f elt, as I read the Speech
from the Throne, that there could be no doubt about the
wisdom of the policy of plenty, and the expansion of
agriculturai production, that was articulated in that
Speech. There may be, in the future, temporary gluts of
individual products on the market, but the general (rend
of world experience for the next decade, at least, must

SENATE DEBATES

surely be one of shortages. The people of the world are
crying out for Canadian skills, Canadian produce, Canadian materials, in a raw or processed state, and Canadian
manufactured goods. To answer this cry, it is our duty to
mankind, and our opportunity, to employ and challenge
every able-bodied Canadian for many years to come, and
to direct our production so as to meet this need.
Before we can answer this cry adequately, honourable
senators, we have to reach a much better understanding of
the role which Canada plays, and the position which
Canada holds, in the world today. The work of a succession of Canadian statesmen has given us a heritage of
goodwill scarcely equalled by the citizens of any other
nation. Mr. St. Laurent's contribution to the founding of
the United Nations, Mr. Pearson's devotion to the unending process of securing peace, Mr. Diefenbaker's goodwill
travels, Senator Martin's human warmth towards the disadvantaged people in the world, Mr. Trudeau's commitment to the diversification of Canada's friendships, and
Mr. Sharp's constant and tireless display of Canadian
patience and integrity in a world where those two qualities are in short supply-all these have given us an image
and an opportunity which is unsurpassed.
But it is not only our statesmen who have kept the
reservoir of goodwill brimming with friendship. We are a
nation of travellers, and Canadians abroad have the reputation of being well-behaved and sympathetic. Although
there have been some bad experiences with promoters who
based their operations in Canada, Canadian businessmen
abroad have a reputation for reliability, speed and performance. The only problem is that thére are not enough
of them. I have heard the same complaint in every country
I have visited. People want to do business with Canadians,
but Canadian businessmen are just not there, except in
very limited numbers and in very limited specialities.
Part of the reason for that, I believe, is that the business
community in Canada is comfortable. It has done quite
well in trading across the border and, to a lesser degree, in
trading with Europe and Japan, and its members see little
need to venture into the lesser-known areas where business methods need adaptation to local conditions.
An even more important reason for our failure to
respond to the open arms of the world is that we have not
developed, in general, the trading instruments which are
available to the other great trading nations such as the
United States, Britain and Japan. We are so inordinately
wealthy that we have never felt the need to develop
merchant banks, collective marketing institutions, trade
centres and such other aids to trade as are commonplace
among the great trading nations of the world. As the
Honourable Jean-Luc Pépin has said: Canadians don't
export. We permit others to import from us.
Now, it may be that we can go on this way forever.
Perhaps we do have sufficient natural wealth that we will
continue to prosper on its strength, with limited effort and
imagination being expended by us. But as I see the formation of trading blocs by others, the resumption of GATT
negotiations, the monetary crisis, the energy crisis, the
uncertainty about American trade policies, I have serious
doubts that Canadian businessmen can continue to be coy
and blushing brides waiting to be wooed. It is important
that we realize the extent to which our well-being depends

upon our raw material natural resources and our huge
American market. Our total exports last year amounted to
$25.2076 billion. Of that, $16.1938 billion was in primary
and semi-processed products, and $7.1576 billion for manufactured exports to the United States, including auto pact
exports. Only a little over $1 billion of manufactured
products, out of $25 billion, went from Canada to all other
countries, and that included $144 million financed by the
Export Development Corporation and $262.5 million by
CIDA, our aid agency.
*

I am pleased to see that the Speech from the Throne
promises measures to aid international trade. I hope that
among them will be measures to stimulate the formation
of trading instruments to put Canadians in a position to
take advantage of the fabulous opportunities open to them
in the world.
A classic example of an opportunity which lies open
before us is the Republic of Iraq, to which I have just led a
trade delegation of Canadian businessmen and government trade officials. Iraq is a Moslem nation of about 10.5
million people, of whom about 20 per cent are Kurds. It
lies between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and has a short but
controversial boundary with Iran at the head of the Arabian or Persian Gulf. Through it run the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, bounding the area which was known as
Mesopotamia and providing huge areas of arable land.
Under it lie rivers and lakes of oil, providing the financial
base for a developing industrial society.
It has a state-controlled economy run by men who, in
my observation, are able and dedicated. They have a development plan which United Nations observers have said
is the best among developing countries. They have highlytrained engineers, economists and lawyers-many of
whom have had their university education in the United
States, Britain or Canada. They know they have sufficient
expertise to specify their needs, and sufficient technical
proficiency to see that they get their money's worth, but
they are quick to admit that they have neither the technology nor the trained personnel to do everything themselves. Hence they have invited some of the nations who
have those assets to participate in the development of
Iraq, and be paid cash for their services. They are most
anxious that Canadians be among the participants.
The needs of Iraq are so extensive, so all-embracing,
that the mind boggles at the figures involved. They have
increased their commodities import budget for 1974 to
$3.96 billion over $1.3 billion for 1973. The capital plant
expansion budget for 1974 is another $2.5 billion. Those
figures may mean little to you unless you look at the
actual programs for which they are budgeted. Let me list
just a few of them:
A two million ton urea fertilizer plant;
A liquefaction plant for liquefied petroleum gas
(LPG) for export;
A liquefaction plant for liquefied natural gas
(LNG) for domestic consumption;
An ethylene and PVC plant;
A plastics complex to produce synthetic fibre, synthetic rubber and organic chemicals;
A 100,000 to 200,000-ton aluminum smelter;

SENATE DEBATES

An expansion to 10 million ton capacity of an existing 1.5 million ton refinery at Basra, Iraq's port city;
Four sugar mills;
Three woollen mills;
Plants to assemble tractors, and light and heavy
trucks;
Several large power projects, including a whole new
400 kilovolt power grid;
Two large cement factories;
Large dams for agricultural irrigation and power
generation;
Three large integrated farms specializing in beef
and poultry, the objective being a basic herd of 50,000
cattle. Their present egg requirement is 45 million;
Six aircraft-our STOL DH-7 appears ideal;
Fishing trawlers in substantial numbers;
Hospitals, schools, roads, bridges, communications
and airport equipment, railway equipment, and so on
ad nauseam.
A measure of the interest of the Government of Iraq in
Canada is the excellence of the ambassador they have sent
to Ottawa. Even though we have not yet reciprocated by
opening offices in Baghdad, we have here Dr. Zalzalah, a
lawyer and Ph.D. in Economics, former Minister of Planning, former Governor of the Bank of Iraq and former
ambassador to such sensitive posts as Cairo and Teheran.
To that must be added the warmth of the reception we
received in Baghdad. Dr. Fadhil Al-Chalabi, the Deputy
Minister of Oil and Minerals, and a large group of deputy
ministers and directors-general met us at the airport late
Monday night. The next day they met with us and planned
our itinerary. We were guided with great kindness and
efficiency through visists with some 45 government specialists in areas of interest to our group, and I met privately with Dr. Sadoon Ai-Hammadi, Minister of Oil and
Minerals, Dr. Jawad Al-Hashem, Minister of Planning, and
Dr. Hikmat Al-Azawi, Minister of the Economy. Dr.
Al-Chalabi hosted a formal dinner for us on the Friday
night, then chaired a general wind-up meeting on Saturday morning before accompanying us to the airport. A
minute of our discussions was prepared and signed. A
follow-up committee of three, headed by Dr. Al-Chalabi,
was formed for the purpose of assuring that substantial
results flow from our visit.
Tangible proof that they mean business is to be seen in
the fact that although total Canadian exports to Iraq last
year totalled only $2 million, there have been signed
within the last 10 days contracts worth over $100 million
for this year, and many hundreds of thousands of dollars
over the next five years. The products sold include
locomotives, wheat and lumber. Small missions with purchases of specific types of products in mind are arriving in
Canada with great regularity, and they come with power
to act.
The Honourable Alastair Gillespie, Minister of Industry,
Trade and Commerce, has been so impressed by the observations of our group, and those of the Honourable Donald
Macdonald, who visited other Middle East nations almost
simultaneously, that he bas decided he must go to the area
himself almost immediately. I am greatly pleased to see
{Hon. Mr. Stanbury.]

March 14, 1974

such prompt action. I know it will be helpful to Canada,
and that it will be warmly welcomed by the Government
of Iraq.
I close by repeating my concern that Canada and
Canadian businessmen develop immediately the trading
instruments which are absolutely necessary for effective
marketing of manufactured products and services in an
intensely competitive trade world. Our bankers are among
the best moneylenders in the world, but neither they nor
other segments of our financial community have ever
launched into the world of merchant banking-the tying
of loans and products together-which has been an essential instrument of every other great trading nation. We
have resorted to co-operative marketing agencies in times
of distress for things like wheat, salt fish, fresh-water fish
and so on, but we have never consciously and concertedly
created such agencies for the purpose of selling our manufactured goods and services. Every other trading nation
has found such institutions or arrangements essential.
We participate in trade fairs in some countries, and
various industries hold specialized trade fairs here, but we
have never set up a thoroughly integrated, permanent
trade centre in which a visiting buyer can survey the
extent of our wares and learn of the services we can
provide.
We may be the fifth largest trading nation in the world,
but we can only thank the good Lord for the riches he has
bestowed on us. In the uncertain but fantastically promising future, we had better begin to do much more for
ourselves. The opportunities facing us right now in the
Middle East will be a good testing ground for both our
businessmen and our government.

Hon. Joan Neirnan: Honourable senators, I should first
like to offer my congratulations and pay my respects to
our new Governor General, His Excellency Jules Léger,
who, I am sure, will fulfill the duties of his office with
dignity and honour, as be has demonstrated so far in both
his public and private life.
I should like also to join in the fond tributes which have
been paid to our gracious Speaker. I do not think I shall
sound too partisan if I support the wish of Senator O'Leary, that she may continue to preside in this chamber for a
long, long time.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Neirnan: May I also extend a warm welcome
to Senators Robichaud and Riley.
Honourable senators, the paramount problems which
greatly trouble many Canadians today, and those in government who serve them-first and foremost, the inflationary spiral in which we are caught, along with many
other nations, and then the so-called energy crisis, which
again is not confined to this country-have received a
good deal of analytical and critical attention in speeches
during the past two weeks. The variety of comments
expressed by knowledgeable and experienced senators on
their causes and solutions serve to demonstrate the complexity of the economic problems with which we are faced.
I cannot claim, or even pretend, to offer any expertise in
those fields. I intend to confine my comments to a few
other aspects affecting our government and our Canadian

March 14, 1974

DEBATES

SENATE
SENATE DEBATES

way of life which are of more concern to me. As I proceed I
may even provide a partial answer to the problem of our
rising cost of living.
One session in the Senate hardly gives me the right to
consider myself an expert on parliamentary affairs, but
most of us would not be here today had we not been
interested in the processes of government.
I do not need to remind anyone in this chamber of the
reason why our country was fashioned in the way it was.
The Fathers of Confederation took it for granted that the
British parliamentary system, with which they were most
familiar, was the best model to follow, but they had to
work out a compromise to which individual provinces
could get and would give agreement. We know what our
federal system was intended to be and what it has
become-laudable and effective in many respects in serving the nation as a whole, but too often frustrating and
inefficient in serving its citizens. If the original concept
was less than perfect, what we have done since, or have
failed to do, has not only enhanced its strength but has
made its deficiencies more apparent.
Again, in following the British precedent, and also to
meet uniquely Canadian requirements and pressures, our
founding fathers chose a bicameral system for the federal
Parliament. The traditional reasons for creating an upper
chamber-that it was necessary to protect the interest of
the propertied classes, or to provide a bulwark against the
onrushing forces of democracy-were quite candidly
acknowledged and discussed in pre-Confederation assemblies. The other more persuasive and vital reason for our
existence was to provide a forum where provincial and
regional interests would be protected and presented on a
more or less equal basis.
In all the derogatory comment and criticism which has
been directed toward the Senate during the past 100
years-and demand for its reform or abolition began that
long ago-only a handful of scholars who studied the
records have recognized that we have been neither as
reactionary, with a few notable exceptions, nor as provincially or sectionally oriented as was originally intended or
tought necessary.
Of course, honourable senators have always spoken on
behalf of the regions they represent, but the records will
show that their interests have ranged far beyond that
limited function. They have been more concerned, and
rightly so, with the unification and development of the
entire country.
On the other hand, as provincial governments grew and
began flexing their muscles-and particularly since the
dominion-provincial conferences assumed such an important role in negotiations between them and the central
government-they would probably have taken great
umbrage at any interference or intervention in their special preserves by the Senate on their behalf.
When Confederation began, 181 people were elected to
serve three and a half million people. Today our population is estimated at about 22.5 million, but the number of
elected representatives in the other place has increased
over the years to only 264. Honourable senators are aware
of the great disparity existing in the physical size of the

ridings which those elected members represent, as well as
in the number of people they serve in those ridings.
The government recently announced plans to consider
ways and means of increasing the number of elected
representatives in order to correct some of the present
imbalances. However, we can be assured of loud and vigorous protests from those areas where representation may be
diminished as a result. The old slogan of representation by
population is not the answer in Canada today.
The composition of the Senate, as it was originally
conceived, has remained essentially the same, although it
appears that we may be increasing our membership by two
in order to recognize the significance and emerging separate status of the Yukon and Northwest Territories. That
is a development which we should all welcome.
But what about the other arm of government-the
so-called bureaucratic branch? Its growth has been far
more rapid and, in my view, much more alarming, because
if it continues at its present rate it will surely tend to
thwart our democratic process. The first available figure
showing the complement of the federal Civil Service is for
the year 1912. In that year there were 20,016 public
employees. During and just after World War II, I spent
f ive years in Ottawa when vast numbers of permanent and
temporary employees were added to the Civil Service
establishment. The total number of employees, both permanent and temporary, at the end of the war was 115,908,
or almost 116,000.
I assisted in the demobilization of naval personnel, and
it was assumed that Civil Service personnel would be
decreased proportionately as various military and other
government offices returned to a peacetime basis. I understand that in fact the Civil Service never decreased in size,
and has steadily, and seemingly inexorably, increased
every year since.
The last available figure from Statistics Canada is for
June 1973, when it reported a total of 445,100 public servants, excluding military personnel and members of Parliament but including all government agencies. That is inflation for you. That figure does not include all persons
employed by the federal government in special executive
or advisory capacities, or those temporarily recruited on a
per diem basis. That statistic is not readily available-I
gather for good reason, because the financial outlay it
represents would probably shock us all.
I have one other interesting statistic for the information
of honourable senators. As of June 1973, Statistics Canada
reported that there were almost 654,000 employees on the
public payroll of provincial and municipal governments.
That figure does not include those special categories to
which I have just referred.
a (1530)

So we have just over one million public servants, presumably serving the best interests of the other 22.5 million
private citizens. Depending on how you look at it, you
might not consider that a bad ratio.
I have already stated that I view with alarm such a
rapid and unchecked bureaucratic growth, which is so
often accompanied by a mindless dissipation of the public
purse. It is not confined to the federal government. We
have just had our annual horror story from Ontario's

SENATE DEBATES

Auditor General, but I am sure it is no more dreadful than
that of any other province, or the next report we shall
receive from the Auditor General in Ottawa.
I shall leave it to other honourable senators to indulge in
a masochistic analysis of the impact that government
growth and, therefore, expenditures at all levels, have had
on our economic woes. What I am concerned about is how
those leviathans which we have created are frustrating the
fundamental purposes of government.
I am rather uneasy at attempts-mine or anyone else'sto categorize my political philosophy. Of course, I am a
committed federalist, as I take it for granted every other
honourable senator is. So, bearing in mind that we are,
first of all, Canadians, and after that members of smaller
geographical units, I believe the ideal government at each
level should, within its own jurisdiction, be manouvrable
enough to reach out and touch the lives of its citizens, be
responsive to their needs, and also be flexible enough to
withdraw its services when a need bas been met, and,
further, be prepared to relinquish its prerogative to serve
when a need can better be met in another way.
I believe most strongly that, wherever possible and
feasible, a government should aid and encourage its people
to help themselves. It should not take the easy, unthinking
way of creating a new department, employing a new coterie of technocrats and bureaucrats, building another
empire, putting patches on government structures which
should be discarded or torn down and rebuilt, or neglecting or declining to compel its departments to work together or co-operate unreservedly with other governments
in order to find solutions to common problems. Interdepartmental rivalries in government, and a jealous
guarding of the preserves of power between governments,
lead to the creation of separate resources and the consequent duplication and confusion of services.
Heaven knows, it is the nature of the public beast only
to grow and never to reduce, but why can we not put a
stopper in its mouth? It is we, who are now part of
government, who are responsible and must act. The ordinary citizen is helpless to stop it. Why can we not say,
"That's it," and use the talent we already have? We have
to make the decision to serve that citizen, in the most
efficient, humane and economical way possible, since he is
also paying for the service.
All elected members in the other place-at least the
backbenchers-are, in my opinion, overworked and underpaid, and yet they are, to a large extent, responsible for
their own misfortunes. It is they who authorize increased
government spending and growth. I am inclined to believe
that it is a chicken-and-egg situation-I do not know
which one comes first. They then spend maddening hours
beating through forests of regulations, restrictions and red
tape, trying to provide a simple service to their constituents, so they have no time to reflect upon what they have
done to themselves.
Their predecessors created this chamber with the objective, I am sure, that it would perform a useful and fully
satisfying function in Parliament-that is, to be of maximum service to the people that its members were appointed, if not elected, to represent. That the Senate bas neither
completely fulfilled its own expectations and those of the
[Hon. Mrs. Neiman.]

March 14, 1974

other place, nor, in the mind of the public, been able to
perform a useful role, bas not been entirely its own fault.
Parliament itself-and that includes this chamber-has
too often failed to meet the challenges that the vast
changes in our society over the past one hundred years
have demanded. Instead of expanding its parliamentary
role and utilizing the talent already available to it, it bas
tended to follow the band-aid approach of adding more
bureaucracies. But since it has also tended to arrogate
more power to its executive branch, the harried backbencher may be forgiven for feeling that he is allotted a
great deal of work but very little real responsibility. We
all know what happens in this chamber. We, as senators,
have made many praiseworthy and useful contributions,
but none of us can be entirely happy with the situation as
it now exists.
What we need is a fresh, hard look at our entire parliamentary system. There is a great deal of work to be done,
and we must use this vast, unwieldy government
apparatus to the best advantage of the citizens of Canada.
Many distinguished parliamentarians in the other place,
and a few equally distinguished in this chamber, have, in
past times, advocated the reform or abolition of the
Senate. But when they were in a position to do something
about it, for reasons best known to themselves they did
not proceed any further. I suggest that it is up to honourable senators to make the first move now, if not of selfimmolation, at least of reorganization. From what I know
of the history of previous inquiries, once they appreciate
the complexities of our parliamentary system I do not
believe the members of the other place would recommend
abolition of the Senate. It bas, potentially, too useful a role
to play in assisting them, if-and that is a big "if"-we can
just get down to defining it.
We should be prepared to consider and recommend some
drastic changes in our structure and functions which
would not necessarily involve constitutional amendments,
but might very well go that far. You have heard the
comments which have been made in the past week with
regard to the need for stronger representation of opposition parties in this chamber. I fully agree with that concept, particularly so long as we maintain an adversary
system. I sometimes wonder, however, if that is the most
important role we have to play here, and I understand that
over the years many honourable senators of both political
persuasions lhave not thought it so. It is a question we
should consider again very carefully.
I have come to the conclusion that the appointment of
senators should be for a limited time only-10 to 15
years-and that it should be a full-time position, with
remuneration and other benefits adjusted accordingly.
That would not only provide a regular flow of fresh
experience from people of all political persuasions, but
would meet the criticism of those who dub us "part-time
public servants." It would also offer a challenge to the
other parliamentary wing to use the talents this chamber
would provide for the service of all Canadians.
I am of two minds as to whether appointments should be
renewable once, but I should certainly wish to see a
provision to make use of the services of retired senatorsperhaps on a per diem basis-who want to provide such

March 14,1974

SENATE DEBATES

service. Then we should have a good look at how each
member of this chamber could serve most effectively.
I believe the time has come to discard the rhetoric and
the sentiment. Let us ask ourselves what we are doing
here. Let us decide what we want to do here, and how it
can best be done. Then let us start doing it. Let us combine
the best of the past with a new blueprint for the future.
I know all honourable senators share my wish that this
venerable chamber continue to grow and evolve, and play
a vital role in our society.
On motion of Senator Buckwold, debate adjourned.

Hon. Mr. Langlois: I am always pleased to see that the
Leader of the Opposition is worried about the Leader of
the Government in the Senate, and I assume that he is
referring to Senator Martin.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Who else?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Because under rule 5 (d) of the
Rules of the Senate, the Leader of the Government is
always present in this place. Indeed, rule 5 (d) reads as
follows:
(d) "Government Leader in the Senate" means the
senator occupying the recognized position of Leader
of the Government in the Senate or a senator acting
for him.
As far as Senator Martin is concerned, he came back
from Venezuela on Monday evening, and tonight he is
down in Trois-Rivières, Quebec, on official business as
guest speaker at a seminar at Quebec University.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Lucky people.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: As a supplementary question, may I
inquire if it is the policy of the government to send the
Leader of the Government away as frequently as is possible so that he will not have to deal with the business of the
Senate?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I believe my honourable friend
should be the last one to complain of the distinction the
government has given to the leader, or to any one of us, for
that matter, in asking him to represent Canada in such
important functions at home and abroad. I am sure the
honourable senator will be in accord with this practice
which has developed.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Do I understand that the deputy leader
suggests it is more important for the Leader of the Government to be away than to be attending to his duties in
this place?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I have just explained that the
Leader of the Government is always present in this place.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I agree that if you are going to be
acting all the time we will all be pleased.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Thank you very much, but that is
wishful thinking.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I am afraid it is.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE

MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLY-DEBATE CONTINUED

Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, may I ask the
Deputy to the Leader of the Government where is the
Leader of the Government tonight? I thought he was back
from his mission to Venezuela, and we were hoping to see
him here tonight.

The Senate resumed from Thursday, March 14, consideration of His Excellency the Governor General's Speech at
the opening of the session, and the motion of Senator
Robichaud, seconded by Senator Perrault, for an Address
in reply thereto.

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. Margaret Norrie: Honourable senators, before the
debate resumes, I should like to have the opportunity to
answer questions put to me by Senator Connolly (Ottawa
West) during this debate on March 14.
The first question was about non-Canadian ownership
of land 'n Nova Scotia. In reply, may 1 say that the
problem is not one of non-Canadian ownersbîp of land in
Nova Scotia, but rather non-resident ownership of land in
Nova Scotia. In the brief, for purposes of clarity, a nonresident is defined as anyone whose principal place of
residence is not Nova Scotia. There are various angles
which need to be studied, and noni-Canadian ownership
could very well be one. Please note also a definite statement was made in the brief to the effect that we are not
against any individual who wishes to move into our rural
communities in Nova Scotia to become a fuil-tîme contributing citizen.
*

(2010)

Senator Connolly was certainly correct whcn he stated
that this matter falîs within provincial jurisdiction under
the termis of the British North America Act. However, does
that prevent one from bringing to the Senate serious
problems affecting any one province or, indeed, several
provinces and discussing themn before it is too late to take
steps to avoid serious trouble?
This study revealed the astounding extent to which
non-resident ownership of land has taken place in Nova
Scotia. I find that Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick,
Ontario, and British Columbia all bave somewhat similar
problems, on a greater or smaller scale.
I cannot answer Senator Connolly's question about
forced sales or sheriff's sales wbere the successful bidding
was done by foreigners or non-residents of Canada. Neither can I answer his question about the number of acres
of land that have been taken out of agricultural production as a result of the continued purchase by non-residents of such agricultural land in Nova Scotia. To obtain
such information would take months and months of costly
work on the part of the Citizens' Alliance for the Preservation of Nova Scotian Land, and it cannot afford either
the time or the money to do so. The Dalhousie Instîtute of
Public Affairs bas done quite a study, as have representatives of the Department of Agriculture, into the question
of non-resident ownership. But more help both in the form
of money and manpower is needed bef ore it is too late.
I hope that this will be of some assistance to you,
senator.
Hon. Mr'. Connolly (Ottawa West): Thank you very
much.
Hon. Guy Williamns: Honourable senators, first of ahl I
should like to congratulate our new Governor General and
Madame Léger. I wish them well in carrying out their
duties, and I also wish tbemn health. My congratulations go
also to the new senators. I know they will do well because
they are men of long experience in public tif e.
To you also, Madam Speaker, 1 of fer congratulations on
your great ability in carrying out the many difficult duties
of your office. You have my confidence and admiration.
My people, the Tsimshians, the Haidas, the Kwakuitls
and the Tlingits of the Alaskan coast, in times before the
white man discovered North America, chose and appointed

DEATESMarch

women as head chiefs of their tribes. The stories and
legends say they ruled well.
H-onourable senators, the Canadian Indians enjoyed a
systemn of rule in whicb women were accepted as equals.
The women were also appointed to the body of "thinkers
and planners.' In my dialect there is no word for "committee" or "council"-theref ore, the reference to "planners.'
Your society, with its many centuries of advancement,
progress and science, still discriminates against women,
and as a result today you have the Women's Lib.
In relating to you the form of government that existed
among the Six Nations, honourable senators, one must
dwell a little on the customs of my people from the
mid-coast of British Columbia to the coastal parts of
Alaska. These are known as the people of the clans, or the
totem people. We are also known and referred to by other
tribes as the "big canoe people." There is one big canoe
here in the museum in Ottawa. If there are some who have
not seen this canoe, I suggest that they go some time to
see it. It is hewn out of a huge red cedar log from the
Queen Charlotte Islands. The length is 60 feet and it is 6
feet 6 inches wide. The prow, or the bow, is 9 feet high, and
the stern is 6 feet high. Its estimated carrying capacity is 5
tons, or 30 people. You may still see some of those great
trees, out of wbich the canoes were hewn, in the coastal
areas of northern British Columbia.
Honourable senators, there is a legend existing among
our people that the interior Indians and the coastal Indians built the coastal ranges and the Rocky Mountains. In
British Columbia we do things big. They built the mountains for no other purpose but that of keeping their brothers, the Plains Indians, out of British Columbia.
*

(2020)

I would like to inform honourable senators that approximately one-fifth of the Indian population of British
Columbia are descendants of the Totem people, the caryers, who were organized in clans or phratries. There are
many clans, such as the Eagle, Raven, Whale, Salmon,
Beaver, Wolf, and Grizzly Bear clans, each of which has its
own chief. There is no intermarriage among clan members;
members must marry outside of their clan. The system is
matriarchal. The offspring follows the line of the mother,
not the father. The son succeeds the uncle, and the daughter succeeds the aunt. That is tbe surest way of protecting
the family line.
There was tribal warfare for material gain only, not for
territorial gain, which was the motive of bonourable senators' forebears in many of those countries from which they
came to Canada. It was flot uncommon in the society of
the day for a chief to have as many as 10 wives. I can only
say: what a system, what a if e! There was no inflation in
those days. Feuds amnong f amilies were carried on for
decades. It was almost a natural way of if e in those days.
I should now like to deal with matters raised in the
Speech from the Throne wbich greatly affect Canada's
Indian people.
The Indian society clashed in somne serious respects wîth
the society of those who came to Canada from other
countries. Many Indians were nomadic or semi-nomadic.
In those days there was really no need, in many parts of
Canada, for permanent dwellings or, shahl 1 say, bouses.

March 19,1974

Marc 19,1974SENATE
DEBATES

During this difficuit transition period for the Indian
people, the governrnent's housing programi has, for many
decades, been lagging further and further behind.
I arn told that in some areas adjacent to municipalities
and cities-particularly in the southeastern portion of
Vancouver Island-as many as 17 people are living in a
three-room house erected under the housing program. In
my opinion, those houses are substandard. Being an old
shipwright and carpenter, I think I know what makes a
standard house, and what makes a substandard house. One
answer ta the problem is a larger appropriation for native
housing. However, that is flot the total answer.
Insufficient labour is employed by construction and
development companies. A housing program without
builders is of no value. The housing situation as it relates
to the Indian people will flot improve unlil the need for
qualified builders is met.
The one bright spot in all of this is that there are quite a
number of trained, qualified Indian tradesmen now. However, these Indian tradesmen lack the means to form their
own establishments, such as smali construction companies. Were they able to do so, they might be able to
alleviate, to some extent, the acute shortage of housing for
Indian people.
Then, again, I must remind honourable senators that a
housing program is not the total answer. Il must be tied to
a down-to-earth counselling program to help these families adjust to modern houses. It may be difficult for some
senators to understand the need for such a program, but
let me give one illustration of why il is necessary.
At the end of World War II an epidemic hit a band of
Indians living in a remote part of British Columbia. At
that time the Government of Canada built 17 houses for
them. They were small structures, but they provided fairly
good shelter. They did flot have running water; I understand there was only one tap to serve the 17 houses. These
Indians were not accustomed to living in this type of
house, and the first thing they did was to stack the
bedsteads up, using them for shelving for their belongings,
and they slept on the f loor. They were accustomed to
sleeping on mother earth, and that was the only way they
could sleep in comfort. That is why I say that extensive
counselling must be part of any housing program for the
native people at least in some areas of Canada. They will
adjust in time. I arn told on good authority that in a very
heavily settled area, again in southeastern Vancouver
Island, there are homes, adjacent to city limita, which
have outhouses. This does not seem at ail reasonable in
such an area, in this day, nor does it make sense. The
Government of Canada and the Canadian people must
make every attempt to make the standards of living of
your sociely availabie ta the Indian people of Canada.
0 (2030)
Now let me say a f ew words about the Indian people of
today from my personal observations. They have the courage of their forebears, but today they are inciined to be
militant, which could be serious and a real national problem. Why? The answer is widespread. The use of marijuana and sof t druga, and indeed heavy drugs, has made
terrific inroads in the Indian reservations, which is a
serious matter. I know il is also a national problem,
because il does not involve only young Indian people.

Whether it be among Indians or others, this problem is
extensive.
The goverfiment must find some way to divert the
energy of these young people to something useful that
would benef il the community and the people of Canada as
a whole. This is not only an Indian problem; it is a
national problem. Every community, every city in Canada,
is affected. The energy of these young Canadians must be
diverted to something which will be of benef il ta this
great country of Canada.
Honourable senators, let me go now mbt something that
is a litIle more pleasant. The Indian people have been
involved in the fishing industry in British Columbia from
the beginning. They were the f irst commercial fishermen.
For a century, or for very close ta a century, they have
been so involved. 1 have rated the fishing industry as
second only to the great fur-trading induslry involved in
the aecuring of the pelts of fur-bearing animais. Such was
the trade. As Indian people in British Columbia we did not
receive our rightfui share of the fruits of our labour-the
labour of those who are no longer with us. However, we
survived well when the other nationals, the other f ishermen who were predominant in numbers and in production,
were not Ihere. When this country was at the height of its
struggle in World War II, the Japanese nationais-and
many of them were my frienda-were taken out of the
coastal area, and the Indian f ishermen was toid by representatives of the govemnment to produce and produce and
produce, in order to carry on Canada's war effort. During
those days the Indian fishermen produced more than 50
per cent of the saimon catch. That is a very good record. I
cannot use any other words to express it.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Wiliiamns: Not only that, but many of our
young men went overseas and made the supreme sacrifice
in the defence of Canada. Being involved in an Indian
organization for most of my if e, and being a fisherman
also, I have some very pleasant memories of the coast of
British Columbia. I have also some very pleasant memories of being an appointee of the then Mînister of Fisheries
on the advisory committee on f isheries for the Government of Canada in ils negotialions with the United States,
Japan and the Soviet Union. I look back on those days
with pleasure. I must say that I learned a great deal, 100.
As a result of the efforts of our organization we have
been able, af 1er about f ive years of endeavour, to gel
governments for the first time ta give some form of assistance or subsidy for fishing purposes. It stili burns me a
litîle bit ta remember that there was a very large experimental boat-perhaps the word "experimental" is my
own-known as the Golden Scamp, thal was built for the
tuna f ishery on the East Coast. The subsidy that wenl int
that ship was $1,700,000, and il was soid on the auclion
block for $700,000.
* (2040)

The point I am making is that the Indian fishermen's
assistance program today provided slightly over $7 million. The program was terminaîed and a new program put
mbt
effect-a ten-year program this time-the total
amount of which will be over $12 million. So far sa good.
We appreciale that. The program has brought our fishermen ta the point of production where they are real com-

SENATE DEBATES
petitors. It is not that they had been poor fishermen all
their lives, although they had poor equipment, but with
this monetary assistance they were able to upgrade their
boats so that they could become real competitors.
To indicate just how competitive they are I will mention
that this past season the top man in the whole industry
grossed over $200,000 from salmon alone. The Indian fisherman is now a real competitor to the other nationals who
are in the industry as catchers of salmon.
About a year and a half of the new $12 million program
has already gone into effect. I must say that the program
is welcomed by the Indian fishermen, but with respect to
this past year our own experts have estimated that the
total income tax paid by the Indian fishermen for 1973 will
be around $1212 million, and perhaps as much as $15
million. In other words, in one year the Indian fishermen
have more than put back into the coffers of the country
the money that is going to be their assistance for ten
years.
The industry is changing every day. When that 200-mile
continental shelf limit comes into effect, the manner of
fishing on the coast of British Columbia is going to
change. In order to compete with other nations the fishermen will have to move out on the high seas, and this will
mean changing from the smaller types of boats over to
large vessels.
In order to get production from any industry it is necessary to have proper and up-to-date machinery. In this case
up-to-date boats must be made available. They will more
than pay for themselves. But I suggest that this will take
at least $50 million over the next five years when that
200-mile limit comes into effect.
A colleague of mine, the Member of Parliament for
Kamloops- Cariboo, Len Marchand, quite often tells this
story about fishermen. At a conference here in Ottawa at
which many representatives of Indian people were present
from different parts of Canada, an Indian who was an
arts-and-craftsman apparently told some British Columbian fishermen, who were representatives of an organization
attending the conference, that for the very first year he
was doing well because he was getting government assistance to engage in arts and crafts. He said, "I grossed $7,000
last year." That is well and fine. I appreciate that very
much myself. To him this was a real step forward in the
right direction. But one of those fishermen, in replying to
him at that time, said, "That is very good, but you must go
after a bigger assistance to enable you to have a bigger
production. Last year I paid twice that much money in
income tax." He was not belittling the man who was
beginning to see a future after getting assistance. On the
contrary; he was encouraging him to go for greater
production.
Honourable senators, you may find that I have digressed
a great deal, but there are so many points I could make in
reply to the Speech from the Throne that it is difficult not
to digress. However, these are the major aspects that I feel
we should dwell on.
I have been much impressed by the speeches of members
of this chamber. For example, I very much enjoyed Senator Quart's speech. It opened my eyes to quite an extent. It
was nice. I have no further comment than that; it was nice.
[Hon. Mr. Williams.]

March 19, 1974

I also took considerable interest in what my colleague
Senator Croll had to say in his references and descriptions
when speaking of the poor people of Canada. You will
recall that he referred to the working poor. I think I can
understand that. He also referred to the welfare poor, and
I think I understand that to a degree. But perhaps I, too,
can make a contribution by way of adding one or two
additional points. The Indians, too, have their welfare
poor. In fact, there are many "welfare poor" Indians.
There are also "working poor" Indians. They are the Indians who make every effort to be employed and to earn a
living in order to provide for their own welfare and that of
their families, but in the majority of cases they are
unskilled, have served no apprenticeships, and their rate
of pay is not as good as that of those who are skilled.
Continuity of employment is not always there, as it is for
the skilled.
@ (2050)

To that I would add that the public at large uses the
term "the poor Indian" very widely. You hear it in all
parts of Canada, and I have heard it personally. That
Indian may not be poor. He may have means, he may have
good earnings-though it would be a rare case-but "the
poor Indian" in many cases is a derogatory term. It is a
statement by society that he does not belong; that he is
outside this society. Fortunately he is surviving, he is
going to continue to survive, and he is going to be here as
long as you will be. The thing to do, in this advanced day
and age, is to provide extension of programs. Training
must be made available for them. True, there are less than
300,000 of them in this country, yet they can stand up very
straight and say, "My forebears, my people, were here
before you qr yours." That is courage.
How do we do these things? It is not easy for an Indian
to come into your society-and I am speaking from experience. I left my reserve in 1944, and, believe me, it was a
struggle, not only from the point of view of being away,
but it was also a struggle to survive. There is some looseness, I admit, in the way of life on a reserve. It is much
easier to live on a reserve than in a municipality or city.
But since 1944 I have no regrets. I must say that I am quite
happy that I did leave, although many of my friends
condemned me, and looked upon me as a deserter for
leaving them. Again, I want to say that it was not easy.
We have quite a large number of Indians in British
Columbia who are now living in the lower mainland of
that province, in the southern part of Vancouver Island,
and in different parts of British Columbia. They have
moved out to the cities, to the municipalities, to take
advantage of the facilities and whatever is available to
each member of society, whether it be schools and education, or whether it be some form of training ground where
he can fit in. But also, by the same token, many returned
to their reserves.
Do not misunderstand me. I am not trying to convince
you that the way of life for an Indian is impossible, or that
your society is impossible. Every day the Indian people are
advancing into your society, and in the distant future I
believe that they will all be in your society, and be participants in your society.
You would be amazed to discover that nearly 40 per cent
of the Indians on some reservations have moved to

March 19,1974

Marc 19,1974SENATE
DEBATES

municipalities or cities. I say it is a very good sign that
they are taking advantage of the educational facilities that
are available in cities and in municipalities and taking
their rightf ul places in your society, and they are making a
darned good job of it.
When this society does not refer to them as 'poor Indians" just because they are Indians, then greater opportunities will exist for the Indian people in this great
country. I am very happy to say that we have many people
from all parts of Canada working in offices here in
Ottawa, and they are doing a very capable and good job.
However, it is not only the Canadian nationals who
discriminate. We have discrimination ahl over the world.
The history of the world is built on discrimination, or
discriminatory attitudes on the part of individuals tow;ard
their fellow men. It is a human fault, and we are not going
to overcome it in Canada, but I believe that by creating
opportunities, or preparing the Indian for more opportunities, we will have a better Canada to live in.
There was another item in the Speech f rom the Throne
that interested me-guaranteed boans to farmers and fishermen. I know next to nothing about farming, but without
the farmers this country cannot exist, particularly when
the population of the world is consuming more and more
farmn products. As a member last year of the Agriculture
Committee, it hit me very hard to see some of the farm
land in the province of New Brunswick reverting back to
the wilderness, when Canada needs ahl the a gricultural
products she can harvest from good land. This also must
be made right. I trust that this government will follow
through and of fer very substantial assistance to f armers.
"Guaranteed boans," I think, is a very good term. In my
understanding it simply means that the government will
guarantee the boan. What better system can we get? I am
sure that many f ishermen will take advantage of it if it
comes into effect, and I ask very seriously: Will the Indian
f ishermen be involved, or will they be told, "You already
have a program."? This country has spent millions upon
millions of dollars in ship subsidy commitments. For the
harvesters of the resources of the seas bigger, better and
more expensive boats will be required in the next decade.
Honourable senators, I appreciate very deeply the opportunity that I have had to speak in the debate on the
Address in reply to the Speech f rom the Throne.
I have spoken.
* (2100)

Hon. Keith Laird: Honourable senators, the debate on
the motion for an Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne, s0 ably presided over by Madam Speaker and 50
competently proposed and seconded by Senator Robichaud
and Senator Perrault, bas been most instructive. I have
either heard or read ail the speeches, and, believe me, I
have learned a lot. One thing that struck me personally
arising out of the Speech fromn the Throne itself and the
debate which bas followed-and, incidentaliy, this first
*occurred to me when I heard mention of the energy crisis
in the Speech fromn the Throne-is that perhaps our biggest problemn today, if you can cail any one problem the
biggest, is that of Canadian-American relations.
One of my reasons for saying that, honourable senators,
is that whiie it is difficuit, if not impossible, to segregate

problems in this complex world, tied in with the matter of
our relations with the United States there are so many
other problems-the matter of inflation, the matter of
prosperity in general and the matter of our military security. Ail of these things are tied in with our relationship
with the United States. As I say, if you can segregate any
one problem from the others then I earnestly suggest that
our biggest problem today is our relationship with the
United States of America. There are certain fundamentals
that should be kept in mind at the beginning of any
consideration of this problem.
Honourable senators, while saying that let me make it
clear that I have absolutely no intention of keeping you
for any length of time this evening, because I realize that
the debate has already gone a long way, but I should like
to try to get you thinking on one or two points.
The matter of deciding and considering some fundamentais in connection with this problem becomes quite important. in my view. before we even start on it. First of ail, we
must keep in mind that there can really be no equal
contest between the United States and Canada, whether
economically, militarily or otherwise. You might say that
a military contest is quite impossible, and I would agree
with you. The American people are s0 friendly and s0
anxious to get along with us in the main that the idea of a
military conflict is simply unthinkable. But let us consider
an economic conflict, which some of our people seem to try
deliberately to provoke. Such an economic conflict with
the United States would be like matching George Foreman, the heavyweight champion of the world, against any
member of the Senate. And I suggest, honourable senators,
that such a contest would be rather unequal.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: I think perhaps Senator Flynn
coffld take him on.
Hon. Mr. Laird: Well, I recognize that he is fairly
healthy, but I would not bet on him.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I had somebody else in mind.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: With his Irish temper yet.
Hon. Mr. Laird: There is another thing that gets me
down, and that is the apparent feeling on the part of some
people that there is something intrinsically evil about
American investment in Canada. I must admit that there
are times when I feel rather like Dagwood in the comic
strip, in that when people discuss this subject I feel that I
just hate myseif. I find myseif more or less wishing that
some of them could be shoved off into the stoney backlands to live where they would be living had it not been
for American investment in Canada. They are so blithe in
their criticism of American investment here, and yet our
standard of living would have been absolutely nothing
compared to what it is now without that American
investment.
There are certain fundamentals like that, honourable
senators, that you have to start out with when you consider this problem. This, of course, does not mean that we
need to knuckle under to the Americans. So many people
seem to take it for granted that we are beaten before we
start, but our whole history shows otherwise.
My most recent reading has been the memoirs of the
Right Honourable L. B. Pearson, and having read both
volumes, I must admit that I am impressed with the

SENATE DEBATES
proposition that very definitely throughout the history of
our relationship with the United States of America we
have neyer knuckled under. If you have been looking at
the rather well done television serial about the building of
the CPR-The CanadianDream, I believe it is calledHon. Mr'. Buckwold: The National Dream.
Hon. Mr'. Laird: Well, I was close, anyway. From that
story it is clear that even back in those days there was the
problem of dealing with American ownership of a key
industry. But certainly we have neyer knuckled under to
the Americans.
Another example which occurs to me, as I arn sure it has
also occurred to many of you, is the question of trade with
Cuba. We have gone right ahead and traded with Cuba
despite the fact that the United States has imposed a ban
on such trade. The recent case of the locomotives manufactured by the Worthington Company in Montreal for sale to
Cuba is a perfect example of this. Wc are simply going
right ahead regardless of how vital the Americans feel thîs
is to their own interests.
Hon. Mr'. Flynn: The Canadian Football Leàgue is
another example. Are you going to deal with that?
Hon. Mr'. Laird: As a matter of fact, I had not intended
to deal with that situation. This does nlot mean that I arn
not acquainted with the game of football-I arn. But I
would regard this as being a suitable subject matter for a
separate speech in this bouse, and therefore I shall not
take up your time by discussing it now.
Hon. Mr'. Flynn: l was merely tempting you.
Hon. Mr'. Laird: Then, ail I can say is, 'Get tbee behind
me, Satan."
Hon. Mr'. Langlois: I arn sure that what Senator Flynn
has in mind is political football.
Hon. Mr'. Laird; Well, it was quite another kind that I
had in mmid.
Hon. Mr'. McElmnan: He just ran off side.
Hon. Mr'. Lair'd: Pernaps somebody sbould run interference for hlmi.
This side of our relationship has been stated so often
and at such length-statistically, economically, philosoph.caliy and in every other way you can think of. It bas been
restated and rewritten many times. One thing that struck
me-and this is wby I said I was going to be brief in my
remnarks and let you just think about it-is that it seems to
me that we might run into the danger, wbîch we have
done in the past, of having these problems resolved by
emotional considerations. This is a very real problemn.
When you look back in history, how many real international problerns have arisen based nlot on reason, but on
pure emotion? I would think that a good many wars have
resulted fromn pure emotion, instead of reason. We must
guard against that in any consideration of this problem.
a (2110)
First, however, let us consider this emotional factor
from an American standpoint. I would say that the principal problemn the Americans have-and, believe me, I have
had plenty of contacts with thern; in fact, rather close
contacts with one[Hon. Mr. Laird.]

Mrh1,17
March 19,1974

Hon. Mr'. Molgat: Explain.
Hon. Mr. Laird: Explain, Senator Molgat says. Well,
perhaps I should admit, as Senator Davey has said on one
occasion, I do have a conflict of interest. How could it be
otherwise witb an American wife?
In any event, I will say this, that the Americans are
remiss in this respect of building up to the emotional
aspect. They have neyer in the past really known enough
about us. They have not taken the time, they have not
spent the energy, to find out enough about Canada and, as
a result, they go off half-cocked every se often.
When we look back on the past and read what bas
happened between the two countries we realize that the
sources of friction were known, recognized, studied and
something was done about themn by governmental of ficials, particularly, of course, those engaged in the
diplomatic service. They unders tood-someti mes, I arn
afraid, their understanding did flot belp the cause, but
they understood what was going on. The ordinary person
over there, however, in some respects speaks from igncrance. Let us be honest about it. In rny opinion this bas
given rise to some of their problems arising out of
emotionalism.
Consider, for example, the senator over there who castigated Canada for putting a tax on the export of oil saying
this was something terrible, without mentioning the littie
detail that we had to import oil for the Eastern provinces
and pay world prices. This is the sort of thing, you see,
that gets a person down. In any event, when one senator
says that-and I arn sure that his was almost a lone
voîce-this sort of thing is taken up by others of lesser
responsibility.
For example, about a month ago in Florida I heard a
commentator on a Fort Myers TV station make exactly
this statement. 0f course, the temptation is to do something about it, but the usefulness of pursuing such an
issue with an irresponsible man is, in my opinion, questionable. Where would it get one? It is this emotional
aspect that hits the Americans, and for no other reason
thari lack of knowledge.
Irresponsible speeches, however, made by some rather
prominent Canadians worry me equally. Tbey castîgate
anything American. I classify them as ultra-nationalistic,
and I do not think they are serving the cause at all. 0f
course, we ail wish to preserve our heritage. Every one of
us wishes to remain a Canadian, but to constantly carp at
the United States for doing this, that and the other thing,
especially if you are a prominent Canadian, bas a most
unfortunate effect on the other side because, frankly, it
frightens people. I have seen the reaction. They are going
to do something in Canada. Perhaps it is a matter of
investment, purchasing sorne property, or sometbing like
that, and they begin to wonder and think twice about it. It
scares thern. These statements naturally build up in their
minds a concern f ar beyond what we, on this side of the
border, know they are worth. It really should be a matter
of concern to all of us that this sort of thing happens.
I suppose, however, it bas one advantage in that it
makes the Americans pay that rnuch more attention to us
and this, of course, should be the ultimate objective-to
induce them to realize that we are here, and to realize that

March 19, 1974

March 19. 1974

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

in our relationships with them we also have problems, that
it is not all one-sided.
I observe in the papers the results of recent polls on this
subject which at first blush seem to indicate that the
majority of the people of Canada are anxious to exclude
American investments, and perhaps to have as little to do
with the United States as possible. I suggest, however,
that this is nothing but an emotional reaction, illustrating
that these very Canadians wish to remain Canadian and
to retain their heritage. That is all it amounts to.
On the other side of the coin, you will all remember that
famous radio speech by Gordon Sinclair, in which he
pointed out very forcibly that the United States is a much
maligned country, and that we should remember all she
has done. I admit that he made the odd mistake in fact in
that speech, but in the main I liked it. It hit the nail on the
head. The Americans have done so much for so many
people. Just think of what they have done for us through
the Carnegie and Rockefeller Foundations, and so many
others. They have done the same and more for so many
other countries in the world. So, when Gordon Sinclair
made that speech, believe me, it struck a chord with me,
despite some criticism which ensued.
In contrast to what might appear from some of the
newspaper polls, I was interested in the sampling of thousands of letters received by the radio station which carried
that particular speech. It showed that 90 per cent of the
writers favoured the editorial. Only 7 per cent of the
letters were unfavourable, and 3 per cent were downright
vicious. This, in my view, encourages us to think that
while Canadians as a whole wish to remain distinctive,
they do appreciate what bas been done for them by the
United States.
Actually, of course, those who are most vocal in their
criticism of the United States are those who are directly
affected by some of its actions. For example, there is the
matter of pollution of the Great Lakes. I certainly think
that while we have carried our share of the load up to this
point, the Americans have not.

e

(2120)

Honourable senators may recall the action of the President of the United States in holding up the allotment of
funds for that purpose. That certainly caused irritation,
particularly to those directly affected. I can well understand the unfavourable reaction. Incidentally, I understand that the problem concerning the allocation of funds
is likely to be resolved very shortly. Let us hope that they
will then be able to get on with this business of cleaning
up the Great Lakes.
I could keep honourable senators in the chamber all
night listening to a list of irritations that arise in the
course of our relationship with the United States. The fact
is that as long as we have a neighbour we are going to
have irritations. Strange though it may seem, I have even
heard about irritations which exist between husband and
wif e.
An Hon. Senator: Not you.
Hon. Mr. Laird: No, not me. I am surprised I did not get
more reaction from my comment. In any event, no matter
how close we are to a person-and we are very close to the

Americans-there are bound to be irritations and emotional reactions.
What can we do about them? May I express the hope, so
far as the Americans are concerned-and they may not
want advice from me-that they will find out more about
our attitude towards those problems which involve them.
So far as we are concerned, I should like to offer this
advice-which I think is in order from one Canadian to
another-that despite irritations, such as pronouncements
by irresponsible people in the United States, we keep our
cool. If we allow ourselves to be carried away by that sort
of thing, we shall not be advancing the cause of mutual
understanding which is so important for both our countries. If we are able to keep our cool, we shall be able to
solve each problem which arises between us.
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham: Honourable senators, I join
with others who preceded me in welcoming the Governor
General and Madame Léger to Rideau Hall. Their many
fine qualities will ensure that those responsibilities to
which they have committed themselves will be carried out
with great dignity.
To you, Madam Speaker, I can only say how personally
pleased I am that you have agreed to continue in your
present position. On many occasions you have exercised a
remarkable degree of patience, and you have given the
Senate exemplary service both inside and outside this
chamber.
I would be remiss, honourable senators, if I did not
express my personal gratitude to the officers and staff of
the Senate who serve this chamber with such great
dedication.
To the mover and seconder of the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne, Senators Robichaud and Perrault, I offer my congratulations. The potential of this
house, I suggest, has been greatly enhanced by their
presence.
May I say also how pleased we are to see Senator Hicks
in his place after a most unfortunate accident. I am sure
that all senators would wish me to ask Senator Hicks to
convey to his good wife our best wishes for her full and
speedy recovery.
Over the past months, all Canadians have become aware
of the so-called energy crisis. It is not my intention to
enter into a debate on whether or not this so-called crisis
is real or contrived. However, it has made all Canadians
aware of the necessity of having a truly national energy
policy. As most people now realize, energy is a scarce
resource and those resources that we have must be carefully husbanded.
Our chief resources are, of course, oil and coal, both of
which are non-renewable. Whether the energy crisis is
real or contrived, it is my belief that it bas been in many
ways a blessing in disguise. It has focused much needed
attention on the scarcity of world energy supplies. It was
recently estimated that if we continue to use our energy
resources at the same rate of escalation as that which has
existed since World War II, by 1990 we will have effectively depleted the known supplies of fossil fuels.
In February of this year a worthwhile conference on
energy was held in my home city of Sydney, Nova Scotia. I
do not intend to go into detail about that conference,

SENATE DEBATES
which was well reported and acclaimed through the
media. One thing that was pinpointed at that conference is
how little we really know about our reserves of all forms
of energy resources. One result of that conference will be a
concerted effort to develop a total inventory of reserves
and a rational program of exploitation. To this end I would
endorse the position that calls for a single price for oil for
the whole of Canada.
I realize that this cannot be achieved without concessions being made that will have the effect of equalizing
economic opportunities in all regions of the country. I
repeat that oil is a non-renewable resource, and if we
insist on squandering it we will leave a heritage of poverty
for future generations.
With that in mind, it becomes necessary to look at
alternative sources of energy and to study carefully their
potential to meet our energy requirements. In this respect
I would urge the Government of Canada to commit itself
to the role of catalyst in the construction of a commonuser grid to connect the provincial electrical utilities of
Eastern Canada. This, I suggest, would provide for the
most efficient use of all energy resources developed and
undeveloped in that part of Canada.
Among other things, construction of the super grid
would enhance the economic feasibility of proceeding with
the development of the Bay of Fundy tides. The super grid
would also lessen the technical difficulties of placing
nuclear plants in service in the smaller Maritime power
system. I hope also that the Government of Canada will
share in the funding of those remaining studies and investigations which are a prerequisite to the determination of
the economic feasibility of proceeding with a tidal power
development in the Bay of Fundy.
I am pleased to endorse the establishment of a national
petroleum corporation which will allow Canadians greater
opportunity to become aware of the real costs and potential of our petroleum resources.
We as a nation must guard against the possibility of
manipulation by giant multinational corporations which
may pursue their own ends with insufficient regard for
the wishes or the needs of either people or governments. If
we as Canadians can agree that the best way to cement
our country from sea to sea is by pursuing economic
policies that allow all Canadians to participate as equals,
then it ought to follow that we are likewise prepared to
pursue other policies which will have as their effect the
equalization of opportunity for all Canadians.
*

(2130)

There is no policy that has been more discussed, nor is
more vital, than a national transportation policy-a truly
national transportation policy-which will allow the
orderly development of all regions of this country. Again,
we cannot afford to develop policies that serve te place
regions of this country in disadvantageous positions. From
the time of Sir John A. Macdonald, various Canadian
governments have attempted to pursue transportation
policies to weld our regions into a cohesive nation. There
is no question that both the Atlantic and the Western
regions of this country have felt somewhat alienated.
Many people believe that our national policies have
encouraged disparity rather than ameliorate it. All
Canadian governments must work together to develop an
(Hon. Mr. Graham.]

March 19, 1974

equitable transportation policy which will give all Canadians the opportunity to participate in prosperity.
At this point in time, Nova Scotia has the leading container port in Canada at Halifax. I should also emphasize
the great potential of the deep-water port in the Strait of
Canso, one of the finest deep-water, ice-free ports in the
world. At the same time as it is assisting in the development of these ports, the province is also looking at other
ports such as my home city of Sydney, te determine their
best potential contribution to the economy. Again, what
we reallv need is for governments, through co-operative
effort, to pursue a comprehensive policy that will enable
these ports to develop to their fullest potential in the
interests of the people of Nova Scotia and all of Canada.
I am pleased to see that the government intends to
propose an agricultural program that will protect both the
producer and the consumer. I suggest we ought to be
extremely careful that we do not promote the corporation
farm as the answer, as the be all and end all, to our
agricultural policy. Much is said these days that what we
need is a more sufficiently integrated food industry that
would provide food at the most efficient price. I would
hope that the policies to be promoted are policies which
will not discriminate in favour of the integrated corporation, but rather policies which will make it economic for
all people, young people particularly, to continue to develop their own private farms.
The policies that we pursue today will provide the
future direction of the agricultural industry. I would suggest that the long-term interests of both producers and
consumers will not be effectively met by the establishment of monopolies in the food industry. The market
system works to the optimum advantage of all when there
exists true competition. We must be sure that this competition does not make paupers of the producers, nor take
undue advantage of the consumers.
One other subject I should like to speak on before
concluding, honourable senators, is that of housing.
During the past year the National Housing Act was
amended to make available new, innovative programs to
assist Canadians in owning their own bouses, to rehabilitate their premises, to improve neighbourhoods, to assist
in land assembly, to give a real boost to co-operatives and
non-profit groups, as well as other programs directed
towards minority groups. I congratulate both the government and CMHC for the progress made in this regard.
The Assisted Home Ownership Program, one of the
programs developed recently, provides assistance for families with incomes below $11,000 per year in buying their
own bouses as an alternative to the large monolithic
public housing developments we have seen in the past.
The programs to rehabilitate and rejuvenate older neighbourhoods require agreements with the provincial governments. These agreements set out the budget for each
province, and the method by which each province will
select the neighbourhoods to be rehabilitated. I understand agreement in principle has been reached with nine
provinces, including Nova Scotia. I hope the detailed
agreements will be signed quickly.
I should like, in this regard, to encourage the Government of Canada to continue its policy of decentralizing
decision-making within the corporation, and to proceed as

March 19, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

quickly as possible to ensure that the role of CMHC
becomes more the role of the banker, allowing the provincial and municipal jurisdictions to cope with the attendant
problems of planning and development.
I am very much aware that economic forces are making
it very difficult for the average person to pursue the great
Canadian dream of owning his own home. Again, it
becomes important to devise policies that provide
optimum opportunity for individuals, and that have the
effect of developing humanized urban areas where
individuals are not sacrificed in the name of efficiency,
and where man can truly pursue the good life.
Honourable senators, there is no doubt that we have too
many people who are poor; too many people who are
ill-housed; too many people who have inadequate training
skills to survive in a competitive economic system. It
becomes urgent, in the face of these realities, that we
pursue economic, social and educational programs that
will truly equalize opportunity for all people in all regions.
And it is important to remember that these programs will
be expensive, but not to pursue them, I suggest, will
endanger the integrity of Confederation.
At the present time, DREE, which has the responsibility
of coming to grips with the problems of disparity, is
attempting to decentralize. We must encourage this
attempt. We must commit ourselves as a people to the
costs that are involved, and, most important of all, we
must be prepared to pay the price in order that all regions
will be enabled to pursue their legitimate aspirations.
It seems that at this period in history, Canada, as a
nation, is facing fundamental options. On the one hand we
have areas that are prosperous because of size and geographical location, and areas that are prosperous because
they have rich resources; on the other hand, we have areas
that are struggling with the problems of disparity. If
Canada is to be great, then all must share their wealth in
order that each region may grow.

[Translation]
Hon. Michel Fournier (Restigouche-Gloucester): Honourable senators, it is with great apprehension and surely
with humility that I rise to make a few comments during
the debate on the Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne.
Having listened to so many honourable senators in this
house who have shown so much ability, knowledge and
know-how, I told myself that it would perhaps be advisable for me to listen rather than to speak. However, I
know that I can rely on your indulgence in making a few
comments. I will spare you a lengthy speech, because at
this time it is better to restrict myself to a few comments.
[English]
Madam Speaker, I can add very little to all the compliments and congratulations that you have received. All I
can say is that I agree with them, and that you deserve
every word of them. I know that when you were appointed
to your august position, everyone in New Brunswick was
really happy.
[Translation]
To the mover and the seconder of the Address in reply to
the Speech from the Throne, my congratulations for a job

well done. As for the mover, Senator Robichaud, he was
certainly not unknown to me nor to the people of New
Brunswick. I would also like to say that he is a real asset
to the Senate, and that his appointment is an honour for
the province he represents and bas so well represented as
premier in the past.
As for our colleague, Senator Riley, I can say that one
could not have chosen a better man for the area he has so
well represented in the past, in the provincial as well as in
the federal government.
The Speech from the Throne came to us this year at a
time when we had felt for a few months already a certain
disruption of the economy, and this across the world. The
oil crisis and the shortage of certain products could not
occur without affecting us in Canada as elsewhere
through the inflationary thrust resulting from it.
But, fortunately, with our abundance of resources, a
wise administration policy and a little good will on the
part of both the provinces and the central administration,
Canada is still the one country that will probably come off
in the best possible way.
This proves to us once again that if it is nearly impossible to give perfect homogeneity to a country the size of
ours with so many regional, economic, cultural and other
differences, the fact still remains that it is only because of
our present confederative system that we have managed
up to now and will manage in the future to keep one
strong and united Canada.
Those of us from the Atlantic area who were among the
first to join Confederation tend to ask ourselves at times if
we made a good deal. Relatively prosperous as provincial
entities before our entry into Confederation, enjoying
flourishing trade with the Indies and our Southern neighbours, it seems that everything crumbled after 1867. That
might not be the only reason for our economic downfall
but one thing is sure, even with the building of a railway
to the West Coast we could never afterwards overcome the
fact that centralization was detrimental to us in central
Canada. As a friend of mine said to me one day, after the
union of Upper and Lower Canada, it was as if a big churn
had been set up in central Canada, the spinning motion of
which brought all the cream to the centre leaving only the
whey at the ends.
This analogy might be somewhat exaggerated because
Confederation brought about some good things too and we
probably shall never wish to abandon it.
However, we are upset to see that after so many years
and all the efforts made to reduce regional disparities, the
results are not so obvious.
With the setting up of the Department of Regional
Economic Expansion in 1969, we hoped that the situation
would rapidly improve. Is it still too soon to see the good
results? I hope so.
However, I am sure that nature provided every country
and every part of the country with adequate resources to
meet the needs of these areas and their population. We
just have to find them and exploit them rationally.
Besides, all the economic studies demonstrate without
any doubt that we have, in the Atlantic provinces, a
combination of various and abundant natural resources.
Frankly, we should have no reason to lag behind the rest

SENATE DEBATES
of Canada if we could find the means to bring about the
necessary developments and to process part of these
resources at home instead of shipping them away as raw
materials.
I shall rely on a study that was made, for New Brunswick, by the Department of Economic Development whose
report was published in April of 1973. For the purposes of
this study, the province was divided into five separate
areas. I would like to talk briefly about the northeastern
part of the province, which is often described as the
have-not area.
According to the 1971 census figures, the population is
about 168,000. The natural resources are listed as agriculture, forests, peat, fisheries and mines.
As for agriculture, this analysis gives us nothing new
when we find that, among all our occupations, agriculture
has surely lost the most ground for a number of years.
Forestry has always been very important at home as
almost 85 per cent of the wooded lands of the Crown are
situated in this part of the northeast. As for most of our
other resources, we find that a little more intensive processing would insure the increase in value and additional
employment for about 2,000 skilled workers, not to mention an undetermined number of forest labourers, skilled
or not.
Located near the coasts of the Chaleur Bay and the Gulf
of St. Lawrence, this territory has always been a fishing
area. In fact, 65 per cent of fish caught in New Brunswick
come from the northeast of the province.
As for the peat moss industry, we know that most such
industries in New Brunwick are established in the
northeast.
The mining industry is our most recent industry, as we
really discovered it only at the end of the 50's.
Therefore, before closing my remarks, I will take the
liberty of saying a word on this industry which could have
a great influence on our economy, provided we can exploit
it in a judicious manner.
For the moment, I would like to say a word on agriculture, the oldest of all our industries, the one which in the
past has always been at the basis of our economy, in spite
of the fact it has slowed down these last years.
Is it not logical and natural to deal with it to some
extent when the Speech from the Throne itself seems to
attach so much importance to food products? As a matter
of fact, if we really want to avoid a food crisis, which
would be much more prejudicial than an energy crisis, it is
time to consider agriculture and land with due importance
and recognition.
Some time ago, our colleague Senator Michaud
described the situation of agriculture in his riding, which
was as well, I suggest, a good picture of the whole situation in the province.
This is demonstrated by statistics relating to agriculture. It is proved that between 1951 and 1971, our province
suffered, in proportion, the most important decrease of the
number of farms in Canada, which is a 4/5 reduction, as
well as a 2/3 reduction in acreage for the same period. One
can easily realize what this means as far as social reform
of any kind is concerned. The main reasons for the high
[Hon. Mr. Fournier (Restigouche-Gloucester).]

March 19, 1974

rate of unemployment of the last f ew years are undoubtedly farm abandonment and migration to cities.
It is high time we find out the reason for this state of
affairs and its remedies, for we cannot neglect what
should be our main industry without paying for it. Perhaps this should be the subject of an in-depth study to be
made by the Senate Committee on Agriculture established
some time ago.
Our first trip through Kent county last spring convinced
us of one thing, that several of our agricultural policies
such as the Small Farm Assistance Program, for instance,
in their present form, were not in the least functional in
this region without some major amendments.
With all the good abandoned land which we have, a
lively market and better prices, I think it would be easy,
with the required encouragements and well-adapted
agricultural policies, to restore agriculture in New
Brunswick.
At the moment it seems that many young people have a
desire to go back to farming. All we need is see to it that
agriculture provides them with a living.
* (2150)

[English]
Signs of mineralization in northern New Brunswick had
been known for some past generations, but it was only in
the late fifties that a major ore body was discovered near
Bathurst. Prospecting and drilling in the following months
by a number of individuals and mining companies did give
the assurance that the many ore bodies discovered thereafter in the Bathurst-Newcastle area made up what was
probably one of the richest and largest ore deposits in
Canada. Mining companies, nevertheless, wanted to keep
those mines idle and in reserve for future use, apparently.
In 1960, a new government came to power in New Brunswick with none other than our new senator from New
Brunswick, Louis Robichaud, as premier. It was then that
things started to move in the province. Mining companies
were told politely but in no uncertain terms that either
they would have to open some of those mines or sell out
and abandon their franchise. Not too long after, plans
were made for the construction of a large concentrator at
Brunswick Mines near Bathurst, and a government financial guarantee was given for the building of a lead and
zinc smelter at Belledune Point, where accommodation
could be made for a year-round deep water harbour.
From then on, the future of mining in northeastern New
Brunswick was looking very bright, with good chances for
expansion, until things started to deteriorate around 197072. With our present market and better metal price, we
should have some improvement.
The first thing that we ought to expect, now that the
first smelter has been converted for lead only, is a new
zinc smelter. It is absolutely unthinkable that all our zinc
should be shipped outside the country in the form of
concentrate when there is enough of it, and more, for the
operation of a smelter. When we know that Canada is the
largest zinc producer in the world, and New Brunswick is
the third largest producer in Canada, we should not tolerate that situation much longer, especially when in the
beginning some government help was given for the refining of some zinc as well as lead.

March 19, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

Another factor that should stimulate the building of a
zinc smelter is that the United States smelting capacity,
which was 1.3 million tons per annum some years ago, will
drop to about half that amount by 1975-76, and surely
Canada, being the largest producer, can operate with some
strength in the market.
Another important thing for the area would be the early
completion of the harbour at Belledune. According to the
recent report on transportation, made for the Government
of Canada and the Government of New Brunswick, the
port of Belledune is the only port in northern New Brunswick that could have enough water to handle large bulk
cargo vessels, anywhere from 26,000 to 80,000 tons, without
the use of an icebreaker. The report does recommend,
however, that the port should have a tugboat in order to
save bringing one from Halifax.
The original plans for that harbour, made in 1965, were
for expenditures of around $18 million to $19 million. Less
than one-third of that amount was spent. Even at that,
without any dredging at all, there is 38 f eet of water at low
tide, which makes Belledune one of the deepest ports in
Canada among the harbours listed by the National Harbours Board.
Every Canadian should be glad to see our Western
provinces taking their rightful place on the Canadian
scene, due to the development of their resources and the
help of proper national policies. There is every indication
that the extraction of oil from the tar sands, the building
of pipelines and the advent of petrochemical industries,
will have a tremendously beneficial effect on the economy
of the Western provinces.
Let us hope that Atlantic Canada will also have its oil
some day, and some of the major projects we have been
dreaming about for so long, like the huge hydro development from the tides of the Bay of Fundy, the Prince
Edward Island Causeway and the Chignecto Canal. It
would be so nice if our provinces by the sea could also
become a little more prosperous in their economy and take
their proper place in a greater Canada.
Honourable senators, if I can make a wish in closing, it
is that our central agencies will make a real effort to solve
some of our major transportation problems, which are
probably the biggest drawback to a better growth. I have a
feeling that this is also the wish of all Maritimers and all
well-wishing Canadians.
On motion of Senator Grosart, debate adjourned.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY ADOPTED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of
His Excellency the Governor General's Speech at the
opening of the session, and the motion of Senator Robichaud, seconded by Senator Perrault, for an Address in
reply thereto.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators, on this last
permitted day for debating the motion for an Address in
reply to the Speech of His Excellency the Governor General, perhaps I may be excused if I limit the usual introductory remarks to saying quite simply that I fully associate
myself with all the compliments that have been paid to
those who guide our destiny here in this chamber and
outside.
This applies, of course, to His Excellency the new Governor General, to Her Honour the Speaker, to the Leader
of the Government, his deputy and his Whip, and to the

Leader of the Opposition, his deputy and his Whip. I
associate my thanks with those already expressed, and
which I feel may not be expressed often enough, to those
who serve us so well on the large and substantial staff of
the Senate amounting to some 400 persons. They serve us
well under the guidance of the Clerk of the Parliaments,
the Black Rod and their deputies and associates.
Perhaps I may be permitted to make two specific references which I hope will be understood by all honourable
senators. The first of these is to our official reporters. I
don't know what the experience of other senators has
been, but mine bas been that their expertise in the language I try to speak and their skill in interpreting that
language almost invariably make the comments I make
here read much better than I am sure they sound to
honourable senators who are unfortunate enough to be in
the chamber when I speak.

a

(1410)

My particular compliment, which I hope and am sure
will be taken in a very non-partisan way, is to Senator
Flynn, the Leader of the Opposition. I say "in a non-partisan way" because I believe one of the most important
things that happens in this Senate is that we have evidence every day, day by day, that there is in this chamber
a real Opposition. I am sure honourable senators would
agree that most of the credit for that goes to his skill, his
experience in debate, and his dedication to the interests of
the Senate. As long as he is here and as long as we in this
group are on this side, the Senate can be assured that there
will be an alert, informed, alive and kicking Opposition,
kicking, of course, on the many occasions when kicking
seems appropriate and necessary under the circumstances
which we face here.
Like other senators, of course, I listened with great
attention to the Speech from the Throne and since then
have read it and might even go so far as to say have
studied it. I congratulate Senator Robichaud and Senator
Perrault, the mover and the seconder, for carrying this off
so well in what must have been a very difficult situation
for them, to move that we thank, in effect, those who
prepared that Speech for preparing it, because I am quite
sure that many of the inherent problems that the contents
raised to even a casual reader were apparent to their very
alert minds. I found much in the Speech from the Throne
to be disappointing, largely in the matter of the remedies
to the problems that face Canada today that did not
appear there. On the other hand, I found at least one
aspect and an important aspect of the Speech from the
Throne very encouraging. I refer, of course, as a member
of the former Senate Special Committee on Science Policy,
to the references in the Speech to what appears to be a
new approach by the Government of Canada to science
policy, taken in conjunction with some unique documents
which accompanied it, to which I shall refer shortly.

SENATE DEBATES
It is perhaps not too much to say that at long last the
Government of Canada-and I use the term in the historical sense-has realized that science and technology as
they reflect on national science policy are the key to our
economic and social future in Canada. I may be going
further in saying this than Senator Lamontagne, the
chairman of the committee, would approve. It is true that
all the recommendations of those three large volumes have
not yet been implemented by the government. On the
other hand, I am most encouraged by the statement in the
Speech from the Throne, and particularly the additional
statements that we have in what I have called "some
unique documents."
Two paragraphs from the Speech itself are, I think,
worth reading. The first is:
The development and use of technology is also
essential to the government's approach to increasing
national economic production. Steps will be taken to
obtain greater returns from industrial research and
development as well as technological innovation in
Canada.
That might almost be taken word for word from the
reports of our Senate committee. The second paragraph
reads:
Scientific knowledge and its application is a keystone to meeting the challenges facing Canada, including those in the areas of food, energy or industrial
development. The objective of the government's
science policy is the rational generation and acquisition of scientific knowledge and the planned use of
science and technology in support of national goals.
The Ministry of State for Science and Technology will
be developing national science objectives as a basis
for exercising enhanced advisory and co-ordinating
authority within the government.
Here again I say that those words could almost be taken
verbatim from our reports. The additional documents go
even further. They are issued by the Ministry of Science
and Technology under the headings "Throne Speech 1974,
MOSST Information Kit"; "Throne Speech, Science Policy
Announcements" and "Statements by Madam Jeanne
Sauvé, the Minister of State for Science and Technology."
I said it was a unique addition to the Speech from the
Throne. As far as I can remember, I do not think any
department of government has ever issued simultaneously
this kind of statement, which seems to me to pin the
government down to regarding these broad statements as
something more than generalities, because in these ancillary documents there is a real pinning down of the government, and we must all hope that in the next year we will
see a full implementation of some of these matters.
I might say that in these documents reference is made
six or seven times to recommendations of the Senate
Special Committee on Science Policy. Most significant
perhaps, is a general statement of policy by the minister,
which reads, in part, as follows:
The Senate Special Committee on Science Policy
has completed a very major study of the whole subject, and in addition, there have been other valuable
studies such as that made by the OECD.
[Hon. Mr. Grosart.]

March 20, 1974

The government has given serious consideration to
these studies and has reached the conclusion that
sufficient evidence has been brought forward to justify a number of important decisions.
I underline that because I believe some senators wondered
if we in that committee were not spending too long taking
evidence. We now have the statement from the minister
that there is now, at long last, "sufficient evidence" for the
government to take a number of important decisions.
After discussing the reorganization of some of the organizations, the statement goes on:
Events are however moving fast and the requirements of the nation call for new policies in science
and technology as in other fields. The powerful
capabilities of Canadian federal science agencies need
to be redirected towards new goals and their organizational structure must adjust to new circumstances.
Again I point out to honourable senators that this is
exactly what our committee has been saying in volumes 1,
2 and 3 over the violent protests of some of those who do
not like to see existing organizations reorganized as we
are now told they are going to be reorganized very much
along the lines of the recommendation of Senator Lamontagne's committee. The statement goes on:
... the Ministry is to have a strengthened role. Its
advice will increasingly be taken into account by
Cabinet in relation to new science oriented policies
many of which will originate in the operating departmentsAgain, good things when the Minister of Science and
Technology can tell us that her advice will be taken into
account by the government.
Again, honourable senators will promptly remember
that when we made the recommendation that there should
be a Ministry of Science Policy, we were told on all sides
that the members of the Cabinet, exercising their responsibilities in their own departments, would not listen. We
now have it before us that the Cabinet is going to listen. I
am sure that from time to time we will be able to ask the
Leader of the Government, who is a member of the Cabinet, how well they are listening and whether they are
doing more than listening.
0 (1420)
Hon. Mr. Flynn: They are very flexible.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Yes. Perhaps one demurrer-and it is
not a great one-in respect of the science policy announcements, is the funding of the Medical Research Council. I
think there has been an oversight in this respect. I am
perhaps being too generous in calling it an oversight, but
there is some evidence that the government bas just made
a mistake in this area and is prepared to remedy it very
quickly. The situation is this: The Medical Research Council, which operates to a great extent as an independent
council, having been spun off from the National Research
Council many years ago, bas been starved to a considerable extent during the last few years. "Starved" may be
too strong a word, but the fact of the matter is that the
funding of the very important work of the Medical
Research Council bas for several years been on a declining
plateau in terms of real dollars. The government, I think,
has recognized this, because in the main estimates for the

March 20,1974

March 20, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES

fiscal year ending March 31, 1975, some $39,600,000 is provided for the Medical Research Council, and we now find
that the goverfiment has rushed in an additional $1 million
in the supplementary estimates (B) for the current year,
1973-74. 1 say "rushed in," because in describing that
expenditure the minister said he "scraped the bottom of
the barrel" of the estimates of the Department of National
Health and Welf are to get that extra million.
The matter has been the subject of a committee meeting
of the Health, Welf are and Social Affairs Committee of
the other place. Considerable evidence was taken, which
made it clear that any continuation of this inadequate
funding of the Medical Research Council could be a major
Canadian tragedy, because it is in this very area of medical research that Canadian scientists have perhaps distinguished themselves more than in any other area.
The rule of thumb as to what Canadian science, as a
whole, might add to the total stock of scientific and technological knowledge in the world is about 2 per cent, and
that is optimistic. But we have pretty conclusive evidence
that in the f ield of medical research the Canadian contribution to the world knowledge is 4, 5, perhaps even 6 per
cent. Yet it is in this area that we find, flot an actual
reduction in dollars but certainly a reduction in spending
power for this year, last year, and the year before, over
previous years.
I bring this to the attention of the Senate because I arn
quite sure that ail senators who have influence will urge
the goverfiment to remedy this, flot next year but this
year. And in at least one statement made by the minister
there is some indication that he may be prepared to do so.
Coming back to the Speech itself, there are various
criteria that could be applied to judge its effectiveness. It
is important that we judge its effectiveness, of course,
because it concerns the whole future of Canada. We have
to ask ourselves whether the activities, the action, the
legislation predicted or projected in the Speech from the
Throne will achieve the solution of any or ail of the major
problems facing Canada today. One way of looking at it,
which is the one I have taken, is to go back to the Speech
from the Throne, as was suggested by the Leader of the
Opposition in his excellent speech, to see what the goverfiment said it would achieve in the speech that we heard
here on January 4, 1973, and what the resuit was. When it
presented its policy to us at the beginning of iast year, the
goverfiment said it had four main objectives: a decline in
the number of unemployed, a realization of the economic
potential of the country, attaining reasonable price stability, and distributing the benefits of the growth of the
economy regionaily. I suggest that the track record in that
respect is something of a guide to what we might expect to
be the track record of the Speech from the Throne this
year.
We have now seen that generally there were some very
significant shortfalls in those objectives last year. Lt is
true, as the Leader of the Government and others pointed
out, that there was a decline in the percentage of unemnpioyment during the year. However, the evidence we now
have-and Senator Forsey will be interested in this-is
that in terms of people unemployed, there has been an
increase in the iast month. Surely the problem of unemployment is one of people, flot of percentages. In the last

27601-9

month, for example, the increase in unemployed is 10,00010,000 more Canadians unemployed in February than in
January.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Is that seasonally adjusted?
Hon. Mr'. Grosart: No.
Hon. Mr'. Flynn: Forcibly adjusted.
Hon. Mr'. Grosart: I would point out to Senator Forsey
that there is no way known of seasonally adjusting bodies.
You can only seasonally adjust percentages. People out of
work are flot seasonally adjusted; they are out of work,
without jobs; they are flot in any way concerned about
whether the percentage is seasonally adjusted or flot. I
stress this point because it happens to be one of those
shelters behind which those using these kinds of statistics
to support their own principle-as I arn using my kind of
statistics to support mine-hide.
This, of course, supports the statement made by Senator
Flynn to which Senator Forsey took objection, which is
why I directed that remark to him. Senator Flynn said
that unemployment is worsening. In particular, it is worsening when more people are out of work in the f irst month
of the year. Ail the predictions we have, to some of which I
wili refer in a moment, are that there will be an increase
in the percentage of unemployment this year. I have seen
no predictions which indicate that the figure this year wili
not be over 6 per cent. As part of that picture, of course,
we have the great unemployment insurance fiasco of the
year.
Again I do flot want to place too much emphasis on
Senator Forsey's speech, but I sit close to him and hear
what he has to say. Sometimes he sends shivers down my
back. However, it is flot my intention to send any shivers
up his front at this time. He was asking whether there was
anything the goverfiment did last year that couid be called
socialistic. I do flot want to get into the definition of
"socialistic." I do flot care whether it is liberaiism of the
Manchester school, Cobden, Bright, Gladstone, Asquith, or
Mackenzie King. Lt does flot bother me what kind of
liberalism it is, and I amrnfot particularly interested in
trying to define socialism, except I do know that socialists
tell me the core of socialism is the concept of more and
more state control.
We all remember the Regina Manifesto, which at one
time was the bible of Canadian socialism. A CCF government was going to take over ail the means of the production of wealth. When somebody pointed out that this
would mean taking over ail the farms, they changed that.
But the basic philosophy has flot changed. It seems to me
that if somebody is iooking for signs of socialism in the
acts and policies of the present goverfiment, ail they have
to know is that this government says, "We are against
wage and price controls, but we are ail in f avour of
controlling who plays football in Canada." Could there be
any greater or more nonsensical extension of the concept
of state control than for the state to say it will decide who
is going to play football here?
e (1430)

Hon. Mr'. Phillips: Lt is very inflationary.
Hon. Mr'. Grosart: I was going to say that is just the
answer, because if Liberal policy runs ail the way from

SENATE DEBATES
fiscal and monetary control through ail the intermediate
activities of Canadians, to who can play football, I think I
can say that is socialisrn.
The unemployrnent insurance fiasco is a perfect example of Senator O'Leary's excellent phrase, that you could
sum up the Speech from the Throne by saying it "deals
almost entirely with the consequences but flot with the
causes' of our problerns. 0f course, there is no better
example than the decision taken-taken just before an
election, but that may have been accidental-to 50
increase the benefits of unemployment insurance that the
fund went "broke" for $1 billion against the actuarial
level. I made that statement before, and it has been questioned, but I tbink the record of at least one of our
commîttees will indicate that in certain arîthrnetical terms
the minister accepted it, flot as a fair statement but as an
accurate one.
What happened? There was unemployrnent, obviously
caused by poor econornic management by the governrnent.
lBy the way, the phrase that is used in the Speech frorn the
Throne is that the governrnent asserts that ît is they who
control the econornic management of our destiny. So we
bad unemployment, massive unemployrnent. No cure is
offered but the way to deal wîtb the consequences, and
that is to pay out buge sums whîch in tbemselves bave
become a dis incentive to work.
There is evidence in every day's paper that these
extraordinary benefits under the increases in the unemployment terms bave becorne a dîsincentive to work. Only
yesterday in the paper, a leadîng industrialîst in the West
made the plea-and it is on the front page of the Toronto
papers, at least-that we ship the unemployed from the
East out there because, be said, the West has jobs for
tbem. The unemployed ask, "Why sbould we go as long as
we can get this kind of weekly payment under the unern
ployment insurance?"
The Speech from the Throne says that this will be
looked at, "in the light of the experience of the last few
years." 0f course, the goverfiment is going to look at its
own experience, and we can only trust that it will corne up
witb some better answers than it bas bad in the past to the
problem of unemployment.
I mention these tbings because, to me, tbey indicate a
sbortfall in the bigb expectations we were given as to the
possible results of government policy as announced in
January 1973.
Hon. Mr. Everett: May I ask the bonourable senator a
question? The Conservative Party bas just bad a convention, wbich I believe was a policy convention. Does the
bonourable senator know wbetber they established any

Hon. Mr. Flynn: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Gosart: I will flot attempt to answer the
question in detail, but I think I can in principle. Just what
happened at that convention, which was a fantastically
successful conventionSorne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr'. Grosart: I arn glad Senator Everett mentioned
it, because it was such a go-go event. In fact, there were so
many young people there that I was flot able to get into
some of the policy sessions, one of which was, indeed, on
unemployment insurance. But I can answer Senator Everett by saying-and I arn not really speaking here as a
Conservative, but just as a senator sitting in this groupthat it is declared Conservative policy to have a public
inquiry into the whole question of unemployment insurance; and the Leader of the Opposition in the other place,
as well as others, have been urging this for months-so far
without success.
Somne Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: As honourable senators know, I arn
always anxious to answer any questions or reply to any
interruptions, but when there are fîve at once I do not
catch them. If anybody will ask me to sit down whîle he
makes bis point, I will gladly do so.
Now, I say that there is plenty of evidence that the
expectation is that unernployment will be up next year.
One bit of evidence which îs most typical, I can assure
bonourable senators, is the Business Review of the Bank of
Montreal for February 1974, whicb states that:
In 1974, the monetary authorities will once agaian be
facing the inflation-unemployment dîlemma. As mentioned, we expect no let-up in inflation. At the same
time, with some slowdown expected in real activity mn
Canada, the unernployment rate is likely to rise.
That is one of the predictions there. I could mention
other polîcies of the government which have certainly flot
done much to solve the unemployment problem, but honourable senators are, I believe, well aware of rnost of them.
The third goal that was set, and agaîn I arn speakîng of a
year ago, was that we should realîze our economic potential. Agaîn, Senator Flynn rnentioned thîs in bis speech.
The potential in economic terms is somewhat difficult to
speak on in a general debate, but it is the measure of the
efficient management or efficient operation of the economy. That is a concept whîch was introduced a few years
ago by the Economic Councîl. Since then it bas had some
revîsions, but it is substantially a sound way of looking at
the performance of the econorny.
The real problem here is productivîty, speaking of
potential, and even the Econornic Council and other econornists seem to have made the mistake in the past of
assumîng that the main iniput was employment numbers.
Well, the main iniput still is employrnent, but it is flot
necessarily the numbers of employed, as we have just
recently discovered. Lt is the quality of the labour force. It
j ust does flot answer the problem of the economy's attaînîng its potential merely to say that we have added people
to the labour force. For example, an addition of 300
unskilled people to the labour force, or women temporarily
ernployed or very young people, will not have the produc-

March 20, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

tivity effect of 100 skilled workers. By that I do not mean
skilled necessarily in any narrow sense, but merely people

who have had the experience of working, who have been
working for five to ten years.
This has been one of the errors which the government
has clearly fallen into in not guiding the economy as close
to its potential last year as it should have come.
The general estimate of the shortfall is about $2 billion,
which is something like 2 per cent and which naturally

makes a significant difference in the unemployment
situation.

•

(1440)

The suggestions that the government makes to catch us
up to this potential, particularly on the supply side, are
enumerated in the Speech from the Throne. Senator
Carter, I think, referred to them as "comprehensive and
far-sighted." I am sorry, but I did not find them so,
because, as I read them, I did not find a single one that has
not been in effect for years.
These are the "positive steps" the government is going
to take-let me run over them quickly:
-guaranteed loans and other forms of assistance to
both farmers and fishermen to assist them in purchasing or modernizing their equipment;
-amendments to the Export and Import Permits Act
to provide the Government with better means to
stabilize the Canadian market;
-improving
the availability of manpower for food
production;
-assistance
in the construction of new storage
facilities;
-research to make it possible to increase production,
improve quality, and lower costs;
-improvements
in harbour facilities for fishing
fleets;
-incentives to increase Canada's catch of unexploited
stocks of fish;
-advance payments on crops to assure producers of
timely cash receipts;
-an
agricultural stabilization plan to encourage
rational production decisions;I think we have had an agricultural stabilization plan
for years.
-assistance to young farmers to provide sufficient
financial incentives for them to establish themselves in farming;
-better veterinary training facilities;
-a prairie grain market insurance plan;
-improvements in Canadian grain rail transportation
capabilities;
-increased
availability of reasonably priced feed
grains;
-incentives to increase the production of livestock
necessary to provide for Canadian and export
markets.
And so on.

Well, if those are new positive steps, then I have not
read what has been going on in the Canadian economy in

27601-9

the last fifty years. Senator Carter is right, they are
far-sighted-but the sighting is a long, long way back!
There is not a single new thing in all those steps that I can
f ind.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It was written by the Prime Minister

himself, and he is finding out things.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Perhaps we should move on to
another of these "great steps," and that is price stability.
Well, of course, the government now says we cannot have
it because of external forces, and that these are forcing our
prices up. The fact of the matter is that almost any analy-

sis will indicate that the effect of external prices cannot
be any more than 40 per cent, and even that is rather high.
It is probably less, but then, of course, we have the evidence of no less an authority than the OECD, which has
stated categorically that the rate of domestic inflation in
Canada is rising higher than external inflation as it
applies to Canada. This appeared, incidentally, in the
original report, the December report. As honourable senators may know, the practice of the OECD commissioners is
to draw up their original draft and call Canadians over to
Paris and ask, "Are we being too hard on you?" And there
were some modifications made.
Paris is a good place for Canadians to persuade the
OECD examiners to make some changes; but in the original draft, at least-and I am not sure if it carried through
to the February draft-they made it clear that this was the
situation. They also made some other recommendations,
which I will refer to in a moment.
In this connection, of course, when we think of the
calendar we always have to circle 1970, which was the year
the Prime Minister said, "Inflation is licked!"
I said to Senator Forsey that I would give him some
additional comfort in my general suggestion that Senator
Flynn was right when he said that the unemployment
situation was worsening. I know of his love for Newfoundland, and it is with the greatest regret that I have to tell
him that from February to February unemployment in
Newfoundland increased 3.3 per cent to 15.6 per cent,
seasonally adjusted, and 20 per cent, unseasonally adjusted. That is this February.

Hon. Mr. Buckwold: Is that because of the Tory government in Newfoundland?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Unemployment is the responsibility of
the federal government.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: No, no. It is an excellent question,
which of course, could be applied to some other provinces,
and this would open up quite a debate, which I would be
delighted to get into some time, but not now.
I have complained about the generalities in the Throne
Speech. These are the kinds of phrases we read all through
this Speech from the Throne: there are going to be
"increasingly vigorous steps"; there are going to be "positive steps"; there is going to be "economic management";
there is going to be "provision of adequate shelter."
Does anybody really believe that last assertion? All the
evidence is that if there is one thing that will be going
down next year it will be housing.
They say they are going to encourage exploration. Well,
we shall see. Above all, they say, there is going to be a

SENATE DEBATES
re-adjustment of existing programs-and we can all hope
that that is so.
There are some specifics, of course. There is a definite
statement that this government is going to bring an end to
any discrimination in freight rates-to "any"; that is the
word that is used. Is there anybody here or in Canada,
generally, who believes that for one minute-that within
this year there will be an end to any discrimination in
freight rates? I do not know why they make these statements, but that is what they have asked us to believe.
There is going to be an amendment to an act to encourage competition. I have my doubts about that. I think that
any amendments we are likely to have will be to stifle
competition, and certainly to stifle growth of the critical
mass in Canadian industry, which is so essential if some
of these objectives in science policy are to be attained.
One may ask, "Have you any positive suggestions?" The
answer is, "Yes." I suggest that there be some further tax
cuts. I am sorry to refer to Senator Forsey so often, but I
hope he will take it as a compliment that I read and
digested, even if I disagreed with, his speech. He gave us a
long polemic on this about the terrible evils of corporate
profits. Terrible things, they were. But then, of course, he
forgot Bill C-192, which we had not long ago, when the
Liberal government made a very substantial cut in corporate taxes, which was widely hailed across this country.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: You want more.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Senator Forsey, you could not have
said it better. The statement you make is exactly true: we
want more, and I think I speak for all Canadians when I
say we want more tax cuts in this country.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Corporate tax cuts. You want more.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: We want more corporate tax cuts, and
I am delighted that Senator Forsey raised that, because I
can nowHon. Mr. Flynn: He still remembers the time he was in
the CCF.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: -refer to a clear statement of Liberal
philosophy in regard to corporate tax cuts. I think it is
Liberal philosophy. Here is the statement, and this, by the
w,ay, was the Minister of Finance, Mr. Thrner, speaking on
June 19, 1973. He was talking about corporate tax cuts. He
said:
Mr. Speaker, the basic objectives of the measures
before the House for its consideration this afternoon
are twofold: they are to protect the millions of jobs
that today depend directly and indirectly on maintaining the international competitiveness of our vitally important manufacturing and processing industries, and to promote the development of many
hundreds of thousands of new jobs for our rapidly
growing labour force in the years that lie ahead.
That is the official Liberal philosophy for the reduction
of corporate taxes, and again I repeat, in chorus with
Senator Forsey, "We want more!"
* (1450)

Hon. Mr. Forsey: Greed!
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Since when?
[Hon. Mr. Grosart.]

March 20, 1974

Hon. Mr. Grosart: If it were not that I dislike taking up
the time of the house, I could read what I have in my hand,
which happens to be the latest 10-year statement of a
Canadian company. It is not selective. It is quite incidental that this particular statement happened to be the one I
had on my desk this morning and which came in the mail
from Northern Electric. Its net earning in 1973 was the
"enormous" sum of $32 million. Before that they paid $30
million in taxes. This was a very great increase; it was an
increase from $20 million the year before. It represents a
50 per cent increase-a fabulous increase.
Let us go back and see whether that was justified. Let
us take the earnings per dollar-sale in this year, this year
of high earnings and high profits. It works out at 5.2 cents
per sales dollar. The year before it was 3.8 cents per dollar.
The year before that again it was 2.2; the year before that
0.7; the year before that again, 2.3; the year before that
again, 2.2; the year before that again, 0.6; the year before
that again, 2.5; the year before that again, 2.4; and, finally,
the year before that it was 3 cents. And of this year's
earnings less than 20 per cent was paid out in dividends.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Will the honourable senator permit a
question? What was the return on capital investment? I
think that is the more usual way to expressing the degree
of profit.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I doubt if it is the more usual way,
and I most certainly doubt whether it is more valid. That
could lead to a long argument, but certainly a fairer
measure of judgment of the validity of profits is how
many cents you keep out of your dollar sale. Is 5 per cent
excessive? One year in ten this company bas hit 5 per cent.
I think I am correct in that. The other is a different
measure and it is one that is not very easy to support, for
the simple reason that the capital invested in any corporation is not a static thing; it includes retained earnings
which are retained for the very purposes, of course, that
Mr. Turner explained so well.
However, I should like to get on with my statement,
although, of course, I have absolutely no objection to
questions.
The second recommendation we would put before the
house is that concerning temporary controls. The government, as I said, is prepared to control who shall play
football, but it is not prepared to control the economy,
despite the fact that the OECD, again, clearly and in
implicit terms recommended that this is the course
Canada should take. I hope that honourable senators will
take my word for it that that is so. I have the statement
here. The OECD, looking at our whole position, has criticized Canada and was very critical of our handling of the
economy in some respects, and came up with the strong
recommendation that we now need price and wage controls on much the same basis as has been suggested by the
Official Opposition.
I would also think that a very careful look should be
taken at the possibility of further indexing.
Hon. Mr. Everett: Will the honourable senator permit a
question? I am just wondering on what basis the Official
Opposition suggested these wage and price controls. As I
recall it, they were suggesting that there should be a
freeze for 90 days and during that time they would pro-

March 20,1974

March 20. 1974

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES

duce a comprehensive wage and price control poiicy. I
think I am correct in saying that that was over 400 days
ago, and I was wondering how they are getting along with
that comprehensive poiicy.

Hon. Mr. Grosart: I think I would answer that by
saying, flot quite as well as the present goverfimeft,
because we have been told by the Leader of the Government that it has had such a policy on the sheif ready for
immediate actioni at any time. I think Senator Everett
would agree that he has misrepreseflted, flot purposely, of
course, the position, because the Conservative Party has
neyer saîd it would have this 90-day freeze and then come
up with a comprehensive incomes policy. What it did say
was-and Senator Forsey had some f un with this because
he seemed to think that our 90 days of indecision would be
flot much worse than the famous Liberal 60 days of indecision-that it would impose temporary controls and see
how they work, and would work on the pragmatic basis of
going step by step, which, as Senator Everett will recail,
was one of the suggestions quite of ten made to us in the
National Finance Committee by the experts who appeared
bef ore us.
We, in the committee, did flot say that we were unalterably opposed to wage and price controls. We said that in
certain circumstances they might make sense, but there
were certain warnings and I agree witb those warnings. I
stili agree with the report of the committee as appiied to
the situation existing in 1971. But those were easy times,
in terms of inflation and unemployment, compared to
wbat we are faced with now. I arn sure that if we called all
those experts before us today we would get some very,
very different advice from tbem and that our report would
be very different from what it was. That, of course, is my
own vîew.
I would also recommend that the government accept
immediately the Conservative suggestion of a public

inquiry-not a witch-hunt, a public inquiry-into the
Unempioyment Insurance Fund, to see if it is flot possible
to get it back on the basîs of operating as an insurance
as
fund and flot a welfare fund. I remember the objections
made by the Leader of the Government on that dreadfui
day 15 years ago wben for the first time the unemployment fund seemed to be runnîng over its actuariai basis. I
amn sure you will ail remember bis eloquent condemnation
of the situation. It was when the Honourable Michael
Starr was minister, and this was wben it looked as tbough
the Unemployment Insurance Fund would not carry on on
an actuarial insurance basis. This was a dreadful tbing.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I remember that very well.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Yes, and since then the fund in actual
cash terms had a defîcit the year before last of $450
million, this year a deficit of $510 million, and the Lord
knows what it wili be next year if the predictions of
încreased unempînyment are correct.
Honourabie senators, I thank you for listening to me for
so long. I hope you wili forgive me, but it is the first
speech I have made in the Senate for some time, and I
have just been trying to make up for iost tîme.
Hon. Donald Smnith: Honourable senators, the vîgour of
the speech by Senator Grosart we have just lîstened to
indicates that he bas indeed fuily recovered bis old form,

and we are ail glad to see hlm in such fine fettie at the
beginning of a new session. He is one of our hardest
workers in the Senate, and we on this side admire bim as
much as do bis colleagues on the other sîde.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Srnith: Some one behind me says, "Even
more," but I do flot think that is fair. I sincerely believe
that he is one of the best members of the Senate. He has so
much background knowledge which he brings to bear on
our probiems and has made outstanding contributions to
some of the special work that goes on here. I hope he will
neyer again lose his vigour, even though he indulges in a
littie semi-partisan outburst from time to time, because we
enjoy those and he does flot make any bad friends by it.
* (1500)

I would like to foilow Senator Grosart's iead when, in
effect, he suggested that perhaps we are becoming a littie
weary of continued references to certain prominent
individuals. I hope I shall fot be so brief as to omit
compietely any reference to Madam Speaker. I wish to
indicate that I was rather aiarmed wben, during the
recess, someone sent to me a clipping of a columnist which
indicated that, because of the passage of time, the time
would soon come when *Madam Speaker would wish to
take a certain action which would involve ber vacating the
Chair, to the great detriment of this body. I wish to say to
her, honourable senators, that I do flot believe that we
should consider those years, and I hope she does not
consider them. When I thought about this coiumn, 1 was
reminded of the words of a television commercial with
which perhaps some of you are not as familiar as I.
However, it is one I aiways enjoy, being at that ripe old
age myseif. Her Honour is "flot getting older; she is getting
better ail the time!"
I do not often take the opportunity of speaking in a
formai debate such as this. I wish to take advantage of thîs
opportunity to say quite simply and sincerely that the
mover and seconder of the Address both showed that they
were indeed seasoned debaters. They both showed their
skill as weli as a wealtb of knowledge of the parliamentary process. We especiaiiy welcome people sucb as these
among us.
I wisb to say witb reference to some of those wbo have
been appointed to this chamber in recent years-I felt like
saying this on other occasions, but the appropriate occasion
did flot seem, to arîse-that for somne years this chamber's
function bas been enhanced by the appointment of gifted
men and women of severai age groups and from ail walks
of life. Their presence here augurs weii for the continuing
process of tbe best kind of Senate reform. It also reminds
some of us who are senior members that when our decision
to retire is made, for some of us in a relatively short tirne,
we will be leaving the Senate in much better bands.
I hope I will be pardoned by those wbo bave been
appointed in recent years and who possess the superior
qualities required in today's pariiamentary process, if I
especially welcome to the Senate my former colleague of
25 years in the House of Commons in the person, of course,
of the Honourabie Daniel Riley, wbo is going to prove to
be a fine member of this body.

SENATE DEBATES
I do not know if it is a rise to prominence of Nova
Scotians or not, but during the short period since the
beginning of this session three Nova Scotians have spoken
before me in this debate. When they had spoken, I sat back
and wondered, "What are we all speaking for now, unless
there is an election campaign in Nova Scotia?" But I
searched through Hansard and could not find any references to such an election campaign, so perhaps this is an
indication of the best form of speech to make in this
chamber. We always learn something from our new colleague, Senator Norrie, who for many years has been
dedicated to the cause of agriculture and to making it
possible to retain sufficient good land so that future generations may grow sufficient food. We have noted from
time to time her deep interest in the problems of people,
and there is no better calling than to respond to that need
and to endeavour to do what one can for others. She is
interested in the young, as is evidenced by her work at
Mount Allison University of some years ago.
Senator Graham is new here, and we always expect him
to refer to the industrial development of Cape Breton or
the production of power, and he is well qualified to speak
on those subjects. He also is a Nova Scotian who is the
right man in the right place.
I may have these Nova Scotians in the wrong order, but
for good reason.
I am sorry that Senator Blois is not in his seat now-and
I assure the other Nova Scotians that I do not intend to
attack in any way my good friend Senator Blois, who is a
friend of us all. He is my only source of information as to
what Senator John M. Macdonald is doing these days, and
if he has found out he is only able to give evasive answers,
but I have my private suspicions.
I was really sorry that Senator Blois could not find
something to refer to in the Speech from the Throne itself.
He seemed to regard it in more negative tones than did my
friend Senator Grosart. I hope he reads my speech-he and
I are good friends and he may do so as a friendly act.
However, I wish to refer you, and anyone else interested,
to page 3 of the Debates of the Senate, which contains the
Speech from the Throne. I counted fifteen items which
refer to the policies which will be changed in order to
provide farmers and fishermen with incentives to produce
more food. Thirteen of those fifteen relate to that great
area in which Senator Blois and Senator Norrie reside. I
suppose that every day they have in their minds, as I have,
a picture of those beautiful green pasture lands where the
cattle graze along the side of the railroad, which I used to
travel on many years ago and until this modern age of air
travel ruined many of the simple pleasures we used to get
out of life. There are therefore two items left of the
fifteen. They refer to fisheries, and I would now like to

turn to those two items, which appear midway down the
left-hand column on page 3. One is, "incentives to increase
Canada's catch of unexploited stocks of fish"; and the
other, "improvements in harbour facilities for fishing
fleets." This may sound like a simple recital of two oddappearing items, but there is a great deal of meaning in
them which I will come to in just a few minutes.
I would like to begin by summarizing some of the
fisheries development policies which have been devised
and put into effect during the past year or so by the
[Hon. Mr. Smith.]

March 20, 1974

minister responsible. With some of these policies the flow
of benefits is already becoming evident. Others will
require a longer term to bear the fruit of success. Perhaps
these will prove to be the most important of all. Some of
the steps already taken have been made difficult because
of the controversy that often arises during a period of
change and reform, especially in any fundamental
resource industry. Because of their purpose and function
they were not understood by those they were intended to
benefit. I well recall a mass meeting in the western part of
Nova Scotia which was reported in the daily paper to have
been attended by 2,000 people to protest a change involving the lobster fishery.
*

(1510)

That is what I mean. Those who gathered to protest
were afraid of something new. People do not protest that
particular regulation now because its purpose was later
explained. It could be regarded as failure on the part of the
Department of Fisheries, and perhaps the minister, to
ensure that fishermen understood the meaning of the
change before the regulations were put into effect.
I am thinking also of other areas where that kind of
tactic has been carried out without consultation. I recall
Senator Norrie's stand on behalf of the people on the
eastern shore of Nova Scotia who rose in protest against
the establishment of a national park without benefit of
consultation. People in the area east of Halifax were successful in having the provincial government withdraw
from an arrangement with the federal government, and
Senator Norrie was one of those who led a delegation to
Ottawa and who made the government well aware of how
the people felt about that particular park. I think it is a
shame that they are not going to get that park.
There is a park in the northern part of Nova Scotia
where I live which, in my opinion, is a great thing. However, the people there were in a different position. The
park was established because there were not so many
privately-owned cottages in the area. There was some
protest, and when the cottages and lakeshore properties
were expropriated, all hell was let loose for a while-if I
might use that term. However, the park is now a good
refuge from urban areas and some of the neighbouring
states.
The provincial government has now stepped into that
vacuum and is prepared to do something on a smaller scale
under the auspices of their program regarding provincial
parks.
The difficulties which I have enumerated provide an
opportunity for exaggeration and half truths from others
whose role often seems to be one not primarily intended to
assist the fishing industry, or whatever industry is
involved, to grow and prosper. Their primary objective
seems to be negative and destructive-that of shortening
the political life of the minister or the government, or
both. There are uniformed newspaper and magazine writers who follow that line of thought, and lend credence to
some of the protest away beyond its value.
That is an unusually easy course to take with respect to
any program of the provincial government, when it is
realized that 10 of the 11 members of the House of Commons from Nova Scotia are in the official Opposition and,
therefore, have established a 10 to one position on the

March 20, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES

front pages as well as on the editorial page of the Halifax
daily newspaper.
This is a mathematical problem. It is up to some of us to
stop that trend and to square the situation. We are trying
to do so in a modest way. However, having detached
ourselves from that kind of politics, we do not do very
much about it. The additional effect of this is that the
radio news in Nova Scotia reflects this coverage like a
mirror.
That is all background for my saying that perhaps it is
time for someone to speak out in support of what the
present Minister of the Environment, through the Fisheries and Marine Service, is trying to do for the fishing
industry. First, it is evident to all of us who have access to
a collection of material on this subject that the Honourable Jack Davis has clearly demonstrated his support for
the inshore fishery to a degree which no other predecessor
in office has done.
I would like to give honourable senators several examples of that. The first example is a piece of legislation,
passed in the last session of Parliament, called the Fisheries Development Act of 1973. That act provides generous
grants for bait-holding facilities, for refrigeration and
icing systems for smaller boats, and also for the provision
of sufficient supplies of ice. A recent announcement indicates a faster pace of implementing this program, the
purpose being to improve the quality of the landed fish by
the inshore fishermen.
A new amendment is in Bill C-2, which is already on our
desks. That bill has already received first reading in the
other place. It is worth noting that this piece of legislation
is the first item, with the exception of the pro forma bill
which is introduced in both houses on the opening day of
Parliament, introduced in this new session. I hope that it
is an indication of the priority position that fisheries will
have in the government's new progran. The amending bill
will provide for financial assistance "for the construction,
modification, conversion and equipment of fishing vessels." New techniques are being developed, new standards
are demanded in the fishing industry, and inshore fishermen as well as other elements of the industry must be
enabled to keep abreast of the markets.
The legislation to which I have referred will be of great
help. It will round out the 1973 plan to assist fishermen to
land an improved quality of fish, and the reward to fishermen arising from increased prices will be of real
magnitude.
I turn now to another item in respect of which the
interests of inshore fishermen have been very much in the
mind of the minister responsible for fisheries. It has to do
with the lobster fishery. In this connection I speak only of
my province, Nova Scotia.
A day or two ago I received a telephone call from the
appropriate section of the Fisheries Service in Ottawa, in
which I was told that in the province of Nova Scotia the
landed value of lobster in 1973 was over $22 million. That
is rather like fishing for gold and getting lots of it.
I should like to give honourable senators an indication
of how much the lobster fishery means to the province of

Nova Scotia. A Canadian Press despatch from St. John's
reported the other day:
The gross landed value [of all of the fish landings in
the province of Newfoundland] was $45 million.
The figure I gave for Nova Scotia lobsters is almost half of
that for all fish landed in Newfoundland, and Newfoundland is not a poor province by a long shot in the area of
fishery and is making rapid progress.
I am pleased to point out that four-fifths of the landed
value of lobsters in Nova Scotia come from western Nova
Scotia, a part of the province for which I have been trying
to do something for many years. That represents $17 million out of $22 million, and represents 12 million pounds of
lobster.
If the average weight of a lobster is one pound-it could
be a little under or a little over-that represents 12 million
lobsters, or a pile higher than the height of this chamber.
Certainly it would mean two lobsters apiece for everyone
who lives in the southern part of Ontario-it represents a
lot of lobsters. It is an industry which must be preserved
and expanded.
I have a friend who is doing his best to expand the
marketability of lobsters. He is looking for increased landing values through good marketing methods. I have a
clipping concerning my friend who operates a fish company at Port Mouton.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Mouton-the lamb.
Hon. Mr. Smith: They lost their "mouton" about 200
years ago! My friend ships annually 40,000 pounds of
frozen losbter to Belgium, Holland and France. That represents only one-tenth of his lobster business. However, it is
a very profitable part of his business and he is now
visiting the United States and England to seek more channels for his product. He is a member of a trade delegation
that is trying to sell various Nova Scotia products. That
delegation left just the other day, and already he has been
interviewed in London. He is quite encouraged by the
prospects, as he sees them.

e

(1520)

The Fisheries Service, of course, and the minister,
regard this highly as well they should, because there are
not too many people involved in this type of rich fishery. I
do not know the population of the southern end of Nova
Scotia from Shelburne County all the way down and
across to Digby-that is what I call southwestern Nova
Scotia-but it is a rich industry, so the resource must be
protected.
This particular aspect of the fisheries industry is receiving the benefits of a restricted licensing system. The
purpose of that system is to make sure that the number of
lobster fishermen is restricted so that the natural replacement rate of this resource is not exceeded by the
harvesting.
I also want to make some reference to the herring
fishery, which is a particularly rich resource in eastern
Nova Scotia. When I say "eastern Nova Scotia" I mean
Senator Graham's country. There has been closer control
and regulation of the herring fishery during the last several years in an effort to prevent depletion of the herring
stocks by overfishing. It has been made clear that in the
future the use of herring for fishmeal and oil should take

SENATE DEBATES
second place to preserving an adequate supply of this
species for food.
A recent Canada Statistics release shows that the production of herring off the Cape Breton coast increased in
January, 1974 to 24 million pounds, as compared to 19
million pounds for the previous January. I have since
found a figure which shows that the total of the eastern
Nova Scotia herring catch during the winter season of
1973-74 was 33,000 tons-double that for last year. So
conservation measures are needed. Such measures are in
the interests, for the most part, of the inshore fishermen,
but they are also in the interests of those who are
employed in the food herring business.
This is the main reason for that great catch down there.
There is a relatively new herring processing plant which
started a year or so ago. That plant was originally
designed for another purpose, but it is now a successful
herring processing plant. This one plant, during the past
winter season, employed 300 to 400 people, half of whom, I
suppose, were women, whose skills are used in the finer
areas of processing. Even if these plants paid only the
minimum wage in Nova Scotia-and I know they pay
more than the minimum wage-they would certainly help
in keeping our people off the unemployment insurance
roll, which some of us worry about-a little too much
sometimes.
Another important step was the close examination conducted of the system of grants and subsidies for the
construction of fishing craft. There were a good many
indications from the industry, which were accepted by the
Fisheries Service and the minister himself, that these
grants and subsidies were not going for the right size or
the right kind of boat necessary to catch up in the modern
race for the rich offshore fisheries. The result of that
study, it is hoped, will ensure that the financial incentives
will be applied to the size and design of boat appropriate
to present day circumstances, as well as to future
circumstances.
For some years now, foreign fishing industries have
been based on the presence on the banks, some 200 miles
or so offshore, of large mother ships. These mother ships
always accompany the Polish and Russian fishing fleets,
as well as other fleets which have moved into the North
Atlantic during the last number of years, and they are
actually processing plants. When the processing ship of
the Russian fleet, for example, is full, another mother ship,
which is a cargo carrier, takes the catch back to Russia.
We may have to get into that type of thing. It has never
before been thought to be economically feasible, but with
the price of fish as high as it is today a great many things
are becoming economically feasible.
I do not want to be diverted too much into the details of
the fishing industry. Were I to do so, many honourable
senators would be as bored as I used to be when some of
my friends constantly talked about the wheat situation. I
do think it is important to these people, however, and
some of us should speak up for them once in a while.
Without going into figures to any great extent, I do want
to point out that several years ago 6 cents per pound was a
good price for the biggest cod. Today it is 12 or 14 cents a
pound, or even more, depending on market conditions. Six
cents a pound was a pretty good price for haddock a few
[Hon. Mr. Smith j

March 20, 1974

years ago. Then it rose to 8 cents, and the fishermen of
today are getting anywhere from 22 cents to 25 cents a
pound for haddock. That is why we have to pay $1.60 a
pound for a "prime No. 1 rib roast" of haddock in our
stores. In the small town of Nova Scotia in which I live, we
pay $1.35 a pound for haddock. No one is making too much
profit on it. The fellow who is finally getting something
out of it for the first time in his life is the one who goes
out on those boats and conquers seasickness and bustedup hands, and endures the other hardships that go along
with that kind of life. He is now making the kind of money
that his father never dreamed of making. So the price of
fish is raising the fishermen's standard of living, and is
allowing them to improve their operations. With the continuing shortage of protein in the world, we will have to
be very careful that we are able to obtain our share of
protein from the oceans.
Another step being taken by the Canadian government
is the establishment of a licensing system for most fishing
vessels. This measure will take several years to phase in.
Lobster fishing has been the only part of the industry up
until now that has been licensed. This measure will be
instituted during the next year or so, and it will have as its
purpose control of the growth of the fleet of vessels prosecuting each of the specific fishery resources that appear to
be diminishing. This principle, as I said before, has been
applied to the lobster fishery for some years. In the future,
it might be appropriate to apply the same principle to the
regulation and conservation of quite a number of other
species.
Those conservation measures which are now in effect, of
course, will likely have to be continued and expanded. A
current example of the kind of regulation that can become
controversial is the ban on haddock fishing on specified
offshore banks during spawning periods, and minimum
size limits on scallops, which is a regulation of ICNAF, the
International Commission for the Northwest Atlantic
Fisheries. Both of those species are regarded as being
overfished, and virtual destruction of the species is possible. Such measures as I have just outlined should have the
support of all those interested in conservation.
A statement issued last week by officials of the Fisheries Service indicates that all nations, with the exception of
the United States, which is a signatory to ICNAF, were
observing the haddock conservation measure. It is evident
that the State Department of the United States would
have a much greater influence on the control of the American fleets if a repetition of recent departures from the
regulations by relatively few Canadian vessels can be
avoided in the future. I understand that steps leading to
this end are now being taken. I regarded the publicity
given to some irresponsible and uninformed statements on
this matter as distinctly harmful to Canada's conservation
goals.
* (1530)

At the present time discussions are being held with the
fishermen and the industry in all parts of the Atlantic
Coast to explain to those concerned the details of the
licensing system proposed, and the benefits expected. A
similar system of licensing and controls, although much
more drastic in scope, together with international agreements, on the West Coast of Canada have resulted in great

March 20, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

benefits, such as increased stocks of fish and long-term
high incomes for the fishermen of British Columbia. Now
the fishermen of Nova Scotia will have their fishery
enriched by adequate protection measures.
It is well known that while some of my neighbours, who
are commercial fishermen on the East Coast, pull their
boats ashore to fix them up, and so on, when the lobster
season is over, many of them head for Prince Rupert, and
places like that, to participate in the halibut fishery in
which the total catch is regulated by international agreement. When the quota has been reached everybody has to
stop fishing. These regulations are strictly observed, and
they have led to large halibut catches by those nations
engaged in the fisheries off the West Coast. Perhaps in the
long term we will benefit in the same way, and I hope

there will not be too many difficulties.
In general, the fishermen on the Atlantic Coast have
continued to be the least organized labour group in this

country. This may be the first time that the Fisheries
Service has gone to the people for advice. It is a new
departure to consult with the fishermen, and it should
receive the general approval of those who believe in
so-called grass roots democracy.
I should like to draw attention to the recent organization of fishermen in western Nova Scotia, at which 650
fishermen attended. This organization has the makings of
a good vehicle for constructive consultation, as I am sure
the people in the Fisheries Service are aware.
It is now evident that one of the most important policy
changes brought about by the present Minister of Fisheries is the turning over to his department of responsibility
for the development of small craft harbours. I cannot
over-emphasize the great benefits that are presently flowing, and will flow in the future, from that reorganization
decision. It is well known that the Department of Public
Works has great responsibility for the engineering,
supervising and building of public works all over the
country. The officials of that department had to make
recommendations to the Minister of Public Works in
Ottawa on whether a certain small craft harbour should be
dredged, or its wharves extended. We have several former
Ministers of Public Works in this chamber, and they know
how difficult a problem it was to make final decisions on
such matters. There was always some kind of loose consultation with the Department of Fisheries, but that consultation was at too high a level; it never got close enough to
the fishermen themselves to achieve an understanding of
their real needs.
Although from time to time the program was respectable
in size, it was phased down and then phased up againthere was no continuity to it. Now the responsibility for
directing what public works shall be built for the small
craft harbours in this country, whether on the Atlantic
coast, the west coast, or in the inland waters, will be that
of the Fisheries and Marine Service of the Department of
the Environment. This is a positive and productive policy,
which is dedicated to f illing the needs of fishermen, wherever they may live.
The small craft harbours branch is now completing a list
of projects to be carried out by the Department of Public
Works. The estimates for the coming fiscal years will
provide for a doubling or tripling of the annual amount

27601-10

available for the improvement of these fishing harbours.
For Nova Scotia the approved program for 1974-75 carries
a total price tag of over $6 million. This estimate, of
course, does not include projects that are under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transport, such as ferry docks
and commercial wharves, such as the one costing $750,000
at Yarmouth, and certainly not Halifax harbour, or any of
those big harbours, because the Ministry of Transport has
first jurisdiction in that respect. Those involve a great
amount of money, particularly when related to inshore
and medium size fisheries. I know quite a bit about it,
because I have lived among fishermen all my life.
Restrictions related to the availability of manpower,
equipment and materials, as well as budgetary guidelines,
may bring about a measure of deferment, which will run
the completion date of this $6 million program into next
year. However, it is my understanding that final approval
and engineering services will be directed to a completed
program during this fiscal year, which will involve an
expenditure of at least $4 million in Nova Scotia.
I am glad to say that a lot of this money is going where
it should have gone years ago, and that is to southwest
Nova Scotia. That is where the rich lobster fishery and so
many other developments in the fishing industry are.
There are big plants there, and a lot of people living on the
little coves along the coastline. I have often thought I
would like to measure the length of that coastline so that I
could see what all those inlets add up to.
I understand, from talking to the director of the small
craft harbours branch, that this is the first stage only of a
catch-up program in Nova Scotia, which will require a
great deal more time and money before the full program is
completed.
In my own particular area there are important fisheries
projects being undertaken. There is the expansion of pri
vately operated cold storage plants, processing plants, and
so on. For example, in Mouton-as my friend Senator
Choquette and I both pronounce it, being so fluent in
French-the modernization of a very old plant, to provide
for year-round operation, is under study. I have no doubt
that this project will require some kind of assistance,
possibly from DREE, rather than going to the small craft
harbours branch. Someone who wants almost exclusive
use of a wharf built by public funds cannot expect it to be
turned over to him, particularly in this instance, where
there is no room for the plant to be on one side and a
public structure on the other.
DREE has been of great assistance over the years, together with other incentive programs that have had good
effects in Nova Scotia. I imagine that this industry will
find that DREE can meet most of their requirements. It is
something that should provide year-round employment,
not only for those working in the plant, but for those
intending to go into the herring fishery. It is labour-intensive, and a very important development. I am sure someone will find a way to bring that about.
Then there are Moose Harbour and Port Medway, where
they are enlarging the boats and expanding. There is a
need for a lot of this work, and I cannot see an end to the
program. I hope those who are interested in building up
the industry will be patient, and will not get too dis-

SENATE DEBATES
couraged while waiting for the engineering services to
catch up with the demands.
I was particularly interested to learn, when I looked
over the projects scheduled for Nova Scotia, that what is
officially described as a "new fishing harbour" for Cape
Sable Island has been approved. I would point out to those
who may be strangers to our area that Cape Sable Island is
not Sable Island. Sable Island is the place where there are
the ponies and oil, we hope. Cape Sable Island is where
those Cape Codders, who many generations ago lived in
what is now Massachusetts, came to. It is a rocky sort of
island off the very southern tip of Nova Scotia, to which it
is now connected by a causeway.
*

(1540)

That causeway was their first blessing in life. This
project will be regarded as a second blessing in the life of
some of those old grandfathers down there, because this
new fishing harbour will mean there will be an opportunity for larger vessels to bring their catches into that
section of Nova Scotia. It is quite a populous place, containing about 5,000 people, and the only real industry is
fishing-associated, of course, with the service industries
that go with any other kind of industry. There are bound
to be large scale economic benefits from this project.
I have been told that it may be possible to make a start
on this during this fiscal year. If so, it is estimated that the
expenditures may amount to $300,000, but the total tab for
this project is in the area of $2 million, so it is big
business. Of course, costs are not getting any lower, but
that $2 million investment will be recovered in wages and
landings of fish down there. They will be better equipped
to protect their boats, and some considerably larger ones
will be able to get into a decent sized wharf. This is a good
investment of the taxpayers' money.
Honourable senators, it would be an understatement for
me to say that I am highly gratified to learn of this
particular development, because it is in an area where I
have enjoyed lasting friendships for many years.
I was also interested to learn that a project of some
magnitude is being planned for Weymouth which has
played a great role in the shipping history of Nova Scotia
and the world. It was where they concentrated on the
barque and the brigantine, the four-masters and the
square-riggers, that voyaged all over the world. It was an
important place, known throughout the world, there they
constructed many smaller naval vessels, especially
woqden ones. Weymouth could be the basis of a better
industry than it has now, and this would expand the
opportunities for employment there. I understand that
before it is completed this project will cost about $1
million, and it is expected that perhaps half a million
dollars will be spent this year, if the engineering can be
done. The Weymouth project is also long overdue. I know
the shore quite well, and I have always looked forward to
the time when it would be developed.
There was a rather important development not far away
that cost over $1 million, but it proved not to be the best
choice of location. There was a lot of money involved, and
I suppose the former Auditor General would have referred
to this as waste and extravagance. The people there could
see the money being poured down the drain. There were
great engineering problems with regard to breakwaters to
[Hon. Mr. Smith.]

March 20, 1974

protect the structure. The engineers had to add and add,
and dredge and dredge, but they had to go back and
stabilize it so that they could go somewhere where it made
a little more sense.
I have indicated some of the success which has been
attained since the introduction of this small craft harbours
branch, and I believe this is very important to our future.
Honourable senators, you have been very patient with
me, and I shall detain you but a few minutes more. I
should like to make a few observations with respect to the
development of new horizons and expanded opportunities
for Atlantic Coast fishing. Ever since the late 1950s,
successive governments have been using their diplomatic
skills in the direction of an international agreement on
proposals for much needed but drastic changes in the law
of the sea. In about 1958 or 1960 an agreement which would
have made a drastic change in the law of the sea failed to
get through the United Nations sponsored conference, by
just a few votes. Now we arrive at a period in history
when it does seem possible that the conference, which is
going to be held this summer, will be crowned with success. The minister has indicated, in public and in private,
that he is confident and most optimistic that it would be
the greatest development that we have seen for a long
time.
I am sure that Senator Martin will recall some of the
attacks he used to meet from the Opposition in the other
place, when they used the phrase, as I recall, "gunboat
diplomacy". He was attacked by statements that the government had made a unilateral declaration-which was
designed to protect and serve the fisheries. As a first step,
straight base lines were established for measuring the
extent of the territorial sea, and a nine-mile fishing zone
was established. Up to then the fishing zone and the
territorial zone was three miles, the distance that the old
cannon could fire in the days when privateers used to
come and do battle with some of those Yankees, during
their war of liberation, I suppose you call it.
All these steps were not taken without difficulties. They
involved the delicate and difficult phasing-out of negotiations with friendly nations which had established historic
rights in those waters. Agreement has now been reached
with all of those nations, except the United States. However, in this instance the results have been pretty good up
to this point. There is a reciprocal agreement with our
neighbouring nation, which permits fishing by the fleets
of both nations up to three miles off the coasts of each. It
is a status quo arrangement, and it is working well. We are
taking their scallops and we let them take our flounders or
some other kinds of fish, and it is working well.
I hope the United States will be at the new Conference
on the Law of the Sea, and will be drawn into new
agreements which will result in granting the coastal states
of the world fishing jurisdiction up to a 200-mile limit
from the shore. In addition, Canada will be seeking preferential rights and resource management on the continental
shelf where it extends beyond the 200-mile limit. We are
fortunate in having that great expanse, which extends
well beyond 200 miles in some areas. It is difficult to
imagine the benefit to all nations, and in particular the
magnitude of the benefit to Canada that will fall from
such a decision.

The responsibilities whîch Canada would be obliged ta

involvement associated with the new requirements of
manpower and ships. These requirements will be in bath

of the fishing industry throughaut the world should alsa

be of the highest order.
I hope that the Minister of Fisheries is not proven in the

hope he will be supported by all cancerned with the future

Hon. Alan A. Macnaughton: Honourable senatars, in
the tradition of this famous chamber I want ta congratulate His Excellency Jules Léger on his appaintment as
Governar General of Canada and also his charming and
graciaus wife Madame Léger.
All of us are glad ta see and welcome in aur midst
Senator the Hanourable Louis Robichaud wha as Premier
of New Brunswick did a very distinguished job, and alsa
Senatar Daniel Riley who was one of aur associates in the
ather hause many years aga. This is indeed a strang team
fram New Brunswick.
May I add a word of congratulation ta the maver and

Senator Raymond Perrault.
Last on my list, but first in the Senate, may I pay
tribute ta aur charming and capable Speaker, Senator
Muriel McQueen Fergusson.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macnaughton: A few days ago some proposais
for the refomm af the Canada-United States Interparliamentary Group crossed my desk, for a re-assessment of
this jaint organization. The report is a very detailed and
capable one, in my opinion. The members af the study
graup were Senators John Aird and Grattan O'Leamy, and
f ram the House af Cammans Messrs. Barnett Dansan and
David MacDonald. These proposals caîl for a review of the
Canada-United States Intemparliamentamy Gmoup and are
ta be discussed this evening at 6 o'clack in the Railway
Cammittee Raam. I wauld hope that as many hanaumable
senatars as can will be present ta discuss, flot the
rejuvenation but certainly the revisian of the terms of
reference under which this very important graup with aur
neighboum ta the south opemates.
* (1550)

This gave me a few ideas with respect ta the Speech
fram the Throne and I thought that it might be of same
use, not ta discuss this repart since it will na daubt be
discussed in detail this evening, but pemhaps ta give some
eferences ta the relationships and contacts
historical
between the United States and Canada and I am sarry if
these mefemences seem ta be ather long. Yestemday Senator
Laird spake of these relationships in an up-to-date and
mast interesting fashion. Not ta impmess anyone, but
simply ta get it an record-and it might just be useful for
aur discussion this evening-I should like ta show how
during 200 years we have had a great many contacts with

27601-10 t

our neighbours to the south and how important such
contact is to aur future.
If I had ta link my remarks ta the Speech from the
Throne, I suppose I could refer you to the f irst sentence in
paragraph 12 of the Speech, which reads:
The Canadian economy, perhaps more than any
other, is clasely tied ta international trade and
markets.
These remarks that I would like ta make in the littie
time that is left will, I hope, refer ta the historical background of events and contacts between Canada and the
United States, same present-day problems and irritations
between aur twa cauntries, and then again the impact of
United States trade and investment an the Canadian
ecanomy.
I have naturally delved into quite a few references and I
do nat dlaim any particular originality for these remarks;
but I do think, as a matter of interest, that it might be
useful for students of this subject if honourable members
would allow me ta file at the end of these remarks a list of
the references on which I have drawn.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable
senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.

Hon. Mr. Macnaughton: Honourable senatars, the development of Canada-United States relations over the past
twa centuries has been characterized by a whole array of
international interactions, ranging f rom overt belligerence
and hostility ta the most congenial relationship witnessed
between states anywhere in the modern world. Indeed,
relations with the United States were born amid the bitter
hastility of the American Revolution of 1776 which itself
was nat finally settled until some seven years later, at the
Peace of Paris of 1783<1> Canadian-American relations in
their initial phase, which lasted until the end of the War of
1812, were times of hostility, encampassing twa AngloAmerican wars, that involved invasions on bath sides.
This was followed by a haîf century of uneasy truce
interspersed by such events as the Confederate raids from
British North American soil ta the United States during
the Civil War on the one hand and the retaliatory Fenian
2
Raids between 1866 ta 1870 on the other. > However,
despite these temporary interruptions of the peace alang
the border, underlyingZ economic and social farces were
beginning to work in the direction of dloser trade rela-

tions-a fact underlined by the mid-century reciprocîty
arrangement which provided a measure of free trade from
1854 ta 1866.(') While reciprocity in trade had been a major
issue just before Confederation, the long recession of the
1880s and 1890s precipitated a mavement in Canada in
f avour of union with the United States. In the meantime,
the Treaty of Washington of 1871-which provided, inter
alia for f ree navigation of the St. Lawrence River, certain
bonding privileges and the free entry of Canadian f ish ta
American markets<4 -eliminated United States-British
issues in North America, and the settiement of the
Venezuela dispute in 1895, involving the boundary line of
the latter country and British Guiana, put an end ta a
United States threat ta Canada.()
By the end of the next decade the stabilization of relations between Canada and the United States provided the

SENATE DEBATES
atmosphere for the amicable settlement of the Alaska and
Passarnaquoddy Bay boundaries by the Boundary Waters
Treaty of 1908. Canadian opinion, however, had been
highly incensed at the British capitulation to American
demands in thîs case; so much se that the Canadian members of the Boundary Tribunal, Sir Louis Arnable Jetté,
Lieu tenant- Governor of the Province of Quebec, and Mr.
A. B. Aylesworth of Toronto, later to hold the portfolios of
Postm aster-General and Minister of Justice in the Laurier
governrnent as well as being narned to the Senate thereafter, both dissented and refused to affix their signatures te
the award. 8> Other disputes relating to taxation, extradition of crîrninals and common defence also werc matters
that werc deait with in a rnutually accomrnodating
fashion. 7 >
In the following decades, trade steadily increased
despite the absence of a formial agreement until 1935. In
the meantîrne, United States investmcnt in Canada had
surpassed that by the United Kingdem in the early 1920s.8 >l
With the outbreak of war in 1939, cooperation in trade,
defence and the common management of industrial resources for war purposes, received a great impetus . Canada
had corne te depend upon the United States for ils strategic defence. The Permanent Joint Board cf Defence was
established by the Ogdensburg Agreement in 1940 te serve
as an advîscrv body te the two governments te coordinate
plans for the defence of North America In 1941 Canada
and the Urnited States established a Joint Defence Production Commiîîee te ensure the effective coordination ot the
production of defence materials. 1 'l The Hyde Park Agreement, aise concluded iri 1941, xsherebv each country undertook to complement each other's war production, extended
the~ military couperation mbt the civilian economic sphere.
The mutual relationship which had marked the cooperatien of the war period was extended into the post-war
perîod with the establishment of the Mili arv Cooperation
Commîttee in 1946 and a joint declaration in 19417 which
outlint'd lirnited mutual ceoperation for North American
defence inv<îlving the exehange et personnel, cooperation
in development and design cf equîpment and the reciprocal use cf certain defence facilities. ' Wîth the advent cf
the Cold War between the East and the West, Canada
entered lno the North Atlantic Treaty cf 1949. This treaîy
was the fîrst and only formai alliance between Canada
and the United States, according te the recent External
Affairs green paper entitled. "Canada t S. Relations:
Options for the Future," Furthermiore, it was precipiîated
in ne smnall via v by the initiative i)1 the then Canadian
Prime Mînîster. Mr. Louis St. Laurent. Relations were

I should like te say just a few words about United States
policy. Current United States policy wîth regard te its
relations wîth Canada was outlined durîng President Nîxen's visit te Ottawa in April 1972. In focusing on Caîîddian-Arnerîcan hislory, the Presîdent underlîned the tendency te somelîmes gloss over the fact that real problerns
exîst beîween Canada and the United States. On thîs
occasion he stated:
It is lime for Canadians and Amerîcans te meve
beyond the sentimental rheterîc cf the past. It is lime
fer us te recegnîze that we have very separate identities; that we have signîficant differences: and that
nobedy's interesîs are furthered when these realîties
are obscured. 1
(1U600)

The Presîdent cf the United States explaîned that bis
country's polîcy toward Canada retlected the Nixon doctrine whîch rested on the premîse that mature partoci s
must have autonemous independent polîcies wîth each
nation defînîng the nature of its ewn interests, decîding

The Nixon doctrine, according te Mr. Sharp's External

One might also add the words of the well-known French
Canadian writer and journalist M. Solange Chaput Rolland in Montreal who, in discussing Mr. Sharp's policy
paper, inter alia, said:
No American will ever solve our quest for a real and
distinctive identity, it is up to us to affirm our difference and to accept the consequences. And only
Canadians themselves, not Mitchell Sharp or the
Canadian government, can determine whether they
want an American standard of living with all that
entails, or a more modest-but Canadian-existence,
with all that implies. If Canadians want three cars
instead of just one, if they prefer Marcus Welby to
Jalna, they should stop complaining because the
White House sometimes treats us as if Canada were
an American satellite, or an American state.O>
I want to deal now with the North-South pull between
Canada and the United States, which can be traced back to
the strong annexation feelings of 1849 when the British
merchants of Montreal, hard hit by the Mother Country's
newly adopted free trade policies, advocated union with
the United States."" Subsequently, trade and mutual
defence have had the greatest influence in developing this
reciprocal attraction. Today the emphasis undoubtedly is
on the former.
Indeed, it is in the economic and cultural fields in which
the North-South pull has been especially strong. This is
because advances in communications and modes of production and economic integration favour large units and
markets which help to augment the natural pull of geography. On the other hand, in the defence and political fields,
continental linkages have not significantly increased in
the last decade. The strongest continental pull appears to
derive from the presence of the U.S. branch plant subsidiaries of large multi-national corporations and from the
great number of informai, non-governmental ties between
private groups, associations and individuals. "Paradoxically, as these ties have expanded, the capacity of Canada to
develop economically and culturally with less reliance on
the United States and the outside world in general has
also increased."(20)

There are several policy differences between our two
countries. In the year 1967 Canada celebrated its centennial under its own new flag adopted through the untiring
efforts of Canada's former Prime Minister, the late Right
Honourable Lester B. Pearson. The year 1967 was also the
time when the government launched a tentative comprehensive study of foreign ownership with a view to adopting some form of national policy. Since 1968 the Canadian
government has adopted such policies, sometimes going
against United States stated positions, as: the partial withdrawal of Canadian forces from NATO in Europe; the
initiative toward obtaining China's membership in the
United Nations; and a categorical stance on certain aspects
of disarmament which apparently go beyond what the
United States feels is currently safe. In the opinion of the
Canadian-American Committee, formed in 1957 by planning associations on each side of the border, and composed
of members from agriculture, business, labour and professional leaders. the most startling divergence from the
United States position occurred in April 1970 when
Canada unilaterally declared that it would extend its

territorial waters to a twelve mile off-shore limit and
establish a pollution control zone within one hundred
miles of Canada's Arctic lands and islands as well as
create nearly 2 exclusive fishing zones in certain international waters.( 1
By and large in the economic field of Canadian-American relations it is expected that there will be increasing
governmental regulation in those areas previously left to
natural commercial forces. For instance, Canada is currently adopting a "screening formula" to set limits on
foreign investments and has levied export taxes on such
resources as copper and oil to protect what it saw as the
national interest. On the United States side, the CanadianAmerican Committee has speculated that Canada's
exemption from the United States interest equalization
tax on borrowing in the capital market in New York might
be eliminated. The effects of such moves undoubtedly
would tend to moderate the growth of economic integration between the two countries. This however does not
mean that a relatively extensive degree of integration
would not remain across a wide spectrum of activity and
interests in both countries."
The current oil crisis, as a result of the Middle East War
and the imposition of an oil embargo on United States
imports from that area, has served to sharpen CanadianUnited States relations in this regard. The current policy
of the Canadian government, of ensuring adequate supplies of oil for domestic purposes, necessitated the rejection, by the National Energy Board in February 1973, of a
United States request for additional oil supplies. However,
it should be pointed out that, despite Canada's insistence
on providing for its own needs first of ail, oil has been
flowing into the United States without interruption. In his
national television address of November 22, 1973, the
Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. P. E. Trudeau, refuted
charges that Canada was reducing oil exports to the
United States and predicted an 18 per cent increase-some
63 million barrels-in 1973 over the previous year.»> What,
of course, has been conveniently forgotten is that Canada
for the greater part of the last decade had made repeated
attempts to increase its export of oil to the United States
all without any avail. On the other hand, however, it must
be conceded that Canada fared better than other countries
in that it was given preference to supply District No. 5 on
the West Coast by shipping oil to the Puget Sound through
the Transmountain Pipeline from Alberta and British
Columbia.

The comparative unemployment rates in Canada and
the United States are observed as being areas which also
might provoke self-interest policies on both sides of the
border. Indeed policies affecting Canada-United States
trade and investment may come to the point of being
determined by "the balance of employment" effects. It is
possible that each country will, in its own way, move
toward a position where major investment projects, trade
or economic cooperation generally must, before approval,
come under close scrutiny for possible effects not only
upon the balance of trade or payments but also on employment. For Canada the adoption of "the balance of employment" criteria could lead to a situation where a desirable
labour-intensive industry that Canada wished to attract

SENATE DEBATES
from outside the country would be restrained by U.S.
action. Further, the emergence of deliberate employment
considerations on the United States side might even lead
to the pressuring of certain U.S. companies to bring back
production from their branch plants in Canada if such
production was clearly destined for the U.S. market and if
related unemployment on the U.S. side was significant.4
While there is considerable evidence which Canadians
can use to support their criticism of United States extraterritorial actions in Canada, sometimes the shoe is on the
other foot. The question relates to the problem of the
proposed transportation of oil by American tankers down
the West Coast of British Columbia-a matter that the
Canadian section of the Canada-United States Interparliamentary Group brought to the attention of their American
colleagues. There is, however, another side to this question. A very pertinent observation on this matter has
recently been made by John Kenneth Jamieson, a native
of Medicine Hat, Alberta, who now heads the world's
largest energy corporation, Exxon. A native of Canada,
himself, he probably is less reluctant to point out to
Canadians that they are not without their own shortcomings. For instance, he takes to task Canadian opposition
based on fears of oil spills as a result of the trans-Alaska
oil pipeline and the related tanker delivery system down
the West Coast. He said, "The thing that Canadians overlook completely is that for years British Columbia was
supplied with oil coming from the south, transporting
right past the West Coast of the U.S., and no one objected". Oil was delivered by north-bound tankers to refineries at the top end of Burrard Inlet in the Vancouver area
until the Transmountain Pipeline from Alberta was built
in the early 1950s. Enlarging on the subject and pointing
to the current oil transportation routes on the East Coast,
Mr. Jamieson noted that no American. has objected to the
hazards of tanker traffic into Portland, Maine, bringing
5
the oil for the pipeline to Montreal."'
Undoubtedly there are other areas where rather zealous
Canadians, carried away by the tide of anti-United States
sentiment, have criticized their neighbours to the south
when Canada itself has been guilty of similar questionable
practices.
I would like to refer briefly to the options for the future.
The Canadian foreign policy review defines "foreign policy" as the extension abroad of national policies. More
specifically, instead of reacting to international events,
what Canada is attempting to do is to steer its foreign
relations policy so that it is positively oriented in the
6
direction of national aims."' The question of course arises
as to what this might mean in terms of Canadian-United
States relations. It seems rather obvious that, with the
increasing public reaction to political decisions, this question will undoubtedly be influenced by public attitudes.
The national mood of Canadians today appears to be
that while they remain aware of the benefits of the American connection, more than any other time since the Second
World War they are concerned about the direction and
dimension of the relationship with the United States. In
response, Canadians seem willing to contemplate and support reasonable measures to assure greater inde2
pendence< >and perhaps distinctness.
[Hon. Mr. Macnaughton.]

March 20, 1974

Canadian distinctness, says Mr. Sharp's foreign policy
paper, "today can only mean distinctness from the United
States." Canadians are coming to realize that Canada is a
distinct country with distinct problems that demand
unique Canadian solutions. It is not that Canadians
underrate the tremendous achievements of American
society. The problem simply is that more and more
Canadians have come to conclude that the American
model does not fit the Canadian condition. Such a conclusion has led, not unnaturally, according to Mr. Sharp's
paper, "to the assertion of the right of Canadians to fashion their national environment according to their own
perceptions."(") The real question for Canada then is
whether "interdependence with a big, powerful, dynamic
country like the United States is bound, beyond a certain
level of tolerance, to impose an unmanageable strain on
the concept of a separate Canadian identity, if not on the
elements of Canadian independence."(2)
Canadian policy-makers concede that the concept of
Canadian uniqueness or distinctness has no autonomous
virtue of its own. If Canadians say they want a distinct
country, it is not because they think they are pretentious
but rather because they consider it important to do things
in their own way. It might also be conceded that they
could be more capable of doing them better if they did
them in their own way. Secondly, "they want Canadian
actions and life styles to reflect distinctly Canadian perspectives and a Canadian view of the world", says the
Department of External Affairs policy paper."I
To further future Canadian independence and distinctness, the present government is contemplating opting for a
policy of pursuing "a comprehensive, long-term strategy to
develop and strengthen the Canadian economy and other
aspects of our national life and in the process to reduce the
present Canadian vulnerability." The basic aim of this
option is to eventually "lessen the vulnerability of the
Canadian economy to external factors, including, in particular, the impact of the United States". In the process,
this option is expected to strengthen Canadian capacity to
advance unique "Canadian goals and to develop a more
confident sense of national identity." Carried to its logical
conclusion this would involve other areas of national
endeavour which would have to be supported by appropriate policies. The main thrust of this option appears to be
"towards the development of a balanced and efficient
economy to be achieved by means of a deliberate comprehensive and long-term strategy."(3)
The emphasis of this option is on Canada without at the
same time being in any sense anti-American. It attempts to
come to grips with, as yet, the unanswered question, what
do Canadians actually want? This option is subject to two
qualifications. The first recognizes that the full benefits of
such an option would take time to materialize and that a
deliberate and conscious effort would be required to put
and maintain the Canadian economy on such a course.
Secondly, it must acknowledge that the era of growing
world interdependence will limit the extent to which this
option can be pursued.("
Nevertheless, it must be admitted that the whole concept of distinctness is changing. Challenges exist in the
modern world that transcend national boundaries. Economic activities increasingly can no longer be performed

March 20, 1974

efficiently except on a scale that exceeds national dimensions. This is a global trend from which Canada cannot be
exempt. "It is a fact, nevertheless, that the Canadian
situation in relation to the United States is unique in two
respects: the linkages are probably more numerous and
more pervasive than between any other two countries and
the affinities between them are also such as to put particular strains on the definition of the Canadian identity. On
both counts the problem of living distinct from the United
States is only marginally related to the larger issue of
global interdependence."(")
"Distinctness and independence," as Mr. Sharp's policy
paper points out, "are clearly related, but they are not the
same thing. In the broadest sense, independence is related
ultimately to the capacity of governments to formulate
and conduct policy on the basis of national objectives in
domestic and international environments. Distinctness, on
the other hand, is an attitude that applies to a national
society in all its various manifestations". As a general
proposition, the paper points out, "there is no real evidence that the United States Government does now
pursue a concerted policy of continental integration in
relation to Canada. Conversely, however, the U.S. Government should not be counted on to inhibit any integrating
trend that may be emerging as a result of separate actions
34
or interest, of various U.S. constituent communities"; )
business groups, trade
that is, the actions of corporations,
unions, and the media.
Canada and the United States, throughout their history,
have developed a special relationship which has a uniqueness that goes beyond those special relationships that are
claimed to exist with other countries. However, there is
evidence that such special relationship as has existed in
the past will to an extent likely diminish on both sides of
the border. Last year, the Chairman of the Board of the
Northern Electric Company, Mr. V.D. Marquez, speaking
before the Canadian Export Association in Toronto on
February 21, 1973, on the subject of Canada-United States
relations, noted with some dismay that there was a growing tendency in the United States "to cease treating
Canada as a specially privileged associate".") In the
United States, according to the External Affairs policy
paper, the perception is gaining ground that the "special
relationship" with Canada was an unbalanced- one involving "accommodations in favour of Canada that are no
longer tenable in the light of current economic and political realities," and that any restructuring of this arrangement "would have to proceed on a basis of much more
demonstrable equity of benefit to each country. On the
Canadian side, there is a current feeling that special
arrangements with the United States," for ail their benefits, "may in the end have curtailed Canadian freedom of
action, domestically as much as in the realm of foreign
policy, and that the cumulative impact of such arrangements taken together carries the risk of locking Canada
more firmly into a pattern of continental dependence."(")
*

(1620)

I want to refer to Canadian constitutional questions.
Americans usually refrain from much overt speculation
about the Canadian internal spectre of disunion. Edmond
Gullion, of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy,
Tufts University at Medford, Massachusetts, points out

that this is possibly so because of an uncharacteristic
delicacy of feeling about a neighbour's most intimate
problems or because the official Canadian position has
usually been reassuring. Nevertheless one of the last
things Americans want is a fragmented Canada. What the
United States wants most from Canada is unity under
whatever format French- and English-speaking Canadians
can achieve it."?

An aspect of the Canadian federal-provincial question
which concerns the United States is the difference of
opinion with regard to economic matters. Most provinces,
for example, appear leery of any curtailment of United
States direct investment for fear of adverse consequences
for their economic growth and employment opportunities.
Furthermore, resource-rich provinces have their own
views regarding raw material exports to the United States
which may also be at variance with those of the federal
government. The best current example, of course, is the
differences of opinion between the federal government
and the provincial governments of Alberta and Saskatchewan with regard to the pricing and exportation of oil to
the United States.
Another federal-provincial issue that could potentially
affect Canada-United States relations concerns proposals
for introducing a new competition policy") For instance,
the sections dealing with foreign judgments, and laws and
directives in the proposed amendments to the Combines
Investigation Act,(") which are to apply to both federally
and provincially incorporated companies, could raise disagreements as to how a particular American corporation
resident in a province should be treated.
Many remedial structures exist between our two countries. Over the past two centuries Canadian-American
relations have necessitated the establishment of certain
administrative and para-judicial bodies to arbitrate and
settle recurring problems that have arisen between two
neighbours so geographically contiguous. Among these are
the International Joint Commission of 1909, created to
settle boundary water disputes between Canada and the
United States. Today the function of this commission
involves the regulation of the natural level or flow of
boundary waters along with the administration of the
Water Quality Agreement signed in 1972 by Prime Minister Trudeau and President Nixon. The International Pacific Halibut Commission, established as the result of the
conclusion between Canada and the United States of the
Convention for the Preservation of the Halibut Fishery in
the Northern Pacific and Bering Sea in 1923, has broad
regulatory powers to ensure the preservation of this commercial species. Likewise the Great Lakes Fishery Commission, set up under the 1955 Fisheries Convention, provides for joint action by Canada and the United States for
research into Great Lakes fish stocks and the establishment of a program to control the parasitic sea lamprey
which is responsible for the depletion of lake trout stocks.
The functions of such bodies as the Permanent Joint
Board of Defence and other defence arrangements have
already been mentioned. In addition to these bilaterally
constituted bodies, a third class of joint activities between
Canada and the United States takes place at the political
level. Such political activities are without administrative
arrangements of a permanent character and are carried

SENATE DEBATES
out through the regular and ad hoc meetings of the Canada-United States Interparliamentary Group as well as by
the two ministerial committees of both countries on joint
defence, and trade and economic affairs. Finally, there are
a large number of ad hoc consultative arrangements which
deal with such varied problems as meteorology, West
Coast pollution controls and anti-trust prosecutions. All of
these, along with the daily flow of diplomatic information
and other trans-boundary interactions, add up to a very
4
large volume of contacts and cooperation. )
Maxwell Cohen, in considering Canada-United States
relations from a legal point of view, notes that no similar
network of relationships and varied types of machinery
has emerged to carry out the complex economic-legal
interactions between the two countries. He suggests,
"Canadians are in a position to insist upon better means
for being heard on common economic, trade, investment
and resource development aspects of the heavily intermeshed relationships of the two countries." In the absence
of existing machinery to deal with work problems two
serious defects have arisen from the Canadian point of
view. The first is the "tendency of the American courts or
American administrative agencies to apply directly or
indirectly United States law and standards to persons,
events, goods, and services based in Canada but made
unlawful or administratively suspect by the operations of
the United States judicial or administrative decision-making." Perhaps the best current example of this is the
attendant difficulty that has arisen with regard to the
export of Canadian built locomotives to Cuba. Mr. Cohen
makes the positive suggestion that to avoid such irritations in the future Canadians and Americans might establish a "Joint Economic and Statistical Commission or a
series of commissions-resources, environmental, commodities, investment et cetera-which will do for these
everchanging potentially irritating areas what the International Joint Commission has done for boundary
waters.

. ."(")

The explanation, of course, for the anomaly of existing
areas of interaction, without anything more than ad hoc
arrangements, is explained by the fact that these activities
have had their import almost entirely in the private sector.
Both Canadian and United States governments have largely been satisfied to avoid any detailed regulation of these
activities in the past. In future, however, especially as
governments more and more move into those areas of
activity which have largely been the domain of private
interests, circumstances will probably induce more government and internationally agreed upon regulation.
I should like to say a few words about Canada-United
States tourism and some of the related figures, because it
is an inter-connecting link. Perhaps very few other areas
foster more good relations between Canada and the United
States than the cross-border tourism between the two
countries. Travel between the United States and Canada is
greater, in visits exchanged and in money spent, than
between any other two countries on the globe. Statistics
for January to November 1973 show that visitors from the
United States numbered 35.5 million, an increase of 2.7 per
cent from the previous year"' On the other hand, Canadian visitors to the United States for the same period
amounted to some 28,950,000. Further, in 1973 American
[Hon. Mr. Macnaughton.]

March 20, 1974

visitors spent about $1.1 billion in Canada while Canadians spent almost as much, $1.0 billion, in the United
States.""
In 1974 it is expected that if the gasoline shortage in the
United States persists it will discourage Canadians from
travelling south of the border. The possible lifting of the
Arab oil embargo however would undoubtedly alter this
somewhat. On the other hand, the apparent sufficient
supply of gasoline north of the border might attract
Americans to spend their vacations in Canada in large
numbers.
The Canadian Government Office of Tourism expects
group travel by plane, bus and train to increase as well
this year. It optimistically predicts that the 83 per cent of
its total tourist revenue now coming from the United
States will be doubled and perhaps redoubled in future
years. To build tourism from its No. 2 position, to Canada's
No. 1 source of export dollars, carefully planned expansion
and improvement of tourist facilities is required, along
with a greatly intensified program of promotion, the
Canadian Office of Tourism maintains.
While Canada-United States visitors have energy problems to overcome and the Canadian tourist industry has
environmental constraints to consider, it is evident that
because of the vast Canadian variety of attractions tourism between Canada and the United States will continue
to contribute to maintaining friendly relations between a
great many people on both sides of the border.
I should like to deal now with the subject of international parks. Perhaps nothing signifies the many years of
peace between Canada and the United States more than
the joint international parks that are found along the
Canadian-American border. Good examples of these are
the International Peace Garden straddling the ManitobaNorth Dakota border, and the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park between Alberta and Montana. In addition, the Roosevelt International Campobello Park off the
coast of New Brunswick, the summer home of the late
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, is becoming a shrine
for American visitors to the East Coast of Canada.
The International Peace Garden was originated by the
International Association of Gardeners who endorsed a
proposal for such a park in 1929. In 1930, 888 acres were
donated for the project by the State of North Dakota and
1,312 acres by the Province of Manitoba. More than 50,000
Canadians and Americans attended the dedication
ceremonies on July 14, 1932 when a cairn was unveiled
with the inscription, "To God in His Glory We Two
Nations Do Dedicate and Pledge Ourselves That as Long
as Men Shall Live We Shall Not Take Up Arms Against
One Another." The gardens of the park were sponsored by
a number of voluntary organizations. Trees from Mount
Vernon, the home of George Washington in Fairfax Country, Virginia, and Kingsmere, Quebec, the summer home of
Mackenzie King, are planted thereA) Apparently North
Dakota is planning to expand its part of the park, as part
of the United States bicentennial celebrations in 1976.
A peace park similar to the one on the Manitoba-North
Dakota border was also established in 1932 when the
Waterton Lakes National Park in Alberta and Glacier
National Park in Montana were reconstituted as the

March 20, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park covering some
1,754 square miles in this beautiful area of the country.(")
The Roosevelt-Campobello International Park was first
conceived by the late Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson
and President John F. Kennedy during the former's visit
to Hyannis Port. In 1964 Canada and the United States
signed an agreement establishing the Roosevelt-Campobello International Park. It is situated on the Island of
Campobello which makes up part of New Brunswick and
stands at the entrance of Passamaquoddy Bay which, as
already mentioned, was the subject of a boundary controversy between Canada and the United States at the beginning of this century. The park was subsequently dedicated
by Prime Minister Pearson and President Johnson. The
park, because it contains the former summer home of the
late Franklin Delano Roosevelt, has become an attraction
for American visitors.
The Roosevelt-Campobello International Park is being
restored and operated jointly by Canada and the United
States who share the operating and capital costs on a
fifty-fifty basis. The board of directors consists of three
Americans and three Canadians appointed by their respective governments. The chairmanship of the board continues for a period of two years and has been held by both
Senator Muskie from the State of Maine and Senator Alan
Macnaughton from Canada. Sovereignty and ownership,
of course, have remained in Canadian hands. The original
area of eight acres has been expanded to 3,000 acres. The
park, in addition to being a visiting place, is- also now
being expanded into a conference centre available to
groups from both sides of the border.
Now I have a very few remarks concerning the role of
the Canada-United States Interparliamentary Group. It
was during January 1959 that the former Governor-General, the Right Honourable Roland Michener, then Speaker
of the House of Commons, and Senator Aiken of Vermont,
started the Canada-United States Interparliamentary
Group. Since that time this group has shown great ability
in adapting itself to changing requirements on both sides
of the border. The Canada-United States Group offers an
important means of direct communication between members of the Canadian Parliament and members of the
United States Congress-an advantage few other countries, if any, enjoy. The Group can be convened quickly
and used for dealing with special problems on either side
of the border. For instance, when President Nixon
imposed the 10 per cent surcharge and introduced the
DISC program in August 1971, a special ad hoc meeting
was held in Washington on November 11 at the request of
Canadian members. On that occasion the Canadian delegation had the opportunity of bringing to their opposite
numbers in the United States the reasons why Canada
thought the surcharge and the DISC program should not
apply to Canada. It is on occasions like this that the
Canada-United States Interparliamentary Group has
proved its worth.«> Indeed, "in the past this has been an
unannounced, indirect but effective way of bringing to the
attention of our American friends and confreres problems
which exist between our two countries and of attempting
to reach a solution".4 7 )

*

(1630)

The contribution of the Canada-United States Interparliamentary Group was aptly described by Senator Allister
Grosart when he spoke on the motion presented by me
requesting a meeting to discuss the movement of Alaskan
oil down the West Coast of British Columbia, On that
occasion Senator Grosart said, "I have said on many occasions that I believe there is a great role in international
relations to be played on what I call the third level, the
parliamentary level, by parliamentarians as parliamentarians, rather than as cabinet ministers or members holding a specific responsibility in foreign affairs."4)
Senator Grosart's view can be substantiated by pointing
to the stated aims of the generic "Interparliamentary
Union" founded at the time of the first Interparliamentary
Conference for international arbitration held in Paris in
1889. The aim of the Interparliamentary Union was then,
and is today, "to promote personal contacts between members of all parliaments and to unite them in common
action to secure and maintain the full participation of
their respective states in the firm establishment and devel"49)
opment of democratic institutions ...
It is rather interesting to note that the founding conference of the Interparliamentary Union, on June 29 and 30,
1889, in expressing its first resolution questioned the role
of governments generally and suggested that more direct
representation of the commonweal was required. Its
founding resolution in part stated:
The conduct of governments tending more and more
no longer to be the expression of the ideas and feelings of the whole body of citizens, it is the responsibility of the electors, by exercising their choice, to direct
the policy of their countries towards justice, law and
the brotherhood of nations.">
Whether or not it is still as true today as it was in 1889, in
the light of the tremendous metamorphosis that Western
governments have undergone since then, the pertinent
question is that parliamentarians as representatives of the
people have a very definite role to play in matters of
international concern, even though the executive branches
of governments have or are already engaged in such international intercourse. International affairs should have a
parliamentary dimension. The consideration of international matters by such a body as the Canada-United States
Interparliamentary Group adds a very pertinent and
necessary democratic ingredient to the affairs of humanity
in an ever shrinking world.
Again, the contribution of the Canada-United States
Interparliamentary Group in its visit to Washington in
July 1973 amounted to very direct consultation involving a
clear and free discussion of a whole array of problems
while at the same time providing a tremendous opportunity to become informed, to persuade and perhaps even
influence. In such a forum parliamentarians can speak to
their opposite numbers with understanding on matters of
great national concern and urgency. Furthermore, " ..
relationships between the United States senators and representatives and Canadian senators and members of Parliament are apt to be on a much more permanent basis
than dealings between cabinet ministers, who change from
5
<)
year to year and from government to government."(

SENATE DEBATES
I want to refer briefly to the United States bicentennial
celebration in 1976. In the light of the two hundred years
of history between Canada and the United States, involving both mutual difficulties as well as mutual friendships,
and because of the fact that the American people are
Canada's closest neighbours who have in recent years
shared in the mutual defence of democracy and freedom,
the forthcoming bicentennial celebrations should involve
as great a contributory participation by Canada as by any
other country in the world. Indeed, the close association
between the members of the Canada-United States Interparliamentary Group should be the vehicle through which
the Canadian Parliament should forward its offer of participation to the United States Congress.
The current importance of parliamentary institutions
makes it paramount that the role of the United States
Congress and Congressmen, in maintaining the high
democratic ideals of the Republic, be acknowledged by
other international parliaments and the Canada-United
States Group is ideally situated to further such
recognition.
Perhaps as a first step the Canadian component of the
Canada-United States Interparliamentary Group could
form an ad hoc committee for the purpose of exploring
what the Canadian Parliament can contribute to the
United States celebrations and how it might be most
fitting for Canadian legislators to participate in this
bicentenary event.
Honourable senators, I have dealt rather extensively
with the historical record between our two nations in
order to lay the basis for further discussion at our meeting
to ba held this evening.
The historical record indicates we have come a long way
from the War of 1812-14, the 1844 election cry of "54-40 or
fight," the Fenian raids of the 1860s and the real danger
that the victorious Union Army would move north at the
end of the American Civil War. It was this fear that gave a
major impetus to bringing about Canadian Confederation.
Today our problems are, in the main, economic:
The bilateral problem of the fisheries.
The complexities of scheduling air transportation over
a Continent split into three nations.
The problems concerning oil and gas, pipelines, law of
the sea, Great Lakes pollution, agricultural quotas,
tax treaties, extradition treaties, phasing out of air
bases, and the defence communication in the far
north.
The problems of the Automotive Products Agreement
and of our bilateral trade accounts.
But, in spite of these problems and irritants, just let us
remember that in 1972 trade, both north and south,
amounted to $27 billion, up from $11 billion in 1965. This
amount of trade is greater than the total U.S. annual trade
with the European Community, including Great Britain. It
is almost as great as the whole U.S. trade with Asia and
Africa combined, and Asia includes Japan.
Look also at bilateral investment. At the end of 1971,
U.S. direct investment in Canada was almost $24 billion;
portfolio investment was $13 billion, and short-term funds
held in Canada by U.S. citizens were about $3 billion, for a
[Hon. Mr. Macnaughton.]

March 20, 1974

total of $40 billion. This is greater than U.S. investment in
any other country and is equivalent to almost one-quarter
of U.S. total foreign investment of $180 billion.
Canada had $3.3 billion worth of direct investment in
the U.S.-$3.1 billion in securities and $7.1 billion in liquid
claims, for a total of $13.5 billion.
With trade like this, no wonder we enjoy, along with the
United States, a high standard of living.
Adolph W. Schmidt, until recently the United States
Ambassador to Canada, in a speech said, in part:
I would conclude by reiterating the view that the
bilateral relationship is sound and healthy. We have
our differences, of course, which in the special way of
democratic societies we let each other know about.
As Prime Minister Pearson paraphased the usual
description of our open boundary: "We have the longest
border in the world for unguarded remarks".
The Ambassador continued:
The historical record of accommodation of our differences and of finding constructive ways of cooperation
is the best of any two countries in the world.
Long may this continue to our mutual benefit.

being repetitious, I should like to pay homage to the
Speaker of the Senate. As you know, Madam Speaker, I
followed your long and illustrious career, before you came
to the Senate, as a lawyer, as a public servant, and as a
person intensely interested and very successful in your
work with local and national organizations whose objectives were to provide a major contribution to the welf are
of many sections of the Canadian public.
Since my appointment to this house my admiration has
increased, and I have a feeling of intense pride when I
hear other senators express themselves, as they do, in such
a way that lets you know in what high regard and with
what deep respect you are held by them.
I read with a certain amount of chagrin-as a matter of
fact, I was aghast-a newspaper release the other day to
the effect that you may be contemplating leaving your
position some time during the latter part of May. I know
ail honourable senators, holding you in such high regard
as they do, will want to urge, along with me, that you
remain in the Chair so long as the law may permit you to
do so, without interfering in any way with your future
security.

I was very interested te hear and read in the Throne
Speech the references te the energy crisis, and particularly
the admonition that we must go beyond our concern for
the energy criais in our own country. Wbile the shurtages
of oil supplies, and certainly the sharp increase in oil
prices, cause serious problems in the industrialized parts
of the world, their effects on developing nations are disastrous. In a country sucb as India, an increase in the price
ut kerusene, which is a low grade petroleumn produet,
nieans that millions of pour peuple must lîterally choose
between lîght and beat and a supply of food on their
itabies.

Il bas been argued that the oil crisîs is not a reai crisîs,
that it was artificialiy created by those who stand to gain
by it financîally. While the ou -producîng ceuntries may
have încreased the price of petroleum products for polîtical motives, they would flot have been able te do 50 were it
not for a world-wide scarcity of oil as well as of other raw,%
materials. It is obvious that pruducors and consumera will
have to get together te find new ways cf conaervîng
existing energy, and to find new and alternative sources.
The severîty of the world situation demands that
Canada mauntaîn iîa international dovelopment efforts,
while adoptîng pregrama, as required, to meot the changing conditions. It is clearly in Canada's best interesta te do
se, net only because of oui, duty as a responsîble member
of the world cemmunîty, but also, as the Secretary of State
for External Affaira put it s0 well in Washington recently,
in vîew of the political consequences of serieus diatreas in
such a wîde area of our planet.
Although 1 congratulated my honeurable celleague from
New Brunswick, Senator Robîchaud, on the able manner
in which be moved the Addresa in reply to the Speech
from the Throne, I also meant te mention the seconder,
Senator Perrault, whe so ably performed his duty. He
presented us with preef of his excellent knewledge of the
problema of net only his part of the country but ahl cf
Canada. 1 thought it was a wonderful thing that he, as a
Westernor, gave lînguistie recognition te the ether foundîng nation cf Canada, by speaking, if only briefly, in the
French language. This is true Canadîanism.
1 was also impressed by the fact that the Tbrone Speech
pointed out that the înflationary trends, the înflatienary
prublerna we are facing today, are net reatrîcted te our
oxvn country. I think that is generally known, except
apparenily te a few peuple who speak in the other place
and toit the guvernment that it must arreat and roll back
înflatîenary prices, witheut efferîng logical and sane
solutions.

SENATE DEBATES

the present time is to do it in small stages, making every
endeavour we can, as the Minister of Agriculture has done
recently by subsidizing the prices of beef cattle. There are
many ways in which this can be done.
One of the things that amazes me, when we see oil
jumping in price to $6 and $10 a barrel-and it is going to
go higher-is the fact that we have a 15-cent levy paid to
the Ministry of Transport under the guise of a fund for the
protection of the environment. On every ton of crude oil
that comes into our refineries, of which I think there are
six in the Atlantic provinces, there is a levy of 15 cents.
When the same crude oil goes through the refineries and
comes out in the form of refined products, volatiles,
bunker C or what have you, it leaves the refinery and is
transported by water in the coastal trade or up the rivers,
and another 15 cents a ton levy is imposed.
No doubt this levy was first imposed because of panic by
the environmentalists. At the time it was a good idea,
because it followed on the great Chedabucto Bay disaster
off the coast of Nova Scotia. There has now been built up
over this period a fund of about $161/2 million. There has
not been one claim on that fund since, I believe, the
Chedabucto Bay disaster. The reason is that the shipping
and oil companies have themselves been policing the
transportation of oil. There have been small spills, which
have been cleaned up. If the spills were the fault of the oil
or shipping companies, they were cleaned up by those
companies under the supervision of officials of the Ministry of Transport.
There the fund rests. There it lies stagnant, waiting for a
major oil spill that can be blamed on the negligence of a
ship's captain or a shipping company or oil company
which allows a spill, probably at the connection where the
crude or volatiles are piped to and from the refinery. That
$16/2 million, if my figures are correct, should be permitted to remain in the treasury under the supervision of the
Ministry of Transport, but there should be a moratorium
declared now; and then, if we have major spills, impose
the levy again. The fund is there and it will take care of a
good many serious spills if they occur. But stop the payments now and allow the oil companies to absorb that 15
cents a ton or the double and sometimes triple levy on the
same shipment of crude. They might process it at a refinery, transship the refined product up to the coast to a
marine depot, and then transport that by a smaller ship
farther up the coast or up a river. Then you get the third
15-cent levy per ton on the same cargo of crude which
reaches the refinery. It does not make sense to me. If the
oil companies could be made to pass that saving of the
payment of the levy on to the consumers, I think that
would make a small but practical improvement in a
common sense way, giving at least some relief to the retail
price of petroleum products.

(1700)

Another thing which caused a great deal of confusion in
my mind recently was a statement I read in the Montreal
Gazette regarding freight assistance in the Atlantic provinces. I read the news and not always the views of the
columnists in that paper. This item appeared and may
have been a feeler sent out on a policy paper.
Let me give some of the background first. In 1970, under
the Atlantic Region Freight Assistance Act, the highway
transport people in the Atlantic provinces were granted a

subsidy of 1712 per cent for transportating freight, goods,
back and forth within the area of the Atlantic provinces
and including that portion of the province of Quebec that
is south of the St. Lawrence River and east of the town or
city of Lévis. I do not know what the Honourable Senator
Bourget would have to say about that. I do not know
whether it is a city or a town. It rests in the shadow of the
great Quebec Citadel.
This grant was given to most trucking concerns and
individual truckers in the Atlantic Region. It was designed
to maintain the freight rates that were in effect, and at the
time the companies co-operated, with few exceptions.
They maintained the level of freight rates until they were
hit by this spiralling inflation. The heaviest roll-up was
within the last year. They were told at the time that they
were going to get a 1712 per cent subsidy, with few exceptions, on all of their freight movements back and forth in
the Atlantic region, extending the line in Quebec but not
into Quebec City or Montreal. But they were told, "You
are going to have to take a reduction in this, probably
within a year or two; we do not know."
So the matter died and along came this galloping inflation. The price of tires rose by about 32 per cent last year.
There was a rise of probably 40 per cent in the price of
diesel fuel, and the price of gasoline rose something like 32
per cent as well. The owner-operator dominated this field.
The transport companies engaged them, because they have
what is known as a leasing authority whereby they can
rent their tractors to one of the companies which are
licensed and operate for hire under their licence. They
have been hit tremendously hard. I have enumerated only
a few of the escalating costs, and these do not include
wages. The cost of a tractor which hauls a trailer has risen
in a year by $3,000. And the other day along comes this
item in the Montreal Gazette:
Federal subsidies for freight rates on selected commodities shipped from the Atlantic provinces to central Canada will be boosted to 50 per cent from 30 per
cent about April 15, it was announced today.
The higher subsidy will apply to selected goods
ranging from raw fish to trailers westbound from the
Atlantic provinces, the transport department said in a
news release. The subsidy is for the region east from
Lévis, Que.
I do not know whether the truckers in Lévis are going to
benefit by it. The item continues:
The department said other subsidies for shipments
within the Atlantic region will be reduced to 15 per
cent from 17.5 per cent soon. This was alleged to be
part of a shifting of subsidy payments to make the
subsidy program more effective.
So, on the one hand you have an increase in subsidy on
freight movement from within the Atlantic area described,
into Central Canada, raising it from 30 to 50 per cent, and
you cut back on the poor truckers within the Atlantic
region who have had to raise their rates because of the
inflationary trends during the last year, as a result of
spiralling or galloping inflation, and who are faced now
with another increase in the rates. It is the only way they
can carry on. Yet we have this ridiculous policy statement-no one is named, but I presume it emanates from
someone within the Ministry of Transport-and I under-

SENATE DEBATES
stand it is to come into effect on April 15, reducing the
subsidy, forcing their rates up within the Atlantic region.
And they call that an effort to arrest inflation or to roll
back prices.
I am sure that the Minister of Transport is not aware of
the implications-that he is not aware of the deep concern
of the trucking industry within the Atlantic provinces, if
he allows an order in council to go through reducing that
subsidy from 1712 to 15 per cent. It is ridiculous. One of
my old school teachers used to use the words, "I call it a
lot of balderdash and flapdoodle." I do not know whether
the honourable senator who is president of Dalhousie
University would approve of those words, but they are in
Webster's dictionary, with the annotation afterwards that
they are of unknown origin.
Hon. Mr. Hicks: I use only the Oxford dictionary.
Hon. Mr. Riley: I have been Americanized. My mother
was American and I am half American. I tried to find a
similar phrase in the French language, and the best I can
come up with, with the assistance of a friend, is "de la
bouillie pour les chats." And that is what I think of this
contradictory policy of the Minister of Transport with
respect to the subsidy to the truckers of the Atlantic
provinces.
*

(1710)

Certainly, before an order in council is passed this
subsidy should be reviewed, because it evolved long before
these prices began to escalate. It evolved, I am sure, from a
meeting of the premiers of the Atlantic provinces several
years ago and bas since lain in a dusty corner of somebody's desk in the Ministry of Transport. It has now come
to light and somebody has probably said-and I am not
sure of this-"Oh, well, the premiers of the Atlantic provinces wanted this a few years ago. Don't you think it is
time we implemented it and reduced this subsidy and
increased the long-haul subsidy from 30 to 50 per cent?"
Well, I tell you that that is not going to work. I hope the
government will take another hard look at it.
There'is another aspect of transportation which bothers
me and which goes back to a decision of the Judicial
Committee of the Privy Council in 1952 in the Winner
Case. This was a decision which was not warmly welcomed everywhere but which was based upon section 92 of
the BNA Act According to that decision, and I suppose
they were probably right, the trucking industry, interproan interprovincial work and
vincially, constitutes
undertaking.
An act respecting extra-provincial motor vehicle transport was assented to on June 26, 1954. That act had to be
approved by the provinces. I believe it was eventually
approved by New Brunswick in 1956. It delegated to the
provinces the authority to regulate and license people
engaged in interprovincial highway transportation.
In the 1966-67 session the National Transportation Act
was passed-a great act. But in the original act there was a
Part III which was not proclaimed at the time. Subsequently, in 1968, a senior official of the Department of
Transport or of the commission met with me and the
secretary of my commission in Fredericton, at which time
he said that all the regulations would be ready within six
months, and he said that they would then let the provinces
[Hon. Mr. Riley.]

March 20, 1974

have a look at them. That was 1968. Since then there have
been a few meetings, and Part III of the National Transportation Act was actually proclaimed two years ago, but
we still haven't anything on the regulations. As a result,
we have a federal regulatory body without teeth. When
you ask questions you receive vague answers: "Well, we
cannot get accord among the provinces."
The late Charles Gavsie, who was one of the most
prominent public servants in this country, when posed
with a knotty problem by somebody sitting across from
him at his desk, somebody obviously worried, perhaps
about a client or about difficulties with the taxation division or something of that sort, would always say, "Well,
now, there is always a meeting place between earth and
heaven." And I have found that as long as men have
goodwill and sit around the table-and this applies to both
provincial and federal bodies and government agenciesso long as they have patience and forbearance and are
willing to give a little and take a little, there are workable
solutions to all of these problems.
I am sure, honourable senators, that Senator Martin will
agree with me in this regard, and I know that the great
negotiator Senator Goldenberg would also agree, because
both of these gentlemen have had vast experience in negotiating settlements of disputes which seemed to be beyond
the reach of settlement when they sat down but which
ended with workable and acceptable solutions.
I find that although Part III was proclaimed without
regulations, certain truckers are being permitted to pass
through the provinces on Sundays, "based on the merits of
the case" according to a press release. In my opinion,
definite rules should be laid down in this regard. Otherwise, the highways of the provinces will become clogged,
traffic will be disrupted and many more accidents will
occur over the weekends.
Certainly, there are emergency situations, but surely it
is obvious that most shipments of freight from one part of
the country to another can be scheduled so that they take
place from Monday to Saturday, leaving Sunday relatively
clear. Even with respect to fruit coming up from the
southern states there is no necessity for weekend transportation. Certainly, there was never any difficulty in the
past in that regard. Oh, occasionally one or two tractortrailers might move into the Atlantic provinces on a
Sunday, but this was rare indeed because the movement of
freight was properly scheduled and dispatched and there
were good dispatchers looking after the scheduling so that
il was not necessary, except on rare occasions, to move
freight through the provinces on Sundays and unnecessarily clogging the highways.
Somebody has said, and I will not quote him, that the
movement of commerce is more important than the general public interest or the convenience of Sunday drivers.
Well, that may be so, but I would hate to see any increase
of traffic on Sundays. There are tremendous movements
now of mobile homes along all our highways owing to the
upward trend in the purchase of mobile homes. For example, if someone from Quebec buys on Friday a mobile
home manufactured in New Brunswick, the movement of
that mobile home could likely take place over the Sunday,
but in my opinion it could be scheduled so that this need
not happen. So I hope with respect to that type of haulage,

March 20, 1974
March 20, 1974

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

as well as other types, that the authorities in Ottawa
responsible for the movement of the traffic will apply
some common sense and will prevent the highways from
being clogged by a glut of mobile homes, modular homes,
office trailers, bunk trailers and whatnot. If they control
that aspect of traffie, the provinces, under the various
motor vehicle acts, will be able to control the flow of
traffic involving the 14-foot widths, which no federal body
is authorized to control, since they cannot infringe upon
the motor vehicle legislation and regulations of the various provinces.
Honourable senators, I could have said much more on
this subject. I should like to express my deep appreciation
to Senator Bonnell for yielding to me. As an Islander, I
know he did it out of the warmth of his heart for another
Islander who migrated to another province. I am also
appreciative of others like Senator Phillips, even though
he made a remark or two in the dying days of the last
session decrying the movement of petroleum products
from New Brunswick to Maine. He meant well because he
is a great man and a great Islander, and I am very fond of
him, but I am very much afraid he did not do any research.
We had lots of petroleum products in New Brunswick this
winter, as was the case in Newfoundland and Nova Scotia.
None of us, to quote the well known expression, "froze in
the dark." We had some oil to export and we wanted to
export it to the pulp mills in Maine because we had good
reason for doing so. All along our western border and,
even more particularly, our southwestern border our
people move back and forth freely; they work in these
pulp mills and make their livelihood there. Many of our
farmers in the southwestern section of the province sell
their raw wood over there and work in the woods in New
Brunswick for these companies. There is an intense community of interest between southwestern New Brunswick,
northwestern New Brunswick and the western part of the
province generally with the people of Maine. We are, in
fact, in some ways rather like one people, in that some of
them come and work on our side of the border while some
of our people go across and work on their side. They are
part and parcel of what is almost an integrated community
and are an integral part of the economy of the whole
region. For that reason, I hope that in moments of panic
those who have to do with the issuing of permits for the
import and export of oil will investigate very carefully
before they jeopardize the jobs and the income of those
from New Brunswick who are gainfully employed in earning their livelihood on the other side of the border and sell
their raw wood there.

heartfelt gratitude for the warmth of the welcome accorded to us when we came to the Senate. As neophyte senators, if I may use that expression, we thought that we
would be brought in the back door and presented to you
quietly, but the grandiose manner in which we were
received and the warmth shown by all honourable senators, many of whom I have known for many years, left a
lasting impression on us.
I wish particularly to thank Senator Martin who spoke
so kindly of us and who also welcomed us so warmly. I

have a very, very fond feeling for Senator Martin because
when I was a young politician he taught me many political
tricksHon. Mr. Langlois: Perhaps that should be political
intrigue.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Others call it strategy.
Hon. Mr. Riley: He taught me how to campaign, as only
he could, because prior to coming to this august chamber
he was probably about the best campaigner I have ever
known. I remember one occasion when we were down in
the bowels of Albert County. I was on my first campaign
tour-and here I should point out that the people of that
county are very fine people, but we were not on the same
wavelength. I am speaking now of the people of Saint
John and the people of Albert County. Senator Martin told
me, "You know, you have gone into this farmhouse and
you have seen this man having trouble with a hawk going
after his hens. You may not be back here next year or the

year after, but some day you are going to come back, and
you are going to pick up that notebook you have in the car
and you are going to say, 'Here I am coming to the
farmhouse of John Jones and the first thing I will ask him
is whether that hawk is still bothering his chickens.'" That
is only one example. I should mention that this particular
farmer and I became very close friends and still are after

many years.
Hon. M. Lorne Bonnell: Honourable senators, I know
you are hungry, but I have a two-hour speech prepared. I
also know you will not mind coming back at 8 o'clock. I
shall probably carry on until close to 6 o'clock, and I am
sure you will all agree to our coming back at 8, or tomorrow if that means we shall not have to come back at 8
o'clock.
If Your Honour will forgive me for not saying all the
nice things I had intended to say about you, and just allow
me to say how nice it is to have you back, I can skip some
paragraphs. If the Leader of the Government will allow
me to say how nice it is to see him again, and the Leader of
the Opposition also, that will permit me to skip another
three paragraphs. Perhaps I can say to Senator Flynn that
I don't think he is so hungry that he would start to eat
grits.
I would like to mention my good friend, the mover of the
motion for the Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne. The excellence of his speech did not surprise me
in the least, because I knew he was capable of it. There is
no need to go further, and that allows me to drop four
more paragraphs. We all heard the seconder, and he
excelled himself, as we knew he would.
I have four or five paragraphs on my good friend from
New Brunswick, who was originally an Islander, and who
has just become a member of the Senate, and whom we
have just heard speak, but I shall skip them and simply
say that since this country was born in 1864 at Charlottetown we Islanders have been true Canadians. Today he
said that the seconder of the motion spoke partly in
French, and that that made him a true Canadian. Let me
say that I don't speak French and I don't understand it,
but so that I may continue to be a true Canadian I have
had my honourable friend prepare a short paragraph

a program in Prince Edward Island Nhich 1 helieve is
worthy of study arîd thought hy other provinces of

the trade. In this manner we are able to, provide cheap
housing and at the same time teach unskilled people a
trade, and they receive pay during the course of instruction. In my opinion, it is a programn well worth prcmoting
in other parts of the country.
It is wonderful to, see in the Speech from the Throne
that the government is going to give further consideration
te transportation problems, that regional disparity will be
investigated very closoly, and that we in the East and in
the West will agaîn receive favourable consideration and
recognition that our problems are greater than those of
central Canada. However, I hope the gevernment does flot
forget the island provinces of Prince Edward Island and
Newfoundland, and realizes that we need transportation
to and from those islands by boat. We need more ferries. If
anything happens to the prosont ferry to Prince Edward
Island, the Abegweit, we are lost in the winter months; we
are lost when strikes occur. We need more ferries for our
island provinces, and we need themn soon. The planning
should be taking place now.
We also need a better air service between the capital
cities of the Maritime provinces, and to the remaînder of
Canada. We need better air services direct from Ottawa to
our uapitals. to Toronto, and te the cities to the south, such
as Boston and New York. In this day and age, travel by air
is becomiiîg more and more popular. and more and more
we in the East need a better, more up-te date service. I
hope the Mînîster of Transport will look into these matters
and mnake sure that wo are flot neglectod. Air Canada
forgets that Prince Edward Island is a province althougb
t colis itse]t the national airlîne. I do net see how it can be
the national airlîne when it serves only certain provinces
of1 this nîation.
1 %vant te say aiso, honourable senators. that I was
pleased te sec in the Speech from the Throne that the
goverfiment intends te take another look at the Unemployment Insurance Act. 1 hope, that they will look at it in ail
aspects. It may be that somoone drew unemployment
insurance and went te British Columbia on a ski safari,
but that is ne roason toecut off everyone in Prince Edward
Island from unemployment insuranco henefîts.
The population of our province livos basically from the
soîl. the top six inches of the land, and from the sea. In the
wînter we do net fish. I ain net telling you what we are alI
doîng, but we are net fishing. Whon we do net fish there is
ne fish packed, and when there is ne fish packed the
factoî ies close. When the factories close the workers are
cut off from unemployment insurance benefits because
they are net attempting te fînd werk, How can they find
work whon there îs ne work?
One et the regulations states that reasonable efforts
must be made te obtaîn employment. One could spend a
foirtune runnîîîg ari)und Prince Edward Island trying te
[mnd a factory that is packing fisb in the winter. If one dîd
[mnd one. ît must have brought mn fish from the seuth.
Howcvor, because a reasonable effort te find employment
is flot made, onemploy ment insurance benefîts are cut off.
Most cf the factories durîng the sommer prevîde transportation assistance by sending buses around te take the
people te werk.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: Yes, the Shaw geverniment started it.

March 20,1974

Marc 20,1974SENATE
DEBATES

Hon. Mr'. Bonneli: The Shaw government started it?
Hon. Mr'. Phillips: Yes.
Hon. Mr'. Bonneil: I thought it was private enterprise
that did that.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: Anyway, it was a Conservative
government.
Hon. Mr'. Bonneli: That is flot what they did that I
remember.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: But that is your difficulty, senator.
You have a very short memory.
Hon. Mr. Bonneli: Honourable Senators, my good friend
fromn Prince Edward Island knows full well that these
buses are owned and operated flot by goverfiment, but by
private enterprise.
Hon. Mr'. Phillips: They receive subsidies.
* (1740)

Hon. Mr'. Bonneli: Because tbey have no transportation
to get to work in the winter, tbey are cut off again. They
are cut off because tbey cannot get transportation to take
tbem to work. The regulations say that they must make a
reasonable effort to find employment, and tbey must also
f ind their own transportation. If a man is colour blind, and
tbereby cannot obtain a driver's licence, be bas no transportation by whicb to get to work. There are nio buses,
trains, or commuter systems. In some areas the only means
of transport is the skidoo. If a man cannot find a way to
get to work some 30 miles away, he cannot draw unemployment insurance.
Honourable senators, that is flot the intention of the act.
The intention of the act was to ensure that those who are
legitimately unable to find work sbould receive the benefût of unemployment insurance. Now, simply because
someone at some place obtained a f ew easy dollars, everyone at every place must pay the penalty.
I should like to suggest that when the review takes place
it should take into consideration tbe great and small
distances, and the isolation of some areas. Regulations for
such areas sbould not be tbe same as those made for areas
such as Toronto and Montreal, which have commuter systems, bus and train systems, and even subway systems.
The regulations sbould be so framed as to provide for rural
areas such as the soutbeast portion of Prince Edward
Island. The regulations, as they now exist, do not make
sense.
Honourable senators, I feel also that some f ishermen in
Prince Edward Island do not receive justice. Possibly the
same thing applies to fishermen in Newfoundland. Some
f ishermen in Prince Edward Island are able to make f rom
$11,000 to $25,000 per year. If they do, they get the biggest
stamp, they draw the largest unemployment benefit, and
they enjoy a pretty good winter. But the poor fisherman,
who works every day and just as hard, who puts out bis
nets and bauls tbem in day af ter day, may be operating in
poor fishing grounds. He may not have the best equipment
to start with. He may have a poor year. He receives the
smallest stamp, and the smallest unemployment benefit.
Yet be works j ust as hard, fishing througb stormy seas, to
keep himself in employment. Simply because his luck bas
run out, or because be was f ishing in poor fishing ground,

be ends up witb a smaller stamp and less unemployment
insurance benef it.
If a man does a just day's work he should receive a just
day's pay-or at least a just stamp-and receive the same
benefits as those who enjoy a gond year in the fisbing
industry.
In the area in wbich I live 124 people bave been cut off
from unemployment benefits during tbe past two weeks
because a factory brought in a load of f isb from outside
and needed 20 employees.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: Did you not get tbat corrected?
Hon. Mr'. Bonneil: Yes, we got it corrected. We contacted tbe unemployment insurance authorities. Tbey said,
"We will put on a bus and will try to bus themn to work.' A
bus was put on. It started out at 6 o'clock in the morning,
drove 65 miles and arrived at the plant at 8 o'clock. The
bus returned at 7 o'clock, and took two bours and 15
minutes tn travel the 65 miles along rural winding roads.
Had that not been done, those employees would bave lost
their unemployment insurance benef its.
I do not believe that sort of thing falîs witbin the
meaning of the act. I would like to see more discretion
given in the interpretation of tbe act. Mucb of the problem
arises because of the regulations made under the act.
I would like to speak also about land use. My bonourable friend, Senator Norrie, is very interested in this
subject. However, it might be discussed more appropriately later by notice of motion, and dealt witb as a separate
subject.
I sbould like also to speak briefly about bigbway safety.
Higbway accidents represent tbe third greatest killer in
Canada. This is a subject to whicb we sbould give some
thought. Tbe Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welf are and Science sbould examine this problem, and in
doing so give consideration to tbe fact that since the speed
limit in tbe Ulnited States was lowered to 55 miles an bour
tbe death rate bas been lowered considerably. It should
look also at safety standards for scbool buses and cars, and
at road conditions. Proper standards should be set wbicb
attacb more importance to people's lives than is attacbed
today.
I was pleased to see in the Speech from the Tbrone that
money will be made available for tbe removal of train
tracks in our municipalities. I would suggest that railway
tracks and crossings be removed from those bighways
which are heavily used by traffic, because many deatbs
result from collisions between cars and trains. Too many
young people are killed. If even one if e can be saved, it
will be worth the time of tbe Senate committee in studying this matter.
A good deal of researcb is taking place on this subject.
Tbe results of sucb researcb could be studied by tbe
committee and passed on to a joint conference of federal
and provincial governments with a view to introducing
legislation, because problems concerning higbway safety
are mostly of a provincial nature or jurisdiction.
I am not in favour of the compulsory wearing of seat
belts, a matter wbicb is to be considered by the Ontario
Legislature. I believe in tbe protection of human rigbts. A
man should be able to use a seat belt if be so wisbes, but I
do not believe be sbould be forced to do so if it is against

SENATE DEBATES
his wish. Some Canadians suffer from claustrophobia, and
if they are forced to wear a seat belt they might die from
fear. They should be permitted to live in the hope of not
having an accident, rather than die of fear from the effects
of claustrophobia. More and more of our rights are being
taken from us, and increasingly we are losing some of
those rights which we should retain. I do not like to see
any provincial legislature take away the right of free
choice in the use of seat belts.
Honourable senators, I wish now to talk about tuna
fishing. Last year Senator Phillips went out with a group
of senators to catch tuna.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: And very successfully, naturally.
Hon. Mr. Bonnell: Prince Edward Island has the record
for the largest tuna caught by rod and reel in Canadian
waters. The former Governor General, the Right Honourable Roland Michener, during his term of office, presented
a trophy for the largest tuna caught in Canadian waters.
That trophy has been held regularly by Prince Edward
Island, except for one year when the tuna went south and
was caught in Nova Scotia waters.
Tuna fishing is very remunerative for fishermen, who
receive approximately 90 cents per pound for the fish.
Honourable senators can imagine the value of 1,000 pounds
of tuna at 90 cents per pound. Tuna is sold in Japan for
approximately $3 per pound.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: Fifteen dollars. Pardon me, senator; I
am sorry for interrupting your remarks, but by the time
the fish has arrived in Japan, having been frozen and
flown out, it is worth $15 per pound. I mention that merely
because I am in sympathy and in agreement with your
remarks, not to disagree with you.
Hon. Mr. Bonnell: Thank you, senator. You are always
in sympathy with my remarks, and I appreciate it.
* (1750)

Hon. Mr. Phillips: Not always. Sometimes you are
reasonable.
Hon. Mr. Bonnell: I would just comment that if the
price has gone up to $15 a pound in Japan, that is really
inflation.
In any event, the point I wanted to bring forth was that
I am pleased to be able to say that the Minister of the
Environment, who is also responsible for fisheries, the
Honourable Jack Davis, has agreed to control commercial
fishing of tuna in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in the year 1974.
Tuna is to be caught only by rod and reel with a 130-pound
test line. This, of course, will mean that sport fishing will
continue, and commercial fishing may still be carried on,
provided it is done by rod and reel.
I should like to suggest that the Minister of the Environment send a research team to Newfoundland, Nova Scotia,
and Prince Edward Island, to determine the potential for
tuna. Even New Brunswick has some tuna. It may be that
we will overfish it or over-exploit it. We need more information; we need some research. For those reasons, we have
asked the federal department concerned to give it some
thought.
Honourable senators, I see it is now 6 o'clock. I thank
you for listening to me. I do not intend to adjourn the
[Hon. Mr. BonnelL]

March 20, 1974

debate and bring the Senate back this evening. Rather, I
will now close my remarks.
Hon. Orville H. Phillips: Honourable senators, I have
the greatest respect for Senator Bonnell as a medical
practitioner, but I would suggest that he have his eyes
examined, because if he looks at the clock he will see that
we have not yet reached 6 o'clock. Therefore, I am still
entitled to speak in this debate. I might go on for one or
two minutes beyond 6 o'clockThe Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, it is now 6
o'clock. Pursuant to rule 12 I intend to leave the Chair
until 8 o'clock this evening, unless the Senate, by unanimous consent, decides to complete this afternoon's business now.
Is there unanimous consent?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: Thank you for your courtesy. I assure
you my remarks will not be extended.
I should like to sum up the debate by referring to the
opening day. On that occasion I watched both the Prime
Minister and the Leader of the Government in the Senate
as they sat in their chairs on either side of the Throne.
They both seemed uneasy. They kept looking at His Excellency the Governor General to see if he was doing the
right thing-at least that was my impression. But what
was really bothering both the Prime Minister and the
Leader of the Government in the Senate was the fact that
they thought someone had made a mistake and had passed
His Excellency the Governor General the same Speech
from the Throne as had been read a year earlier. Having
heard it before, they could not believe they were hearing it
again.
There were a couple of minor differences in the latest
Speech from the Throne, one of which was the proposed
anti-inflationary measures. For once I thought that perhaps the government was really going to deal with inflation. However, when the main estimates came out for the
fiscal year ending March 31, 1975, showing an increase of
20 per cent in the estimates, I realized that the government
had been influenced by the winds of the ski slopes of
Europe. That, honourable senators, can only be called
"windy."
Later on in the Speech from the Throne, the government
referred to the necessity of increasing farm production,
subsidies, and so forth. My immediate reaction was that
this was the "fishy" part of the Throne Speech. In the
event that some honourable senators do not understand
my remarks, I should explain that when a Maritimer hears
a remark he does not believe he says it is fishy, because he
does not believe or appreciate the odour from decaying
fish. The reference to agriculture can be summed up, I
think, by saying it was fishy.
Strangely enough, about the same time the Throne
Speech was being written, both the Prime Minister and
the Leader of the Government in the Senate were scuba
diving or fishing in the Caribbean. I think that is where
the fishy part of the Throne Speech originated.
I should like to refer to a number of remarks made by
honourable senators throughout this debate. At times I
thought the debate was dull, repetitious and needless. But
when one considers that we have had the same Throne

March 20, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

Speech, essentially, for the past three years, one cannot
criticize honourable senators for making the same speech
again and again.
When I first came to Parliament as very much a greenhorn-and honourable senators, was I green when I came
to the House of Commons!-Senator Riley's sister, the late
Mary Riley, was my first secretary. She taught me a great
deal about Parliament, parliamentary procedure and government. One thing I remember the late Mary Riley for
was her advice to me to respect the public service, to
forget the ministers and deputy ministers and to deal with
the individual who is going to make the recommendation
on policy.
I would just like to suggest to Senator Riley, who completed his remarks a few moments ago, that he should
remember his late sister's remarks; he should know the
people he is dealing with and talk to them.
* (1800)

I honestly mean this, honourable senators. She was of
immense value to me; she helped me in many ways. There
is no need for special mention of women in the Throne
Speech. Every man I know who has been fortunate enough
to have met such a woman will agree.
Senator Bonnell has just completed his remarks. I have
known the honourable senator for a number of years. I
was of the opinion that he was going through some sort of
Kung Fu method of self-defence, and that he was being
taught by the Honourable Senator Martin. He bas just
concluded what was, for me at least, one of his better
speeches. Usually he is a specialist in exaggeration and
irresponsibility. Today he modified his remarks and did
very well in presenting the Island viewpoint. The only
thing is, I find myself in agreement with two or three of
his remarks, which causes me some concern.
Honourable senators, I will conclude with two brief
requests. I cannot make these remarks with the idea that
either the Senate or the public will listen to me-I have
been around here too long to think that. Perhaps I could
refer to our Orders of the Day to show why we are not
being heard. Honourable senators, we are wasting too
much time on Inquiries. It makes me sick to see this
inquiry in the name of the Honourable Senator Hicks. One
would think that he was the Columbus of the Maritimes,
and that he founded the United Nations. God knows, he
could not find his way down the street unless there were
mercury lights all over the place.
Look at the next one, in the name of the Honourable
Senator Deschatelets, P.C.-"francophonie". Have we
found anything new in in the term "francophonie"?
Then let us look at the third one, which fills pages,
paragraph after paragraph, in the name of the Honourable
Senator Argue. It is meaningless. Why waste time on it?
Honourable senators, I appreciate your courtesy in listening to me, and in extending me the courtesy of going
beyond the six o'clock deadline. I have made one request
of you. I am now about to make a second. The second one
is even more important than the first, although I ask you
to join me in both.
Several years ago the publicity people elected a new
Prime Minister. Senator Martin will, I am sure, join me in
confirming how much money went to buying publicity for

the idea of a new horizon, a new star, a new dawn. The
person who bought his way into the new dawn, who
convinced thousands and thousands of Canadian voters
that there was going to be a new dawn, has not provided
that new dawn.
Last year we became aware, through great publicity,
that a new comet was coming on the scene. The comet
Kohoutek was going to provide new horizons, a bright star
in the western sky in the evening. The comet Kohoutek
turned out to be similar to the Government of Canada.
Honourable senators, neither of them was too bright.
There is one exception. The comet had the good common
sense to buzz off into outer space, and most of the Canadian people are wishing that the Canadian government
would do the same thing.
Everyone has heard the remarks of the Honourable
Senator Martin. In fact, a great many honourable members
of this chamber have boasted about his influence in the
government and in the Liberal Party. May I suggest that
you all join meThe Hon. the Speaker: I am sorry, honourable senator,
but you have far exceeded the two minutes for which you
had permission to speak. I think I should bring that to
your attention.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: Thank you, Madam Speaker. I realize
that is one of my faults. After all, it is so easy to be carried
away. I will finish in 30 seconds, if I may.
The Hon. the Speaker: I think many honourable senators have appointments they are anxious to keep.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Adjourn until eight o'clock then. The
rules provide that if at six o'clockThe Hon. the Speaker: I have already called it six
o'clock. I think you were out of the chamber at the time.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: If you call it six o'clock, we should
adjourn until eight o'clock.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: There was unanimous consent to
continue.
The Hon. the Speaker: I know, Senator Flynn, but with
unanimous consent we can go on, and unanimous consent
was given to continue for two minutes, I think in your
absence.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: He was just concluding.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: May I say, honourable senators, I
would urge Senator Martin to impress upon the present
Cabinet the necessity of joining Kohoutek in outer space
and oblivion.
The Hon. the Speaker: It is moved by the Honourable
Senator Robichaud, P.C., seconded by the Honourable
Senator Perrault, that the following Address be presented
to His Excellency the Governor General of Canada:
To His Excellency the Right Honourable Jules
Léger, Chancellor and Principal Companion of the

adjourned until Tuesday, March 26, at 8 o'clock in the
evening.
Honourable senators, before the question is put I should
like to give a brief outline of our program of work for next
week. First, we will continue with the second reading of
Bill S-2, an Act to amend the Animal Contagious Diseases
Act and Bill S-3, an Act respecting the use of national
safety marks in relation to motor vehicle tires and to
provide for safety standards for certain motor vehicle tires
imported into or exported from Canada or sent or conveyed from one province to another.
In addition it is expected that by Wednesday two supply
bills will reach the Senate, one covering supplementary
estimates (B) for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1974,
and one for interim supply on the main estimates for the
fiscal year ending March 31, 1975.

The Standing Senate Committee on National Finance
will examine and report upon the aforesaid supplementary
estimates (B), and a number of the standing committees
will hold organization meetings.
On Tuesday night Senator Aird will move the motion
standing in his name to authorize the Standing Senate
Committee on Foreign Affairs to examine and report upon
Canadian relations with the United States. It is expected
that the Minister of External Affairs will appear before
this committee on Thursday next.
Senator Lamontagne will proceed with the motion to
reconstitute the Senate Special Committee on Science
Policy, following the motion I just made on his behalf, to
organize and hold a conference for the purpose of determining the feasibility of establishing a Commission on the
Future.
Lastly, I am informed that Senators Hicks, Deschatelets
and Argue will speak to the inquiries standing in their
respective names on the Order Paper.
Hon. Mr. Rowe: Honourable senators, I should like to
direct a question to the Leader of the Government, which
I realize may be difficult to answer at this time. Can any
information be given now, particularly for the benefit of
senators living in the distant parts of the country, with
regard to the Easter recess? Travel is heavy during Holy
Week, with students going home, and so on, and if reservations are not made well in advance one is just out of luck.
Could the Senate be given any information in this regard,
please?

e

(1410)

Hon. Mr. Martin: No time has yet been fixed for the
Easter recess. The usual practice is not to sit on Good
Friday. Whether we shall sit on Holy Thursday is yet to be
determined. It all depends on what comes before us and
the progress made.
Hon. Mr. Asselin: Does the leader know if the Prime
Minister will call an election before Easter?
Motion agreed to.

QUEBEC PROVINCIAL POLICE
FINANCIAL COMPENSATION FOR MAINTENANCE-QUESTION
ANSWERED
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, on March 13
last, the Leader of the Opposition asked, in my absence, a
question about the decision made by the Solicitor General
on the question he was asked by the Quebec Minister of
Justice.
The answer will undoubtedly be considered unacceptable by my friend, but here is the reply that the Solicitor
General sent me this morning:

SENATE DEBATES
To this day, the federal government has not finalized its answer as concerns the request made by the
Quebec Minister of Justice as regards financial compensation for the maintenance of Quebec police forces.
I urged the Solicitor General to give me a more complete
answer soon, otherwise the Leader of the Opposition will
ask me another question on this matter.

FORT-FALLS BRIDGE AUTHORITY
CONSTRUCTION OF NEW INTERNATIONAL BRIDGE-QUESTION
Hon. Mr. Everett: Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government. The Fort-Falls
Bridge Authority Act is an act respecting the construction
of an international highway bridge between Fort Frances,
Ontario, and International Falls, Minnesota, to replace the
private toll bridge owned by the International Bridge and
Terminal Company.
What action is being taken to build the new bridge as an
entry into Canada from the United States to replace the
present privately owned toll bridge entry?
I spoke to the Leader of the Government prior to the
sitting of the house, and I imagine he will wish to take the
question as notice.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Yes, I shall take that question as
notice.
ANIMAL CONTAGIOUS DISEASES ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Fred A. McGrand moved the second reading of
Bill S-2, to amend the Animal Contagious Diseases Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose of this bill is
to provide authority to regulate the care and treatment of
animals while in transit for the purpose of reducing the
incidence of sickness and disease. In addition, a number of
areas in the act are being clarified and strengthened in
order to assure the necessary authority for adequate protection of the Canadian livestock population against serious epizootic diseases.
The Animal Contagious Diseases Act was first passed by
Parliament in 1869 as an "Act Respecting Contagious Diseases Affecting Animals." Amendments have been made
since that time, and the name changed to the Animal
Contagious Diseases Act. The present act is the vehicle
through which Canada has been able to eradicate and
control the major diseases affecting animals. This act is
essential for the well-being of the Canadian livestock
industry with regard to both domestic production and
international trade.
The first purpose of the bill, to provide authority to
regulate the care and treatment of animals in transit, is
dealt with in sections 31, 32, 33 and 34.
The remaining sections of the bill deal with a number of
items already in the existing Animal Contagious Diseases
Act but which, in the opinion of the legal authorities of
the Department of Justice, need clarification.
These items are for the purpose of:
(1) Clarifying definitions with respect to animal
semen, poultry, other birds, bees, reptiles and hatching eggs.
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

March 21, 1974

(2) Authorizing the Governor in Council to regulate
the importation, quarantine, destruction, disinfection
or
purification
of
animal
products,
animal
by-products, fodder, fodder packing, and other articles
and things likely to introduce infectious and contagious diseases.
(3) Regulating the exportation of animals for the
prevention of disease.
(4) Establishing areas for the inspection, segregation, and testing of animals for tuberculosis, brucellosis, and any other infectious and contagious diseases.
(5) Regulating the conduct and operation of zoos
and game farms for the prevention of animal diseases.
(6) Requiring every operator of a dairy, creamery,
or cheese factory, to supply samples of milk or cream
for inspection for disease testing.
(7) Prescribing sanitary and health measures for
artificial insemination centres to authorize the inspection, testing, and segregation of animals kept at the
centre and to prescribe the records to be kept concerning collection, storage, and sale of animal semen.
(8) Regulating the manufacture, distribution, and
importation of veterinary vaccines.
(9) Regulating the introduction of garbage and also
the use of garbage in the feeding of swine and poultry.
(10) Authorizing an inspector to enter the premises
and carry out the provisions of the act, the regulations, and any orders made by the Governor in Council or by the minister.
(11) Regulating the construction, operation and
maintenance of animal deadyards and rendering
plants, including the packaging and marketing of
products of such yards.
(12) Regulating meat lockers on ships in Canadian
waters to prevent the introduction of foreign animal
diseases.
Through the implementation of the provisions of this
act, Canada has achieved an animal health status recognized as equal to the best in the world. As a result of this
animal health status, livestock and livestock products are
acceptable in practically all countries of the world. In 1972,
the last year for which total figures are available, veterinary certification with respect to the health of Canadian
livestock and livestock products provided for the export of
such livestock and livestock products to 117 countries,
with a total value of approximately $800 million.
It is therefore essential to the well-being of the Canadian lifestock industry that a strong act providing for eradication and control of animal diseases be maintained.
Further, it should be noted this bill amends the name of
the present Animal Contagious Diseases Act to "An Act
respecting infectious or contagious diseases affecting animals and the protection of animals." This new name more
clearly describes the purpose of the act as amended.
As the amended Animal Contagious Diseases Act now
becomes the instrument through which the transportation
of livestock is controlled, sections 404 and 405 of the
Criminal Code, which presently deal with these responsibilities, are being repealed by this bill.

Finally the Livestock Shipping Act, which presently
deals with the shipping of livestock out of Canada by ship,
is being repealed inasmuch as these responsibilities will
now come under the provisions of the amended Animal
Contagious Diseases Act.

MOTOR VEHICLE TIRE SAFETY BILL
SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED
Hon. Joan Neirnan moved the second reading of Bill
S-3, respecting the use of national safety marks in relation
to motor vehicle tires and to provide for safety standards
for certain motor vehicle tires imported into or exported
from Canada or sent or conveyed from one province to
another.
She said: Honourable senators, Bill S-3, of which I have
the honour to move second reading this afternoon, is
extremely important to everyone who uses Canada's roads
and highways. It is a sequel and is complementary to the
more general Motor Vehicle Safety Act, which was passed
by this chamber just over four years ago.
In 1967 the Department of Transport assumed responsibility for all aspects of road and motor vehicle traffic
safety that fell within the jurisdiction of the federal government. Following a study defining the limits of its own
jurisdiction, the department instituted a series of collective and individual consultations with the ten provincial
departments responsible for motor vehicle administration
and highway safety in order to determine the means
whereby the federal government could make the greatest
and most effective contribution to their common goal.
In January 1969, the Minister of Transport met with his
provincial counterparts in Quebec City, and there the ten
provincial ministers endorsed the proposal that the federal
government assume an expanded role in setting and maintaining uniform standards, not only with respect to highway safety generally but specifically for the manufacture
and importation of motor vehicles and their components.
It was also agreed that the federal government should
conduct and coordinate traffic safety research and promote international cooperation in all these areas. These
proposals were confirmed by the ministers at a subsequent
meeting in Fredericton. The Motor Vehicle Safety Act,
which honourable senators considered and approved some
years ago, was the result of that federal-provincial
agreement.
The essence of the Motor Vehicle Safety Act, passed in
March 1970 and proclaimed on January 1, 1971, is that it
provides the federal government with the authority to
write and enforce safety standards for new motor vehicles
manufactured in, or imported into, Canada after January
1, 1971. Because in previous discussions the provinces had
agreed to continue being responsible for maintaining and
enforcing the safety standards of vehicles on the road, as
well as of replacement and additional parts for those
vehicles, the Motor Vehicle Safety Act is limited in its
application.
It does not provide jurisdiction over what are known as
after-market tires-that is, tires other than those fitted to
a new vehicle as original equipment. We would all agree

that tires are one of the components which, on the one
hand, are vital to the safe operation of motor vehicles, and,
on the other hand, are susceptible to latent defects, which
manufacturers or distributors might be liable to overlook
and consumers not to recognize. Since it is almost inevitable that the tires will need to be replaced on every motor
vehicle during its lifetime of use, it is important that the
safety standards of the replacement tires be equal to those
of the originals.
So, as we see, since the passage of the Motor Vehicle
Safety Act, the safety standards of tires fitted to new
vehicles have been regulated by the federal government,
but those of replacement tires remained under the jurisdiction of the provincial governments. Unfortunately, the
provincial governments soon realized that they face an
almost impossible administrative task. Apart from their
other qualities of mobility, tires are also an extremely
mobile market commodity. In addition to the numbers
which are imported, the fact that domestic production is
confined to about six manufacturing plants in Canada
made it inevitable that the provinces would face jurisdictional problems in attempting to deal with shipments
which crossed international or interprovincial boundaries.
From a practical standpoint as well, none of the provinces
have acquired the necessary facilities for testing tires. The
result has been that this large area of the after-market has
not been regulated by proper safety standards, and that
Canada has been vulnerable to the dumping of unsafe
tires on its consumers.
The provincial governments have been as concerned as
the federal government about the critical role played by
tires in providing for the safe operation of a motor vehicle,
and they have requested the federal government to
assume responsibility for the regulation of after-market
tires in the same way it has for new tires. The government
was happy to accede to that request because it recognized
the need for minimum safety standards for all tires to
enable consumers to buy replacement tires anywhere in
Canada with the same assurance that they have when
purchasing new vehicles.
Since the Motor Vehicle Safety Act came into force, the
federal government has gathered evidence showing that
significant reductions in motor vehicle accidents, injuries
and deaths can be effected through the provision of safety
standards for motor vehicle tires at the point of manufacture. Between April 1972 and September 1973, eighty lines
of original equipment tires were tested and found to be in
compliance with existing federal standards for new passenger car tires.
Although replacement tires have not been regulated
under the present act, an extension program of testing
after-market tires was undertaken by the ministry during
this same period on behalf of the provincial departments
responsible for motor vehicle administration. In that
survey it was found that up to March 1973, twenty-two of
353 replacement tires tested did not meet the federal
standards for tires on new cars. The tests indicate that
replacement tires generally have been inferior to new car
original equipment tires.
Honourable senators, the Minister of Transport, Mr.
Marchand, undertook that his ministry officials would
work with their provincial counterparts to remedy the

SENATE DEBATES
situation. It is, therefore, in response to requests from the
provinces, and in the interests of traffic safety in Canada,
that the present bill is offered for your consideration.
Before going into some of the details of Bill S-3, I should
like to say that while ministry officials were drafting the
Motor Vehicle Safety Act and its accompanying regulations, it was careful to ensure that the safety standards set
were at least equal to, and in conformity with, the standards already set for similar motor vehicles in the United
States. It will be appreciated that there is a substantial
export and import exchange of motor vehicles across the
international border, and because of this it is essential
that our standards be uniform and mutually recognized. In
drafting Bill S-3, which is almost identical in wording to
its parent act, the same considerations have obtained and
will be continued when the necessary regulations are
drawn.
a (1430)

Bill S-3 uses the same definitions for "motor vehicle,"
"manufacturer," "distributor" and "importer" as are found
in the Motor Vehicle Safety Act. It also defines a tire as
being "any tire, made of rubber, chemicals and fabric and
steel or other materials, that is designed to contain a gas or
liquid".
Furthermore, the bill is directed toward the same classes
of persons and companies as its parent act.
This bill would give the Government of Canada authority to prescribe safety standards to regulate the design,
construction, safety performance and labelling of motor
vehicle tires for the purposes of protecting persons against
personal injury, impairment of health or death. The standards which must be observed in order to meet this objective are not set out in the bill. They are now in the course
of preparation by the Ministry of Transport and can be
introduced quite quickly and easily as the initial regulations under this legislation.
All classes of motor vehicles will, or can eventually, be
covered by appropriate regulations setting out minimum
levels of safety and labelling requirements. For practical
reasons, the initial standards will be identical to those
currently being enforced for new motor vehicles under the
Motor Vehicle Safety Act.
The act establishes a national tire safety mark as a trade
mark which will be the exclusive property of Canada.
Under the act, regulations will be made respecting the use
of the national tire safety mark on prescribed classes of
tires, such as specific types and sizes of passenger car
tires, motorcycle tires and heavy duty highway vehicle
tires. The use of the mark will imply compliance by the
tire manufacturer with the prescribed safety standards.
The form of the mark as well as its location on the tire will
be prescribed, together with the need for marking the date
of manufacture on the tire. Misuse of the national tire
safety mark will be an offence.
I have considerable detail here, honourable senators, on
the provisions of the bill, but, since I am prepared to move
that the bill be referred to committee if it receives second
reading, perhaps you would prefer me to omit some of it. I
can assure you that the provisions as a whole are quite
similar to the provisions you studied when dealing with
the Motor Vehicle Safety Act.
[Hon. Mrs. Neiman.]

March 21, 1974

The act not only provides that the government will have
powers of maintaining and enforcing standards, but also
provides penalties for non-compliance with its various
regulations and provisions-as does its parent act. I am
sure that the principles and objectives underlying Bill S-3
will find the ready support of all honourable senators.
I have with me a copy of the proceedings of the Standing Senate Committee on Transport and Communications
to which the Motor Vehicle Safety bill was referred. It
shows that the committee considered that bill and some of
its regulations in considerable detail.
Hon. Mr. Martin: When was that?
Hon. Mrs. Neirnan: The act was passed in 1970 and
proclaimed in 1971. The regulations made under that act
are far more numerous and complex than those that wili
be made under this bill, since they cover a multitude of
components affecting the whole range of motor vehicle
safety. In this bill, of course, we are just dealing with
tires.
The committee subsequently reported the Motor Vehicle
Safety bill without amendment.
Although there are a few quibbling questions in my
mind regarding Bill S-3, the only serious reservation I
have and one that does not detract from its merit is that it
may not have wide enough application to achieve optimum
safety standards for buyers of tires. I have discussed my
reservations with officials of the Ministry of Transport,
and can well appreciate that they, too, may have some
jurisdictional problems which have yet to be resolved.
Since other honourable senators will probably welcome
the opportunity of reviewing its provisions with those
officials, and perhaps their legal advisers, it is my intention to move that Bill S-3 be referred to the Standing
Senate Committee on Transport and Communications if it
receives second reading.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Honourable senators, I think we are indebted to Senator Neiman for the
clear exposition she has given of this piece of legislation.
However, I am afraid I did not quite follow her at the
beginning, and perhaps I am a little off track when I ask
this question.
As I understand it, the bill applies only to new tires.
Perhaps this is a matter for the committee, if Senator
Neiman does not have the information, but she has used
the expressions "after-market tires," and "replacement
tires." I ask whether those terms are synonymous with
"second-hand tires" and "recaps", and whether the standards that are to be applied to new tires can in any way
affect the use of after-market replacement or second-hand
tires.
Hon. Mrs. Neiman: I have discussed this very point
with officials of the ministry, senator. The measure
applies specifically to new tires, and the importation of
new tires which are sold in what is known as the aftermarket-that is, as replacement tires-and only in that
context. It does not apply to retreads, which I think
embrace a wide variety of tires, and it does not apply to
what might be called second-hand tires. This is something
that I, too, would like to diseuss in some detail with the
officials, because I think, from the information they have
given me, that this is another area where they are having

March 21, 1974

DEBATES
Marc 21,1974SENATE

sorne problems in flot only frarning the regulations, but
framing thern in such a way that they are enforceable.
There again, there probably will be jurisdictional problems, because at the moment the business of retreading
and recapping tires is strictly a provincial matter. I think
what the ministry is doing, in effect, is taking one step at a
time to broaden its jurisdiction, and, hopefully, it will
achieve that eventually.
Hon. Mr'. Choquette: Honourable senators, sorne persons will certainly have to be appointed to, administer the
two bis that have been introduced this afternoon, but I
wouid ask whether I amn correctiy informed when I arn
told that there are ten new positions to be created, at
$20,000 per year, to enforce this legisiation. That is the
usual thing when important legisiation like this is presented. Arn I right?

27601-11

Hon. Mr'. Martin: That is an interesting question that
we rnight want to pursue further with the minister in
committee. Senator Choquette is usuaiiy right, but this
may be one instance when he is flot.
Hon. Mr'. Langlois: The exception confirrns the rule.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourabie senators, I move the
adjournment of the debate.
While I arn on my feet, and before the question is put,, 1
wouid indicate to, the house that the Standing Senate
Comrnittee on Transport and Communications wiii hoid

o'ciock, in a roorn to be rnade availabie to us. Ail members
of the committee wiii receive a notice in due course.
On motion of Senator Haig, debate adjourned.

RIGHT HONOURABLE ARTHUR MEIGHEN
PORTRAIT-QUESTION
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Honourable senators, I wonder if I
might ask the Leader of the Government if he can give us
any information about the prolonged absence from the
corridor outside the other place of the portrait of a former
leader of this house, the Right Honourable Arthur Meighen. I understand that some months ago, when an eccentric
character burst like a bomb into the Chamber of the House
of Commons, he damaged this portrait and I understood at
the time that it was being removed for repairs, or something of that sort.
To the best of my belief, it has now been absent from its
place on the wall for a very long time and I wonder if the
Leader of the Government will inquire into the matter
and give us any information?
Hon. Mr. Martin: I shall be very glad to do so.

Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, I give
notice that on Thursday next, March 28, 1974, I will call
the attention of the Senate to certain elements within the
precincts of the Senate Chamber and in particular to its
clerestory.
Hon. Senators: Explain.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Not to be too technical about the
matter, I understand that the word "clerestory" applies to
basilica-like structures and includes the upper windows,
which provide light. Such a word would apply to this
chamber. I shall draw the attention of the Senate particularly to a project that refers to the clerestory, or the
windows, of this chamber.

BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, March 21, the
adjourned debate on the motion of Senator McGrand for
second reading of Bill S-2, to amend the Animal Contagious Diseases Act.
[Translation]
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, one of the
disadvantages of having so few senators in the Opposition
will be your misfortune in having to listen to me on a
matter about which I know nothing. It reminds me of the
time when Senator Martin was the agricultural expert of
the Liberal Party in the House of Commons. However, it
will be up to the Prime Minister to try to and straighten
this situation.
I merely wish to explain in very broad terms-and I will
be careful not to pose as an expert as Senator Martin used
to do on farming-the bill now under consideration and
which deals, as you have understood, with contagious or
infectious diseases affecting animals and the protection of
animals.
Obviously, this has nothing to do with man; we would
have done it otherwise, because the worst animal is man.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: He is sick.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: He is more liable to catch contagious
diseases.

Honourable senators, I am pleased to see the government using this chamber to introduce some of its legislation. My hope is that it will make greater use of it for that
purpose in this session than it did in the last. We reached
the lowest point in years in terms of legislation introduced
in this chamber during the last session. Of course, we have
to understand that we are in a minority government situation, and this minority government does not take risks of
any kind.
The first Senate bill of the last session afforded us a
rather unhappy experience. It was considered beyond our
competence by the Speaker of the other place. Therefore,

March 26, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

it did not go through the other place and did not receive
royal assent.
Senator McGrand last week gave us a thorough explanation of the bill presently before us, and I thank him for
that. The purpose of the bill, as honourable senators are
aware, is to provide authority to regulate the care and
treatment of animals while in transport for the purpose of
reducing the incidence of sickness and disease. The bill
further seeks to clarify and strengthen certain areas of the
Animal Contagious Diseases Act in order to assure the
necessary authority for the adequate protection of the
Canadian livestock population against serious epizootic
diseases.
Bill S-2, if passed, will give the Department of Agriculture additional authority to ensure that infectious diseases
of the type which affect animals are detected early and
prevented from spreading. For example, it provides wider
powers of regulation concerning the importation, quarantine, destruction, disinfection or purification of animal
products, by-products, fodder, fodder packing and anything else that might serve to spread infectious and contagious diseases.
Also, regulations may be made under this bill to ensure
that we do not export disease-bearing animals, animal
products, by-products or anything else used in respect of
animals which may have been infected. The logic behind
this is obvious. We do not want to export disease for the
simple reason that we would not want any other country
to export it to us. In other words, we are imposing stringent regulations on ourselves in the hope that the various
countries which export animals and animal products or
by-products to us will do likewise.
The bill provides for the establishment of areas for the
inspection, segregation and testing of animals for diseases
like tuberculosis and brucellosis. That, I can tell you, is an
excellent idea. Brucellosis is a disease which human
beings can contract. I know f rom experience. During a trip
to Europe some time ago I contracted the disease, from
either the milk I drank or the cheese I ate-it was probably the cheese, because I rarely drink milk! This disease
does not kill you but it makes you very sick, and for quite
a while.
The bill also authorizes the regulation of the conduct
and operation of zoos and game farms to prevent animal
diseases. My hope is that these regulations will lead to
better protection for the animals from some of the mindless people who visit these places. Also, there is little
doubt that there are, in Canada, a large number of private
and small public zoos where the accommodation is inadequate, and where the staff charged with the responsibility
of caring for the animals are either untrained or, at the
very best, ill-trained. Many of them are people who have
acquired a working knowledge only at the expense of the
animals in their care. I hope the new regulations will alter
this situation and render such abuse impossible.
The producers of dairy products will be forced to supply
samples of milk and cream to protect human beings from
consuming tainted food.
Contagious disease in animals will have to be reported
as soon as detected, under pain of penalty for non-compliance. The penalty will be non-compensation when the

disease is finally detected, and the animal or animals
destroyed.
All these measures to be instituted to detect and protect
against animal contagious diseases are, ultimately, for the
benefit of the human population, and we can scarcely be
opposed to them.
I am puzzled, however, as to why those responsible for
drafting these amendments to the act seem not to have
consulted any of the recognized authorities in the field of
veterinary medicine with regard to them. My office was in
touch with Dean Howell of the College of Veterinary
Medicine of the University of Guelph, which is the leading
institution of its kind in Canada. We were in touch with
Dr. Walcroft, head of that section of Connaught Laboratories dealing with infectious diseases in animals, and also
with Dr. McDermott, head of the section of the Ontario
Department of Agriculture dealing with veterinary medicine. None of these men knew anything about the bill;
none had been in any way consulted.
The provisions in the bill allowing for regulations pertaining to the humane treatment of animals being transported into, out of, or within Canada are welcome indeed.
Just recently, the Animal Welfare Foundation of Canada
drew our attention to the fact that "exotic" animals are
subjected to differing degrees of strain, stress, neglect or
outright cruelty while in transit from point of origin to
Canada.
[Translation]
Honourable senators, we support in principle this legislation the purpose of which is very commendable. As you
have noted, it aims at protecting animals from contagious
diseases and, hence, at protecting humans.
Nevertheless, it would be better if some experts would
tell us if this legislation is really what is needed and if it
does not create more problems than it solves.
Moreover, the quite extensive regulatory powers provided in this bill seem, in my opinion, to open the door to
abuse on the part of civil servants.
Because of these two points, that is, the advisability of
seeking the advice of experts and the question as to
whether this bill may conflict with the basic rights of
individuals, I would suggest that it be referred to the
Senate Committee on Agriculture where we can satisfy
ourselves that this bill really provides the best method to
achieve its purpose.

* (2020)

Hon. Hazen Argue: Honourable senators, I shall be very
brief, and I would like the privilege of adjourning the
debate so that I may have a little time in which to consider
any further remarks. It seems to me that this is a year in
which this kind of measure particularly should be considered. There have been many instances of animals being
killed in transit in this country in recent weeks and
months. These are difficult times on the Prairies today,
and many animals have died in peculiar circumstances.
For that reason, among others, I would like this bill
referred to the Agriculture Committee, as I believe it will
be. In committee there will be opportunity for further and
more detailed examination of what the bill proposes. The
committee could consider whether the provinces are doing

March 26, 1974

SENATE DEBATES
all they can in this particular field so that the public gets
the maximum protection, that the health of animals is
secured and maintained and that agriculture generally
benefits from the provisions of this legislation.
At this point, honourable senators, I move the adjournment of the debate.
On motion of Senator Argue, debate adjourned.
MOTOR VEHICLE TIRE SAFETY BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from Thursday, March 21, the
adjourned debate on the motion of Senator Neiman for the
second reading of Bill S-3, respecting the use of national
safety marks in relation to motor vehicle tires and to
provide for safety standards for certain motor vehicle tires
imported into or exported from Canada or sent or conveyed from one province to another.
Hon. J. Campbell Haig: Honourable senators, this is the
first chance I have had to speak in this chamber since my
illness of a year ago. Before I proceed, I wish to thank all
the senators and the staff for their good wishes during my
illness. As you probably know, I had a stroke on April 13,
1973. With therapy and trying to behave myself, I hope I
am regaining my former good health.
I congratulate Senator Robichaud, the mover of the
motion for an Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne, and Senator Perrault, the seconder of that motion.
I have heard many speeches here in the past, and I can say
that both senators made great contributions in the
speeches they made.
I express also my best wishes and congratulations to
you, Madam Speaker, for the kind, fair and courteous way
in which you carry out your duties as presiding officer of
this chamber, and the other duties connected with your
office. We are proud to have Your Honour as our presiding
off icer.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, Bill S-3 was introduced on Thursday last by Senator Neiman, who
explained it in an exceptional way. In essence, it is an
attempt by the federal authorities, with the approval and
consent of the provinces, to regulate the safety and the
manufacture of tires, as defined in clause 2(1).
Clause 3 establishes a national trademark, which will
belong to Her Majesty in right of Canada.
Needless to say, safety is part and parcel of the Motor
Vehicle Safety Act, and in that respect tires for vehicleswhether they be for trucks, automobiles, motorcycles or
anything else-must be produced in such manner that
they will meet the standards required to provide that
safety. I am not entirely certain that this bill will have
that desired effect.
As you look through this bill you see various terms
defined, such as distributor, importer, inspector, tire, and
so on. You see various headings like "National Tire Safety
Mark," "Manufacturers and Distributors" and "Importation of Motor Vehicle Tires." But when you analyze the
bill you will see that its main principle or main thrust is
actually contained in its regulations.
[Hon. Mr. Argue.]

This is not the first time we have had occasion to
examine a bill which, in essence, is entirely dependent on
its regulations. On the contrary, we have seen in the
recent past that regulations form a most important part of
much of the legislation being brought forward. With that
in mind, it is my opinion that the bill should go to committee and that the regulations should there receive our
particular attention.
Under Part II of the bill, which deals with administration, clause Il outlines the powers of inspectors with
respect to search, seizure and forfeiture. Clauses 16 and 17
then set out the offences and the punishments therefor.
The clauses to which I have referred deal only with new
tires, and that is a most important point. Last Thursday
Senator Connolly (Ottawa West) asked Senator Neiman if
the expressions "after-market tires" and "replacement
tires" were synonymous with "second-hand tires" and
"recaps." He wanted to know whether the standards that
are to be applied to new tires could in any way "affect the
use of after-market replacement or second-hand tires." In
reply, Senator Neiman suggested waiting until the bill
went to committee at which time any question could be
dealt with.
Well, we have had that story before, and quite often,
unfortunately, questions are not dealt with in committee
because officials simply do not have the answer. I am
suggesting that in future when a bill of this type-in other
words, one which is so dependent upon regulations for its
enforcement-comes before us, the departmental officials
should be ready, willing and able to explain the regulations and answer any questions.
Anyone interested in a bill should, through the proper
channels, be able to ask questions about it, and judging
from my correspondence it is my impression that there are
many people interested in this subject. But if questions
are raised, will the officials be able to answer them?
Do the regulations regarding the safety of tires apply to
second-hand tires, to retreads, to snow tires, and so on?
How are these regulations going to be published? Is publication going to be made only through the distribution of
the Canada Gazette, which a mere couple of hundred lawyers read-or their students read for them?
Leaving aside the question of replacement tires, or
second-hand tires, just where is the notice going to be
given to the manufacturers and distributors about the new
tires? Because that is the key to success for this kind of
bill.
Honourable senators, for the various reasons I have
stated, I hope that when this bill receives second reading
it is sent to the appropriate committee and that at that
point the proper officials are brought forward to answer
questions. I hope that they will be prepared to answer
them quickly and not keep us waiting for two or three
years as bas been the case in the past.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
On motion of Senator Neiman, bill referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Transport and Communications.

March 26, 1974

UNITED NATIONS
TWENTY-EIGHTH MEETING OF GENERAL ASSEMBLY-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

Hon. Henry D. Hicks rose pursuant to notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate to the
Twenty-eighth Meeting of the General Assembly of
the United Nations, and in particular to the discussions and proceedings of the Assembly and the participation therein by the Canadian delegation.
He said: Honourable senators, some of you will know
that I was included as one of the delegates who represented Canada at the Twenty-eighth General Assembly of the
United Nations held in New York from mid-September of
last year until the week before Christmas. It is perhaps
not inappropriate, therefore, that I give some of my
impressions of that session of the General Assembly, and
of the part which the delegation from Canada played.
Let me at the outset say that I have no illusions that I
have become an expert on the United Nations merely by
being included among the Canadian delegation for one
session of the General Assembly, though I recall that
many years ago, when I was the Premier of Nova Scotia, I
spent two or three days as an observer with the Canadian
delegation to the United Nations. At that time I believe
the present Leader of the Government in this house was
Minister of External Affairs and the leader of the Canadian delegation to the United Nations.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: The good old days.
Hon. Mr. Hicks: In any event, the Twenty-eighth session
of the General Assembly was an interesting one, by any

standards, and for reasons perhaps none of us could have
predicted when we went to New York in mid-September.
First, however, I should say that the United Nations in

1973 achieved a total membership of 135 nations, and is
now approaching more and more nearly its goal of universality; that is to say, of representing virtually all sections
and all political positions of the globe which we inhabit.

Last year we accepted into the membership of the
United Nations the two Germanys-West Germany and
East Germany. Though they had been observers, they had
not been represented at the United Nations before. We also
accepted the new independent island of Barbados, from
the Caribbean, and these three brought the General

Assembly up to 135.
The general debate was of interest to me, and with some
exceptions was of a high order. The speech made by Willy
Brandt, the Chancellor of West Germany, was regarded by

many as a highlight because of the view that he took of
world relations and European relations in particular, and
for the lucid way in which he explained the position of
West Germany in the new Europe and in the comity of
nations. He spoke extremely well and extremely
forcefully.
The main point, however, which I think impressed

everyone in the general debate of the United Nations was
the attitude of détente between the United States of
America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The
speakers on behalf of both these great nations, as well as

167

the speakers on behalf of the so-called satellites of the
U.S.S.R. and the friends of the U.S.A., adopted more temperate attitudes than they had heretofore. There seemed to
be, during the first fortnight of this session of the United
Nations, an atmosphere which made possible a better
understanding among the great powers of the world, and
which, hence, gave more opportunity for the lesser powers
to play a constructive part in the securing of world peace.
As opposed to this I think one would have to say that
the rudeness and violence of the confrontation between
the U.S.S.R. and the People's Republic of China was quite
surprising, and it struck a jarring note. I am told by many
old U.N. hands, who have attended more sessions of the
General Assembly than I, that at no time at the height of
the cold war were the exchanges between the U.S.A. and
the U.S.S.R. as sharp and as vitriolic as those exchanged in
the General Assembly and in the committees of the United
Nations between the People's Republic of China and the
U.S.S.R. So much for the general debate, and the beginning of the sessions of the General Assembly.
These all seemed to assume a role of secondary importance when on Yom Kippur the war broke out between
Egypt and Syria, on the one hand, and Israel, on the other.
The U.N., of course, and all its activities, were dominated-indeed, I might say that all activities were overshadowed-by what everyone recognized as the importance of
bringing about a speedy resolution of this violent conflict.
It seemed to me that the United Nations showed itself at
its best, despite unprovable and unproven allegations
during this debate that Israel was the aggressor. For many
weeks after U.N. observers had clearly shown the aggression on the part of Egypt and Syria by which this war was
started, and when it seemed quite ridiculous to maintain
the allegations, spokesmen for the Arab nations continued
to refer to Israel as having been the originator and the
perpetrator of this aggression on the holy day of Yom
Kippur.
To me this was wholly unrealistic, because I would have
thought that the Arab nations would have gained much
more sympathy if they had said flatly, "Of course we
attacked Israel in an attempt to regain the lands which
Israel took from us in the Six-Day War in 1967." But, no,
they maintained this unbelievable fiction that the Israelis
had started the war again. In retrospect, I do not suppose
this is very important.
In any event, the Security Council went into action.
Since Canada is not a member of the Security Council at
the present time we were not directly involved in its work,
but we were directly involved in the provision of a United
Nations Emergency Force. It f ell to Canada, after a considerable amount of negotiation, not always with the agreement of all the great powers concerned, to provide the
logistics component-that is, transportation, communications and other sophisticated services-of the United
Nations Emergency Force, which had to go in and separate
the antagonists in this war and attempt to maintain a
peaceful relationship, or at least some kind of a non-violent relationship, while the peace talks could be organized
and proceeded with.
Here I may say we saw again the ploy of trying to
balance off Canada as a Western nation with an equivalent component of the emergency force from the countries

SENATE DEBATES
behind the Iron Curtain, Poland being the country put
forward by the U.S.S.R. and her allies. Canada, quite
properly in my view, maintained that while we were not
unwilling to work with Poland or any other country, we
did not regard ourselves as representing the Western
powers or, indeed, any group of nations, in performing our
role in a United Nations Emergency Force; that we supplied men who adopted the colours and the badge of the
United Nations; and that we provided soldiers and provided logistic support for a United Nations Emergency
Force, not a force which was nicely composed to balance
the East against the West, or any other alignment of the
nations of the world.
In any event, the Twenty-eighth Meeting of the General
Assembly did not prorogue before Christmas 1973, but
adjourned because of the likelihood of its having to be
recalled if developments in the Middle East, and the very
unsettled peace-if peace it can be called-should require
the attention of the General Assembly again.
*

(2040)

As I say, it seemed to me that Canada played a useful
role in adopting an attitude of willingness to be of service-to be of service not in the interests of the Western
powers, not as a friend of Israel, and not as a friend or
enemy of the Arab states, but as a component of a United
Nations force to represent the world authority of the
United Nations in endeavouring to maintain a stable
peace, and to perpetuate a truce until the peace talks
succeeded
in
making
better
and
more
lasting
arrangements.
I turn from this, feeling reasonably satisfied that
Canada offered to play, and has been playing, a useful role
in circumstances which at no time have been easy, and at
some times have been extremely difficult, to say it seems
to me that perhaps the most important thing that was
arranged at the Twenty-eighth Meeting of the General
Assembly of the United Nations was the Third United
Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea which, in my
opinion, is very important for Canada. This conference
will be held in 1974, and will attempt to establish a new
legal regime which, among other matters, may affect:
-Canada's sovereign rights over the resources of its
continental margin, that is, the submerged land
mass bordering its coastline;
-Canada's right to manage and receive a preferential
share of the living resources found over its entire
continental shelf;
-the right of coastal states to take measures to protect their marine environment as Canada did in
adopting the Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention
Act;
-the right of coastal states to control scientific
research within their zones of maritime jurisdiction;
-the disposition of the riches of the seabed beyond
the jurisdiction of states so that they can be of
benefit to the whole of mankind.
These are but a few of the questions which will be
at issue during the Third United Nations Law of the
Sea Conference in 1974. Because its decisions are
bound to have far-reaching consequences for the
[Hon. Mr. Hicks.]

March 26, 1974

international community as a whole, for individual
states, for coastal communities and even for the
individual, it is widely recognized that the forthcoming Law of the Sea Conference will be one of the most
important diplomatic conferences ever convened
under the aegis of the United Nations.
The conference will be held in Venezuela. The important
thing is that Canada succeeded in gaining, by an open
election, the position of chairman of the drafting committee for this conference, which post will be filled by
Ambassador Alan J. Beesley. He is recognized internationally as an authority in this area, and I am sure will
discharge his duties in a competent manner. When I was
asked in 1964 or 1966 by the then Secretary of State for
External Affairs, who is now the Leader of the Government in this house, to lead two Canadian delegations to
the general conferences of UNESCO at Paris, one of the
junior members of my delegation at that time was the
same Alan J. Beesley. I am delighted to note the progress
he has made in External Affairs. He is now representing
Canada in Vienna which is, as you know, the headquarters
of the International Atomic Energy Agency. In any event,
I am sure that Canada won a major diplomatic victory in
having Ambassador Beesley named to this important post.
The chairman of the drafting committee is conceded by all
those who are interested in this Law of the Sea Conference as the person in a position to be able to influence,
implement, adjudicate and decide upon, and perhaps produce, a document which may carry another step forward
our efforts to control the resources of the sea in the
interests not only of our own country but of the whole of
mankind.
I may say that some of the other events which occurred
at this meeting of the United Nations cannot give one so
much satisfaction. The efforts to outlaw terrorism and the
efforts to deal with the protection of diplomats and other
internationally protected persons must, to say the least, be
regarded as disappointing, for the simple reason that some
of the members of the United Nations do not wish to
outlaw terrorism as a political weapon. They attempted to
make qualifications that if the terrorism was on behalf of
racial minorities, persons who are being subjected to the
evil policies of apartheid, colonialism, this sort of thing, it
should not be subject to the normal rules. This would
make it impossible, I believe, to develop any kind of
agreement which would put an end to these practices that
have caused so much concern in several parts of the world
recently.
I was the Canadian delegate charged with the responsibility of representing Canada on the special political committee, which is really an offshoot of the first committee
of the United Nations, which was overloaded with work a
number of years ago. The special political committee was
created to share its workload. I listened to the general
resolutions dealing with the evils of the policy of apartheid in South Africa, the effects of colonialism and neocolonialism in the states of South Africa, the question of
UNRWA, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency,
which looks after the Palestinian refugees and also the
issue of Israeli practices in the occupied territories where
the Arab states contend that Israel is endeavouring to
permanently incorporate these territories into the State of

March 26, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

Israel, and to destroy the basis of life and living for the
Arab peoples who inhabited these territories before they
were occupied by Israel in the various wars that have
taken place since the state was created in 1948.
I might mention that one other interesting resolution
passed in the General Assembly seems to me to show
something of the futility of certain procedures in the
United Nations. Our Russian friends proposed that there
should be a 10 per cent reduction of the armaments budgets of all the major nations of the world, and that an
unspecified portion of that 10 per cent saving should be
donated to assist the developing countries. This was debated and carried, with a great many high-sounding speeches,
despite the fact that the proposer would not agree to any
auditing to determine that there actually was a 10 per cent
reduction, and would not agree on any formula which
would determine how the moneys were to be disbursed, or
anything like that. One cannot help but feel a little frustrated at the number of resolutions that passed with overwhelming majorities in the United Nations, and which
have little or no prospect of resulting in any positive
action being taken or any problems being solved. I have to
say that no one who attends the United Nations can help
but be concerned at the repetitiveness and frustration
which bedevils the work of the General Assembly and
most of the committees. Nothing is ever said three or four
times in the United Nations; it is said at least 70 or 80
times and it does not really add to the force of the statement when it is repeated as many times as that.
A factor which concerned me when I led Canadian
delegations to UNESCO in Paris in the sixties concerned
me also at the United Nations. Many nations, and some of
them are exceedingly small, with limited revenues, few
resources and small populations, contribute infinitesimal
amounts to the budget of the United Nations. Of the 135
member nations, no fewer than 66 contribute the minimum amount, which is 0.02 per cent of the United Nations
budget. If honourable senators will do a quick calculation,
it means that one can obtain a clear majority in the United
Nations General Assembly with the support of nations
who together do not contribute 2 per cent of the budget of
the United Nations. I assure honourable senators that on
occasions the vote is determined in this way.

For example, it was agreed at the Twenty-eighth General Assembly that information offices should be established
in several African nations for the dissemination of information on the evils of apartheid in South Africa. One
could not help but wonder whether such information
offices were needed in those areas where the evils of
apartheid were already well known and widely recognized, and whether the decision was taken rather in order
to provide positions for functionaries in those small
nations which had supported the resolution.
Perhaps even more surprising is the fact that today one
can secure a two-thirds majority in the United Nations
General Assembly with the support of nations which collectively do not contribute as much as Canada. Canada's
contribution at this time is 3.8 per cent of the budget, and
one could line up two thirds of the member nations of the
United Nations who do not contribute that amount. Perhaps that is not a bad thing.

27601-12

I do not believe for one moment that the major powers
should be allowed to push the smaller powers around in an
unreasonable way. Yet at the same time there are occasions when one wonders whether the member states of the
United Nations exercise their responsibility in as mature a
manner as we would sometimes wish.
As I have said before, the number of resolutions that are
passed with no, or very little, chance of ever being implemented or of having any effect whatsoever are rather
more than one would like.
Finally, I might say something about Canada's role in
the United Nations. I do not believe that our influence is
as significant today as it was right after World War II,
during the so-called "Pearson era," when Canada, fresh
from its good performance in World War II and the helpful
role it played in the creation of the United Nations, had a
voice in the councils of the nations out of all proportion to
the population, size and wealth of our country.
However, generally speaking, we can be pleased that we
are well regarded in the United Nations. We tend to vote
too often with the so-called responsible establishment, the
developed nations. Perhaps I should not use the term "too
often," but we tend to vote often with the developed
nations. At the same time we seek to be sympathetic with
the problems of the developing countries, and to be friendly toward them. I think they recognize this.
Canada needs constantly to reassess its role and attitudes in relation to the aspirations of developing countries. We should never allow ourselves to be regarded, as
people sometimes try to regard us, as belonging to the
so-called European establishment of Western nations. Of
course, we do belong to that group. We have ties of culture
and heredity with Europe, with the Anglo-Saxon people,
with the people of France and other European nations, and
so on.
In a rather peculiar way we have not identified ourselves, in the eyes of the United Nations organization,
with the United States of America and with the new
world, because we do not belong to the United States bloc,
to the Latin American bloc or to the American bloc. In the
allocation of positions, membership of committees, and so
on, we tend to be classified by United Nations agencies
with the countries of Europe.
Canada should try to maintain an independent posture.
Perhaps all too often we resolve our dilemma, when it
comes to voting in the United Nations, by abstaining. I
have used the word "dilemma." Perhaps it is too strong a
word, but there have been times-and there were times
during the Twenty-eighth Session of the General
Assembly-when I felt that Canada abstained when she
could have taken a positive or a negative position, as the
case might be, and given a forceful explanation of her
position which over a reasonable period of time might
have enhanced Canada's reputation and 'increased our
influence among the nations.
Honourable senators, those, briefly, are my impressions
of the Twenty-eighth General Assembly, and I regarded it
a personal privilege and honour to be invited to represent
Canada. I am grateful that my membership in this house
enabled me to be a member of Canada's delegation to thc
Twenty-eighth General Assembly of the United Nations.

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Rhéal Bélisle: Honourable senators, before proceeding with my remarks concerning the Twenty-eighth
General Assembly of the United Nations, I should first
like to join with others in complimenting the government
on the appointment of our new Governor General, His
Excellency Jules Léger. This learned and distinguished
diplomat has all the qualities for continuing this great role
of Her Majesty's representative. The sagacity which he
has acquired in his many roles around the world undoubtedly assure us that his selection was an excellent one. His
cultivated and charming companion will, I am sure, grace
Rideau Hall with continued dignity.
May I be permitted also to express my thanks to his
predecessor, the Right Honourable Roland Michener. This
Ontarian from Alberta has distinguished himself and has
made an outstanding contribution toward the unity of our
country and the harmony of its people who are working to
make Canada one of the f inest countries in the world.
Honourable senators, the pleasure of returning to this
august assembly following a short recess continues to be
appreciated in the knowledge that the session will be
chaired by the learned and charming lady who now presides over us. I once read a book in which it said that
feminine sagacity is always more appreciated than masculine sagacity because it is enriched by this motherly love
that controls the sound of words and puts them through
the feeling of the heart before they are permitted to come
out. In this context, Madam Speaker, so far you have been
unique during your term of office.
Many senators have expressed to me that they are not
too fond of listening to travelogues, and so it is not my
intention to dwell on that subject. I would be remiss in my
duty if I did not express to His Excellency, Doctor Saul F.
Rae, our permanent Ambassador to the United Nations,
my deep appreciation for the courtesy and attention I
received while in New York. Suffice it to say that this
well-liked and experienced diplomat is doing an excellent
job for Canada at the United Nations. He has surrounded
himself with competent and efficient personnel who
assisted me and other members of the delegation. I therefore wish to say "thank you" to them.
*

(2100)

It gives me a great deal of pleasure to follow such a
distinguished orator as Senator Hicks, who has presented
the Senate with a very full account of the proceedings of
the Twenty-eighth Meeting of the General Assembly of
the United Nations, with particular reference to the discussions that took place and the participation therein by
the Canadian delegation.
May I be permitted to say that I was extremely
honoured and proud to be a member of the Canadian
delegation. I was most impressed by our delegation's contribution to the proceedings, both at the parliamentary
and official levels, in the General Assembly and in the
various working committees of the United Nations. I was
extremely proud of my colleagues for the way in which
they performed their duties, the questions they asked and
the frank discussions we had with the other member
delegations.
It is not my intention this evening to present a summary
of the conclusions reached by those participating in the
[Hon. Mr. Hicks.]

March 26, 1974

Twenty-eighth Meeting of the General Assembly. Senator
Hicks has ably performed that task. Instead, I should like
to address myself to a number of significant observations
respecting Canada's contribution to the United Nations
and its financial involvement therein. There is no doubt
that Canada's substantial and rising contributions to the
United Nations' family of organizations reflect its firm
support for an active participation in this world organization. The assessed and voluntary payments made by
Canada to the United Nations since its inception in 1945
total approximately $421.8 million. These payments fall
into three broad categories: the annual assessments to
finance appropriations of the United Nations under its
regular budget; peacekeeping contributions; and contributions to the activities of a variety of multilateral economic,
social and humanitarian programs. The total Canadian
contribution to the United Nations for the fiscal year
1974-75 will amount to approximately $30 million.
May I draw attention to the second category, namely,
peacekeeping contributions. Article 1 of the Charter of the
United Nations states that one of the purposes of the
United Nations is:
To maintain international peace and security, and to
that end: to take effective collective measures for the
prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and
for the suppression of acts of aggressionSince 1945, the United Nations has been involved in 11
military operations, including Palestine, India and Pakistan, Korea, the Middle East, Lebanon, the Congo, and
Cyprus, to name only a few, as well as the most recent UN
Emergency Force in the Middle East.
Canada firmly supports UN activities in maintaining
international peace and security, and to that end Canadian
military personnel have served with the United Nations in
all 11 operations. As of May 1972, about 620 Canadian
military personnel were serving in Palestine, India and
Pakistan, and Cyprus. As of March 1974, a further 1,100
Canadian military personnel had been sent to staff the
present UN Emergency Force in the Middle East.
Canadians are proud of the role we have played in the
service of the United Nations' peacekeeping missions since
1945. More recently, the Canadian delegation at the United
Nations made an active appeal to the member states to
keep the peace between Egypt and Israel. In my view, that
move has political appeal at home and prestige abroad, but
it is prestige bought at the Canadian taxpayers' expense.
Some UN peacekeeping operations have been financed
by the assessment of all members, while others have been
paid for by way of voluntary contributions. Until 1956,
with the exception of Korea, which did not engage the
financing machinery of the United Nations, the assessed
shares were relatively modest and were paid by virtually
all member states. However, with the establishment of the
United Nations Emergency Force in 1956 and the United
Nations Operations in the Congo in 1960, peacekeeping
costs mounted considerably. The total cost of UNEF was
$217 million in United States dollars, and the total cost of
UNOC, again in United States dollars, was $392.8 million.
Canada paid its total share of the assessed portion of these
expenses, being $5,910,000 for UNEF and $9,187,000 for
UNOC.

March 26, 1974

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

A preliminary estimate for the present UN Emergency
Force in the Middle East is $30 million for a total complement of 7,000 troups, all ranks, for a period of six months.
But let us not fool ourselves about this estimated cost of
$30 million. With the escalation of costs nowadays, that
$30 million will be $40 million or $50 million for six
months, $90 million to $100 million for a year, and if the
Middle East issue is another Cyprus, only the Good Lord
knows how long it will last or how much it will cost.
Please, honourable senators, let's be more realistic about
the Middle East problem than we were about Cyprus or
Vietnam. Canada and 22 other developed countries will
share 34.78 per cent or $10,434,000 of the total cost of the
peacekeeping force. The bill for Canada amounts to $954,000 for six months, or approximately 3.18 per cent of the
total.
Thus, Canada's share of the 23-country contribution of
$10,434,000 represents 9.14 per cent. The average cost for
this group, which includes Australia, Italy, Japan, Poland,
South Africa, Sweden and West Germany, is $453,652.
According to a recent report of the United Nations
Finance Committee, Canada is the fourth largest contributor of the 23 developed countries; that is, she follows Japan
with $2,145,000, West Germany with $2,130,000, and Italy
with $1,080,000.
The five great powers, the United States, the U.S.S.R.,
France, China and the United Kingdom, will pay $18,945,000, or 63.15 per cent of the total cost between them,
representing an average of $3,789,000 for each of the great
powers. Thus, Canada's bill of $954,000 comes to more than
25 per cent of the average paid by the United States, the
Soviet Union, France, and the United Kingdom.
Further, it should be noted that the 107 developing
countries in the United Nations will pay, as Senator Hicks
said a while ago, $621,000 or approximately 2.07 per cent of
the total cost of $30 million. Some of these developing
countries include members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC, who in recent
months have seriously affected the economies of the
industrialized world through oil embargoes and increased
prices for oil. It is ironic to me to see these Arab states,
who are accumulating massive revenue reserves from
increased oil prices, contribute the least towards the
Emergency Force in the Middle East when nations such as
Canada, Japan, West Germany, France and Italy, all of
whom were hurt by the oil crisis, contribute more proportionately, or expressed in terms of world population, here
is Canada with a population of 23 million as compared
with 375 million in the oil-producing countries of the
world, and those oil-producing countries are contributing
less than one-tenth of the cost assessed to Canada. These
are only conservative figures.
*

(2110)

Canadians reading today's newspapers are shocked by
recent world reports that oil-producing countries will be
hard pressed to know where to invest their surplus cash.
The World Bank has estimated in a recent study that the
OPEC countries will control 70 per cent of the world's
liquid cash reserves by 1980. If this trend is allowed to
continue, you can imagine the impact this will have on the
international financial markets, not to mention the distressed international monetary system.

27601-12

For Canadians the cost is great. Not only do we have to
pay our share of the United Nations police force in order
to maintain peace in the Middle East, but we also have to
pay inflated prices for our imports of oil from the OPEC
countries, as well as the high cost of imported goods and
services from those countries affected by the oil crisis. Is
there any wonder that our cost of living is rising and the
average Canadian's purchasing power is diminishing?
No one seriously suggests that Canada should not take
part in the United Nations Middle East initiative, but the
price to be paid by the Canadian people should be clearly
understood. Prestige in the international field does not
come free of charge, yet it is a subject seldom discussed in
public by the present government. Indeed, it is questionable whether there is any prestige in peacekeeping operations any more.
In our discussions with some of the delegations, countries like Canada were being accused of being tools of the
big powers, and as such had lost their credibility, independence and national identity. We have become associated
with and, as Senator Hicks said a while ago, coloured by
our political respectability. Or, to express it another way,
we belong to "the right club". Furthermore, we have
incurred heavy financial costs from our peacekeeping
operations in India and Pakistan, Palestine and Cyprus,
with little return or appreciation for our contribution.
Why beg for this effort, when Canada's abundant physical
and human resources, skills and energy could be employed
more productively elsewhere in the Third World.
It took many lengthy private sessions at the United
Nations headquarters before the Canadians and Poles
reached an understanding on how they should share their
support troop roles in the Middle East. It is one thing to
get commitments of so many troops from politically
acceptable United Nations members and something else to
get them on the scene, ready to work as a team with the
command, control and logistics support to make it
possible.
How long have we to wait for a settlement in the Middle
East at our expense while the world's diplomats continue
to negotiate to better their position?
Some countries, including the Soviet Union and France,
argue that peacekeeping is the prerogative of the Security
Council, and that the General Assembly overstepped its
authority by establishing UNEF and UNOC. Accordingly,
both countries have refused to pay their assessments for
either operation. France paid the UNEF assessments until
1964, but has refused to pay for UNOC.
Canada, along with the United States and Britain, has
continuously upheld the Assembly's principle of collective
responsibility and supported adoption of resolutions
assessing the cost of UNEF and UNOC against the total
membership, with reductions to developing countries.
Because this support has not been unanimous, the United
Nations has been plagued with financial difficulties, to the
extent that member states like Canada have, through
voluntary contributions, absorbed most of the costs for
peacekeeping operations. To date, only 26 countries have
contributed or pledged over $26 million to the United
Nations special account. According to one estimate,
approximately $70 million more is needed to liquidate the
short-term deficit due to peacekeeping.

SENATE DEBATES
Moreover, it is clear that voluntary contributions have
proved an unreliable means of financing, and deficits have
infested operations like the United Nations force in
Cyprus from the beginning. The Secretary General has
had to make frequent appeals for additional funds. As of
December 15, 1972, about $127.8 million had been pledged
or contributed to meet an estimated cost of about $147.9
million. These costs do not include amounts that some
troop contributors, including Canada, have agreed to
absorb without seeking reimbursement from the United
Nations. For instance, during the 1971 calendar year
Canada absorbed approximately $1.6 million over and
above the normal cost of maintaining the contingent at
home. Are we assessing the depth of the Canadian taxpayer's generosity by the width and length of our country?
Therefore, I ask you, honourable senators, to consider
very seriously what it costs the Canadian people to maintain a peacekeeping force, bearing in mind the effects of
world inflation and the rising cost of money. The Canadian people derive few benefits from peacekeeping. Instead
they pay a very high insurance premium for limited
coverage.
Since 1965 the Special Committee on Peacekeeping
Operations has been reviewing comprehensively the whole
question of peacekeeping, including ways to overcome the
financial difficulties. So far agreement has not been
reached on guidelines for the financing of future peacekeeping operations.
Honourable senators, if the Canadian government is
going to act responsibly in this area, then it should ensure
that the Canadian contribution is taken earnestly, not
only by those nations that participate in the peacekeeping
operations but also by those nations for whom it is intended and who threaten international peace and security.
Finally in this regard, it is most important that those
members who create world disorder should make some
serious financial contribution towards financing the
United Nations peacekeeping operations.
There is one other important area on which I should like
to comment. It is in the realm of education, a subject that
is, as you know, close to my heart. As some of you may
know, the Twenty-seventh Assembly decided, by Resolution 2951, to establish an international university under
the auspices of the United Nations, to be known as the
United Nations University. This was the result of a concept study launched by former Secretary General U Thant
four years ago. Canada supported the resolution, which
was adopted on December 11, 1972. The resolution called
for the establishment of a 20-member founding committee,
which was to be responsible for the definition of the
principles and objectives of this university, and for the
drafting of its charter. The results and recommendations
of this committee were presented to the Twenty-eighth
Assembly by the Secretary General last November.
* (2120)

Although the U Thant concept was one big institution
on a single campus, the United Nations University that
has developed will be a string of institutions in "a worldwide system of research and training centres and programs." It will link scholars of many nationalities in
centres of learning around the world.
[Hon. Mr. Bélisie.]

March 26, 1974

According to its charter, the UN university "shall be an
international community of scholars engaged in research,
post-graduate training and dissemination of knowledge in
furtherance of the purposes and principles" of the United
Nations. Its staff will be picked for competence and
"appropriate representation in terms of geography, age
and sex." The university is to do research in "the pressing
global problems of human survival, development and welfare... with due attention to the social and natural
sciences," and disseminate the results to the UN, its agencies, scholars and the public. Japan has been recommended
as a possible host country for the university headquarters.
It disturbs me to hear of such grandiose schemes, when
so much money has been spent by the developed nations
on education. Here we are attempting to build a global
super structure on top of the traditional centres of learning in Europe, the United States and Canada. Are we to be
brainwashed by such a concept? Have we not succeeded in
building and establishing our centres of learning to
encompass this global view? Surely, the universities of
Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, Yale, Laval, Toronto, McGill
and the Sorbonne, just to mention a few, have established
themselves through the centuries as international centres
of learning? Have we overlooked the Pearson College
concept or the United World College Organization? Do we
not have a moral obligation to continue the dream of
Lester Pearson? Do we not have the courage of lending
some support to our former colleague, John Nichol, who
resigned from this chamber last year to preside over the
Lester B. Pearson College of the Pacific? Can the existing
centres of learning not cope with "the pressing global
problems of human survival, development and welfare," or
is this passé?
What concerns me is the additional cost involved to
erect and maintain such a university in one centre. So far I
have not seen any estimates of the total capital cost of the
development. At a time when the United Nations is
experiencing serious financial problems, it would seem
highly undesirable to place further pressure on its funds.
A second concern of mine is the Canadian government's
support of such a proposal. How can one level of government in our country be prepared to spend more of its
taxpayers' money in a venture of this size, when provincial ceilings for education in Canada are being lowered on
our citizens and our own educational system is being
impaired? By supporting the UN resolution, Canada is
ther-by prepared to commit itself to an even larger financial UN assessment.
Let us not overlook the important contribution Canada
has made, and continues to make, in assisting developing
countries. In 1971, Canada ranked sixth among the industrialized nations as a donor country. In 1973, the Canadian
government provided over $430 million for development
assistance through the Canadian International Development Agency and the International Development Research
Centre.
I notice in the estimates for 1974-75, that the President
of CIDA, Monsieur Gérin-Lajoie, the former Minister of
Education in Quebec, will be privileged to spend on our
behalf over $549 million for programs in the underdeveloped countries.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Is it not $600 million odd?

March 26, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Mr. Bélisle: According to the estimates that I have
here, it is $549 million.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I think it is $672 million.
Hon. Mr. Bélisle: I can give you the figures for 1972-73.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Je pense que c'est $672 millions.
Hon. Mr. Bélisle: If you say it is $600 million odd, that is
even more. This will take the form of multilateral and
bilateral aid which includes the allocation of funds for the
various UN programs.
The International Development Research Centre is
another very worthwhile program, founded on Canadian
initiative, where we contribute towards solving the problems of the developing regions of the world. As many of
you know, the International Development Research
Centre is not a crown corporation but an international
public corporation, created by an act of the Canadian
Parliament in 1970 to support research designed to adapt
science and technology to the specific needs of developing
countries. The centre is unique in that, while it is financed
by the Canadian Parliament, it is governed by an international board of governors who independently set its policies and priorities. The headquarters of the centre is in
Ottawa. District offices are located in Quebec, Montreal,
Guelph, Edmonton and Vancouver, and regional offices in
Bogota, Columbia and Singapore.
In 1973, the Canadian Parliament granted $8 million to
this international agency for the establishment and
advancement of scientific and technical research programs
in those regions. In 1974-75, our contribution to this
worthy cause will increase to about $14 million. How much
more can we afford to spread our resources around the
globe without losing our effectiveness in this field? A UN
university will only duplicate what we already have.
To summarize: Canada contributes its fair share to the
United Nations and its affiliated agencies for peacekeeping and development aid:

That represents an increase of $147 million for one year
alone, and it does not count our generous contribution to
the Colombo Plan.
Hon. Mr. Martin: The increase for total aid this year
was $73 million.

Hon. Mr. Bélisle: I have checked and no figures were
available for what we have spent and what we will be
spending on the Colombo Plan.
It should be remembered that these contributions are
over and above those given by Canada for OXFAM,
CARE, and other worthy religious and private agencies.
From my many discussions with members of other delegations, I consider that Canada's major contribution to the
United Nations and world problems in general is in the
field of foreign aid. We should be concentrating our energies in the 15 intergovernmental agencies which study the
problems of and assist developing nations in the fields of
agriculture and food, labour, world health, education and
technical assistance, communications, tariffs and trade,
international finance and atomic energy.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Would my honourable friend permit
me to point out that the increase in the total aid budget
this year is about $73 million over 1973-74.
Hon. Mr. Bélisle: I was quoting 1972-73.
Hon. Mr. Martin: But I said that it is an increase of
about $73 million this year, 1974-75.
Hon. Mr. Bélisle: And I was excluding all our cost of
operation. The cost figures that I have given are only for
our foreign aid.
Hon. Mr. Martin: That is what I am talking about.
Hon. Mr. Bélisle: This is not the cost of staffing our
embassies. It has nothing to do with it; in other words, it is
nearly a billion dollar price.
Hon. Mr. Martin: It is $670 million odd.
* (2130)

Hon. Mr. Bélisle: If you include all other costs from all
other departments pertaining to federal external affairs, it
is nearly a billion dollars.
The time has come, honourable senators, when we must
sit down and count the costs of world government. We
must examine our own physical, human and financial
resources. We must establish our needs and priorities in
relation to basic world needs. We must concentrate on
improving what we have by solving our own urgent problems first, before supporting the building of castles in the
air and pursuing grandiose world dreams.
Hon. Miss Lapointe: May I ask a question of the Honourable Senator Hicks?
Senator, you said that Barbados was accepted as a new
member of the United Nations last year. Did you mean,
rather, the Bahamas? Barbados has been a member of the
United Nations for quite some time.
Hon. Mr. Hicks: That is correct. I had it written correctly in my notes, which I was not looking at, and I suppose I
must have used the wrong reference.
Hon. Mr. Martin: They are both good places in which to
sit in the sun, anyway.

[Translation]
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, I have a question for Senator Bélisle. I did not want to interrupt him
because I agree with most of his remarks tonight.

SENATE DEBATES
Still, when he mentioned the tax burden on Canadian
taxpayers for our contribution to the security forces in
countries where conflicts are possible or exist I wondered,
and would like to ask him, whether in his figures he
excluded the pay to our troops which otherwise would
have been a burden for Canada, for the Canadian taxpayers, had these troops stayed in Canada instead of going to
Cyprus or elsewhere?
I believe that when figures are quoted such as those we
were given this evening, this very important distinction
should be made because, in fact, the troops' pay which
would otherwise have been paid are included in the figures he mentioned, when in fact the difference in tax
burden includes only the cost of logistics, transportation
and other special costs borne by our troops in foreign
countries. I would ask therefore whether he made that
distinction in his figures.
Hon. Mr. Bélisle: I am happy to notice that my honourable colleague did follow my speech a bit.
I did not include the figures related to our forces
because it is almost impossible to compile those figures at
the Secretary of State Department. Moreover, and my
honourable friend knows it as well as I do, they are
included as a whole and do not give any detail to the effect
that those forces have been paid in this country or that
they have been employed in this country or elsewhere.
Moreover, about CUSO, I agree that our help has been
well used. Unfortunately, we are spending too much and
without planning.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I think that we are misunderstanding each other or maybe that we do not understand each
other at all.
I was not at all speaking about CUSO. I alluded to those
expenses which are a burden to the Canadian taxpayer for
the maintenance of security forces outside the country,
for instance, in Vietnam or elsewhere. I think you mentioned the Congo, the Middle East, and when you said that
this was costing money to the Canadian taxpayers, I think
that the subtraction should be made of what this would
have cost if our soldiers had remained in this country, or
the maintenance of those forces in Canada, the only difference in the additional burden for the Canadian taxpayer being the transport and logistics expenses overseas
which, I understand, must be higher than if those
expenses had been incurred by troops based in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Asselin: In other words it would be more
costly to keep them in Canada?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Less costly.
Hon. Mr. Bélisle: I mentioned in my speech not only
that we have paid our contribution to the United Nations,
but I think that I quoted an increase of $1,600,000. It is
therefore impossible for me to say whether that money
was spent for the maintenance of Canadian forces in
Canada or abroad, because no figure is available.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: You do answer exactly my question.
You did not make the deduction which should have been
made, in my opinion, if those forces had remained in
Canada instead of going abroad. I think that you have
answered my question quite directly.
[Hon. Mr. Langlois.]

March 26, 1974

[English]
Hon. Mr. Hicks: Honourable senators, may I interject
here, too? I follow the point Senator Langlois has been
making, and it is quite true that the additional cost to
Canada of using regular troops is comprised of transporting the troops and maintaining them outside Canada. But
Canada has heretofore suffered unfair treatment in its
contribution to United Nations peacekeeping forces in that
the United Nations has offered to pay to Canada, and has
paid to Canada, sums of money approximating only these
extra costs, whereas the United Nations has at the same
time paid the full cost, including the total salaries, of
troops from other countries of the world who simply make
the argument that they do not have enough regular troops
and have, therefore, to call up reservists to do the work.
So, Canada has not been getting the same treatment as
other member states who have contributed to peacekeeping forces.
One of the points Canada was making in respect to the
United Nations Emergency Force in the Near East was
that this time we were going to demand the same treatment for our forces as that accorded to the forces of other
member states. This question had not been resolved when
I left the United Nations, and I am not sure whether it has
been resolved to Canada's satisfaction yet. Perhaps the
Leader of the Government in the Senate knows.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I do not want to intervene in the
debate, because I should like to say something later. But I
will intervene to the extent of putting a question to both
senators. Is it not a fact that if Canada's proportion in a
number of these peacekeeping operations has been far and
above that of some other members of the United Nations,
it is simply because Canada wanted that situation to
obtain in order to bring into being peacekeeping forces in
particular situations? That certainly was true in at least
four operations, including Cyprus.
Hon. Mr. Hicks: Yes, I agree.
Hon. Mr. Bélisle: May I answer the Leader of the Government by saying that we do not know what took place in
the past, because the figures are not available. It may be
true that the government was paying extra money to be
part of the delegation. But this time why beg, when we are
not wanted? And why do we have to pay 25 per cent more
than any other country in order to have a peacekeeping
force? Why?
Hon. Mr. Martin: If I were to answer that question now,
I would incur the everlasting enmity of Senator Aird, and
that I do not propose to do.
[Translation]
Hon. Mr. Langlois: One last question. I should like
Senator Bélisle to understand that I agree perfectly with
everything he says. I only want him to clarify the matter
of the insurance premiums that we are paying.
Before concluding, if the premium were too high, would
the cost of a disaster have to be determined if it had
happened?
Hon. Mr. Bélisle: As concerns the insurance premiums,
if we are farther from the Middle East and pay the oilproducing countries ten times as much, would not the
insurance premium be excessive since we are far from the

conflict and especially since these countries are making
billions and billions of dollars? Should they not at least
contribute an equal amount since they have a population
of 375 million, while ours is only 23 million? I could give
you the income figures or the gross national product of
oil-producing countries, but it is ridiculous for us to
remain the milch cow of other countries.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: But the conflict is f ar away.

FOREIGN AFFAIRS
COMMITTEE AUTHORIZED TO EXAMINE AND REPORT ON
CANADIAN RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES

Hon. John B. Aird moved pursuant to notice:
That the Standing Senate Committee on Foreign
Affairs be authorized to examine and report upon
Canadian relations with the United States; and
That the committee be empowered to engage the
services of such counsel and technical, clerical and
other personnel as may be required for the purpose of
the said examination, at such rates of remuneration
and reimbursement as the committee may determine,
and to compensate witnesses by reimbursement of
travelling and living expenses, if required, in such
amount as the committee may determine.
He said: Honourable senators, in the most simple language, your committee is asking for authorization to
examine and report upon Canadian relations with the
United States. I happen to believe that very often simple
words cover a most complicated subject, and this was
never more true than in this particular instance.
For me, two questions immediately arise: First, is the
Standing Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs a proper
forum, and capable of performing such a formidable and
challenging task? Secondly, if it is capable, and if it is an
appropriate forum, how does your committee propose to go
about programming such an encyclopedic undertaking?
If the answer to my first question is in the affirmative,
and I believe it is, then the answer to the second question
has to be: Constructively and very carefully.
Why do I think that the Standing Senate Committee on
Foreign Affairs is capable of, and the appropriate forum
for, such an inquiry? Honourable senators, I believe that
the competence of the committee is now reasonably established. I believe that its previous reports on Canada's
relations with the Caribbean, the Pacific Rim, and, most
recently, the European Community, have had a positive
public response-particularly in the press and the Canadian business community, which apparently have found
these reports both timely and useful. I believe this to be
particularly true of our recent report on the European
Community. The European Community report has not
only been well debated in this chamber, but used as a
basic document by other institutions, conferences and
seminars since its issue last July.
In the same vein, and not by way of a digression, on
November 1 last a delegation of 16 members from the

Community's Parliament visited the Canadian Parliament. This was the first formal visit between the two
Parliaments, and it came about as a direct result of the
Senate committee's initiative in meeting informally a
group of European parliamentarians in Brussels earlier in
the year. The Ottawa meeting, organized jointly by the
committees of the House of Commons and Senate dealing
with foreign affairs, proved to be a useful one. Several
senators have already spoken about this meeting and the
joint communiqué resulting from it, so I will not go into
details.
However, I do think that two recommendations of the
European Community report should be reiterated, largely
because they have not yet come to pass.
First, your committee has continued to press for the
most desirable objective of the opening of a Community
information office, or the establishment of a Community
delegation office in Ottawa. Secondly, the committee
recommended and urged a head-of-government visit to
Brussels. In my view it is regrettable that circumstances
have not yet enabled a basis for a visit by the Prime
Minister to the European Community headquarters. I am
sure that the committee continues to consider that this is a
necessary policy step, valuable in Europe to alert them to
Canada's interest, and important in Canada in order to
focus Canadian public attention on the Community.
In addition, of course, world events-the outbreak of the
Arab-Israeli war, the global energy crisis, and mounting
problems in the international monetary system-have
focused world attention on the role of the European Community. In fact, the recent unilateral actions of some of its
member countries have clearly demonstrated the delicate
nature of its very existence, and its present apparent
disarray has discouraged many of its advocates.
But to return to my original point and question, it seems
clear that our report, our European "handbook," did
matter, did have a useful function and, therefore, was an
appropriate use of the Senate's time. More important, I
believe that it demonstrated the professional competence
of the committee, which encourages me to conclude positively that the committee is an appropriate forum, and
that it can effectively carry out an inquiry into Canada's
relations with the United States.
This brings me to my second question, of how your
committee proposes to undertake such a formidable taskand I repeat these words-constructively and very carefully. I believe that the tentative program approved last week
by your committee is a logical and careful plan.
There may well be some among you who will say we are
brave indeed to undertake such a vast, complicated and
sensitive project. I would agree that in the whole picture
of Canadian external relations there is a no more complex
subject. But I would also submit that there is for Canada a
no more important subject. This relationship matters tremendously to us as a country.
I hardly need recite to the members of this chamber the
relevant trade statistics. In 1973, 68 per cent of our exports
went to the United States, 70 per cent of our imports came
from them, for a total trade between Canada and the
United States valued at $33 billion. For even the United
States Canada is its most important trading partner,

SENATE DEBATES
taking more than 20 per cent of its exports-roughly as
much as the United States exports to Japan, West Germany, the United Kingdom and The Netherlands combined. We are each other's best customer. The difference is
in Canadian vulnerability and heavy dependance on
export trade. As an export-oriented country-20 per cent
of the Canadian GNP depends on exports as compared to 4
per cent in the U.S.-we can hardly survive as a nation
without the United States market.
And I need not remind you that trade is only one aspect
of a multi-faceted relationship. There is a continuous
intermeshing in almost every field of endeavour. In transportation, energy, cultural relations, communications,
international trade unions, business corporations, defence
arrangements, fisheries, finance and investments, environmental concerns and trans-border tourism, Canada has a
constant and complex relationship with its southern
neighbour. One cannot overstress the implications for
Canada of this situation.
Why, you may ask, should we undertake this task at this
time? My response is that there is a gap, a need for a
thorough examination of this subject which is on nearly
every thinking Canadian's mind, and about which nearly
every Canadian has an opinion or a strong point of view.
In 1970, when the government produced its "Foreign
Policy for Canadians" booklets, you will recall there was a
significant omission, a "missing booklet". Although there
were separate booklets on Europe, on the Pacific countries, on Latin America, on international development and
on the United Nations, presumably by design there was
no study of Canada's relationship with the United States.
Whether the subject proved too unwidely or too sensitive,
or simply just too difficult, the government chose not to
tackle specifically the Canadian-American relationship.
The House of Commons Committee on External Affairs
and National Defence subsequently noted the omission
and chose to examine certain aspects of the Canada-United States relationship, but it dealt mainly with the
increasingly topical issue of foreign (United States)
ownership and investment in Canada, with some attention
focused on trade union links and cultural influences.
*

(2150)

Partly as a result of public criticism and partly due to a
realization of the need for an overall strategy in dealing
with the United States after the events of August 1971,
the Department of External Affairs did present in October 1972 its policy paper on Canada-United States relations entitled Options for the Future. This paper outlined,
for the long term, the chosen direction of government
policy from among possible alternatives. It is the committee's view that there has never been a more appropriate
time than right now for full discussion and continuing
examination of the general issues involved in the Canadian-United States relationship, as well as a study of the
most important specific issues in the relationship.
Honourable senators, what we propose to do is begin
with a general examination and assessment of the Options
for the Future policy paper in order to gain an initial
overview of the directions Canadian policies should be
taking. We also hope to look at any significant shift in the
Canada-United States relationship in the past several
years, and to reassess the strengths and weaknesses of
Canada's negotiating position. To this end the Secretary of
[Hon. Mr. Aird]

March 26, 1974

State for External Affairs, the Honourable Mitchell Sharp,
will be our first witness on Thursday night, March 28 at 8
p.m. This is the only time that is mutually convenient, and
in view of the importance of the first meeting and the fact
that the minister will be present it is to be hoped that
there will be a full turnout by the committee and, of
course, all other interested senators will be most cordially
welcomed.
Hon. Mr. Martin: That is next Thursday night?
Hon. Mr. Aird: Yes, senator.
Hon. Mr. Martin: That means that we must have this
resolution adopted before then.
Hon. Mr. Aird: That is right. On a personal note, I must
say that although it is flattering to know that there is a
quite long waiting list of applicants for places on the
committee, I am sorry that a few senators have been
disappointed that they have not been named to the committee. I say to them that they are always welcome at any
and all hearings.
Hon. Mr. Martin: And to participate.
Hon. Mr. Aird: Then, before getting into a more specific
bilateral policy area such as Canadian trade relations with
the United States, we propose to examine an element in
the relationship which is often taken for granted or overlooked, but which is absolutely fundamental. I refer to the
institutional links, or, as I prefer, the bilateral machinery,
governmental as well as non-governmental, through
which the two countries and their citizens maintain contact, conduct business, handle negotiations, et cetera.
These institutional arrangements between Canada and
the United States are basic and myriad. Federal, provincial and state governmental departments and agencies are
involved in a constant and complex intermeshing on a
daily, often hourly, basis at all levels. All these components bring Americans and Canadians into contact with
each other in almost every possible field of endeavour.
The committee would like to assess the extent and
effectiveness of these institutional elements, probably
beginning with the governmental and intergovernmental
machinery on the Canadian side. We wish to look at the
degree of co-ordination of Canadian policies toward the
United States achieved among various departmental components, and between federal and provincial institutions;
to examine, possibly with the help of a subcommittee, the
functioning and effectiveness of joint machinery such as
the International Joint Commission, and to assess the
extent and importance of non-governmental institutional
arrangements in the relationship. Finally, we hope to
make some assessment of the relative merits of negotiating with the United States in a multilateral, as opposed to
a bilateral, context.
The committee hopes to complete these two preliminary
examinations-that is, the general look at the government's policy direction, and the study of the functioning
of the bilateral machinery in the conduct of Canada-United States relations-by the autumn. We then propose to
take, one at a time, specific issue areas which would form
the basis for a series of reports on Canada-United States
relations. The first area, because of its overriding importance, would be bilateral trade relations. At that stage we

March 26, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

could reassess our position and decide whether to take up
any further topics.
In conclusion, honourable senators, may I make it clear
that the committee is well aware of what a complicated
and difficult study it proposes to undertake. It is aware of
the responsibility it has to produce first-class reports.
With your support I think we can do that. I commend the
motion to your favourable consideration.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators, as the
seconder of the motion perhaps I may be permitted a few
brief remarks, the first being that it is doubtful that the
committee would have had the courage to undertake this
inquiry had it not been for the fact that its chairman is
Senator Aird, whose background and experience is such
that no member of any committee of Parliament tackling a
subject like this could hope to have. As honourable senators are aware, Senator Aird is co-chairman of the Canada-United States Defence Committee. He took the place of
the late Mr. Pearson on the Committee of Nine, and he has
devoted a great deal of careful consideration to the very
important question of Canada-United States relations.
Those of us who are members of the committee will
remember the way in which he directed our inquiry into
the Canada-EEC relations to the broader context of not
only Canada-Europe-United States relations, but also our
relations with other countries of the world, particularly
Japan and Latin America.
I am sure honourable senators will know that the committee's decision to embark on this important study was
not an easy one. As Senator Aird has said, it sounds simple
for the committee to ask to be "authorized to examine and
report upon Canadian relations with the United States."
The committee is well aware that there are other similar
examinations presently under way, one, of course, being
that of the study group of the Canada-United States Committee, which met this afternoon and which will be presenting its report to the members of that committee tomorrow-a report dealing with how to do a better job in the
future than bas been done in the past in its contacts in this
area of Canada-United States relations.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Will that be tomorrow afternoon?
Hon. Mr. Aird: Perhaps I might be permitted to interject here to say that that meeting bas been postponed to a
week hence.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Thank you very much for that information. I had a notice about an hour ago saying that it was
going to be held tomorrow evening. In view of the shakeup that the commonalty gave the study group a week ago,
I am not surprised that the study group has decided to
take a little more time before facing the commonalty of
that group again. The very fact that such problems arose
in that more or less simple exercise indicates the complexity of the problems that will be before the committee
if this request for authorization to make this study of
Canada-United States relations is granted.
The most important thing that occurs to me about this
and other activities of our own committee, and the matching committee in the other place, is that they indicate that
there has been a great change in the official approach of
Canadians to our relations with the other nations of the
world.

a (2200)

For far too long these relations were conducted almost
in secret. When I raise this matter occasionally the Leader
of the Government gives me his annual or semi-annual
lecture on the prerogative of the Crown in respect to
international relations. I am glad to say that while that
prerogative is still part of our constitutional law, it is
being widely ignored by parliamentarians who are now
insisting on having a voice in the examination of the
manner in which our relations with other countries of the
world are conducted.
The committee bas gone about this project with extreme
care. I know that Senator Aird bas spent long hours
discussing the advantages and disadvantages, and the dangers and prospects of such an inquiry. I know that he has
recommended to the committee that we enter upon it with
great caution, and I am glad to hear him report to the
Senate that this will be done in stages; that having looked
at the one aspect, trade relations between Canada and the
United States, we will see how well we have done, what
we can contribute in that area, before we go on, perhaps,
to other areas. An obviously difficult one, of course, would
be that of defence.
We are entering into this inquiry at a time when I think
it is quite factual to say that relations between Canada
and the United States are abnormal. At the present time
we have confrontations, and there are irritants between
us that have not been usual in the long history of our
relations with the United States. Many of us are aware
that in that long history the United States bas been more
than generous to Canada in the development of some of its
international policies. If in recent years some of us feel
that that country bas been less than generous, then I think
we have the responsibility to develop a basis of understanding of that change in attitude.
We are all aware of the great problem that has developed quite recently in United States-European relationships. The famous "Year of Europe" bas gone with the
wind. I read only today a statement by a prominent international commentator that relations between the United
States and Europe are at such a critical stage that democracy itself in Europe may be in danger; that it may not be
possible for Europe, if it is not able to resolve its difficulties with the United States, to maintain its present kind of
democracy over the next two decades.
We, fortunately, have not reached that point in our
relations with the United States. We do tend to stress the
irritants, forgetting that the real problem here is the
problem of two neighbours living together. We cannot
take the easy way out that sometimes dissatisfied neighbours can. We cannot move away; we are here. We cannot
call in the cops, we cannot go to city council, we cannot
form irate ratepayers' associations. We simply have to face
the fact that we are living together, that we have more
mutual interests, perhaps, than any two nations anywhere
in the world, and, in my view, it is in the activities, the
contacts and the discussions between parliamentarians of
both nations that we are most likely to come up with
solutions that will be mutually acceptable.
I am quite sure that the committee, under the chairmanship of Senator Aird, is capable of making an important
contribution. It is a real tribute to Senator Aird that for

SENATE DEBATES

the first time in the history of the Standing Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, there is a queue of senators
wanting to join him in the great work he is doing.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, even at this late
hour I would have preferred, really, to have adjourned the
debate. We are anxious, of course, as Senator Aird has
said, that this matter be disposed of so that the committee
can be set up to begin its first session on Thursday after
dinner, when the Secretary of State for External Affairs
appears. However, as no one else seems to wish to make
any observation, I would simply like to say that Senator
Aird need not apologize for the decision of the members of
the committee to take on this subject. It is not the first
time that a parliamentary body has examined CanadaUnited States relations, but perhaps there never was such
a time in the history of both countries when those relations deserved to be examined in an in-depth study, as is
contemplated by the committee.
Senator Grosart has said that many bodies, voluntary
bodies outside the parliamentary precinct, year after year,
examine some aspect of our relations with the United
States-political aspects, cultural aspects, social aspects,
and so on. If there is any body in Canada that should not
hesitate to examine our relations with our neighbour, the
most powerful country in the world, it is the Parliament of
Canada. And if there is any one house in these two houses
that has the time and, consequently, the responsibility of
making such a study, it is this chamber. I therefore strongly commend Senator Aird's initiative and that of the
members of the committee who have decided to give this
matter the study which it deserves. I do not believe that
Senator Aird should in any way feel inhibited or apologetic. This is something that is long overdue and deserves to
receive our full support.
It is important to take into consideration the observation just made by Senator Grosart, namely, that this
committee has a long queue of members who would like to
participate in the work of the committee as members of it.
Unfortunately, they cannot all be members of the committee, but all members of the Senate can attend and put
questions. They can participate short of exercising the
right to vote, and I sincerely hope that this will be done. If
the queue is as Senator Grosart indicated, I am sure it will
be very much in evidence when the Senate committee sits
Thursday evening. I congratulate Senator Aird on his
speech. He well knows that I am always anxious to hear
him, and the occasions are all too rare when his wisdom,
experience and good nature are given an opportunity to be
demonstrated in this house.

e

(2210)

Hon. Mr. Aird: Honourable senators, I understand that I
have the privilege of making a few remarks in closing. I
am likely to be embarrassed by the way in which the
record will read as it relates to me in my capacity as
chairman. The strength of the committee lies in its members. Over the past five years the membership of this
committee has gone from strength to strength. When the
committee held its organizational meeting the other day,
16 of its 20 members were present, which indicates the
high degree of interest shown by the committee members.
I would not like the debate to close without my putting
[Hon. Mr. Grosart.]

March 26, 1974

the record straight. It is the membership that makes the
committee function so effectively.
Motion agreed to.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, before we
adjourn, Senator Buckwold wishes to make some
announcements.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: Honourable senators, a certain
amount of confusion might arise because of the number of
committee meetings to be held tomorrow and on Thursday. Most of the meetings are organizational. Tomorrow,
March 27, at 9.30 a.m., the organization meeting of the
Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional
Affairs will be held in room 263-S. At 10 a.m., the organization meeting of the Standing Senate Committee on Transport and Communications will be held in room 256-S. Also
at 10 a.m., the Standing Senate Committee on National
Finance will be dealing with supplementary estimates (B)
in room 356-S. That committee has already held its organization meeting.
At 10.30 a.m., the organization meeting of the Standing
Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce will
be held in room 256-S, following the meeting of the Standing Senate Committee on Transport and Communications.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Is the honourable senator in a position to say whether any consideration has been given to
problems arising from committee meetings held on
Wednesday mornings? Many senators have other obligations, and I have received complaints about meetings
being held on Wednesday mornings. Has that been taken
into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: There has not yet been any serious
consideration of that matter. We all agree that this problem does exist. The meetings tomorrow morning will be
brief. Hopefully at an early date I shall be able to discuss
with the Leader of the Government and the Leader of the
Opposition the matter of committee meetings conflicting
with our other obligations.
Hon. Mr. Asselin: Will notice be given to committee
members tomorrow morning?
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: Yes. Some notices will not be in
the mail until tomorrow morning. On Thursday, March 28,
at 9.30 a.m., an organization meeting of the Internal
Economy Committee will be held in room 263-S. As we
have heard from Senator Aird, the Standing Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs will meet in the evening, when
the witness will be the Minister for External Affairs.
I hope that as many senators as possible will attend the
organization meetings of the committees on which they
serve and will notify those of their colleagues who are not
at present in the chamber.
Hon. Mr. Larnontagne: What about the Standing
Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and Science? It had
been suggested that it meet at 9.30 a.m. on Thursday.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: I appreciate having that matter
drawn to my attention. I suggest that the committee hold

March 26, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

its organization meeting at 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, March
28, in room 263-S.
Hon. Mr'. Martin: Senator Langlois has pointed out that
tomorrow's meeting of the Finance Committee Will flot he
a short one. The President of the Treasury Board will be in
attendance.

Hon. Mr'. Buckwold: It is understandable that there may

APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 2, 1974
FIRST READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, a request
has been received f rom the CBC in Edmonton for permission to photograph the Senate chamber when vacant.
I inquired as to the reason for this request and was
informed that the CBC wishes to use the photograph as
part of a documentary film being produced about Premier
Lougheed of Alberta. As honourable senators know,
Premier Lougheed's grandfather, Sir James Alexander
Lougheed, was a member of this chamber from 1889 to
1925. He was a well-known member of the Senate and
made many speeches. I understand that in a speech he
made here on July 13, 1905, hie referred in part to the
Northwest Territories, which is a subject of interest at the
presenit time. The CBC wishes to take a photograph of this
chamber to be incorporated in the documentary. When the
documentary is shown, an unidientified voice will read
Senator Lougheed's speech.
Honourable senators, is it agreed that the CBC be permitted to photograph the Senate Chamber?
Hon. Mr. Asselin: When will they do this?
The Hon. the Speaker: As I understand it, they will
make arrangements with a photographer here in Ottawa to
take the photograph when the chamber is vacant. They
will, ot course, ask permission of the Clerk of the Senate
before doing so.
Hon. Mr. Martin; Will the "unidentified voire" be Senator Flynn's?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I doubt il very much. My French accent
would not fit the occasion.
The Hon. the Speaker: la it agreed, honourable senators, that the CBC have permission to do this?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.

year ending the 31st March, 1974 and tabled in the
Senate on Tuesday, 12th March, 1974."
2. This is an interim report to be followed by additional hearings on the said Supplementary Estimates (B) for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1974,
leading to a final report.
3. In obedience to the foregoing, your Committee
made a general examination of the Supplementary
Estimates (B) and heard evidence from The Honourable C. M. Drury, President of the Treasury Board,
and Mr. B. A. MacDonald, Assistant Secretary, Program Branch, Treasury Board.
4. These Supplementary Estimates total $1,120 million and bring the total Estimates tabled for the fiscal

year ending March 31, 1974 to $21,411 million. It is to
be noted that the Supplementary Estimates (A) and
(B) total $2,124 million increasing the original Main
Estimates from $19,286 million, which, in percentage
terms, is an increase of Il per cent. This increase in
the size of Supplementary Estimates in relation to the
original Main Estimates has been growing over the
past few years and is a matter of concern to your
Committee.
5. The largest items in these Supplementary Estimates are as follows:
(a) A payment to the Old Age Security Fund to
make up the deficiency in the fund, which has
arisen out of the increase in the basic pension and
the introduction of quarterly indexing-$235 million
(b) Higher Family Allowance payments reflecting
the increase in the average payment from $12 to $20
for each child, following the increase last October
from the $6 and $8 rates which then prevailed-$190
million
(c) Subsidies to hold down the price of petroleum
products to Canadian consumers despite the steep
rise in world prices-$240 million
(d) Equalization payments to certain provinces reflecting the recent amendments to the relevant statute so as to include education property taxes as a
revenue to be equalized-$146 million
(e) Another payment to the provinces under revenue guarantees that accompanied tax reform-$50
million
(f) Payments to Alberta and Saskatchewan as provided under the Oil Export Tax Act-$76 million
(g) Payments to the railways to compensate them
for the freezing of freight rates-$41 million
(h) Additional subsidies to producers of manufactured milk-$31 million
6. The Treasury Board has supplied your committee
with a list explaining the $1 items in Supplementary
Estimates (B).
7. Your Committee expressed concern about the lack
of detail that is available in the Supplementary Estimates on the source of funds that constitute a transfer
from a vote in previous Estimates to the new Supplementary Estimates. Your Committee recommends that
in the case where funds are transferred that full detail
be given on the sources of these funds, especially if
the source is due to a reduction in a capital project.
8. In continuing its examination on Supplementary
Estimates (B), your Committee proposes to consider
the following items:
(a) The growth in the personnel establishment in
the Public Service of the Federal Government. In
this connection the following figures indicate the
man years in each of 3 years from 1971-1974 for
departments, departmental corporations, departmental agencies and certain Crown Corporations
whose man years are subject to Treasury Board
control:
Year
Total Personnel
1971-72
256,000 man years

SENATE DEBATES

265,000 man years
1972-73
292,000 man years
1973-74
These figures indicate an average increase of
employment over the last 3 years of 6 per cent per
year.
(b) The auditing procedures that are to be employed
in ensuring that the $240 million paid to oil importers for the restraint of prices of petroleum products
to consumers during the period commencing January 1, 1974 and ending March 31, 1974, are fully
adequate.
(c) At March 31, 1971 the Old Age Security Fund
had a cash balance of $728.4 million. As at March 31,
1974 it is forecast that the fund will have a cash
deficit of $235 million. Your Committee proposes to
enquire into the reasons for this situation and what
steps are being taken to correct them.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this report be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Everett: Honourable senators, with leave of
the Senate, I move that this report be now adopted.
I may say by way of explanation that the committee did
not conclude its examination of supplementary estimates
(B), but in view of the fact that a supply bill is now before
us it was concluded that the right and proper thing to do
was to issue an interim report. This report has just been
presented, and the committee will continue its examination of supplementary estimates (B) next week and, in
due course, make a final report to the Senate.
I might only mention that there are three areas where
the committee wishes to obtain further background. First
of all, your committee is concerned about the growth in
the personnel establishment in the federal Public Service.
In 1971-72 it totalled 256,000 man years; in 1972-73, 265,000
man years; in 1973-74, 292,000 man years. This is an
increase in the total personnel man years of 6 per cent per
year.
The other area that your committee is interested in is
the sufficiency of the auditing procedures to be employed
in the payment of the $240 million in respect of petroleum
products to restrain the prices of these petroleum products
to consumers between January 1, 1974, and March 31, 1974.
Preliminary examination by the committee would indicate
that at this stage there are no adequate auditing procedures to ensure that the Government of Canada does not
pay out more than the required amount to the major oil
importers in order to maintain the price freeze in effect
from January 1, 1974, to March 31, 1974.
The third area that your committee is interested in is
the fact that the old age security fund at March 31, 1971,
had a cash balance of $728 million, and it is estimated that
by the end of this month that cash balance-that is, three
years later-will drop to a deficit of $235 million. That is a
turnaround of close to a billion dollars. Your committee
would like more details as to how this situation occurred
and what steps are being taken to put the fund back into
balance.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators, we in this
group concur with this rather unusual method of discharging the duties of the National Finance Committee to the
Senate. As honourable senators are aware, the Senate
[Hon. Mr. Everett.]

March 27, 1974

requires that the supplementary estimates, the subject of
any appropriation bill, be referred to and reported on by
the committee before the Senate will consider the bill
itself.
This morning we discovered what has been becoming
more and more evident, that a mere single sitting of the
committee is not sufficient to satisfy the inquiries that
senators wish to direct towards the minister or ministers
and the officials. Senator Everett has mentioned that a
number of matters had to be left over this morning for
further consideration. I happen to know that there are a
good many more that would have been inquired into this
morning had we had time. So the situation is that the
committee now discharges its duty by making an interim
report to the Senate and will then carry on its inquiry and,
I presume, will later on make a final and complete report
on the matters that Senator Everett has mentioned and on
some others.
It does indicate increasing interest of members of the
Senate in the work of the National Finance Committee
under Senator Everett. It is becoming more important
each time we examine a bill to realize that the estimates
on which that bill is based are not adequately examined in
the other place. That is not a criticism of the other place,
because the approach there is quite different from ours. I
welcome the fact that the committee is making now a
much more detailed and closer examination of the estimates than we have done in the past.

a

(1420)

Hon. Mr. Buckwold: Honourable senators, may I
address myself to the Chairman of the Standing Senate
Committee on National Finance? I wonder if the committee could add one more subject which would be of interest
to senators. The answer may not be forthcoming now, but
I feel an attempt should be made to know just where we
are going so far as the $240 million is concerned which is
being budgeted by the Department of Energy, Mines and
Resources for payments for the stabilization of petroleum
product prices in Canada. As we are aware, this represents
the maintenance of a lower, subsidized price across the
country.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: That is what Senator Everett said.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: I am sorry. I did not hear that as
being one of the questions under further review. Perhaps
that could be clarified before I go on.
Hon. Mr. Everett: You have raised a good point, Senator
Buckwold, and, indeed, on page 3 of our report, with
respect to one of the areas we propose to examine, we
state:
The auditing procedures that are to be employed in
ensuring that the $240 million paid to oil importers for
the restraint of prices of petroleum products to consumers during the period commencing January 1, 1974,
and ending March 31, 1974, are fully adequate.
I appreciate the senator's bringing this to my attention.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: I am aware of the auditing. However, in view of the state of flux at the present time, my
concern is with regard to where the money is going to
come from, who is going to get what out of higher prices
for oil, and from whom are they going to get it? I gather

March 27, 1974
Marc

27,1974SENATE

that, basically, this is to be financed from the revenue
from the oil export tax. Perhaps "oil export surcharge"
would be a better way of putting it.
I know that many of us are confused on this issue, but it
depends on just how much the oil-producing provinces are
going to get of the higher prices as to what is left in the
difference between that price for export and the export
tax received. In the light of the current situation I certainly hope some attempt will be made to get information on
how all of this is going to be financed.
Hon. Mr. Everett: I think, Senator Buckwold, you must
understand that we are dealing here with supplementary
estimates (B), which is where our authority lies. As I
understand it, the $240 million is out of the general revenues. However, I understand further that a bill will be
submitted in April to appropriate moneys received from
the oil export tax in order to make the subsidy payments.
Obviously, this is going to be the subject of intense discussions between the heads of government, and I doubt very
much if our authority would permit us to go into the
matter in much detail. What we would really be dealing
with would be the $240 million that is being appropriated
here by way of supplementary estimates for the period
January 1 to March 31.
Motion agreed to and report adopted.

SCIENCE POLICY
COMMITTEE APPOINTED TO ORGANIZE AND HOLD
CONFERENCE TO ESTABLISH COMMISSION ON THE FUTURE
Hon. Maurice Larnontagne moved pursuant to notice:
That a Special Committee of the Senate, to be
known as the Special Committee of the Senate on
Science Policy, be appointed to organize and hold a
Conference for the purpose of determining the feasibility of establishing a Commission on the Future,
whose responsibility would be to help as many private
and public organizations as possible to forecast and
build their future not only in isolation but together, as
was recommended in Chapter 13 of Volume 2 of the
Report of the Special Committee of the Senate on
Science Policy; and
That the committee have power to engage the services of such counsel, staff and technical advisers and
to incur such other special expenses as may be necessary for the purpose of organizing and holding the
said Conference.
He said: Honourable senators, this is the first time that I
am addressing this chamber in the course of this session,
and although I would not like to repeat what has been said
before, and much more eloquently by others, I certainly
want to express to you, Madam Speaker, the hope that you
will be with us in this Chair for long years to come.

Hon. Mr. Asselin: You might be on this side!
[Translation]
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: Honourable senators, my motion
today has already been discussed in substance and approved in this house on July 19, 1973. I have therefore
no intention of justifying it in detail again. However I
should like to point out that I am more convinced than
ever of the need for establishing a Commission on the

DEBATES
Future, the feasibility of which would be determined by
the special conference suggested in this motion.
If we do not take care, through reflection and collective
planning, our society and the whole of humanity will face
ever more numerous and more serious crises while the
exponential era of quantitative growth will go on during
the next few decades. The Special Committee of the
Senate on Science Policy warned us about this in the first
chapter of its second volume published in January 1972,
before the collective awareness brought about by the
energy and food crises and the chronic state of inflation.
I should like to renew this warning today by referring
briefly and singly to the population explosion. In 1970, the
world population was estimated at about 3.6 billion people.
United Nations experts recently stated that this population would reach the 6.8 billion mark by the year 2000. The
implications of such a population explosion are almost
beyond understanding. Humanity has never had to meet
such a challenge. It is not ready to do so at the present
time, and yet if it does not face up to it with some measure
of success, it will inevitably meet with disaster. Above all,
let us not imagine that we have 25 years to get ready for it.
The population explosion is a continuous phenomenon,
which is unfolding under our very eyes. In ten years, we
will have to support one billon more inhabitants on our
planet.
If humanity is to meet this challenge, and others that
are related to this basic phenomenon, Canada will, to my
mind, have to play a great role, and our persistent concern
with daily problems, and all the sterile quarrels it entails,
is not preparing us very well to play it. Canadians should,
most urgently, get into the habit of thinking collectively
and rationally on the future, and use this thinking to
guide their present action. That would be, precisely, the
main task the Commission on the Future would be
requested to assume.
a (1430)

[English]
I do not intend today to justify the substance of this
motion, which was already approved by this chamber last
July. I should like, however, to present a progress report
on our activities.
From July 1973 to mid-September we were engaged
exclusively, with our small staff, in the preparation of the
third volume of our report on science policy. As honourable senators already know, this volume attracted a good
deal of attention; since its publication we have had to
devote a substantial portion of our time to what I describe
as follow-up activities. Private organizations have sent us
briefs and have requested interviews to discuss their reaction to our recommendations. This dialogue is still going
on, and SCITEC, the Canadian Association of Scientists,
Engineers and Technologists, will hold a two-day meeting
in Ottawa at the beginning of May to discuss Volume 3. A
number of foreign experts, including representatives of
foreign governments, have come to Ottawa to consult with
us, or have invited individual members of the committee
to visit them and to discuss science policy issues. For
instance, Senator Grosart was invited last December to
attend as a special guest a science policy seminar held by
the Caribbean countries in Barbados. Various departments
and agencies of the Canadian government have asked to

SENATE DEBATES

meet with us for the purpose of getting more background
information on our specific recommendations. As a result
of this exchange of views, the government has already
implemented in substance many of our proposals. The
Speech from the Throne indicates that others, among the
most important contained in our report, will soon be acted
upon. We sincerely hope that this process will continue
and that by 1975 the substance of our whole report will
have become government policy. Honourable senators will
realize, I am sure, that all these follow-up activities are
important, and that we cannot refuse to be consulted when
people seek our advice. However, it must be recognized
that such activities require a good deal of time and
patience.
When our special committee prepared its report, it fully
realized that futures research and futures information are
complementary. Futures information naturally flows from
futures research, and is designed to bring an improved
knowledge of the future into the decision-making process
of individual organizations, public or private. We proposed, therefore, the establishment of a Commission on
the Future to act as a network of information and to assist
Canadian decision-makers, but we also recommended the
creation of a multidisciplinary centre of futures studies
within the Economic Council.
The council bas accepted this responsibility, but came to
the conclusion that it would be wise to invite to Ottawa a
small group of leading futurists to help launch this new
research operation. We intended as a committee to do
precisely the same thing anci to organize a dialogue
between Canadian decision-makers and futures researchers on the feasibility of the commission.
Since the two operations are complementary and will
involve more or less the same experts, our steering committee and I have discussed on several occasions with the
Chairman of the Economic Council, Dr. André Raynauld,
and his associates, the possibility of launching the two
operations together, and of a co-sponsorship of the proposed conference. I am glad to announce that the council
accepted this co-sponsorship in January. For the steering
committee, this proposal seems to have a great deal of
ment, but it will belong to this chamber and eventually, I
presume, the full committee, of course, to reach a decision
on this matter. Personally, I believe that it would be a
better guarantee of success for the conference if the
Senate committee were associated with the Economic
Council as its co-sponsors.
Incidentally, I would like to point out that the Chairman of the Economic Council has already stated publicly
that he agreed with at least one function that could be
performed by the commission proposed by our committee.
He said:
The Commission on the Future recommended in the
Lamontagne Report, is, in my opinion, one of the best
instruments for the co-ordination of efforts concerning the development and diffusion of technological
forecasting methods in both the private and public
sectors.
This agreement, in my view, augurs well for a fruitful
collaboration, and it shows that our committee was neither
too naive nor too impractical when it proposed the estab[Hon. Mr. LamontagnedI

lishment of the commission and the organization
conference for that purpose.

(1440)

During the preliminary steps that we. took for the preparation of the conference, we were surprised by the underdeveloped state of futures studies in Canada, and the
almost total lack of information in our country on what
goes on in this area of research in the world. In our view,
this regrettable situation in itself, justifies the setting up
of the commission envisaged by our committee, but it
means also that we have to start from scratch.
At our request the Economie Council undertook a
survey of major Canadian private and public organizations to see if they were interested and involved in futures
studies. In the private sector, 140 major companies were
contacted. Of the 93 firms which agreed to participate in
the survey, 58 per cent indicated that they had no knowledge and no activity in the area of long-term futures
studies, 24 per cent claimed they had some knowledge but
no practice, and only 18 per cent, or 17 firms, indicated
both knowledge and practice of such research.
In the public sector, 34 federal agencies and seven provincial and municipal organizations were included in the
survey because they seemed the most likely to be doing
research in this area. Fifteen per cent of those organizations reported no knowledge and no practice, 39 per cent
indicated some knowledge but no practice, and 46 per cent,
or 19 organizations, claimed both knowledge and practice.
The fact that only 36 Canadian public and private
organizations claimed knowledge and practice of futures
studies might reveal that there is little interest in Canada
in this kind of research. However, the authors of the
report produced by the Economic Council arrived at a
quite different conclusion. They state:
Certainly the great majority of persons contacted
during the survey indicated strong interest in
attempting to probe the future beyond the usual fiveyear medium term. It was generally felt that efforts
devoted to such futures forecasting would be useful
and would justify the application of increased efforts
in this direction. However, it was agreed that
improvements in methodologies and wider diffusion
of information on futures forecasting should be
encouraged.
Thus, while the survey conducted by the Economic
Council revealed that the Canadian research effort devoted to futures studies was weak, it also detected a clearly
perceived need among major private and public organizations for more and better Canadian studies in this area,
and for a wider diffusion of information in our country on
such studies being carried out in the world. What seems to
be needed is a catalyst, an information clearing house.
This is precisely one of the major roles envisaged by our
committee for the proposed Commission on the Future.
On the basis of that conclusion, the obvious next step
was to establish contacts with those federal agencies
which had been included in the survey conducted by the
Economic Council. Our Director of Research, Mr. Philip
Pocock, bas had detailed discussions with the staff
involved in futures studies in the Ministry of State for
Science and Technology, the Department of the Environ-

March 27, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

ment, the Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce,
the Ministry of State for Urban Affairs, the Department of
Supply and Services, the Canada Post Office, the Economic Council and the Public Service Commission.
At a recent meeting of the Ad Hoc Interdepartmental
Committee on Technological Forecasting, Mr. Pocock presented our preliminary views on the proposed Commission
on the Future and the conference, while representatives of
each department and agency attending the meeting gave a
brief account of futures studies being conducted within
their respective organizations. Those contacts indicated
the following situation:
1. Government departments and agencies are giving
increasing attention to futures studies. Specifically there
is a growing interest in using the Delphi method for
finding consensus views regarding the probability of
future events and trends.
2. There is not a readily available and comprehensive
list of Canadian organizations and individuals conducting
futures studies.
3. There is not a readily available Canadian survey of
the type of futures studies being conducted abroad and of
the foreign organizations actively involved in this area.
Obviously, some of these gaps have to be filled before
the conference, if it is to be a success and achieve its
important objective. For instance, it is essential for the
conference to identify Canadians who have been doing
serious work in this field.
Various steps have been taken to fill this gap:
1. An analysis has been made of the three most recent
international conferences on the future, held in Oslo,
Kyoto and Bucharest. The Canadian participants were
identified as well as those of other countries.
2. We learned that Dr. R. J. Doyle, Chairman of the
Department of Biology at one of Canada's most dynamic
universities, the University of Windsor, was making a
survey of Canadian publications on futures studies. He
will be forwarding to us the paper which he has been
preparing on this topic.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Who called this conference? What is
the name of the body that called that conference? You
referred to a conference in Oslo.
Hon. Mr. Larnontagne: The World Federation Society.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Do you mean, no one from Windsor? I
am disappointed in your answer.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: I continue:
3. The most thorough study of futures researchers in the
North American academic community is being conducted
by Professor H. Wentworth Eldredge, of Dartmouth College, on behalf of the World Institute Council, which is an
international organization monitoring futures studies.
Professor Eldredge has agreed to have his staff go through
his card catalogue and supply us with the list of Canadian
academics who reported to him their activities in this area.
4. An approach has been made to Dr. Peter Meyboom,
Director General of Sciences Procurement in the Department of Supply and Services, suggesting that the department invite Canadians with expertise in the field of
futures studies to identify themselves. This suggestion,
which has been accepted, will improve the application of

the contracting-out policy in this area, but it will also
assist the work of our committee.
As honourable senators can see, we will soon have a
good picture of the current state of Canadian studies and
expertise on the future. The approach that we followed
has not been costly, since most of the work has been done
for us by others on a free basis, but it has been roundabout and time-consuming. It would have been more
rapid, but much more expensive, to undertake an overall
survey of our own.
It is also essential for the conference to have a data base
on futures studies being conducted throughout the world
and on the type of organization involved. A Rome-based
institution called IRADES publishes a handbook on this
topic. Mr. Pocock bas analyzed this survey and prepared
on that basis a memorandum entitled "A Brief Review of
the Growing World-Wide Interest in Futures Studies,"
giving a short description of the most typical organizations conducting futures studies, and of projects and publications having special relevance to the role foreseen for
the proposed commission.
*

(1450)

Other international handbooks, such as Exploratory
Planning Briefs have been published or are under preparation, including the book which will soon be published by
the Futures Group in Connecticut, and which has been
commissioned by the National Science Foundation in the
United States. These surveys of international activity
indicate the widespread and rapidly growing interest in
futures studies in governments, in the academic sector and
in private organizations. It is reported, for instance, that
about 800 organizations in the world carry out futures
research, either on a part-time or a full-time basis.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Eight hundred organizations in the
private sector?
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: No, overall. The World Futures
Society, comprised of various experts on the future, has
grown from 200 members at the time it was founded in
1966 to approximately 13,000 members today.
In fact, the proposed Commission on the Future could
play a most useful role in Canada, if it did nothing other
than monitor the world's output of futures studies and
supply a synthesis, in a useful form, to Canadian
decision-makers.
Japan has been devoting increasing attention to futures
studies. The following major research projects are presently being carried out in that country: Global Constraints
and New Vision for Development; Japan in the Changing
World; Ecological Studies for MITI; Value System and
Social Dynamics; and Policy Studies on World Problematique. Mr. Pocock has established contact with
Professor Yujiro Hayashi, who is currently the President
of the Japan Institute for Future Technology and professor of social technology at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. Professor Hayashi, who was previously the president of the Japan Future Association, has been most
helpful to us in supplying information and papers. Contacts have also been established with other individuals
and organizations, mainly in the United States.
As a result of the work done by our staff, it would be
relatively easy and most useful to produce the first

SENATE DEBATES

Canadian handbook on international activity in the field
of futures studies, before the proposed conference. We are
now seeking a government agency which would be able
and willing to undertake this project for us. That agency, I
hope, will be the Economic Council.
In consultation with a few experienced public servants,
consideration has been given to the structure of the conference for the purpose of identifying the various means
which would allow Canadian decision-makers and leading
futurists to most effectively determine the feasibility of
the commission. Some exploration has been made of new
conference techniques that might be used. Also, a draft list
of leading futurists who might be considered as useful
participants has been prepared.
On the basis of this consideration, Mr. Pocock bas written a memorandum entitled, "A Canadian Commission on
the Future," which is helping me in preparing a position
paper containing the following sections: the breakdown of
the traditional decision-making process; the need for a
future-oriented consensus; the state of futures studies in
the world and in Canada: the need for a Canadian network
of futures studies; futures studies and management: the
need for a national information network on the future;
organizing a future-oriented consensus: the foundation of
a new organizational culture and of anticipatory democracy; the structure and activities of a Commission on the
Future, called Futures Canada; and, finally, the Conference on the Future, its format, participants and program.
I expect to be able to submit the first draft of this
position paper to the committee early in April. When it is
in its final form, I hope that it will constitute a useful
handbook for the conference, and that it will be made
available to the participants of that conference well in
advance so that we can go to the conference with a
eommon background and common motivation. We will
then have reached the final stage in the preparation of the
meeting.
In conclusion, I should like to say that, in spite of our
involvement with follow-up activities related to our report
on science policy, a great deal of preparatory work for the
conference bas been accomplished with a small but highly
dedicated staff. However, a lot more remains to be done. In
consultation with the Economic Council, the conference
bas been tentatively scheduled for next fall. Again the
committee will have to pass judgment on this matter. As
far as I am concerned, while I certainly do not envisage
with great enthusiasm another summer of heavy work, I
am not particularly worried by unavoidable delays. I am
more interested in making sure that the conference will be
a great success than in determining a date now which
might prove premature and mean failure later. I have seen
too many meetings fail because of a lack of adequate
preparation to accept, at this stage of our work, becoming
the prisoner of a rigid time schedule.
The Senate can be proud to have been the prime mover
in launching the process which will lead to the formulation and implementation of a coherent Canadian science
policy, an area which the government itself bas since
recognized as vitally affecting "the well-being of Canadians and the future of Canadian society as a whole."
We now have the unique opportunity to launch good
futures studies in Canada and an effective national net[Hon. Mr. Lamontagne.]

work of information on the future. Dante, the famous
Italian poet, almost seven centuries ago, wrote:
You may understand, therefore,
That all our knowledge shall be a dead thing,
From that moment on,
When the door of the future is shut.
The responsibility that we will accept in approving this
motion will be to open the door to Canada's future, and to
keep it open. Let us face this new challenge as wisely, but
also with as much imagination, as we have assumed other
major responsibilities in the past.

[Translation]
Hon. Mr. Deschatelets: Would the honourable Senator
Lamontagne be kind enough to answer this question?
Will the conference, the organization of which is the
main objective of your special committee, be restricted to
Canadian participation alone or will it be opened to all
scientists who could be interested?
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: In the first place, the committee
must take a decision on that point. Moreover, since, as
stated in the motion, we will be considering the feasibility
of such a Commission on the Future, I think that the
number of participants to the meeting or conference
should be relatively restricted. We would like to have an
appreciable number, let us say from 100 to 125 Canadians
entrusted with decision-making in their respective fields.
I would like those 125 decision-makers to represent the
various sectors of Canadian society, namely, industry,
labour, cities, governments as well as churches and other
voluntary organizations.
On the other hand, I would like that this dialogue be
held between Canadians and experts from the entire
world, including Canadians who have developed the best
expertise possible in the fields related to studies on the
future.
Hon. Mr. Asselin: I should like to ask Senator Lamontagne another question. Is private industry ready to support financially the organization of such a conference or
has it indicated that it would be prepared to provide
financial assistance?
Hon. Mr. Larnontagne: I have not approached private
industry for financing the conference. Personally, I think
it would be somewhat shameful for the Senate and the
Economic Council if we were to beg for support to finance
a venture which, in my opinion, would not be that
expensive.
I have therefore not taken any steps to obtain such
support. I know that some Canadian companies, like Bell
Canada and others would be very interested in taking part
by displaying exhibits on future developments in their
respective fields. I think that this is perfectly acceptable.
But if we were to start accepting financial contributions
from insurance companies, for instance, as was offered to
me, we would risk becoming or seeming to be a lobby,
which we would certainly not want.
However, I have received assurances that when the
commission is established, if this is collectively thought to
be feasible, many Canadian industries will be interested
in becoming members and contributing to its success.

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Leopold Langlois: Honourable senators, I would
like to say a few words about this motion, particularly
after the speech of Senator Asselin about the possible cost
of this Commission on the Future. I would remind all
honourable senators who do not belong to our Internal
Economy, Budgets and Administration Committee that
last fall Senator Lamontagne submitted for approval a
budget of $109,475 covering the cost of this special conference to study the feasibility of a conference on the future.
Besides approval by our committee there was one condition of the effect that on or before November 30, 1973, the
Special Committee of the Senate on Science Policy was to
tell us whether $109,475 were adequate for the preliminary
work of this conference and should it be considered to
exceed this amount the committee would completely
review the financing approval of such a project.
I understand that in November 1973, we had no progress
report from the committee chairman but that during a
subsequent meeting, in December 1973, Senator Lamontagne outlined the progress made to date, insisting on the
intention of the Economic Council of Canada to participate in the preparation of such a conference. I am glad to
notice that this afternoon Senator Lamontagne reconfirmed this intention of the Economic Council to participate with the Special Committee of the Senate on Science
Policy in this conference.
However, this will not affect the decision already taken
by the Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration
Committee which was to request Senator Lamontagne and
his committee to appear again before the committee to
seek reconfirmation of the budget we had decided to
approve last year and under this condition-and I should
not anticipate the decision of the Internal Economy Committee-I think the project might be relaunched with
success.
During my intervention in the debate on the Address in
reply to the Speech from the Throne I had the opportunity
to review briefly the main aspects of the enormous work
accomplished to date by the Special Committee of the
Senate on Science Policy, and particularly to point out the
decisions which resulted directly from this tremendous
task undertaken by Senator Lamontagne and his colleagues of the Special Committee on Science Policy. I
spoke mostly of the new structures set up, in the other
place, by the department of the Honourable Mrs. Sauvé to
implement some of the major recommendations of Senator
Lamontagne's committee, especially the revision of the
financial aid system to scientific research at university
and other levels for a better co-ordination of scientific
research in Canada. As was mentioned with such authority by Senator Lamontagne a moment ago, it is absolutely
essential for the future of this country-not to mention
the future of the whole humanity-that present generations consider the development of technology and establish a detailed scientific policy to meet the challenges of
the future.
He also emphasized the challenge the human race will
have to meet because of the astounding growth of the
Earth population and the necessity to feed that many more
people. It is indeed quite a challenge. As he suggested, we
must take up this challenge immediately and look at the
future in a way quite different from the one we looked last

year at the energy crisis, when we were taken by surprise,
not having even thought such an occurrence possible.
I hope that we will cease moving ahead blindfolded and
that the work our committee is carrying out will bear
fruit. This project started in a magnificent way. I hope
that, in future, our work will benefit our country and the
whole of mankind.

[English]
Hon. Ernest C. Manning: Honourable senators, I would
like to join with others in commending Senator Lamontagne for the motion he has put on the Order Paper, and
discussed so clearly this afternoon.
We are all aware that in the increasingly complex society of our times, events in so many cases are running
ahead of the decision-makers. In both the private and the
public sectors, a great amount of time is now taken up by
decision-makers in trying to find solutions to problems
that have already developed, rather than anticipating
these developments and attempting to chart a course
ahead of time in the hope of resolving serious situations
before they reach crisis proportions.
a (1510)

I am impressed by the procedure that is proposed. While
it is obvious that a Commission on the Future may have
tremendous potential-I personally think it has-it would
be most unwise to commit ourselves to something of this
magnitude without adequate examination and preparation
in advance.
If I understand what is proposed, there are really two
major preliminary steps, in addition to the work that
already has been done by the Senate Committee on
Science Policy.
The preparation of the position paper to which Senator
Lamontagne referred is an important step. I hope that
when that paper is available we shall all have an opportunity to examine it in detail. It should produce valuable
information and answers to many of the questions which
need to be resolved in deciding whether a Commission on
the Future would be a practical and worthwhile permanent institution.
Following the position paper, the proposal is that a
conference be held which will afford an opportunity to
assess thoroughly the data from the position paper and
any additional pertinent information and, in the light of
that assessment, reach a decision as to the practical value
of a Commission on the Future.
I commend Senator Lamontagne for that procedure
because as far as it is possible to do so it protects us from
making mistakes and going ahead without fully appreciating all the implications and problems that may be
involved. If, after going through the position paper and
the conference, a judgment is made that a Commission on
the Future is feasible and desirable, we all at that stage
will know that it is made in the light of very complete
information and we can have confidence in the commission's future success.
I am pleased to add this word of commendation of what
is proposed by Senator Lamontagne.
Hon. Donald Cameron: Honourable senators, I expected
to follow Senator Grosart, as I thought that he was going

SENATE DEBATES

March 27, 1974

to speak next, but he signalled that the ball is in my park
for a moment or two.
I am rising to support the motion of Senator Lamontagne with a great deal of enthusiasm. As he says, the
repercussions from Volume 3 of the Report of the Senate
Committee on Science Policy are continuing to come in
almost every day. In my 18 years in the Senate I have
never before experienced the kind of response from business organizations that has been generated by that report.
Institutions like the Association of Professional Engineers
of Canada, and that of Ontario, the geophysical groups
from the West, and some other organizations, have put
committees of their organizations to work in analyzing the
report. They have not endorsed all of the recommendations, by any means, and this is one of the strengths of a
report of this kind. They have made counter proposals in
some cases, and those counter proposals are an enriching
response, so that the dialogue that has arisen has been a
very profitable one for Canada and all concerned.
Honourable senators, we have reached the stage where
we are considering the next and logical outflow of that
committee, that is, the setting up, or the contemplation of
the establishment, of a Commission on the Future.
I like to think of the work of the Senate as being divided
into two general types. For simplicity, we might call one
the Senate's role in dealing with housekeeping problemsthe question of day to day finance, and dealing with
legislation in the various fields. That is work which must
be done, and the Senate committees deal with it very
effectively. In its second type of work the Senate has a
special responsibility in what I might call global activities.
In other words, if we accept the thesis that we are part of
one world, a shrinking world, then it follows that we
cannot escape the impact of what is happening in other
countries. And it is important that we should feel that
impact, in order that we may be able to predicate our
thinking on the basis of what is being done in other
countries.

gloom-and-doom sayers, and tried to write it off. However
there has been quite a debate, certainly in Academe, as to
whether these people had gone too far; whether they were
away off base or not.
As far as the ordinary man on the street is concerned he
had never read "The Limits to Growth." He was not
concerned. He wanted to go his own quiet way undisturbed with his head buried in the sand as far as the
impact of these global problems was concerned. This went
along until last fall, when all of a sudden out of the blue
sky came the curtailment of the oil supplies from the
Middle East. This had a tremendous impact on the ordinary man on the street because when he went to fill his
gas tank he was met with the legend "Sorry, no gas" at one
gas station after another. I was in California and Oregon
in late December and January and saw that happen. This
brought it home to the ordinary citizen with a terrifie
impact, and he became aware that there is something
about this "limitation of our resources." The same thing is
going to happen in the next few years with respect to
copper and various other metals. So it is time that people
became concerned with the limitation of our rich

Honourable senators, I have used a quotation from the
famous architect Blackburn-who designed the greenbelt
around Washington, D.C.-so much that many of my colleagues say that it should be my monogram. But it is a
quotation that should apply to some phases of the Senate's
activities. Blackburn said:
Make no small plans, they hold no magic to stir men's
blood.
I like to think of some of the activities of the Senate as
being conceived in that concept. We are not thinking in
terms of small plans that hold no magie to stir men's
blood. Se, in approaching this proposal, I should like to
think it is being conceived in the terms of "no small
plans." I think of it as being conceived in terms of a
concept that would stir men's blood, and excite them.
There is a place in our Canadian system for such a concept, and I hope we develop it.
About two years ago-in 1972, I think-there was a
report entitled "The Limits to Growth," by Mr. Denis L.
Meadows and three other members of an M.I.T. project
team. To me, it was the first time that a group of scientists
dealt with this problem of finite resources in a semipublic
manner. Some people said that this was just a group of

preparation.

[Hon. Mr. Camerond

resources.

Honourable senators, the timing of this work is right. I
would particularly emphasize the importance of Senator
Lamontagne's suggestion that we take as much time as is
necessary to do an adequate job of preparation. The need
for preparation on an important conference of this kind
was emphasized by the recent Vienna conference which
was attended by the Prime Minister. If I read the newspapers correctly, he was rather disappointed with the result
of that conference. There were many talented scientists
and public figures participating in it but it was a partial
failure, because the time was net taken to do adequate
preparation and organization.
We cannot afford to have such a result in this case. The
fact that a conference like the Vienna conference could
leave a less than satisfactory feeling of accomplishment
arose strictly out of the fact that there was inadequate

e

(1520)

For these reasons I hope we will accept these procedures
which, to me, comprise an exciting challenge which I
know the Senate can meet, and meet most effectively.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators, I need
hardly say I support Senator Lamontagne's motion. May I
also say I welcome the opportunity to add mine to the
tributes that have been paid to him for the indefatigable
way and the courage with which he has carried through
the work of the Senate committee so far.
I am glad that Senator Cameron spoke, because I know
that as vice-chairman he has throughout been the strong
right arm of Senator Lamontagne.
Many of us who have been active in the committee will
remember times when the atmosphere was far less cordial,
both outside the Senate and to some extent in the Senate
than it seems to be on this happy afternoon. I welcome the
complete support, for example, of Senator Langlois, who
had his doubts at one time-and quite properly so. I
welcome also the support of Senator Manning and others,
because the task that Senator Lamontagne launched us on

March 27, 1974
March 27, 1974

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

was something novel in Canada-indeed almost novel in
the world-and the end result, in which the Senate can
take some pride, is the verdict of Dr. Alexander King of
the OECD, which has been accepted around the world,
that this is the most complete survey of national science
policy ever made anywhere at any time.
Many of us know that for that reason our reports and
proceedings are used almost as a text here and there
around the world. You find them referred to when people
wish to compare what they are trying to do in national
science policy with the conclusions we reached in examining our own.
It is very much to the credit of the Senate that it
permitted Senator Lamontagne's committee to carry on its
bridge activities between the end of its science policy
investigation and the beginning of the investigation into
the field of futures, because, as Senator Cameron pointed
out, the number of briefs that are still coming in,
addressed to the government and to others about the
recommendations made by the committee, is amazing.
Another aspect of the work of the committee is the
impact which its staff-Mr. Pocock, Mr. Ostiguy, and two
young ladies-have had at all levels upon those who are
concerned with science policy in Canada. Working together with Senator Lamontagne they have been in constant contact with the government, and I think the Speech
from the Throne is the reason why the atmosphere in
respect to the work of the committee today is as generally
harmonious as it is. There is clear evidence that so many
of the recommendations of the committee, which were
opposed strongly by some, are now officially government
policies. It is somewhat difficult to go through our major
recommendations and find one which has not in one way
or another now been accepted by the government, if not
immediately implemented.
Perhaps because Senator Lamontagne referred to my
attendance at a conference in Barbados, I might take just
a minute to report to the Senate on that conference. It will
be more convenient than giving the usual notice of my
intention to call the attention of the Senate to the
conference.
The conference, which was called by the Organization of
American States, involved a number of countries in the
Caribbean proper and in Latin America. Our committee
was invited to send a representative to attend. It is significant that we were the only outside organization invited by
the Organization of American States to be represented
there, and I found myself, as the representative of the
committee, the only non-Caribbean or non-Latin American there.
I recall that in the early days of the work of our committee, when we had reached certain conclusions, we decided
to go to Europe and "bounce off"-that was the phrase we
used-our conclusions on experts in different countries.
When I was in Barbados I found myself in the opposite
position, because those very bright people who were
there-about 30 science advisers to various governments,
20 of whom were Ph.Ds (and working Ph.Ds)-were
"bouncing off" their science policies on the recommendations that we had made. They were well aware of them,
and of the work we had done. So I found myself continually saying, "Well, we saw it this way."

The conference lasted five days. During the first three
days we heard a complete report from each of the different
countries on the state of the art and the health of their
own science policies. The countries represented were
Haiti, Santo Domingo, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, Barbados, Brazil, Venezuela, Peru and Colombia.
Much of the discussion was based on the OECD reports
on the state of science policy in different countries,
including Canada, and our own reports. One of the final
conclusions of this five-day meeting was to set up what is
called a "Science and Technological Regional Co-operating
Committee"-very much the same kind of philosophy that
we adopted in looking at our own diverse and diffuse
science policies which we called at one time "Canada's
Science Policy by Accident".
They suggested, and I have had some correspondence
along these lines, that they are most anxious to have some
of their people come up to Canada to meet with our
ministry and our committee, and this, as a matter of
course, we will be taking up with the committee. They are,
incidentally, quite prepared to pay their own way.
Finally, perhaps I should say that there has been an
amazing breakthrough in the sugarcane technology down

there. It has been described as the greatest breakthrough
in the whole history of the sugarcane business. Strangely
enough, it is a technique developed by a Canadian firm
from Alberta called Canadian Cane Consultants, which
started to examine the possibilities of using the outer
layer of the cane for fertilizer, and finally developed a
machine which greatly improves the efficiency of the
business of extracting the sugar. The company has also
discovered that there is an inner layer which makes excellent animal fodder.
It was a proud moment for me to be taken out to see
these machines working, and to be informed of the tremendous lift that this Canadian invention is going to give
to this most important resource in these countries.
Honourable senators, again I commend the motion to
you. I need hardly say I shall be voting in favour of it.
Motion agreed to.

COMPETITION POLICY
MOTION TO AUTHORIZE BANKING, TRADE AND COMMERCE
COMMITTEE TO EXAMINE AND REPORT UPON COMPETITION
LEGISLATION-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Salter A. Hayden moved pursuant to notice:
That the Standing Senate Committee on Banking,
Trade and Commerce be authorized to examine and
report upon any bill relating to competition in Canada
or to the Combines Investigation Act, in advance of the
said bill coming before the Senate, or any matter
relating thereto; and
That the committee have power to engage the services of such counsel, staff and technical advisers as
may be necessary for the purpose of the said
examination.
He said: Honourable senators, I think I should add a few
words of explanation. The subject matter of this motion
has to do with the new competition policy for Canada, and

SENATE DEBATES
the history of that is a very brief one. During the last
session a bill was introduced in the House of Commons
dealing with the subject matter of a new competition
policy. At about that time there was issued by the Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs a book-I was
going to say "a booklet," but it is more a book because it is
of such volume-entitled "Proposals for a New Competition Policy for Canada."
There were many representations made in
with the proposals contained in the draft bill
in this book, and as contained in the bill
introduced. However, the session terminated

connection
as outlined
which was
before the

In this present session Bill C-7 has been introduced in
the other place. Whether that bill reflects and incorporates
the representations that were made to the other place in
the last session is a matter which should be considered.
However, it is interesting to note that the Minister of
Consumer and Corporate Affairs has made several
speeches. I intend to quote just a few lines from a speech
that he made in Winnipeg to the Canadian Institute of
Management on March 12 on this year, Bill C-7 having
been read the first time in the House of Commons on
March 11, to indicate why I think a study should be made
at this time, and before any bill dealing with a new
competition policy comes to us. To describe the bill, I can
use no more definite language than that of the minister
himself. He said:
Even speaking about only this piece of proposed
legislation I must be selectiveMeaning that he had to pick topics for discussion on that
occasion.
-because of its sheer extensiveness and complexity
and so I will attempt to distill what you may consider
to be some of its most important provisions.
Now, the minister used that description of the bill, "its
sheer extensiveness and complexity." I would not attempt
to rate myself higher than the minister, who had the
opportunity of sitting in on the formulation of the proposals, the preparation of the legislation, and considering
the submissions made by the public. So I would think that
if we want to be well educated we should study this bill,
even before it comes before us formally. We have had
experience before of bills coming to us, in the normal
course of events, towards the beginning of the summer
recess, when we have the old difficulty of pressure of time,
Therefore, I think in this case, before that pressure can
develop, we should learn as much as we can about the
"sheer extensiveness" of this bill and its "complexity". As

March 27, 1974

a matter of fact, I think that that is what the minister
would like us to do, because when he was closing his
speech in Winnipeg on March 12 he said:
I would be happy to try te provide further information or clarification and also to receive your views on
any or all of these proposals for stage 1 of the government's new competition policy.
I would take that statement as being an invitation
which includes the members of the Senate, and a committee of the Senate, to seek as much clarification and education as possible. This is a method by which we can examine the legislation in the light of all the material that is
available, come to our conclusions, and make our submissions to this chamber, so that by the time the bill reaches
us we shall be in a position to give informed consideration
to it.

On motion of Senator Grosart, for Senator Flynn, debate
adjourned.
RIGHT HONOURABLE ARTHUR MEIGHEN
PORTRAIT-QUESTION ANSWERED

Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, Senator Forsey
asked me a question regarding the parliamentary portrait
of a former Prime Minister of Canada, who was at one
time a Leader of the Government in this house, as well as
Leader of the Opposition. I refer, of course, to the Right
Honourable Arthur Meighen, for whom Senator Forsey
has a special affection, and for whom I am sure we all
have great respect.
Senator Forsey asked if I could give any information
about the prolonged absence from the corridor outside the
other place of the portrait of the former leader of this
house, the Right Honourable Arthur Meighen.
I made some inquiries about the portrait. I noticed
today, for the first time, that it is not in its usual place
right opposite the elevator at the entrance to the House of
Commons. The explanation given is that both the portrait
and the frame were damaged, and it has taken some time
to find an expert craftsman te repair the portrait. This is a
highly specialized field and all competent people have a
backlog of work. I do not know who damaged it, or under
what circumstances. I am sure that Senator Forsey would
not have had anything to do with that, nor, indeed, would
anyone from either house. However, I hope that the
repairs will be carried out quickly so that the portrait of
this distinguished Canadian can resume its place on the
walls of the House of Commons.

NATIONAL FINANCE
INFORMATION CANADA-AUTHORITY TO PUBLISH AND
DISTRIBUTE REPORT 0F COMMITTEE WHEN AVAILABLE
Hon. Douglas D. Everett, Chairman of the Standing
Senate Committee on National Finance, with leave of the
Senate and notwithstanding rule 45(1) (i), moved:

That the Standing Senate Committee on National
Finance which was authorized on Tuesday, lYth
March 1974, to continue its examination of Information Canada and table its report thereon in the present
session, be authorized to publish and distribute its
report as soon as it becomes available, even though the
Senate may not then be sitting.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it your pleasure, honourable
senators, to adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, I understand that
this is a routine motion and that is why I agree to give
leave, but why is Senator Everett worried about having to
publish the report while the Senate is not sitting?

Hon. Mr. Everett: Because it is possible the report might
become available while the Senate is in Easter recess. I
would give the Senate the saine undertaking that I did
before: if it is merely a temporary recess from week to
week we will publish the report when the Senate is sitting. This motion is in order to be able to publish the
report if the Senate is in recess for more than a week.
Hon. Mr. Flynn. If we are going to adjourn for the same
period of time as the House of Commons adjourns, I do not
think the report should be published in the absence of the
Senate.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, Senator Everett
wiII recaîl that when this matter was discussed last spring
I suggested that an effort be made to wait until the Senate
was in session. That would be far better than having the
report printed when we could flot possibly have it tabled
here and give it the attention that I think it warrants. In
the meantime, the report has flot come out. I hope we will
have a recess, but that has flot been decided. It cannot be
for much more than a week, so I think the suggestion of
the Leader of the Opposition is sound. The recess may be
12 days, or even two weeks. I would hope Senator Everett
would find it desirable to accede to the suggestion of the
Leader of the Opposition. When the Senate is sitting this
is the place where a parliamentary report should be introduced, unless there are very exceptional circumstances, as
there were last spring.

the problem? Would the honourable chairman of the comnmittee agree to consuit the Leader of the Government and

pleased to do so, if that satisf ies the Leader of the Government and the Leader of the Opposition. Indeed, it is at the
option of the Senate whether or flot this motion goes
through, because I have asked for leave.

then were very much different from those that could

simply to ensure that if those conditions do arise we

for such adjournment, the Honourable the Speaker be
authorized to notify honourable senators at their

would not consuit only one source, when deciding.

forward, but I understand that Honourable Senator Cameron could flot be here today.
Hon. Mr. Martin: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: In any event, it is a private bill.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: That is right. It is a private bill,
anyway.

Hon. Mr. Martin: Stand.

Hon. Mr. Martin: It is Senator Cameron's bill.

Hon. Mr. Phillips: Why?

Sorne Hon. Senators: Stand.

Hon. Mr. Martin: Senator Cameron is not here.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: The sponsor is not here.
Order stands.

APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 1, 1974
SECOND READING
Hon. Leopoîd Langlois moved second reading of Bill
C-15, for granting to Her Majesty certain sums of money
[Hon. Mr. Evereitt

The Hon. the Speaker: The first order bas already been
stood. We are now dealing with the second order, and it
has been moved by Senator Langlois, seconded by Senator
Martin, that this bill be now read a second trne. Is it your
pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, as you will
recali, royal assent has already been given to three supply
covering estimates for the current fiscal year. The
bis
first supply bill provided interim supply for the months of
April, May and June. In the previous session this bill was

March 28, 1974
March 28, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES

known as Appropriation Act No. 3 and provided supplies
for the total of $2,722,427,083.92.
The second such bill, agreed to on June 28, 1973, provided full supply for the balance of the main estimates for
1973-74 and was known in the previous session as Appropriation Act No. 4, covering supply for the total amount of
$7,383,985,885.08.
Finally, the third bill, agreed to on December 21, 1973,
provided full supply for the whole of the supplementary
estimates (A), 1973-74, and was known in the previous
session as Appropriation Act No. 5, and was for a total of
$477,053,928.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Would the honourable senator permit a
question at this stage? He has been referring to the title of
the bill and to the number of the bill. I have already
mentioned that it is a source of confusion that the bills are
numbered by the calendar year instead of by the fiscal
year. This is a good example of such confusion. Here you
have bill No. 1 for 1974, whereas it is the last bill for the
fiscal year ending the 31st March 1974.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: They number the bills by the session
in the course of which they have been presented, and even
if I agree that this might create confusion I cannot change
the situation.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: But you could suggest that it be
changed.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I will make my suggestion later on,
and I hope my honourable friend will do so himself. He
has done so in the past.
To continue, the bill introduced today provides for full
supply of supplementary estimates (B), 1973-74, which
total $1,120 million. These estimates consist of approximately $396 million in statutory items and $724 million in
voted items, the latter figure including $35 million in
loans. The total estimates tabled today for 1973-74 consist
of budgetary expenditures of $20,473,700,000, and nonbudgetary expenditures of $937.6 million, giving a grand
total of $21,411,300,000. Supplementary estimates (B) were
referred to the Standing Senate Committee on National
Finance on March 19, 1974, and these estimates were discussed in committee on March 27, with the President of
the Treasury Board and his officials. As was pointed out
yesterday by the Chairman of the National Finance Committee in presenting his interim report, this study of the
estimates now before honourable senators will be carried
on starting next week. There are two additional sittings of
the committee scheduled for next week, and they will be
carried on as long as the members of this committee are
satisfied that they have given the fullest consideration to
these estimates.
* (1420)

The form of the present supply bill is the same as that of
supply bills in previous years. No additional borrowing
authority is requested, since the first supply bill for the
current fiscal year provided sufficient borrowing authority in the amount of $3 billion. These supplementary
estimates are made up almost entirely of a few large
transfer payments, some directed to the relief of inflationary pressures on certain groups, others to the provinces,
and still others, in the form of subsidies, to the agriculture
and transportation industries.

27601-13

I will briefly mention now the latter ones, which made
up almost 90 per cent of the total. Firstly, payments to the
old age security fund, to make up deficiencies in the fund
which have arisen out of the increase in the basic pension
and the introduction of the quarterly indexing, in the
amount of $235 million; secondly, higher family allowance
payments in the amount of $190 million; thirdly, subsidies
on the price of petroleum products to Canadian consumers
in the amount of $240 million, as a result of the decision
taken at the first minister's conference of January, 1974.
As it was explained yesterday, this amount of $240 million
covers a period from the first of January, 1974, to the
thirty-first day of the present month.
Has the honourable senator a question?
Hon. Mr. Phillips: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I am sorry. I could not stop in the
middle of giving these figures.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: With the great respect that I have for
the honourable senator, he is reading his notesHon. Mr. Martin: Order.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: -much too fast for my interpretation
in either of the official languagesHon. Mr. Martin: Order.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I must call
your attention to the fact that when a senator has the floor
he cannot be interrupted unless with his permission, and
only to ask him a question. If he gives permission to have
a question asked, of course it is quite all right, but if he
does not, the senator who is speaking has the floor.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: Honourable senatorsHon. Mr. Langlois: Madam Speaker, may I have the
floor, please?
The Hon. the Speaker: I shall have to ask honourable
senators to permit Senator Langlois to speak, as he is in
the midst of a speech and has the floor until he wants to
permit someone to ask him a question.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: I ask, honourable senators, that Senator Langlois yield for a question.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: For a question, yes.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: The Honourable Senator Langlois,
perhaps due to his superb intelligenceSome Hon. Senators: Question! Question!
Hon. Mr. Phillips: Who is asking for the question? I am
not quite sure. Is the Senate asking for the question? I was
confused, as I am sure any honourable senator who was
listening to his remarksHon. Senators: Question! Question!
The Hon. the Speaker: If Honourable Senator Phillips
has a question, then I do not think he should give an
introduction. He should simply ask his question.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: The Honourable Senator Langlois
referred to $1.9 million and then within the same sentence
seemed to transfer that sum to $1.9 billion. Would the
Honourable Senator Langlois show us now the courtesy of
clarifying the amount of money involved. After all, there
is a considerable amount involved. I hope I am not offend-

SENATE DEBATES
ing honourable senators opposite or the occupant of the
Chair, but I feel I am entitled to clarification on that
point.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, I am sorry if I
have not made myself clear, and I shall endeavour to
speak more slowly. I hope my honourable friend will be
able to follow what I have to say.
The fourth category covers expenditures mentioned for
the equalization payments.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: What about my question?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: It includes equalization payments to
include education property taxes as a revenue to be equalized at $146 million; revenue guarantees to the provinces,
$50 million; payments to Alberta and Saskatchewan as
provided under the Oil Export Tax Act, $76 million; payments to the railways to compensate them for the freezing
of freight rates, $41 million; and lastly, additional subsidies to producers of manufactured milk, $31 million.
These estimates, as in previous fiscal years, seek authority to finance new items through complete or partial offsets in other votes in the same program or other programs
of the ministry where funds can be made available
through the exercise of restraint or where changing circumstances permit lower expenditures. These offsets are
treated as $1 votes in order to bring them before Parliament for authorization.
Thirty-three $1 items are included in these supplementary estimates. Yesterday your committee on National
Finance was given a summary by the President of the
Treasury Board of these $1 items in detail, and each such
item was explained as to the transfer and source of funds.
* (1430)

I know that these $1 items have in the past generated a
good deal of discussion in this chamber. If honourable
senators who are not members of the Standing Senate
Committee on National Finance are interested in having
this summary, together with the explanations, I am ready
to provide them with it. I had given thought earlier to
having the summary printed in a sufficient number of
copies for distribution to each senator present today. However, I am in the hands of the Senate. Should any senator
wish to have the summary printed as an appendix to
today's proceedings, that could be done; otherwise, I will
give an example of each category of such items, and if
further information is required I will be pleased to provide
it in one way or another.
I will commence with the $1 items which authorize
amendments to previous appropriation acts, of which
there are six items. An example of such items is to be
found under External Affairs, the Canadian International
Development Agency, vote 25b, to authorize an extension
to the vote wording in order to provide parliamentary
authority to certain sections of the Technical and Educational Assistance Regulations. The explanation of this is
the following: It was agreed in 1973 to amend the regulations governing the Agency's Technical and Educational
Assistance Plan by increasing the allowances paid to foreign trainees and revising the schedule of expenses into
more specific categories. However, before these revisions
can be implemented, parliamentary authority is required
for the payment of medical expenses and expenses for
[Hon. Mr. Phillips.]

March 28, 1974

dependants. This vote wording amendment will provide
that authority when approved by Parliament.
The second category of these $1 items is that authorizing
grants, of which there are eight items. One example is
Consumer and Corporate Affairs, vote 5b, totalling $150,000. The explanation is that it is proposed to provide
additional assistance to consumer organizations such as
the Consumers Association of Canada so that they may
expand their consumer advocacy role. The source of the
funds is vote 5. Funds are available due to delays in the
commencement of the Consumer Help Office Project.
The next category of such $1 items is that authorizing
transfers from one vote to another, of which there are 15.
One example of these is under Industry, Trade and Commerce, vote lb. The amount of transfer to this vote is
$299,999. The explanation is that the additional amount is
required to cover the cost of scientific and engineering
services provided by the Department of Supply and Services to this department with respect to two major contracts not included in the original estimates. The source of
the funds is vote 25. Funds are available, due to the
provinces' inability to identify programs and make available financial resources to meet the criteria of the Travel
Industry Program.
The next category of $1 items cover those authorizing
the deletion of debts due to the Crown. There are three
such items. One is found under Public Works, vote 10b.
Authority is requested to delete certain debts and claims
totalling $136,771.31, the explanation being that it is proposed to write off the Crown's claim against the W. C.
Clarke Memorial Centre of $136,771.31.
The next category of $1 items cover those items which
authorize a guarantee for a loan. There is only one item in
this class, and it is found under Transport, National Harbours Board, vote 88b. It authorizes the Government of
Canada to guarantee a bank loan of $1,200,000 to the
Maritime Employers' Association.
The explanation given is that in order to assist the
Maritime Employers' Association in coping with its financial responsibilities in connection with the labour management agreement, it is proposed that the Government of
Canada guarantee a bank loan of $1,200,000 to the
association.
This loan is required by the association to help meet its
obligations under the Job Security Program and to meet
operating expenses.
Changing cargo patterns, including a swing from break
bulk to containers, do not insure sufficient revenue from
the special cargo surcharges introduced to finance the Job
Security Plan. In view of this, the bank now requires a
guarantee before making any more loans to the Maritime
Employers' Association.
Honourable senators, that concludes the categories and
explanation of the $1 items. As I said previously, I am in
the hands of honourable senators and will provide any
additional information which may be required. I hope I
have covered the important features of the bill. I repeat
that I will be only too pleased to supply further
information.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: May I ask a question of the sponsor
of the bill? What were the important features which the

March 28, 1974
March 28, 1974

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

honourable senator hopes he has dealt with? The honourable senator can number them one, two, three and four. In
doing so, it will allow me to respond to his remarks.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, I do not think
I am permitted, more than any other senator, to speak
twice on the same subject. I have concluded my remarks
and I am sorry that my honourable friend has not understood what I said. I gave the main points of the bill and I
am sorry that he was unable to follow them or is not
satisfied with my explanation. If there is any further
specific information that he requires, I shall be only too
pleased to reply to a specific question.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: I thank the honourable senator. May
I have the main point of his remarks-the main point
dealing with the pros and cons of the financial aspects of
this bill? Just give me the main point, please. You can give
it in anglophone or in francophone. Just give me the main
point.
*

(1440)

Hon. Mr. Flynn: That is enough!
Hon. Senators: Order!
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, I think the
main point in this bill is that we are providing supplementary supply in a total amount of $1,120,000,000. These
estimates consist of approximately $396 million in statutory items and $724 million in voted items. The last figure
includes, as I mentioned a while ago, $35 million in loans. I
think those are the main points of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: Honourable senators, it may come as
somewhat of a surprise to those who are not listed as being
"artificial seals" of the government and, indeed, it came as
somewhat of a surprise to me that the Leader of the
Opposition automatically assumed that I was somewhat of
an artificial seal, a walrus. Honourable senators, I am not,
and I would be damn well disappointed in the Senate if
that were the situation today.
I am accustomed to the fact that honourable senators
opposite are expected and, indeed, almost demand direction, Martinization. But let me put this clearly on the
record: I do not expect, nor do I want-and God help him
if he ever attempts to turn around and give me direction
again-the Honourable Senator Flynn to give me direction. I resent it.
Hon. Senators: Order, order!
Hon. Mr. Flynn: You can make a fool of yourself if you
want.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: I am not making a fool of myself. I
am a senator and I have a right to my views. Don't you
ever again attemptHon. Senators: Order, order.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Sit down.
An Hon. Senator: You are not in caucus.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, we have a
motion before the house. It does not appear to me that the
comments that have been made by Senator Phillips are
relevant to the motion.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

27601-13

The Hon. the Speaker: In the Fourth Edition of Beauchesne's Parliamentary Rules and Forms it says that the
debates are to be free, but the comments also have to be
relevant. I do not think the comments just made by Senator Phillips are relevant to the motion before this house. I
would therefore ask the honourable senator to conclude
with something that brings him within this order of
relevancy.
Hon. Mr. Phillips: Thank you for your direction, Madam
Speaker. I would honestly like to reply to you, but were I
to do so, the question of an argument between myself and
the Chair and, indeed, yourself, might come into it, and I
would not wish that.
Honourable senators, we are dealing in this bill with
what are supposed to be the final government estimates
for the fiscal year past. They are not final. I will deal with
that in a moment. I would ask honourable senators to
consider several factors, and I am presenting them percentagewise. It is easy to say 5, 10, 30 per cent and get
them mixed up. But, honourable senators, today I am
asking you to forget your petty little senatorial cliques;
forget your petty little party politics; forget your prejudices. Look at the facts. The facts are that we are told that
in this supply bill we are providing the final estimates for
the fiscal year past. I doubt that very much. Every time a
Cabinet minister sees a microphone, every time he sees a
TV camera, he starts off in a new ministerial atmosphere
shouting, "Millions, millions, who will listen to me?" He is
somewhat in the position of a broker offering so much
stock, so many cattle, and coming to the final multi-million dollar figure.
* (1450)

Let us just look at the final estimates of $214 billion for
last year. This is a shocking figure, but the public has
become accustomed to accepting such figures and saying,
"Oh well, what can we do about it?" Perhaps the best
thing the general public can do is to consider this matter
seriously. Why do we not in our educational system teach
our high school students about the expenditure of public
money?
We have recently concluded the debate on the Address
in reply to the Speech from the Throne, during which we
listened, perhaps ad nauseam at times, to various people
talking about the increased cost of living, increased taxation and so on, yet no one thought of suggesting that these
things should be put in ordinary terms that the ordinary
labouring man, the ordinary employed person, would
understand; we did not achieve that in the debate.
Let us consider certain figures in the Public Accounts.
In the three years from March 31, 1971, public expenditure
increased 60 per cent. I know you are all accustomed to
hearing percentage figures; you just listen to them and let
them pass. The increase over last year's expenditures will,
in the next year, be 30 per cent. I repeat, in the last three
years expenditures have increased 60 per cent. Compare
that with the 30 per cent increase projected for next year,
which does not include supplementary estimates.
We are faced with, not an unfortunate but a disastrous
situation whereby in three years the federal government's
expenditure has tripled. It is all very well to react by
saying, "Expenditure has tripled in three years. So what?"
Where does the revenue come from? There is only one

SENATE DEBATES

source of revenue, and that is taxation. Consider, honourable senators, that you, as members of this chamber, will
in the next three years give the final approval to supply
bills which will double the present taxation revenue. Are
you willing to do that?
* (1500)

During the recent debate on the Speech from the
Throne, we had the opportunity, or the misfortune, of
listening to various senators present their ideas and their
viewpoints concerning the cost of living index, the rate of
inflation, the housing problem-you can go on and name
them. This government bas been successful in creating so
many problems that it would take at least two hours to
enumerate them. So I am going to say just "you have
heard it all before".
It is an endless chain, a chain of rising costs, rising
wages, rising taxation. At this time of year those of us who
are a little delinquent, slow, perhaps, to file our income
tax return-to be truthful, we hate to-have come to
realize that in that chain, an unbroken chain, taxation is
the strongest link. Indeed, we think of it not as being
taxation, but as being confiscation.
Honourable senators, you may think I place the blame
on the federal government only. I do not. Much as I love to
criticize the federal government, the federal government
is not the only culprit. Indeed, it is a bit of a shock to the
average Canadian to realize that the federal government,
the provincial governments, the municipal governments,
those three levels of government, have spent an amount
equal to one-half our total income-that of the average
Canadian and the average Canadian business firm. I could
go into great detail and inform you that from the average
Canadian sitting in this chamber-and I presume this
chamber is made up of average Canadians-the federal
government bas collected one thousand dollars; it has
collected it from you, your wife, your children.
Let us proceed to the provincial level of government and
you will find almost the same figure, and this is repeated
for the third level of government.
Honourable senators, again I say, we have passed the
taxation level, we are now at the confiscation level. Perhaps I should refer more to the estimates before us. I will,
for a moment, and in doing so perhaps I will transgress
into next year's estimates.
This is a point that really annoys me; in fact, it annoys
me to the extent that I wonder what the hell has happened
to the good old principle of being a Canadian. I refer to the
vote under External Affairs dealing with CIDA, the
Canadian International Development Association. Honourable senators, we as Canadians have always enjoyed a
particular respect in the international field, yet we find
the government, through a $1 item, authorizing the
Governor in Council to make their regulations, and to
make them as they see fit. It does not matter a damn what
Parliament thinks three months from now. We have given
the Governor in Council authority to make those regulations. And the regulations cover a multitude of sins or a
multitude of reports.
The vote authorizes the Governor in Council to do
everything from burying an individual to flying his family
to join him. But, honourable senators, there is nothing in
[Hon. Mr. Phillips.]

March 28, 1974

the $1 vote that says we as Canadians will pay for the
individual's being sponsored under CIDA to attend a university or a technical school in Canada or in his native
country. Indeed, it allows CIDA to send students, sponsored by the Canadian government, to Russia, Communist
China or Algeria.
* (1510)

Honourable senators, the last damn thing I want my tax
money to go to is paying for a revolutionary Marxist
student in Africa to go to a technical school in Algeria.
Perhaps you think it is perfectly right that the student
selected for scholarship or for future training should have
the opportunity to go to the university of his choice. But,
honourable senators, at the present time we are one of the
few nations that can take a black student-and by "black"
I don't mean anything discriminatory-and put him into
any university in Rhodesia, South Africa, and all of these
countries which we condemn. We as Canadians can place
that student in a mixed university, and I want to emphasize that, and in case you do not understand what I mean, I
mean black and white.
Let us consider, then, the consequence of our becoming
the Algeria of North America. Honourable senators, I don't
give a damn what the World Council of Churches says, or
Oxfam or any other group; I do not want Canada to
become the Algeria of North America.
Let us consider for a moment the effect on a student
who has been given a grant from either a Canadian government agency or voluntary agency. What happens to
him or to her if we become the Algeria of North America?
Right now at this moment, we can sponsor any student,
black or white, in any university-Rhodesia, South
Africa-and that student is accepted, receives the same
training as the white or Caucasian race receives. But let us
get political through CIDA. What happens then? Not one
of those students will be accepted.
My concern in this regard is further deepened by the
fact that the Secretary of State for External Affairs, Mr.
Sharp, stated that we were not getting involved with
anything too political; we were dealing with the humanitarian aspect; we were being humanitarians.
Honourable senators are familiar with the severe
drought that has occurred throughout Central Africa.
Honourable senators will also recognize the fact that we
were damned miserly in giving donations to those people.
And if we are going to be humanitarian and give grants to
freedom fighters, why do we not turn to Estonia? Why do
we not turn to Hungary? Why do we not go to Tibet?
There is not a suggestion in this regulation that we would
do that.

e

(1520)

Honourable senators, let us not be suckers for the
Algerian tactical schools. Perhaps we should consider the
situation in North America and Africa, and here I deliberately attempt to restrict my remarks and, as honourable
senators know, it is difficult. There is, throughout America, a prevalent idea that the whites are in Africa to
suppress the black race. Honourable senators, stop and
consider this fact, that people of our age in Africa were
born there, and that their ancestors went to Africa for the
same reason as our ancestors came to this country-that is,
looking for land, land to be developed. Let us look at the

March 28, 1974

March 28, 1974

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

total black population in Africa today, and then let us look
at the total native population in North America. I think if
we compare those populations, honourable senators, we
will f ind that there are an awful lot more blacks in Africa
who have survived the white man's desire for land than
there are natives in North America who have survived the
white man's desire for land. When honourable senators
opposite support Mr. Sharp in his political dealings-and I
am going so far as to say "communistic dealings," and I
ask any of you to challenge me on that-I ask them to
compare the survival rate of the blacks in Africa with that
of the North American Indian. You will have a new look at
the situation.
Now, it is interesting, honourable senators, that the
Secretary of State for External Affairs stated that we
were dealing with this matter for humanitarian purposes.
Apparently, someone who has been trained in revolution
in China, Russia, or Algeria is entitled to these benefits we
are granting by this motion. What about the freedom
fighters in countries such as Estonia, Hungary and Tibet?
Have we contributed one nickel, one iota, to them? Not
only have we not considered those daily massacres, but
instead we find this government describing communist
guerillas, white or black, who descend upon farms and
murder the husbands, wives and children, as freedom
fighters. You, honourable senators, are contributing to
that. I hope you enjoy reading reports of the murder of
innocent people. I do not enjoy it, but that seems to be the
attitude of this government.
Honourable senators, the next item I want ta deal with
is the stabilization of petroleum product prices. Everyone
in Canada is aware of the differing prices, whether it be at
the gas pumps of a service station, or in the bill received
from the local fuel dealer.

e

(1530)

Honourable senators, I realize that I have taken far
longer than I had intended on the previous issue, but I
would point out that it is one that is very personal to me.
From here on I shall attempt to condense my notes. As you
are aware I do not commit the cardinal sin of standing up
and reading a speech verbatim. Perhaps sometimes you
wish I did, but that really does not matter. From here on,
as I say, I will attempt ta abbreviate my remarks.
One of the items included in this bill is vote llb at $240
million. I raised a question on this in the Standing Senate
Committee on National Finance yesterday, and there is a
great deal of confusion about it. I shall not add to that
confusion, but shall simply say that I respected the attitude of the President of the Treasury Board when he
stated that he was looking for an outside auditor-an
auditor who was not associated with an oil company. At
that time the chairman of the National Finance Committee said, as I recall it, "Good luck." I would go further than
the chairman of the committee and add just one criterion,
and that is that the auditing firm must be one closely
associated with the Liberal Party.
Honourable senators, I am sure you are all aware-and
both Senator Benidickson and I pointed this out in the
committee yesterday-we are dealing here with a sum in
excess of $1 billion. Indeed, according ta my calculation,
we are dealing with a sum of $1.5 billion. Now I am not
going to comment on the chairman's report; it is not

necessary. However, I want to say this, that I am at times
amazed by the stupidity of the government, on the one
hand, and the facility with which they can manipulate the
NDP, on the other. A billion and a half dollars ta the oil
companies, and the NDP does not raise a whisper! It
completely ignores it. This must have been the ultimate in
what I believe the Leader of the Opposition calls "the
washroom conference."
Honourable senators, the Minister of Finance in dealing
with Bill C-245 stated that as a result of the transfer of $76
million to Alberta and Saskatchewan, the other provinces
would qualify under the Federal-Provincial Fiscal
Arrangements Act for something in the vicinity of $25
million, and this bill is deficient in that the statement,
indeed, the commitment, of the Minister of Finance is
completely missing.
The Minister of Finance further went on ta say-and
here I am condensing my remarks-that if this procedure
was followed throughout the year there would be something like $800 million due in fiscal transfers ta the provinces, and there would have ta be some new arrangement.
I suggest ta you very strongly, honourable senators, that
the reason why this money was paid not ta the provinces,
as the Minister of Finance indicated, but ta the international oil companies was simply that the federal government did not wish to pay the provinces east of the Ottawa
Valley line.
Honourable senators, despite the fact that no one listens
and no one pays any attention, I enjoy speaking ta the
Senate. However, from here on I will really condense my
remarks.

e

(1540)

I would ask honourable senators ta look at vote 40b,
Cape Breton Development Corporation, of approximately
$5 million. When we consider that the Cape Breton Development Corporation was established ta revitalize the
coal mines of Cape Breton, we must ask why we are
approving this vote when on January 1, 1974 the Cape
Breton Development Corporation signed a contract ta
import American coal into Nova Scotia?
Honourable senators would think that I was somewhat
remiss if I did not put the knife in and turn it a little, but
the projects that have caused some concern and publicity,
during my time here anyhow, have always been those of
Liberal governments. The St. Laurent government had the
Printing Bureau, the Pearson Government had the National Arts Centre, and I presume that this government is
looking for something by which they can equal their
predecessors. Apparently, they have found it in the Ste.
Scholastique or the Mirabel airport. We are perhaps taking
a chance, in that we envisaged huge aircraft flying from
Europe ta North America. Since that time certain events
have taken place in the international oil supply situation,
and we now find that the North American airlines are
putting their 747s, their huge aircraft, in reserve. They are
storing them in the desert area of the United States, and in
the meantime we proceed with not one international airport ta receive them, but two airports. We should consider
the estimates in these regards, and give them that special
little touch that the Senate is known for-that second,
sober look. Perhaps that money may have been better used
in inter-urban transportation.

SENATE DEBATES
Honourable senators, while we are dealing with this bill
I would point out that the facts and figures given are not
complete for this year. Since the supplementary estimates
were tabled we have had the Minister of State for Urban
Affairs announce a $100 million housing project. Then we
have had the Minister of Agriculture announce initially
$2.5 million per week to reduce beef prices, but he was not
satisfied with the publicity he achieved in that regard and
returned to offer something approximating $3 million or
$3.5 million. I am deeply concerned about parliamentary
control over expenditures. Expenditures cannot be controlled by Parliament if every time a cabinet minister sees
a TV camera and a microphone he starts off shouting,
"Millions, millions; publicity."
We must attempt to control this expenditure by TV, and
insist upon strict economy. We cannot have the Minister
of Agriculture walk out from a question period in the
House of Commons and announce to the TV cameras
grants of $2.5 million or $3 million a week. We cannot have
him return later, because he is not satisfied with the
publicity he achieved, and say, "I will up the ante to $3.5
million." He must be responsible to the taxpayer, to the
beef producer and to Parliament. In dealing with this bill,
honourable senators, I ask you to be responsible to yourselves, to the taxpayer and to Parliament.
* (1550)

Hon. W. M. Benidickson: Honourable senators, inasmuch as the previous speaker made some reference to me
and to our joint participation in discussions on some of the
estimates in the bill before us at a meeting of the National
Finance Committee yesterday, I should like to say a few
words. I do not want honourable senators or the public at
large to think that there is any intention to deal with a bill
which involves $1.02 billion in any cavalier fashion. That
is not so.
Those who want information can look at yesterday's
Hansard, where they will see that Senator Everett, as
Chairman of the National Finance Committee, reported
upon the sitting that was held yesterday, which was by no
means the final consideration of the items of the dollar
immensity indicated by the figures in the bill before us.
There was an unusual suggestion made by Senator Grosart that notwithstanding the approach of the end of this
fiscal year we ask the President of the Treasury Board if
he would be willing to appear next week and have further
discussion on these matters. We asked the chairman if he
could give assurances that we would have his permission
to so do.
The official report of those commitments in committee,
of course, is not yet available in printed form, but it will
be available to those interested in due course. I commend
in particular Senator Phillips who yesterday drew attention to one item in the estimates of considerable size and
to which he again referred today, namely, the item of $240
million, the details of which appear on page 5 of the bill,
and is item 116 of supplementary estimates (B) for the
fiscal year ending March 31, 1974. Senator Phillips yesterday calculated that while this sum was simply for three
months of the fiscal year that ends on March 31, if the
same plan was to be continued for another year it would
next year involve $1 billion. A newspaper indicated this
morning that as a result of yesterday's meeting of first
[Hon. Mr. Phillips.]

March 28, 1974

ministers it is probable that some comparable arrangement will continue for a year and a half.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: For a year, 12 months.
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: Senator Phillips today used the
figure $1.5 billion. I understood that to be the projection
for more than one year, but perhaps the $1.5 billion was
for 15 months, which my neighbour Senator Laing whispers he read about in a morning newspaper. In any event,
it is a large sum. We should put briefly on the record of
today's Debates of the Senate part of a description of the
purposes of this vote, which reads:
Payments in accordance with and subject to regulations made by the Governor in Council, to refiners
and other persons who import crude oil and petroleum
regulationsthe
in
prescribed
as
products,
$240,000,000.
It indicates that payments must be to persons from outside
Canada and for consumption within Canada. It goes on to
say-and I particularly want this to appear in the record
of today's proceedings:
such payments being for the restraint of prices of
petroleum products to consumers during the period
commencing on January 1, 1974, and ending on March
31, 1974, primarily in the Atlantic provinces, Quebec
and that part of Ontario east of the line known as the
Ottawa Valley line.
I refer now to the report submitted yesterday, which
again is not in printed form as an appendix to yesterday's
Minutes of the Proceedings of the Senate, although it is
available for perusal by members of the Senate or the
public from the records of the Clerk of the Senate. It
indicates that in the supplementary and further consideration of the estimates to be given next week, and if necessary on further sittings, one of the recommendations is
that which appears in paragraph 8(b), which refers to
investigation to assure that:
The auditing procedures that are to be employed in
ensuring that the $240 million paid to oil importers for
the restraint of prices of petroleum products to consumers during the period commencing January 1, 1974,
and ending March 31, 1974, are fully adequate.
That refers only to auditing procedures that are fully
adequate. When the record of yesterday's meeting of the
National Finance Committee appears in printed form, it
will be clearly seen that our purpose in having additional
meetings was to ascertain if in the three months which
have now expired and for which these payments are being
made, the committee can satisfy itself that the payments
were adequately audited. Indeed, I recall that that question was raised in a commendable speech by Senator
Laing in the recent debate on the Address in reply to the
Speech from the Throne, during the course of which I
asked the honourable senator whether he personally had
made any investigation, as former Minister of Northern
Affairs and Natural Resources, of the effectiveness of the
proposed audit.
My interest lies not only in ascertaining that the audit
procedures are good-whether conducted by an outside
auditor who is not compromised by association with those
who benefit directly from receipt of this subsidy, or in
another manner-but that retrospectively the committee

March 28, 1974

Marc 28,1974SENATE
DEBATES

can be satisfied that the benefits adequately restrained
prices to consumers.
Hon. Mr'. Laing: Could we flot use the Auditor General?
Hon. Mr'. Benidickson: The President of the Treasury
Board said yesterday that the method of auditing had flot
been determined. The Auditor General's office was one of
the instruments that might be used. Another was a consortium of auditors, because it is flot too easy today to find an
auditor in national firms familiar with the industry who
has not had some association with some of the companies
to whom payments under this vote might be made directly, et cetera.
I wish to emphasize that there is scope for members of
the committee, flot only to assure themselves about the
efficiency of the audit procedures but also to look backward and see if, in fact, consumers have adequately benefited from this expenditure of taxpayers' money. So that if
something similar is required for the ensuing period,
whether it be 12 months, 15 months or a year and a haîf, as
Senator Phillips said this afternoon, the committee as
authorized by the chairman and agreed to by the President
of the Treasury Board will have authority to continue its
examinations.
Hon. Charles McElmnan: Honourable senators,, I shall be
brief. It is not my wish to debate ail the points that
Senator Phillips has placed upon the record. However, in
the course of his derogatory remarks relative to, the Honourable Mitchell Sharp, if 1 understood him correctly,
which I think I did, he referred to Mr. Sharp as being
"communistic," and he challenged any honourable senator
to refute that.
*

(16w0)

Hon. Mr'. Choquette: Do you take that seriously? Do
you think it is worthwhile refuting it?
Hon. Mr'. McElmnan: Your question is well taken. The
circumstances of today have to be considered. However, I
do think that when a respected Canadian is maligned on
the floor of this house, or in any other place, and a
challenge is issued concerning such derogatory statements, we are responsible to clear the record of that day.
That is my only intent at this moment.
The Honourable Mitchell Sharp represents our nation
throughout the world today. He is not a communist, nor is
he communistic. He is a very fine Canadian, deserving of
high respect.

and notwithstanding Rule 45(l) (b), I move that the bill be

Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.
APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 2, 1974
SECOND READING

Hon. Leopold Langlois moved the second reading of Bill
C-16, for granting to Her Majesty certain sums of money
f or the public service f or the financial year ending the 3l1st
March 1975.
He said: Honourable senators, the main estimates for
1974-75 on which this bill is based were tabled in the
Senate and referred to the Standing Senate Committee on
National Finance on March 19, 1974. These estimates have
not as yet been discussed in committee. However, before
we are called upon to give final approval to, the 1974-75
estimates, our National Finance Committee will have
ample opportunity to discuss them and report to the
Senate thereon in the usual manner.
The 1974-75 estimates total $23,297 million, consisting of
budgetary expenditures of $22,023 million and non-budgetary expenditures of $1,274 million. The bill now before us
is the f irst interim supply bill for the 1974-75 fiscal year
and will release a general proportion of three-twelfths of
the votes in these estimates. There are, however, additional proportions for 26 special items to which I wiil refer
later. The total expenditure proposed by this bill is
$3,138,241,654.50.
The proportions requested in this bill are intended to
provide for ail necessary requirements of the public service to June 30, 1974. This bill is in the usual form of
interim supply bis, and in no instance does it request
release of the total amount of any item.
In general, the 26 votes which require additional proportions may be grouped as follows:
(a) Votes in which it is customary to pay grants early
in the fiscal year:
Energy, Mines and Resources-Vote 25

Finance-Vote 10
National Health and Welf are-Vote 65
(b) Votes for which additional sums are required to
finance programs until forecast revenues are received
later in the fiscal year:
Finance-Vote 25
Supply and Services-Vote 1 and 10
Transport-Votes 60, 80, 85 and 110
(c) Votes which provide payments required to cover
accounts maintained on a calendar rather than fiscal
year basis:
Transport-Votes 35 and 45

Urban Affairs-Vote 10
(d) Votes for which additional portions are required
for other specif ic purposes:
Consumer and Corporate Aff airs-Vote 30
Environment-Vote 15
External Aff airs-Vote 20

Treasury Board-Votes 5 and 10
Clause 5 of this bill would grant borrowing authority for
$3 billion, and provide for the cancellation of all outstanding and unused borrowing authority from previous appropriation acts for the fiscal year 1973-74. This borrowing
authority has been included in the bill, as usual, to authorize the issuance of Treasury bills, marketable bonds and
unmarketable bonds, including Canada Savings Bonds, for
the financing of the ordinary operations of the government, including non-budgetary cash requirements, such as
loans and advances to crown corporations, and to meet
requirements of the Exchange Fund Account.
I might add some further explanation on the borrowing
authority to which I referred. As honourable senators are
aware, section 36 of the Financial Administration Act
requires that "no money shall be borrowed or security
issued by or on behalf of Her Majesty without the authority of Parliament."
The authority to borrow for the purpose of refunding
maturing issues comes under section 38 of the Financial
Administration Act. This section provides that the Governor in Council may authorize the minister-that being the
Minister of Finance-to borrow such sums of money as are
required for the payment of any securities that were
issued under the authority of Parliament and which are
maturing or have been called for redemption.
Section 39 of the Financial Administration Act provides
for authorization by the Governor in Council of temporary
short-term borrowing by the minister in special
circumstances.

e

(1610)

The authority for the government to raise new money
through the issue of securities is usually obtained annually. About the beginning of each fiscal year an appropriation bill, such as the one we are dealing with today, seeks
new authority for the Minister of Finance to raise new
money by the issue of securities, and provides for cancellation of unused borrowing authority under previous appropriation acts. Additional borrowing authority is sought, if
necessary, later in the year. The terms and conditions for
such borrowing are authorized by the Governor in Council. Section 37 of the Financial Administration Act reads
as follows:
Where authority is conferred by Parliament to
borrow money on behalf of Her Majesty, the Governor
in Council, subject to the Act authorizing the borrowing, may authorize the Minister
(a) to borrow the money by the issue and sale of
securities in such form ... as the Governor in Council may approve; and
(b) to enter into such contracts . .. relating to the
borrowing ... as the Governor in Council may
approve.
[Hon. Mr. Langloi s]

March 28, 1974

New money raised through the issue of securities is used
in the financing of the ordinary operations of the government, including non-budgetary cash requirements such as
loans and advances to crown corporations, and to meet the
requirements of the Exchange Fund Account.
The types of securities issued by the government
include treasury bills, marketable bonds denominated in
Canadian dollars or foreign currency, and non-marketable
bonds including Canada Savings Bonds.
The total borrowing authority authorized annually by
Parliament in the last few years has been as follows:
$1,750 million
1964-65
$1,750 million
1965-66
$1,750 million
1966-67
$1,750 million
1967-68
$2,000 million
1968-69
$2,000 million
1969-70
$3,000 million
1970-71
$3,000 million
1971-72
$3,000 million
1972-73
$3,000 million
1973-74
It is proposed to have the same authority for the new
fiscal year. By the end of the fiscal year 1973-74 authority
to borrow $3,000 million will have to be used to the extent
of an estimated $200 million. The major portion of cash
requirements for 1973-74 were met through a run-down of
government cash balances and sales of foreign exchange
reserves.
In the coming fiscal year, as in other years, the full
amount of borrowing authority should not be required.
However, it is important for the government to have
flexibility in its debt management planning and operations. For example, the government's practice is to have
available at all times sufficient unused borrowing authority against which to change net new borrowing by means
of Canada Savings Bonds, which peak at the time of the
new campaign but diminish thereafter, and to enable it to
finance the unpredictable requirements of the Exchange
Fund Account.
It is customary for one of the first appropriation bills of
each new fiscal year to request net new borrowing authority. Accordingly, this bill now before you incorporates a
request, equal to the amount requested in the last four
years, of $3,000 million.
The wording of this bill provides that the coming into
force of this new act cancels only that portion of the
outstanding and unused borrowing power in respect of
which no action has been taken by the Governor in Council pursuant to section 37 of the Financial Administration
Act.
Honourable senators, that concludes my remarks on this
bill. I am at your disposal to supply any further information you may wish in connection thereto.
Hon. W. M. Benidickson: Honourable senators, I assure
you that I shall be brief. I spoke to the preceding bill, but
this one is different in that it relates to the forthcoming
fiscal year, 1974-75, whereas our immediately preceding
discussion on the other bill related to the fiscal year that
will expire on March 31, 1974.
I simply want to point out to the Senate that the total of
expenditures for 1973-74-made up of the main estimates

March 28,1974

201

DEBATES20
March 2, 1974SENATE

and the supplementary estimates (A), plus the supplementary estimates (B), which were passed today-amount, for
the fiscal year now expiring, to $21.4 billion.
Basically, this bill asks simply for three months's
supply, into the next fiscal year, commencing April 1. Lt
relates only to the main estimates, which we received a
f ew weeks ago. Those main estimates totalled $22.02 billion. If later we have, in addition to the main estimates, a
request for supplementary estimates and only equal to
what was asked in supplementaries for the fiscal year
1973-74, the total would be $24.66 billion, a very substantial
increase indeed.
As was intimated in the previous debate, that sum could
be realistic, and indeed the supplementary estimates could
exceed those of last year, as they usually do, but ail the
more so if we are to continue for a year or 15 months in the
ensuing fiscal year with these substantial votes to restrain
the prices of petroleum products aimed at aid to the
consumer. That is a very ominous figure to ail of us, but it
is a trend.
Yesterday in the Standing Senate Committee on Nationai Finance I suggested that we should not only examine
the size of the expenditures, but should look upon similar
expenditures and taxes demanded in other comparable
countries. I indicated to the committee the existence of a
useful OECD report, and got approval for consideration of
this too at a future date. Lt is a bit back-dated and ref ers to
figures in 1971, but I hope the Treasury Board will have
something comparable for a later year.
The information given in committee yesterday comes
fromn an article in the Financial Times of Canada dated
January 28, 1974. The heading of the article is, "Ottawa's
bite not the worst." In the article there appears the following table:

Hon. Mr. Langlois: What was the date of this OECD
report?
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: Lt was 1971. Yesterday I said
to the President of the Treasury Board and bis officials
that I hoped they might update that into more current
f igures.
H-onourable senators, my previous few remarks are not
enough. The table must be looked at because it also adds,
to the take for direct taxes at all levels of government in
those respective countries, another column which deais
with direct social security contributions that are taken in
a way other than out of general taxation.
For those of you who might immediately judge from my
preceding remarks that the percentage of taxes related to
gross national product taken in the United States is substantially less than in Canada, I want to emphasize that
when it comes to those payments that are taken separately
and directly for social security in the United States, the
United States governments receive revenues in the form of
special contributions of that nature to the extent of 5.74
per cent of their GNP, whereas in Canada that form of
what I would describe as regressive "take" by government
comes to only 2.64 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I have 10
inform the Senate that if the Honourable Senator Langlois
speaks now, his speech will have the effect of closing the
debate on second reading of this bill.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, I have only a
few words to add to the comment just made by Senator
Benidickson. He referred to the total of the main estimates
on which the bill is based. He gave a figure of $23,297,427,837. I think the Senate will be interested in having a
breakdown of that figure, which is as follows: budgetary
items, $22,022,903,837; non-budgetary items, $1,274,524,000.
The honourable senator has also referred to the supplementary estimates, which would likely add to those f igures that I have given. I think it is worth noting that
yesterday we were informed by the President of the Treasury Board that over the years, for some years back, these
supplementary estimates represent roughly between 1 and
2 per cent of the main estimates, as a rule. There is no
reason to f eel that this percentage would be increased in
the coming fiscal year.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

THIRD READING
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shail
this bill be read a third time?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, with leave,
and notwithstanding rule 45(l)(b), I move that this bill
be read a third time now.
Hon. Arthur Laing: Honourable senators, this bill provides for a prodigious increase in expenditure in one year.
I would hope there will be more things said in this house
than have been said so far.
I should like to review briefly the immense increase in
taxation. I am not directing my criticism particularly

SENATE DEBATES
against the national government, because taxation at all
levels of government-federal, provincial and municipalhas been increasing at a very great rate. Cumulatively,
taxes in Canada are now reaching a point where serious
consideration must be given, at all levels, to economizing,
and making sure that we are not wasting money.
A very good point was made yesterday by the Minister
of Finance, that an increasing proportion of the requirements of government nationally in recent years is in fixed
amounts, outside government control. I agree with him,
and I sympathize with him in that problem.
We have had a wide spectrum of social security measures. The government, in the light of inflationary pressures within Canada and around the world, has done its
best for the Canadian people. By supplementing social
security payments in various ways, and by increasing
them, it has minimized the effects of inflation on those
people who receive them. A very large proportion of the
total budget of Canada has been earmarked for this purpose. But there remain other areas-investment in the
country and encouragement to industry-which should be
carefully surveyed.
In the field of employment there is one section which
causes me a great deal of worry, and that is the increase in
the last five years in the number of people within the
service industry. It has been the most rapidly expanding
source of employment, rising from 27 per cent five years
ago to 31 per cent of total employment at the present time.
These service industries, unless backed by a strong financial structure of more permanent employment, probably
residing upon the firm foundations of the resources of
Canada, would be the first to suffer if we had a recession,
and the employees would be the first to lose their jobs or
be displaced.
I would not like to see the government restricted to
these programs-and I know that is within the management competence of the government-which most Canadians approve. The balance should be used to create conditions within industry, for the encouragement of industry.
That will mean, over a great period of years, permanent
jobs for very many people.

•

(1630)

We had an election in the province of British Columbia
many years ago-I think it was in the thirties when we
had come out of the depression-and our great Liberal
champion at that time was none other than Duff Pattullo
who was, I think, probably the best premier British
Columbia ever had.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Who was that?
Hon. Mr. Laing: Dufferin Pattullo. His campaign was
"work and wages", and we needed work and wages at that
time in British Columbia.
Today our greatest labour union in British Columbia is
the International Woodworkers of America. It is a very
powerful and responsible union which has been good to its
members and has been, I think, good to the concept of
unionized employment in this country. Today there are
29,000 members in that union with a basic pay of $32 a day.
If you were working in the sawmills in British Columbia
in 1933 you were paid 35 cents an hour if you were white,
and 25 cents an hour if you were an Oriental. I remember
[Hon. Mr. Laing.]

March 28, 1974

one of the first things that Pattullo did was to set a
minimum wage within those mills of 40 cents an hour.
From then on we gradually improved ourselves. But attention was paid at that time to the basic encouragement of
industries which could be expected to create in future
years jobs that would last.
I have been talking in recent months about the change
in Canada, and the transfer of power in Canada. I am not
trying to rub it in to my central Canadian colleagues
when I remind them that a great new power is moving in
Western Canada. This is partly because of the fact that
two-thirds of the people of the world live around the
Pacific Rim, and the fact that their standard of living is
rising at a rate of 9 per cent annually-a little higher than
ours, but from a very low base, of course. When you
multiply that huge population by that percentage you get
an enormous multiplicand.
We have a port in Vancouver which last year handled
421/2 million tons of freight. This year we are expecting 45
million tons of freight through that port. This is almost as
much as is shipped through all of the other ports of
Canada combined, and there are new great sales being
made.
As a result of the kind invitation of the Minister of
External Affairs, and the concurrence of our own leader
here, I paid a short visit to Brazil. I found that we are
going to move a million tons of potash to Brazil out of the
port of Vancouver on a contract just consummated there.
There is a committee from Alberta at the present time
visiting Brazil with the intention of selling a great deal of
sulphur. You know, in Alberta alone today they are producing 51½ million tons of sulphur annually-and sulphur
is the core of all industry, because sulphuric acid starts
every other industry.
And they intend to sell coal there. I think that is a little
venturesome owing to the freight costs down to the coast
first and then the long water haul to Brazil, but there is
some hope that at least coking coal will go in there
because there are enormous steel plants being built in
Brazil. Indeed, one of them is a 12-million-ton per year
plant which is an investment by the Japanese. It is near a
port called Vitoria, which is about as close to Europe as
you can possibly get in Brazil. Out of there last year they
shipped 37 million tons of iron ore.
Travel, I suppose, helps one a great deal. I did not know
until recently that Brazil last year produced 7 million tons
of soya beans. They are just now beginning to get into this
and other agricultural production at a tremendous rate.
Fortunately, we are selling to Brazil an increasing quantity of wheat. This year it is expected that our wheat sales
to Brazil alone will be in the order of $300 million. I stand
to be corrected by our colleague who was on the Wheat
Board, but that is my understanding.
There are areas of new, fantastic growth possible within
this country. The mining industry in this country is being
maligned today by people who do not know what they are
talking about. About the best job that Canadians have
done in their history is mining. We are the best miners in
the world. If you go to South Africa you will find that
even today the mines there are being operated by Canadians, by people educated in Canada. We are doing a won-

March 28, 1974
March

28

1974

SENATE DEBATES

derful job of promotion in all of the mining countries of
the world, and we are extremely competent in Canada.
People say, "Oh, yes, you've got an open-pit mine out
there, but you only employ a very small number of men
and you use great big trucks." And all of that is true.
Kaiser's coal operations in the province of British
Columbia are using 200-ton trucks, which cost $276,000
apiece. They are operated by one man who has to climb a
ladder to get into the cab. I asked the boss what he had to
pay those men, and he replied "Those fellows won't join
the union." I said, "I'm not surprised, but what do you pay
them?" He told me that they were paid $100 for eight
hours' work.
But behind that operation and those pits, that mining
company today-like all mining companies in Canada-is
using every single yellow page in the telephone book, f rom
"food" to "rope" and everything else. That is an aspect
which is entirely missed by those who are criticizing the
mining companies for making unsightly holes in the
ground, and then dumping their labour back on the government to look after in welf are. Surely, that is an improper and a ridiculous view to take of the thing we do best in
Canada, and one of our greatest industries.
We should focus more of our attention on this matter. I
would like to see more of the funds that the government
still has under control addressed to the development of
that kind of thing, and to the betterment of transportation
in this country.
I was not being facetious when I said that we could
build a new railway from the Head of the Lakes to Calgary. Not at all. I said Calgary but probably it should go to
Edmonton, bearing in mind the comparable grades on
those two railroads. The grade on the CP is very heavy,
while the grade on the CN is one of the lightest in the
world having regard to the extent to which it has to rise to
get through the Rockies. It is a well known fact that
pulling a train on a one degree grade costs twice as much
as pulling it on the level. But I think that we could build a
fast rail service between the Rocky Mountains and the
Head of the Lakes. I think that we could move unit trains,
100 cars in a train, at 80 to 100 miles an hour, and we could
compress the economic geography of Canada by as much
as 30 or 40 per cent.
There is a great row over boxcars at the present time.
There are 27,000 Canadian boxcars in the United States,
and I suppose we have about the same number of theirs in
Canada. If you send a boxcar to British Columbia today, it
gets lost for two or three weeks. If we could move the
freight traffic speedily, and control it, between those two
important points in Canada, a distance of about 2,400
miles, we would compress the economy of Canada and
accomplish a very great deal.
These are things which I hope the Government of
Canada will address itself to. We need some great new
economic thrust in the nation at this time in order to
produce new hope, new dreams and new jobs-jobs which
we know are going to last and which we will have two,
three, f ive, ten or even fifteen years from now.
We have to pay some attention to offshore mining,
honourable senators, because I would expect that in the
next ten or fifteen years we will have offshore mining

27601-14!

developed to the point where it is probably going to be
producing one-third of all the metal in the world. Fortunately for us, one Canadian company, Noranda, has gone
into this field with American counterparts and is taking
about 25 per cent of that investment. The Soviets are sea
mining it, and the Japanese have perfected it. With the
coastline that Canada has, the longest coastline of any
country in the world-163,000 miles-the opportunity for
us to investigate this new field of what could be extremely
productive mining is a blessing given to very few countries in the world. This is the kind of thing to which our
government should extend its full effort. We should
advance as far as we possibly can with modern technology
in the production and development of jobs that are currently needed.
*

I make this only criticism, that we seem to be distributing funds to ventures that are not particularly productive. We have great inquiries going. We study everything
nowadays, and we study it to death. I have in my office
studies by the Government of Canada across the years,
from the time I first came to Ottawa in 1949, that have
cost-I added it up the other day-$124 million. When you
mention to the present people in charge a report that was
made in respect of transportation, for example, in this
country-in fact, there are three or four major reportsyou find they have never heard of it. They pay no attention to history. They say, "That is bygone. Start all over
again."
You know, you can study yourself to death, and you can
involve so many people, and, of course, it is a popular
thing to bring everyone in and ask what they think. Well,
when you throw all that chaff in the air, you are going to
get no result at all-none at all. It is a great mistake for
governments-and they are all doing it today, in part, at
least-to govern by Gallup poll. It will not work.
I think our democratic system is a wonderful system. It
is a lot nearer perfection than other systems of which
assessments have been made by other people across the
years. If a goverment is elected for a period of time, at the
end of which it must meet the people again, then it is
imperative that the people have trust in that government
during that period and give it an opportunity to perform,
to put into effect the things that it said it stands for. At
the end of that time the people can deal with it in any way
they like, considering its performance. But with this constant cry of, "Bring somebody in; get a study going; get
everybody going," we are getting everybody standing on
everybody else's feet, and when we do that we get no
results at all. So I just make this observation, that I hope,
when this section of our budget comes up in the future,
that it is within the competence of the government to
vary, to control, or to pay some attention to it.
I mentioned agriculture in the province of Alberta the
other day. They have a plan in Alberta to build 20 small
dams to irrigate about four or five million additional acres
of land in that province. The soil there will hold water,
and it is an area where growing conditions are superb, due
to the climate. It is an area that could feed the entire
population of Canada, and some other countries as well.
These are the things that our national government should
give attention to, instead of dissipating money in a great

SENATE DEBATES
variety of studies which, in the long term, will not stand
us in very good stead.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators, it is usual
to hear some comment from this side of the house on a bill
such as this. I ask, first of all, to be excused for rising to
speak from a seat which is not normally my own. On
instruction of the deputy leader on this side, I have moved
to this position, and so for the moment I am speaking from
my place, as required by the rules. It will cease to be my
place after I have spoken.
Hon. Mr. Larnontagne: You are coming closer to us.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: We will then return to the more
normal and expert management of the affairs of this
group.
Honourable senators, this, of course, is the first interim
supply bill dealing with the requirements of the government for the fiscal year which will start at the beginning
of next week. It appropriates a fairly modest amount-a
mere $3 billion-compared with the fantastic indications
of government spending this year that we have from the
main estimates, and from the expectation of supplementaries. Some of us have attempted to discover what might
be the real spending plans of the government for the
coming year, but this is still, as has been indicated, a deep,
dark secret.
As was indicated in a speech, part of which I heard,
announcements have been made from time to time outside
the House of Commons of new spending intentions, and,
as was indicated, particularly under the influence of
television cameras. My guess is that government spending
this year will total something like $25 billion. This is not,
of course, the amount indicated in the main estimates, but
if we add merely supplementary estimates (A) and supplementary estimates (B) of last year we arrive at a total
of about $23 billion, and I anticipate there might very
easily be another $2 billion in (A) and (B) supplementaries, or in (C), (D) and (E) supplementaries, which we
could very well have this year, if the government intends
to keep on spending as it has been spending.
I mention that because in other debates that we have
had here it has been pointed out that most of this spending
is directed toward the consequences, rather than the
causes, of inflation. I need hardly say that in the opinion
of the financial press, and in the opinion of many economists, and so on, there is little doubt that government
spending, particularly the high level of government spending by the present administration, is one of the major
causes of inflation in Canada.
In spite of the many warnings that have been given, and
the evidence that has been placed before it, the government steadfastly refuses to accept the validity of those
arguments, and continues to tell us that our inflation is
externally caused. On another occasion I pointed out that
as important an organization as the OECD has stated
categorically that the rate of domestic inflation-domestically created and caused inflation-is greater than the rate
of external inflation as it applies to inflation in Canada.
However, I say that the amount that we are asked to
approve in interim supply at this time, in those terms, is
comparatively modest-$3,138 million.
[Hon. Mr. Laing.]

March 28, 1974

I am sorry I was not in the chamber when Senator
Langlois introduced the bill and made, I am quite sure, his
usual excellent explanation as to why this money is
required, and required in the rather uneven proportions
that we find. In some schedules it is eight-twelfths, in
others six-twelfths, five-twelfths, four-twelfths, threetwelfths, two-twelfths and one-twelfth. I am informed
that Senator Langlois has explained the reasons for this.
As I say, I regret that I was not in the chamber when he
did so.
* (1650)

Hon. Mr. Langlois: That applied to some 25 votes.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I hope honourable senators will
accept my statement that I was absent, if not on public
business, at least on what I consider to be urgent Senate
business at that particular time.
Hon. Mr. Martin: And we all recognize the great public
service rendered.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I shall not take very much credit
until the bell rings at 6 o'clock.
Honourable senators, I would particularly draw your
attention to clause 3 of the bill which states, as usual:
3. The amount authorized by this Act to be paid or
applied in respect of an item may be paid or applied
only for the purposes and subject to any terms and
conditions specified in the item, and the payment or
application of any amount pursuant to the item has
such operation and effect as may be stated or
described therein.
I take the opportunity provided by this clause to point
out the growing tendency, perhaps at a departmental level
and perhaps at Cabinet level, to keep on transferring
funds from one vote to another. This practice is very
greatly on the increase. In examining supplementary
estimates(B) for last year, for example, we found a substantial number of items, perhaps 10 or a dozen, under
Schedule B of the explanation of the $1 votes which deals
with these transfers. Of course, what happens when clause
3 is not strictly adhered to is that votes of Parliamentand we must keep in mind that these votes are instructions from Parliament to proceed with certain expenditures-are not carried out.
Obviously, there can be very good reasons why everything in the main estimates, or everything voted by Parliament, is not proceeded with in the particular year. There
may be delays, and so on. Nevertheless, we find that this
tendency on the part of departments to say, "Well, now,
we have not proceeded with this, but we want to spend the
money on something else," and so, we are presented with
these changes of intention on the part of the government
and contraventions -perhaps I should say "amendments,"
because they are not really contraventions since these are
done by an act of Parliament-of clause 3. It is orly right
to point out that it would be much better if this trend were
slowed up rather than quickened.
We are trying in the National Finance Committee, when
we receive supplementary estimates, to obtain explanations of the particular capital works because they are
mainly capital works that are not proceeded with, and I
hope that Senator Everett, as chairman, will be successful
within the year in persuading the government to list those

March 28, 1974
March 28, 1974

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

capital works not proceeded with. I say this hecause it is
very important that we should know what changes have
been made, particularly if some of the capital works previously indicated have been abandoned. Perhaps flot too
many are abandoned-it is generally a question of delaybut it seems to me that we should he told in much more
detail than is presently the case that the instructions of
Parliament to do certain things are not going to be followed in that year. I raise this point because it does arise
directly out of the very useful general instructions in
clause 3.
Honourable senators, I know we are, to some extent,
getting close to a deadline-there is always a deadlineand I will say no more on that at the moment. I appreciate
the fact that Senator Langlois has given the usuai undertaking that the passing of this interim supply bill will not
in any way preclude or limit our right to inquire in detail
into the spending involved in any of the items that will be
authorized when this bill is passed.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I have done so.
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.
BUSINESS 0F THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, may I be permitted at this stage to state that I am very grateful to ahl
honourable senators for having so courteously agreed to
allow me to proceed with the two appropriation bills this

afternoon. I should like to announce that arrangements
are being made now to have royal assent given to this
legislation at approximately 5.45 this afternoon. I was also
informed only a few moments ago that there is a possibîlity that we might be gettingHon. Mr'. Martin: We will not be getting it now.
Hon. Mr'. Langlois: I arn referring to the Veterans Land
Act amending bill, and I am told that we will not be
getting it now. Therefore, we will not be dealing with it
today.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I wonder if I might ask what will be
the effect if we do not deal with it today, because I
understand the present legishation runs out at the end of
this month.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: On Sunday.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: My understanding is that the general
effect of this legislation is to extend the period of certain
privileges now enjoyed by veterans. I suppose, if we
cannot deal with it until Monday or Tuesday, there will be
an assurance on the part of the government that no veteran will suf fer any disability because of that fact.
Hon. Mr'. Buckwold: Honourable senators, I have had an
opportunity to discuss this matter with the proposer of the
bill in the House of Commons and I indicated that we
would be ready, with your co-operation, to sit here to try
to pass this bill having regard to the time requirement.
However, as of a few minutes ago, that bill had not passed
the House of Commons. Consequently, our position is
rather difficult so far as trying to get it passed here now is

concerned. I indicated to himn that we wouhd be avaîlable
to deal with the bill on Tuesday evening, and assured him
on your behaîf of our full co-operation. He seemed to be

well satisfied that there would be no hardship inflicted
upon any veteran as a resuit of this one-day delay.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: They won't apply for a loan on
Monday.

ANIMAL CONTAGIOUS DISEASES ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from Tuesday, March 26, the
adjourned debate on the motion of Senator McGrand for
second reading of Bill S-2, to amend the Animal Contagious Diseases Act.
Hon. Hazen Argue: Honourable senators, this bill was
well explained by Senator McGrand when he introduced
it. Last Tuesday evening I had the opportunity of saying a
few words with respect to this legisiation. It has been
quite a long time coming. It is to bring the Animal Contagious Diseases Act up to date by providing some very
comprehensive amendments.
I noticed in the Senate gallery that evening Dr. Kenneth
Wells, the Director General of the Health of Animals
Branch of the Department of Agriculture. I have personally known Dr. Wells for many years. I f irst met him, in a
public way, in the Agriculture Committee of the House of
Commons back in 1952, when we were considering the
circumstances surrounding an outbreak of foot-and-mouth
disease in the province of Saskatchewan. The deliberations then were very vigorous. That particular outbreak

SENATE DEBATES
was eventually cleaned up, and the farmers were paid
compensation. Dr. Wells has in the meantime advanced
from his position at that time of Chief Veterinarian to the
very important position of Director General which he
holds today.
This legislation is administered by the Department of
Agriculture, under a new Minister of Agriculture, the
Honourable Eugene Whelan. I believe that Mr. Whelan is
making an important impact in Canada by the manner in
which he is handling the Department of Agriculture, in
the many measures that he is introducing, and in his
showing that he is an authentic voice of the farmer in
government. I am pleased to see that he has placed before
us this comprehensive amendment to an important act.
I now wish to bring to the attention of the Senate a
matter which I believe to be of great urgency. If it is not
directly connected with the administration of this act, in
my opinion it can be associated with the type of administration that should take place, and I am convinced that the
present Minister of Agriculture, when reading the Debates
of the Senate for today, will give careful consideration to
what I am about to say. I believe also, if he finds the facts
as I outline them, that some action will be taken.
Western Canada is experiencing probably the most
severe winter on record. As far as Saskatchewan is concerned, this is a year of a fall of snow that has broken all
previous records. Last Saturday morning I was in the city
of Moose Jaw, and the temperature was 25 degrees below
zero. I have been out on my farm in the last couple of
weeks, and there were blizzards for at least 50 per cent of
the time-blizzards of a kind that blocked for some time
all the country roads; indeed, all roads except the main
highways, which the provincial government was able to
keep open.
During this very severe winter, which may continue for
almost another month-the snow is still there, and it is
still cold-thousands of head of livestock have died, if not
from starvation, then from malnutrition, brought about by
a shortage of feed caused by this unusually severe winter.
When cattle die from malnutrition, from lack of adequate
feed, we reach the very type of situation in which disease
could become rampant.
I notice that there is authority in the present measure
for the government to take whatever steps it feels necessary by way of regulation to prevent the occurrence and
spread of contagious diseases amongst livestock.
This is a critical situation. When it has been mentioned,
some have pooh-poohed it and said "Well, it is a normal
thing, and all the farmer has to do is get a little better feed
for his livestock and the disease will go away." I do not
believe that to be the case. Governments have paid very
little attention to this situation up to now. When I was in
Saskatchewan, I heard Mr. Boyd Anderson, who is vicepresident of the Canadian Cattlemen's Association,
explaining on the radio what was happening. Farmers
were endeavouring to ration the available feed supplies
for their livestock and feeding an inordinate amount of
straw, with the result that with many of the livestock
impaction developed. The cattle went down and, after a
few days, died. He pointed out that it was necessary to
improve the diet of these animals by giving them better
[Hon. Mr. Argue.]

March 28, 1974

quality roughage, providing a certain proportion of hay
and grain to the animals in this condition.
I am sorry to say that there are small farmers, wintering
a number of cattle, who have become so short of feed that
they have suffered severe losses. When the newspapers
report the losses they publish headlines to the effect that
cattle are being starved, and it is then suggested that the
police should lay charges. I do not think those really are
the facts at all. The livestock producer, the farmer, wants
to do the best he can, but because of a very severe shortage
of feed the cattle are suffering malnutrition and some
have died.
This has happened to new farmers and small farmers
who, above all, cannot afford the severe economic losses
occasioned by this situation. I know personally a young
farmer who has lost nine cows. This represents a very
severe blow to him. His road has been blocked for many
weeks, and he is hauling by skidoo, on a daily basis, a few
bales of feed to his cattle.
I suggest that an emergency situation exists on the
prairies. It has existed for some time, and will continue,
according to the weather forecasts, for another few weeks.
*

(1710)

I would also suggest that there are things that should be
done. The livestock industry is passing through a crisis,
for a number of reasons. One is the situation concerning
the United States and the importation of large quantities
of cattle into Canada, and the other is the very low price
brought about in part by the severity of the weather.
For the information of honourable senators, I should
like to relate something that I learned today from an
auctioneer who operates a livestock auction at Assiniboia,
Saskatchewan. Two or three weeks ago good cattle passing
through his auction were sold at about 44 cents per pound.
The federal government announced a seven-cent subsidy
on beef to packers, to be passed on to livestock producers.
Donald Beaton, the auctioneer, informed me today that
good cattle passed through his auction market yesterday
at 35 cents per pound; that he did everything he could to
improve the price, and was able to get it up to 37 cents per
pound.
The situation has been brought about by an emergency,
caused partly by action stemming from the United States
and partly because of the severity of the winter, complicated by those factors to which I have just referred.
Because of malnutrition, some hundreds of animals have
been sold through this particular auction.
I suggest to the Minister of Agriculture-whose authority is adequate under this bill and under the general
function of his department to promote and improve the
production of livestock-that he immediately send experts
to the Prairies to survey the situation and find out to what
extent livestock are dying through lack of good feed.
Thousands of cattle have been so dying and thousands
more will continue to die. It is not the fault of the farmer.
The provincial government has taken no action. I have
six suggestions to make:
1. That federal and provincial authorities should bring
to the attention of farmers the percentage of high quality
roughage required to maintain an animal in reasonable

March 28,1974
March 28, 1974

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

health. The minimum may be 25 per cent. I amrnfot certain
of the figure, but there certainly is a minimum.
2. That farmers should be informed that they should
discontinue providing only straw as roughage, that there
must be a certain quantity of grain in the ration, or a
certain quantity of prepared livestock feed, in order to
maintain these animals in good condition.
3. That provincial goverfiments should make available
lists of those who have roughage for sale, in order that
f armers might know where roughage can be obtained. The
average general price of baled hay on the Prairies in the
last few years has been around 40 cents per bale. I arn told
that fodder is in such short supply, that hay-not of the
best quality-is selling from $2 to $3 per bale, which is far
more per hundredweight than the best quality wheat in
the world sold for just 18 months ago. Therefore, there is a
crisis. I suggest that lists of f odder suppliers should be
made available to those f armers who require hay and
roughage.
4. That the Canadian Wheat Board, an agency of the
federal goverfiment, should make available to producers
information on where oats, barley and other livestock feed
can be obtained within the elevator system.
5. That it should be made clear by both the federal and
provincial governments that loans should be made
through our regular institutions under the Farm Improvement Loans Act. Such loans should be made very quickly,
because they are urgently needed.
6. That the provincial goverfiment make available, or
ensure that there is available, snow removal equipment in
order that a f armer who has a herd of livestock in need of
additional f eed can have his road cleared of snow to enable
him to feed his livestock.
Honourable senators, I do flot think that adequate attention has been given to these matters. There are f armers
today whose livestock are in a very bad way. Many animals could be saved if action were taken along the lines I
have suggested. This matter is pertinent to the whole
question of animal diseases and animal health because,
after all, in the prevention of disease nothing is better
than healthy livestock.
Hon. Sidney L. Buckwold: I wish to compliment my
colleague from Saskatchewan on his drawing attention to
the very serious problem which exists in the cattle industry in Saskatchewan. I agree with him that real problems
exist, due particularly to a very severe winter and a
shortage of f eed. There was a time when if one saîd he was
making hay it meant that he was doing very well. At 40
cents per bale one was not doing very well, but at $40 per
bale one is making hay in the fullest sense of the term.
The honourable senator said that the provincial goverfiment had done nothing, that it should provide snow
removal equipment, and so on. I should like to suggest
that the Government of Saskatchewan has been remiss in
flot coming to the rescue of farmers. It is basically a local
problem. It is not a situation that is prevalent in all parts
of Saskatchewan. It might be argued by the federal minister that it is flot a national problem. The provincial government has kept its head in the sand.
An Hon. Senator: In the snow.

Hon. Mr'. Buckwold: The provincial government has so
much money that it does flot know what to do with it.
Saskatchewan is flot longer a have-not province-although
when one looks at the equalization payments one might
think it stili is. The new budget is unbelievable having
regard to the way the goverfiment is spending money. Yet,
as to rescuing those in the area of southern Saskatchewan
to which Senator Argue referred, one hears flot a peep out
of the provincial goverfiment. I suggest that the real responsibility is theirs, but that does flot minimize the responsibility of the federal Minister of Agriculture to
become jnvolved in the situation.
My second point is that I believe the prices indicated by
Senator Argue in no way represent failure of the federal
government's program in granting a seven-cent premium
payment as a subsidy to cattie owners and feeders. This
matter has flot yet been discussed in the House, and I
thought that Senator Argue might touch upon it. On a
national scale it is a much broader problem than the
localized problem concerning shortage of f eed.
The cattie industry is in real trouble. The federal goverfiment has flot had enough good marks given it. It has
received nothing but criticism. The fact is that the goverfiment acted quickly in response to a real emergency. The
fact is that the cattle industry was being bankrupted by
low-price imports from the United States. That situation, I
arn told, is now levelling off.
*(1720)

The price of cattle in Canada, we should know, is basically set in Omaha, Nebraska. If they have a surplus of
cattle which their own market cannot absorb, that surplus
is shipped to Canada. That is where the price of cattle in
Canada is being set. It has been a very sof t market. We
have a good many overweight cattle coming into Canada
and we are buying them here at relatively low prices. The
drop in price to 35 or 37 cents a pound on the hoof, to
which Senator Argue referred earlier, could represent, I
suppose, a local situation resulting from cattle being f airly
lean because of the feed shortage. I would not want the
impression lef t that the bottom has suddenly dropped out
of the market simply because the price has dropped 7 cents
per pound, and that the government has seen fit to subsidize the industry.
We have a long way to go in settling this problem. I f eel
that the attention of this house should be drawn to the
prompt action taken by the Minister of Agriculture, thereby relieving a difficult situation facing cattle raisers and
cattle feeders in this country.
Hon. Mr'. Argue: Honourable senators, I do flot intend to
make a further speech at this time, but I would like an
opportunity to, make a f ew remarks in response to the
points raised by Senator Buckwold. I agree with him that
the Government of Saskatchewan has not done a damn
thing. You cannot get them moving at all. The primary
jurisdiction is theirs. However, f rom what I read in the
newspapers, precisely the same situation applies in the
province of Manitoba. If Mr. Whelan takes the leadership,
I think he can smoke them out and get them to start
exercising their responsibilities. It is for that reason that I
brought it forward in the manner I did.

SENATE DEBATES
Senator Buckwold has said that he does not want it felt
that the bottom has suddenly dropped out of the market.
Well, that is exactly what has happened. Suddenly the
bottom has dropped out. On the Assiniboia market two
weeks ago cattle were selling at 44 cents per pound; now
the price is 37 cents per pound.
My view-and I have voiced this publicly-is that this
payment should not go to the packers. The packers are
gobbling it up; they are stealing it; they have failed to pass
it on to the producers. In my view, the payments should go
directly to the producer himself outside the market, and
separate from the market. If that were done, I do not think
it would have this depressing effect.
The shocking thing to me-and I must admit, I do not
understand the economics of it-is that when the federal
government announced that it would pay the farmer 7
cents per pound more, the market went down. The only
reason anyone can figure out as to why it went down is
that the packers said, "If the market goes down 4 cents a
pound we will split the 7 cents; we will take 4 cents
ourselves and pass on only 3 cents to the producers."
Honourable senators, that is precisely what they have
been doing, or something very close to it. The Assiniboia
market demonstrates that at least in that market the
packers want it all. That is one hell of a situation. The
minister well knows about it; he understands it. He is
getting pretty desperate. He does not know whether to
keep on fighting in an effort to get these payments to the
producers, or throw up his hands. I hope he keeps on
fighting. Perhaps he should take a leaf out of the Honourable Jean Marchand's book and tell the packers that if
they do not pass the payment to the producers he will
nationalize them. That position got some action in moving
grain. The CPR says now that it can move grain. All of a
sudden they had a conversion. I would suggest that if the
packers do not pass on the subsidy to the producers, public
money put there for the producers, then the government
would be justified in suggesting that the packing industry
be nationalized.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Senator McGrand, bill referred to the
Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture.

March 28, 1974

He said: Honourable senators, if the Senate adopts this
motion it will enable the committee to hear the Minister of
Agriculture at a meeting which we have tentatively scheduled for Tuesday next at 10 a.m.
Motion agreed to.
ADJOURNMENT
Hon. Leopold Langlois: Honourable senators, with leave
of the Senate and notwithstanding rule 45(l)(g), I move
that when the Senate adjourns today it do stand
adjourned until Tuesday, April 2, at 8 o'clock in the
evening.
Honourable senators, before the question is put I should
like to give a brief outline of our program of work for next
week. In addition to the uncompleted items presently on
our order paper, it is expected that we will receive a bill
from the House of Commons to extend the Veterans' Land
Act, and perhaps one or two other public bills. Also, we
will be receiving Bill C-264, which is a private member's
bill having to do with the Eastern Canada Synod of the
Lutheran Church in America. That bill will be sponsored
in this house by Senator Forsey.
There are a number of committees scheduled for next
week and some consideration might be given to devoting
Wednesday next to committees only in order to enable the
committees to discharge their heavy workload.
*

(1730)

The Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture will
meet on Tuesday. The Standing Senate Committees on
Foreign Affairs, on Banking, Trade and Commerce, and on
National Finance are expected to meet on Wednesday. The
Standing Senate Committees on National Finance, on
Transport and Communications, and on Health, Welfare
and Science have reserved meeting rooms for Thursday.
Bill S-3 has been referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Transport and Communications, which has already
held one meeting on it. That bill will be before the committee again on Thursday next, when it is expected that a
number of witnesses will appear. It is hoped that Bills S-2
and S-4 will also be before the committee next week.
This is what we can anticipate for next week. Our work
load will be heavy, as you can see.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: We can carry it.
Motion agreed to.

NEWFOUNDLAND
TWENTY-FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF UNION WITH CANADA

Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, had the Senate
been sitting yesterday I would have risen to note that
Newfoundland was, on April 1, celebrating its twenty-fifth
anniversary as a province in our Confederation. I am sure
I speak for all when I join with the Prime Minister in
offering congratulations to the government and the people
of Newfoundland. It is apparent that Newfoundland is
happy to mark this occasion, and Canadians in all of the
other nine provinces rejoice in this anniversary event.
[Translation]
When the bell struck midnight on March 31, 1949, Newfoundland, the oldest settled colony in North America,
became the newest province of Canada. We realized then
the full meaning of a country stretching a Mari Usque Ad
Mare.
[English]
No one will deny the great progress that has been made
in Newfoundland in this quarter of a century. Newfoundland has grown, as Canada herself has prospered. To
senators from Newfoundland in particular, I should like to
acknowledge the contribution that Newfoundlanders
themselves have made to Canada. Newfoundland has great
traditions. Its culture is old and distinctive. The sea has
given it a spirit of independence and has encouraged the
talents of its people, and this has enriched Canada itself.
Newfoundlanders are strongly committed to Confederation. They contribute to national unity. They demonstrate
that this can be done as they maintain their own individuality and remain loyal to their unique heritage. A free
society should welcome these qualities, and we in Canada
do.
It is the intention of the government to underline the
contribution of Newfoundland to Canada when the governrment holds a federal cabinet meeting in St. John's on
June 24 next.
Our country, resolutely, is developing as a strong and
fortunate nation. This anniversary event gives the opportunity not only to make our association with Newfoundland more meaningful and increasingly so but to note the
strength and the vitality of Canada itself.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, I wish to
join with the Government Leader in underlining this
event of historic significance. On March 31, 1949, Newfoundland became the tenth Canadian province. A project
that had been commenced by the Fathers of Confederation
over a hundred years ago was finally completed. As the

Leader of the Government has underlined, the dream of a
Canada a mnri usque ad mure had been realized.
For twenty-five years now we have had the privilege of
referring to Newfoundlanders as Canadians. I say we have
had "the privilege," because I sincerely believe that we
have profited significantly from their having joined us.
They have made to our cultural mosaic a very distinct
contribution. Their view of life, characterized as it is by
their strong independent spirit was, when we were first
exposed to it, and continues to be now, refreshing and
stimulating. It took them a while to join us. They had to
make sure that we measured up, but once having joined
they proceeded to make up for lost time.
*

(2010)

Newfoundlanders have demonstrated in the years since
they became Canadians a praiseworthy degree of patriotism and dedication to the cause of making Canada great.
They have laboured unselfishly and tirelessly. They have
not been a burden on Canada. They have been an asset to
it. Canada is the better for their being Canadians.
But Newfoundlanders are not only Canadians; they are
"Newfies," a proud, determined, individualistic people
with a unique heritage, an inspired vision and the guts to
make the impossible come true.
[Translation]
Honourable senators, as I have said in English, our
friends the Newfoundlanders waited 72 years before
deciding to join Canada.
They assessed our experience and what Canada had to
offer. It was a rational decision on their part to join this
country, although the population was 30 per cent French
Canadian.
Indeed, there has always been a great deal of understanding, agreement and co-operation between the French
Canadians and the Newfoundlanders.
[English]
As the "Newfies" would have it, praise the day we
decided to join them.
Hon. Lionel Choquette: Honourable senators, I should
like to ask a question of the Leader of the Government
with respect to this matter.
We all know there will be great festivities in Newfoundland to celebrate the 25th anniversary of their joining
Confederation. In that respect I have read certain editorials in newspapers of that province, and of other provinces,
to the effect that the Prime Minister has been invited to
participate in those festivities, but has turned down the
invitation. Comments have been made to the effect that
the Prime Minister has been travelling not only throughout Canada but throughout the world, and those commenting find it strange-most strange, as a matter of fact-that
the Prime Minister cannot find time to attend the festivities in Newfoundland.

April 2, 1.974

SENATE DEBATES

The question I put to the Leader of the Government is
this: Will he, or some other member of the Cabinet, go to
Newfoundland to represent Canada in those festivities?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, Mr. Jamieson,
the minister in the federal Cabinet from Newfoundland,
represented the Prime Minister and the Government of
Canada last night at the official dinner in St. John's.
The Prime Minister yesterday in the House of Commons
made a statement about the fact that the anniversary is a
matter of considerable significance, and indicated that not
only he but all the members of his Cabinet would mark
the event on June 24 next, at which time there would be a
meeting of the Cabinet in St. John's expressly for that
purpose.
I am sure that Senator Choquette, who has a sense of
fitness in these matters, would not want to suggest that
there was any effort by the Prime Minister to avoid
joining with all Canadians in marking the importance of
this anniversary.
Hon. Eric Cook: Honourable senators, as a Newfoundlander I should like to thank both leaders in the Senate for
expressing their most kind and generous sentiments.
I feel sure that all Newfoundlanders are happy-indeed,
very happy-to have become Canadians.
Hon. Frederick William Rowe: Honourable senators, I
should like to align myself with Senator Cook's brief
expression of appreciation and thanks, and perhaps elaborate for a moment or two because when the fiftieth anniversary rolls around, it is possible that all of us who are
here tonight will not be here then.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I am very much afraid.
Hon. Mr. Rowe: Honourable senators, this celebration
has great significance for me, because I was a vice-president of the organization, the Newfoundland Confederate
Association, which fought the campaign to join Canada
and which was successful. There were times, of course, in
view of the hostility and the deep division that that
struggle created in Newfoundland, when we had to examine our consciences, and when we wondered whether we
were doing the right thing. In retrospect, over 25 years, my
conscience is clean and clear, and I feel that we did do the
right thing.
We, that is Newfoundland, benefited from joining the
relatively great Canadian community. We have benefited
in many ways. We benefited first of all, and most notably,
perhaps, in acquiring our great social services. I am sure
that it must be very gratifying for the Leader of the
Government in the Senate to remember that it was he who
had the opportunity and the pleasure, as Canada's great
Minister of National Health and Welfare, of signing the
initial Welfare agreements with Newfoundland and,
indeed, of presiding over the various negotiations which
extended to Newfoundland those social services which,
perhaps, were foremost in the whole civilized world.
We benefited in other ways, too. We benefited in the
great shared-cost programs, such as the building of highways. We benefited from the more recent regional disparity programs which have done so much to alleviate and

change the circumstances that were keeping Newfoundland back, and other parts of Canada as well.
Most of all, and this is the argument which I used at that
time, and which I think was a valid one, we benefited in
the form of insurance by tying ourselves to a great nation.
We were, to some extent, insuring ourselves against a
repetition of what happened to us in the 1930s, and I
cannot help thinking that if some of the other provinces of
Canada-the western provinces, for example-had not
been a part of a great Canadian nation in those 1930s, their
lot would have been much more serious than it was-bad
as it was at that time.
We like to think, of course, that Canada benefited from
that union, too. We like to think that we gave to Canada
some of the great resources of the world. We are surrounded by the richest fisheries in the world; these are now
Canadian; they belong to Canada. It surely also must be of
some significance that the single greatest mining operation on the face of the earth is now in Canada, and it is in
Canada because Newfoundland joined Canada. I am referring, of course, to the multi-billion dollar mining operations in Labrador West.
We also brought our forests and our valuable paper mills
into Canada. We brought our tremendous water power
resources, and our strategic position, which is becoming
more important and more significant in the light of developing trade patterns. I am not thinking of our strategic
position in a military sense, although that was important
at one time and could become important again. Let us
hope that day will never come. But our position is certainly strategic from the standpoint of international trade, and
commercial and industrial development. Our great deepwater ports are already being utilized, and let us make no
mistake about it, honourable senators, they will be utilized
in the next 25 years in a way that we cannot even visualize
at this moment.
*

(2020)

Finally, honourable senators, we brought to Canada, or
at least I like to think we did, over 440,000 people who, we
hope, are helping to enrich Canadian life and culture.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Paul Desruisseaux: Honourable senators, if I rise
at this stage it is because I had the privilege to spend some
nine months in Newfoundland about two years before the
union of that province with Canada. It was my privilege to
discover the warmth and kindness of those good people
who during the war years were struggling in the real sense
of the word and helping Canada as much as they could.
There was at that time some question as to the possibility
of their joining with the United States of America-we
heard about that here and there, as you will remember,
senator-but never did Newfoundlanders fail Canada in
their evaluation of what should come to be. Therefore, it is
with joy that I join in the celebrations that will take place.
Not only bas Newfoundland acquired something from this
union; Canada has acquired some of the best people in the
world.

April 2, 1974

SENATE DEBATES
VETERANS' LAND ACT
BILL TO AMEND-FIRST READING

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate that a message had been received from the House of Commons with
Bill C-17, to amend the Veterans' Land Act.
Bill read first time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this bill be read the second time?
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senatorsHon. Mr. Flynn: Are you moving second reading?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): No. I was just about
to give an explanation of a motion that I should like to
make. This bill provides for an extension of the deadline
for qualification of veterans to come under the provisions
of the Veterans' Land Act. The date of expiry of a section
of that act was 31 March 1974, and this amendment passed
the House of Commons on March 28. It has been suggested
that we should have dealt with it sooner, and because we
are now beyond the deadline I intended to move with
leave, that is to say if it is agreeable to have unanimous
consent of the Senate, that we have second reading at this
time. In fact, I so move.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: May I put the motion first,
senator?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Well, Madam Speaker, it depends on
the motion you are going to put. I understood Senator
Connolly to ask for leave, and it is on the question of leave
that I should like to hear from the Government Leader as
to whether he considers it essential that this bill be read
the second time tonight and, furthermore, as to when he
would feel it necessary for this bill to receive royal assent.
I shall have other comments to make after the leader has
replied to this question.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Subject to our deliberation here, I
would hope that we might be able to arrange for royal
assent tomorrow. I spoke in this sense to the Leader of the
House of Commons this afternoon.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, I thank the
Leader of the Government for this answer, which substantiates my opinion that there is no real urgency about this
bill. There is no question of this bill's having to pass today
or tomorrow. No one entitled to benefit will be prevented
from so doing even if the bill does not receive royal assent
before Thursday.
I wish to mention at this time that there was an incident
in the other place which I think should concern all senators. It was suggested there that the Senate should have
been on hand last Friday to deal with this bill, pass it and
arrange for royal assent to be given on that day. The
answer the Leader of the Government has just given to
my question makes it quite obvious that this was not
necessary. There was, and is, no urgency about this bill. I
understand that the act, which would have expired on
March 31, is continued for a certain period. However, it is
not a matter of two or three days that makes any difference as far as the veterans who will benefit from the
extension are concerned. They may file their applications,
and they have done so.
[Hon. Mr. Desruisseauxj

Before dealing with the question of the leave asked by
the sponsor of the bill, however, I wish to draw attention
to the way in which in the other place a notorious opponent of this body, a proponent of its abolition, was permitted to speak about the Senate. It is quite obvious that
under the rules of the House of Commons such comments
as were made about this chamber, entirely unwarranted as
they were, should have been prohibited. I am not being
critical of the Speaker in the other place for having permitted the honourable member for Winnipeg North Centre-of course, I should not have to mention his constituency; everyone knows him here-to speak in such terms.
I suggest, however, that, if, in the other place, they were to
observe their rules more closely, it would be much easier
for us to observe ours.
I therefore suggest to Madam Speaker that she meet
with the Speaker of the other place to arrange for the
prevention of a repetition of such an incident. If the
members of the other place are permitted to voice criticism of the manner in which we deal with bills here, then
they will have to expect that we will reserve to ourselves
the equal privilege of criticizing the manner in which they
deal with legislation.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I resent the accusation that was
levelled against us. It was ill-founded and contrary to
their rules. We will observe our rules if they will observe
theirs, but as far as I am concerned this attack was
entirely unjustified and should never have been allowed
without some mention being made of the fact that it
entailed a breach of the rules of that House.
This bill can be dealt with tonight, tomorrow, or on
Thursday, and no one will be hurt. I am willing to give
leave to the sponsor of the bill to present it for second
reading tonight, if this will accommodate him. But I will
insist that the debate be adjourned until tomorrow, since
the Leader of the Government has said there will not be
royal assent tonight. The Opposition will reply at that
time. No one will be denied anything to which he is
entitled. There is obviously no need for this bill to be
referred to a committee. It can be read the second time
tomorrow and probably the third time on Thursday. I
re-emphasize, supported by Senator Martin, that there is
no rush.
a (2030)

And again, I protest the way in which this matter was
dealt with in the other place. I repeat my request to you,
Madam Speaker, that you get in touch with the Speaker of
the other place in order to ensure that such incidents are
not permitted to recur.
The Hon. the Speaker:
agreed?

Honourable

senators,

is

it

Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, I am sure that
we are all in agreement with what the Leader of the
Opposition has said. None of us, in either the Senate or the
House of Commons, should forget that both houses were
established under the Constitution of Canada, and they
represent two of the constituent parts of our parliamentary structure. Whatever anyone might say, in either the

April 2, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

House of Commons or the Senate, the fact remains that
under our Constitution the process of enacting legislation
depends upon passage by both Houses of Parliament. It
has long been established that it is not in the interests of
Parliament that one house should engage in criticism of
the other.
I shall confine my observation to that fact, which has
been well established by members of both the Senate and
the House of Commons, as well as by members of both
houses in the United Kingdom Parliament from which we
derive our origin and inspiration.
The facts of this matter are as Senator Flynn stated. The
particular benefits under the act expired on March 31, and
the essential purpose of the bill, on which Senator Connolly is about to speak, is to extend the date for the making of
application for those benefits.
On Thursday last the Senate was engaged in an unusually long sitting involving consideration of the appropriation bills. It had been arranged that royal assent would
take place at 5.45 p.m. About an hour before that time,
intimation was received from the House of Commons that
it might pass the Veterans' Land Act amendment bill, and
we were asked whether we would be prepared to deal with
it.
I pointed out the Senate's 48-hour rule which, if
observed, would not permit the Senate an opportunity of
considering the bill before the following week. I
explained, however, that I would speak to the Acting
Leader of the Opposition-Senator Flynn was unavoidably absent at that moment-and Senator Choquette said
that he would co-operate fully.
Before we adjourned, I was told that the bill could not
possibly be passed by the House of Commons that evening.
When I learned that the bill had, in fact, been passed on
Thursday evening, I pointed out to the Deputy Minister of
Veterans Affairs the implications which Senator Flynn
has mentioned-and, indeed, which Senator Buckwold
stated when giving an assurance in reply to a question put
to him by Senator Grosart. This was well known in the
House itself, because the member in question acknowledged that no veteran would lose a grant because of this
delay of two or three days. There was no doubt about the
legal implications in either the Senate or the House of
Commons. In addition, we were informed by the law
officer of the House of Commons as to his understanding
of the implications of the measure-namely, that no veteran would suffer.
I hope that my remarks will bring this incident to a
close, and that our comments will serve as a reminder that
Parliament works best when each house observes its own
functions and regards itself the custodian of its practices.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Hazen Argue: Honourable senators, this debate
has been brought about following Senator Conolly's
request that leave be given at this time to proceed with
second reading of this bill. Senator Martin was then asked
whether any veterans would suffer as a result of the time
being taken to deal with this measure.
I want to associate myself with the remarks made by the
Leader of the Opposition and other senators in criticizing
and condemning this kind of attack on the Senate on a

so-called point of order. I would suggest that not only is
this attack unwarranted under the rules, but also from the
standpoint of the welf are of the veterans of this country.
Sorne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Argue: No veteran would suffer as a result of
the Senate's taking whatever time it feels is required to
thoroughly deal with this legislation. In addition, I would
point out that if we do an outstanding job and are able to
make some improvements to the legislation, then that will
be of additional help to the veterans of this country.
Further, not only will no veteran be hurt as a result of a
two- or three-day delay in the passage of this legislation,
but, as it was pointed out in the evidence given by off icials
before the Veterans Affairs Committee of the House of
Commons some days ago, even without this legislation,
even without an extension of this act for another year, the
authorities have two months' work on applications already
before them. In other words, it would be two months
before they could even get to a single new application
resulting from the extension of the act.
Honourable senators, as I say, a two- or three-day delay
will not prejudice any veteran. For that matter, nothing
adverse would take place because of a delay of an additional number of days. The Senate should take the
necessary time required if it feels it can make a valuable
contribution in its consideration of this legislation. Our
veterans are interested in the extension; they are interested in some important amendments which would allow
them to make applications now, notwithstanding the deadline of 1968. They are asking for a reduction in the amount
of land required for a small holding, as well as for
improvements in benefits.
Again, I repeat, no veteran will suffer as a result of the
Senate's doing its job. We have a duty to do our job, and if
we do it well it cannot help but assist the veterans in their
just request to the Parliament of Canada.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators, it might be
well to point out for the record that when this matter was
before us on Thursday last I asked whether "there will be
an assurance on the part of the government that no veteran will suffer any disability because of that fact." And the
fact I was referring to, of course, was that the bill was not
coming before us on Thursday, and that we were not
sitting on Friday.
I might point out, in reference to the criticism that was
made of the action taken by the Senate-and in deference
to our rules, I will not say where the criticism was madethe person who made it, who is a well-known opponent of
the Senate, did say, "No veteran will lose a grant because
of this delay of two or three days." That statement was
incorporated in the criticism made. I suggest that apart
from the propriety under the rules of the other place of
that statement being permitted, it is very clear from the
statement that the concern was not for the veterans, but
merely another opportunity taken by a certain person to
carry on a childish feud against the existence of this
chamber.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
*

(2040)

Hon. Sydney L. Buckwold: Honourable senators, I want
to add a brief comment to what has been said tonight. I

SENATE DEBATES
indicated to this house on Thursday that during the late
afternoon I had been in communication on two occasions
with the parliamentary secretary to the President of the
Privy Council in order to find out how this bill was
moving through the other place. The reason I rise now is
to pass on what I said to him, certainly with the authority
of the Leader of the Government. I told him that the
Senate was prepared to cooperate in any way it could to
facilitate the passage of this bill, and that senators were
anxiously waiting for it to come from the House of Commons. That appeared to be well received by this gentleman, who indicated that he was not sure of how the bill
would progress because an amendment was going to be
moved, and there was no indication of the exact time at
which it might be passed.
I assure honourable senators that an expression of complete cooperation was extended to the other place on
behalf of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Might I ask Senator Connolly (Ottawa
West) whether he is still asking for leave to proceed
tonight?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): It would be a convenience to me if I could explain it tonight, before I forget
it!

SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this bill be read the second time?
Hon. John J. Connolly moved, with leave of the Senate
and notwithstanding rule 44(1)(f), that the bill be read
the second time now.
He said: Honourable senators, Senator Flynn may or
may not be privy to the fact that I was not asked to move
second reading until 3.30 this afternoon, and I did not start
making preparations to do so until 5 o'clock. I am afraid
that if I wait overnight I might forget everything I have
learned-and that may not be very much.
This bill amends the Veterans' Land Act, Revised Statutes of Canada 1972, Chapter V-4. It is short and easily
understood. However, it seems to me appropriate that, as
sponsor, I should present the bill in the context of the
Veterans' Land Act.
The original act, as honourable senators will know, was
passed in 1942 as part of the Veterans' Charter, which
Parliament adopted to help those who had served in both
World War II and the Korean War to get re-established
after their wartime service. I think this was bi-partisan
policy. It can be said that the Veterans' Charter of Canada
was the outstanding veterans' charter of any belligerent
country in the world.
The purpose of the act was to assist veterans from those
two wars to settle on the land as either full-time or
part-time farmers, and it was extended to assist also veterans who desired to become commercial fishermen. The
original loan ceiling imposed at the time the act was
passed, about mid-way through the war, was $4,800. An
idea of what inflation has done, and how prices and
economic conditions have changed in the country may be
gathered when it is realized that today the ceiling on loans
for the full-time farmer is $40,000, and for the small farmer
[Hon. Mr. Buckwold.]

April 2, 1974

and commercial fishermen, it is $15,400. Under the original
legislation the repayment term was 25 years, and that has
been extended by amendment to 30 years.
Originally it was intended that the money should be
used by veterans to buy land, buildings, equipment and
some livestock to enable them to get settled on the land
they proposed to purchase. The money can now be expended on a much broader basis. It can be used to improve
land, and to improve the farm enterprise the veteran is
conducting. It can be used for non-farm secondary enterprises, such as the establishment of a retail outlet for the
farmer's or fisherman's production and perhaps even to
run school buses in the area in which the veteran might
live. It can even be used for trailer parks, beaches, amusement places and things like that, if the land upon which
the veteran has settled lends itself to such use.
Since the legislation came into effect in 1942, disbursements under the act have exceeded $114 billion. In 1973-74,
the past fiscal year, about $65 million was disbursed in
new or additional loans, and some $80,000 in principal and
interest was taken in by the administration as repayment
on loans. Since this program came into being, 140,000
veterans have been helped, and this I am told is some 13
per cent of enlistments in our armed forces in World War
II and the Korean War.
In recent years there has been an increase in the interest
shown by veterans in applying for benefits under the act.
In the fiscal year 1972-73, 5,300 loans were made, 2,000 of
which were additions to existing loans with the remainder
being new loans. In 1973-74, the fiscal year just ended, it is
expected that about 7,500 new loans and additions to loans
will have been made. The outstanding capital investment
that the administration has in lands acquired by veterans
under the program now amounts to $535 million. These
investments are in 10,000 large farm accounts and 50,000
accounts for small holdings and commercial fishermen.
Let me now say a word about the qualifications necessary to enable a veteran to get a loan under the legislation.
A certificate from the director is required, and over 300,000
such certificates have been issued. The cut-off date-I
shall speak about the reason for this in a moment-for
qualification to take advantage of the provisions of the
legislation is set in section 31 of the mother act as October
31, 1968. At that date, 140,000 certificates of qualification
had been issued, and not used; approximately 140,000 had
been issued, and used. The difference, which is about
20,000, is probably explained by the fact that some veterans took alternative benefits under other legislation, and
soine, although qualified, simply did not proceed with an
application for a loan under this act.

e

(2050)

Honourable senators, let me speak to the terminal date
for qualification of a veteran to apply for a loan, which, as
I said, is October 31, 1968. In 1942 when the act was
originally passed, it had an open end. There was no date
set before which a veteran must apply and qualify for a
loan. In 1959 a terminal date for the first time was set, and
it was set, to reduce it to simple language, at September 30,
1962, or a date not later than 15 years from the date of the
veteran's discharge from the forces. In 1962 the act was
amended again, and the terminal date was extended at
that time to October 31, 1968.

April 2, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

I am advised that each time a terminal date, before
which a veteran must qualify, was set it was well advertised by the administration in the newspapers, in posters
in post offices, and in veteran's organizations and their
publications.
In 1965 a further amendment was passed by Parliament
and a terminal date of March 31, 1974 was set for the
application for new loans from qualified veterans. For
additional loans the terminal date was fixed at March 31,
1977. I think honourable senators will understand that
when I talk about additional loans I am referring to the
case of a veteran who has made an application for a loan,
obtained his money, made some repayments, and who then
has found that he needs more money for further improvement and additions to his enterprise, his property, or his
farm. Such a veteran can apply for additional money
under such circumstances.
Honourable senators, I have one or two other esoteric
pieces of information that may be of interest. In 1971 it
was found by the veterans' administration that there were
2,600 veterans remaining in the armed services who might
qualify for a certificate and a loan under the Veterans'
Land Act. Some of those 2,600 had, of course, taken advantage of the provisions of the act, had received loans, and
had acquired property as a result. I should point out also
that any qualified veteran who obtained a certificate
before October 31, 1968, whether he is in the service or is
discharged, is eligible for assistance under the program.
I think the interest rates will be of interest to honourable senators. Under Part I of the act, for the first $6,000 of
loan the rate is 3/2 per cent. That Part I deals with land
settlement. Under Part III, the farm improvement assistance section, the rate at the present time is 7 per cent. The
rate is the current rate under the Farm Credit Act. I
understand, however, that as of April 1, 1974 that rate is
increased to 8¼ per cent. Of course, the initial rate on the
first $6,000 is a much lower rate than the current rate, and
perhaps that is one of the very attractive features of the
program to veterans at this time when the rates of interest
are so high. Even the 7 per cent or the 81/ per cent rates
are below current market rates.
The down payment required from a veteran in order to
obtain a loan under the act is, in the case of land settlement, 10 per cent of the amount of the loan. If a veteran
applies for a loan of $10,000, then $1,000 is required from
him as a down payment on the property that is going to be
security for the loan. Under the farm improvement assistance section, Part III, a down payment of 25 per cent of the
amount of the loan is required, and in the case of small
holdings it is about 15 per cent.
Honourable senators, having explained the background
and the history of the legislation, may I deal briefly with
this brief bill? The bill extends for one year, to March 31,
1975, the time for qualified veterans to submit an application for a loan. Under the present legislation that time
expired on March 31, 1974.
There is a proviso in the bill, however. This was moved
by way of amendment in the other placeHon. Mr. Flynn: By whom?

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I leave it to the
honourable senator's own imagination to decide. I do not
think names should be mentioned here.
Hon. Mr. Cook: It is a quite imaginative clause.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): It is imaginative
only in the sense that it has been copied from one or other
pieces of fiscal legislation. The provision is that after
September 30, 1974, if 20 members of the House of Commons append their names to it, a motion can be placed
before that house, and it must be heard within 15 days.
The purpose of the motion is to have the minister review
the terminal date for loans, which will now be March 31,
1975. If the motion is approved, then the minister must in
fact review the terminal date and report to the house
within 15 days whether he has decided to further extend
the terminal date for applications for loans.
It is obvious from Hansard of the other place that some
members would have liked to move amendments to the
bill. I direct these remarks particularly to Senator Argue,
because he spoke about improving the bill and making
amendments. Two amendments were thought desirable,
although the motions for amendment were not made. It
was thought that the government should have provided in
the bill a section to reduce the minimum size of the
smallholding. The minimum size of the smallholding
under the legislation as it exists now is about half an acre,
and 20 per cent less in certain circumstances. To buy half
an acre of land today, particularly in the environs of some
of the larger communities, would cost a great deal more
than it would have cost when this legislation was originally passed. Perhaps I should add as a footnote to this part
of my remarks that disabled veterans are allowed to make
application for a smallholding of only 50 per cent of the
prescribed one-half acre. In other words, a disabled veteran can apply for a loan on a holding of a quarter of an
acre, or even less.
0 (2100)

Some of the Opposition also thought that this bill should
increase the ceilings on the loans. The reason given was
that the amounts-$40,000 for a farm and $15,400 for a
smallholding or commercial fishing-are unrealistic in
today's high-priced market.
The reason why these amendments were not moved is
that the bill arose from a recommendation from the Governor General and amendments which have financial
implications would be out of order in the other house.
Indeed, I should think that the same rule would bind us
here if we were to increase the impost on the treasury,
which would be the effect of amendments of this kind.
So the House of Commons settled for the review procedure which I have described. However, the opposition
there-and I am sure not only the opposition but the
government benches as well-have promised that they
will urge the government to go further with this legislation in another year, or perhaps sooner, with a view to
reducing the minimum size of a smallholding, and increasing the ceilings on loans. I should say that a program of
that kind could be urged, but I think only after a study of
the f inancial implications involved.
Honourable senators, I think this legislation has
through the years proved to be very helpful to veterans.

SENATE DEBATES

As I said at the beginning, the Canadian Veterans' Charter
is one of the best bodies of legislation for veterans enacted
by any country in the world. The benefits and amenities
for veterans were improved recently. For example, the
disability grants in the last fiscal year have been increased
by 24 per cent, and I am told that the cost of that has been
some $54 million. The war veterans allowances have been
increased to a total cost of $17 million.
I have said probably more than enough with reference to
this measure, honourable senators. Senator Flynn suggested that the debate is to be adjourned, and I have no
objection whatever to that or to the suggestion that it
might not be necessary to send the bill to committee. I
have no firm views either way. Whatever is satisfactory to
honourable senators in that respect is satisfactory to me,
but if it is desired to send the bill to committee then the
appropriate committee, in my opinion, would be the
Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and
Science. If the bill receives second reading, and if it is the
wish of honourable senators that it be referred to committee, I shall make the appropriate motion at that time.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, I shall say
only a few words, and then leave it to my colleague
Senator Beaubien to deal with the substance of the bill.
Senator Connolly has given us a good and sufficient
explanation of the bill. With reference to his remark that
any amendments to the bill, such as those suggested by
Senator Argue, would be out of order, I believe he is right
in that respect. Therefore, no useful purpose would be
served in sending the bill to committee, because the only
relevant matter in the bill is the extension of its provisions for a certain period.
I was rather amused, however, by the fact that Senator
Connolly's comments about the amendments were coupled
with comments on the review provision inserted in this
bill in paragraph 3(f) of clause 1, which, as he mentioned,
closely resembles a provision in another bill which
decreased the corporate taxes for certain corporations
involved in manufacturing and otherwise. But there is a
substantial difference, because in this bill the minister is
obliged to review the legislation and give Parliament his
views with respect to the way in which the legislation
shoula be amended, if at all. In respect of the amendments
to the Income Tax Act of last session the government, in
effect, saîd, "You tell us in what way you want the legislation amended, and we will accede to your demands."
They have been able to resist that sort of approach in
this bill. But it is still typical of a weak government that it
is not able to govern properly, and is willing to accept
being forced te act. This type of provision is something
that should never be found in a bill. This government is so
weak and so inept that all we can hope is that it will soon
screw up the courage to ask the people of Canada whether
or not they are still willing to live with this sort of
impotent federal administration.
It is an awful piece of legislation. Paragraph 3 is a
disaster. It is not as bad as what they wrote into the
Income Tax Act that I mentioned a few moments ago, but
it is typical of a government which, being unable to stand
on its own two feet, is compelled to say to Parliament, "If
you don't like the way we are legislating, tell us what we
should be doing." That was never the case in Canada
[Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West).]

April 2, 1974

before this government, and I hope that kind of legislation
will not continue to be placed on our statutes.
In any event, honourable senators, dealing with the
substance of this bill, I believe we are all in agreement
with the extensions. Certainly, there are many veterans
who have not been able yet to take advantage of the
legislation. These men should be granted a final extension
or, rather, a further extension. As for any future extensions, I think the government should have sufficient guts
to take the initiative with regard to that matter. It should,
when the extension provided for in this bill draws to an
end, decide for itself whether further extensions are warranted and, if so, how long they should be for.
Hon. Mr. Thompson: Honourable senators, I should like
to direct two questions to Senator Connolly now, in case
the bill does not go to committee. He might wish to refer
the questions to the department or to the minister.
My first question assumes that both men and women
who have served in the armed forces are equally entitled
to the benefits of this bill, and it is: If a man and a woman
who have both served in the armed forces get married, do
both of them receive individual benefits or do they receive
benefits only as a couple with the result that one of them
loses out on the benefits?
My second question is with respect to the men and
women who served in the armed forces for perhaps five
years, and who required only a year of education or technical training in order to get a job. There is an assumption
on the part of many of these people that because they
received another form of benefit, such as education or
technical training, they are not entitled to the Veterans'
Land Act benefits. I have heard that if such a veteran
were to pay back the cost of his education or technical
training he would then be eligible to apply for the benefits
under the Veterans' Land Act, and I should like to know if
that is correct.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I believe the answer
to the second question is yes, but I would like to get more
information in order to be sure about that. I will have that
information for Senator Thompson tomorrow.
The answer to the first question is, as Senator Mcllraith
has suggested to me, that it is hypothetical-at least, in
the way it was put. If they get married, I do not think each
of them would make an application for the same piece of
land, and if they made separate applications for different
pieces of land then I suppose they have two establishments. I will obtain some information on that question,
too.
*

(2110)

Hon. Mr. Thornpson: May I say that the question is not
hypothetical. It comes directly from that great province of
Alberta, and someone who has written to me to the effect
that his wife was in the WRENS and he was in the Navy,
and both of them feel that they are entitled to individual
benefits. His wife, under women's rights, feels that if they
get only the benefit of the husband, then she is being
denied her rightful benefits.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Certainly from the
point of view of the two of them having made up their
minds, they should be helped. In the second place, I am

sure they are worthy of help because they were both in
that great service, the navy. I will get that information.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: They deserve the very best.
On motion of Senator Beaubien, debate adjourned.

PRIVATE BILL
EASTERN CANADA SYNOD OF THE LUTHERAN CHURCH IN
AMERICA-FIRST READING
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate that a message had been received from the House of Commons with
Bill C-264, respecting the Eastern Canada Synod of the
Lutheran Church in America.

Bill read f irst time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this bill be read a second time?
Hon. Eugene A. Forsey: Honourable senators, with
leave of the Senate and notwithstanding rule 44(1) (f), I
should like to move that the bill be placed on the Orders of
the Day for second reading later this day. I have discussed
this matter with the Leader of the Opposition.
The Hon. the Speaker: With leave of the Senate, and
notwithstanding rule 44(1) (f), it is moved by the Honourable Senator Forsey, seconded by the Honourable Senator
Heath, that this bill be placed on the Orders of the Day for
second reading later this day.
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the
motion?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, I merely want to
point out that this being a private bill it has to be referred,
in any event, to committee; therefore there is no need for
debate at this stage.
Motion agreed to.

COMPETITION POLICY
BANKING, TRADE AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE AUTHORIZED
TO EXAMINE AND REPORT UPON COMPETITION LEGISLATION
The Senate resumed from Wednesday, March 27, the
adjourned debate on the motion of Senator Hayden that
the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and
Commerce be authorized to examine and report upon any
bill relating to competition in Canada or to the Combines
Investigation Act, in advance of the said bill coming
bef ore the Senate, or any matter relating thereto; and that
the committee have power to engage the services of such
counsel, staff and technical advisers as may be necessary
for the purpose of the said examination.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, I support
this motion, but I want to say that I support it with the
usual reserve. Our studying a bill before it officially
reaches us does not mean that the Senate, or even the
Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce, will be bound by the report which this committee
may make on the subject matter of this bill. This procedure, although it is rather unorthodox, is good, in the
sense that it is half way between our legislative responsibility and the responsibility which we have assumed over
the years in the field of investigation. We are in fact
investigating the merits of a problem which is facing the
government and Parliament. But we are not really dealing
with the bill, we are dealing with the problem and we are
trying to find out whether the proposed bill really meets
the situation. However, when the bill reaches us in its
final form, as far as the House of Commons is concerned,
then we are at liberty to deal with it as we would deal
with any other bill. We will have to see then which, if any,
of our Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee's recommendations have been incorporated into the bill as passed
by the other place and be guided accordingly. In essence,
what I am saying is that our studying the bill before it
comes to us does not replace the study we would give it as

SENATE DEBATES
a matter of course when we have the bill and put it
through committee stage.
But with regard to this kind of bill, of which the Senate
is eminently qualified to study the substance, I have here
before me an editorial from the FinancialTimes of Canada
of March 25, 1974, which I think underlines, in its fashion,
this very point. Writing about this bill it says:
The unfortunate result is that the House of Commons faces Bill C-7 with very little understanding of
its scope. Most MPs have a vague idea that it will
protect the consumer against misleading advertising
and other unfair trade practices. It is doubtful whether more than a handful of them have any awareness of
the sweeping discretionary powers which they are
asked to give to the Restrictive Trade Practices Commission. Few have contemplated the disruption which
the commission could cause in the distribution of
goods and services to the public.
The bugbear of Mr. Gray's bill is "an inadequate
degree of competition." The immediate danger is an
inadequate degree of comprehension about what Mr.
Gray proposes.
a (2120)

Now, I don't subscribe to all of this, but I suggest that
members of the other place are preoccupied more with
matters other than the technical aspects of the problem
dealt with in this bill. I suggest that our Banking, Trade
and Commerce Committee, being in a position to hear
witnesses and obtain briefs from people who are really
qualified to comment on and really concerned with the
substance of this legislation, can be very helpful to Parliament by undertaking the study provided for in Senator
Hayden's motion, and from this perspective and in this
light I support the motion.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, I rise simply to
say, as I have done on two other occasions when Senator
Flynn made somewhat similar observations, and quite
rightly so, that I thought it important that I, as a member
of the government, should make a brief comment. Of
course, Senator Flynn is right in saying that a pre-study of
a bill of this nature in no way interferes with the constitutional obligation of the Senate to deal with a bill that
originates in the House of Commons, whether it be a
government bill or otherwise. Senator Hayden gave us
valid reasons when he spoke last week in support of his
motion. We are all very much aware, as he reminded us, of
the pressures that attend upon the Senate during particular periods of its operations in relation to the business in
the other place, and the only way we can guarantee in
certain circumstances that we have examined particular
measures is in the way suggested by Senator Hayden in
his motion. The study of the subject matter of a bill in no
way, as Senator Flynn has pointed out, infringes upon our
obligations to deal with an actual bill covering the same
subject matter when it ultimately reaches the Senate. It is
at that time that we must deal with that particular bill, for
it is only then that we are legislatively seized of the
subject matter of the bill. But at such time we will have
had the advantage of the study carried out by the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce.
This committee, as Senator Flynn bas said, is particularly
qualified to deal with matters of this kind because of the
[Hon. Mr. Flynn.]

April 2, 1974

great experience of its members, and the experience of so
many other senators as well.
I certainly am not going to comment on the qualifications of members of the other house, particularly in view
of what I said earlier this evening when commenting on
what a member of that place had said about us. I can only
assume that they have competence-as they certainly had
when Senator Flynn and I were members of that house. I
am sure that situation continues.
I am sure that our committee will want to consider not
only what is reflected in the editorial Senator Flynn has
read, but also the other side as reflected in the Financial
Post, a journal with similar interests to those of the Financial Times. The Senate will want to examine this bill, not
from any one point of view but from all points of view. I
can further say that the minister in charge of this bill, as
the committee will learn if it does not already know, is a
man of exceptional ability and great experience in the
particular type of legislation he will be introducing. I am
sure that he and his officials will give every cooperation to
our committee in this matter. I agree to the conditions laid
down by Senator Flynn.
Motion agreed to.

CRIMINAL CODE (CONTROL OF WEAPONS AND
FIREARMS)
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Donald Carneron moved the second reading of Bill
S-4, to amend the Criminal Code (control of weapons and
firearms).
He said: Honourable senators, by way of introduction
may I associate myself with all that has been said in
welcoming our new colleagues to the Senate in this session
of Parliament. Senators Robichaud and Perrault have
made a very auspicious beginning by the competent
manner in which they moved and seconded the motion for
an Address in reply to the Speech from the Throne. I am
sure we can look forward to many more valuable contributions from them.
I should like also to join with my colleagues in the
well-deserved compliments paid to our gracious and
esteemed Speaker, who has brought distinction to that
high office and who has discharged her responsibilities
with a graciousness we have not seen in a long time.
Honourable senators, in introducing Bill S-4 this
evening, I should say that this is a re-introduction of Bill
S-2, which died on the Order Paper last year. It is in
exactly the same form. It is interesting to note that the bill
presented last year generated a surprising amount of correspondence and discussion. There was an excellent
debate in the Senate in which many senators took part and
made fine contributions to what has become an increasingly important topic.
What I had not expected, in sponsoring this bill, was the
heavy correspondence which resulted. Hundreds of letters
came in from individuals, members of gun clubs, shooting
associations, gun collectors, wildlife associations, and so
on. Many of the letters were of a very emotional nature
and often were critical of me, of the Senate, of the
government, and of the bureaucrats. When that bill was

April 2, 1974
April 2,1974

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

introduced and debated, some individuals and organizations mounted a vigorous campaign attacking the very
idea of any form of gun control, claiming, quite wrongly,
that the bill would have the effect of legislating out of
existence the legitimate sportsmen and hunters, members
of gun clubs, rifle clubs, pistol clubs, gun collectors, and so
on. Some of the letters, and some of the information put
out by what I call the "gun lobby," and an organization
called FARO, which means Firearms and Responsible
Ownership, presented the worst distortion of the facts I
have seen in 18 years in the Senate. Interestingly enough,
in the period through March, April, May and June of 1973,
80 per cent of the letters were very critical of the bill and
20 per cent were favourable.
0 (2130)

It is interesting, however, that from July through the
remaining months of 1973 and in early 1974, continuing up
to the present time, there bas been a very marked change
in the tenor of the letters coming in. In these months the
attitude, the expression, has almost been completely
reversed from four to one against the bill to approximately
four to one in favour of it.
In the early spring and summer of 1973 there was some
evidence of an organized lobby against the proposed legislation. For example, it was possible to plot the path of
some individuals as they moved across the country holding meetings and contacting individuals. They contacted
sportsmen's clubs, rifle associations, gun collectors' associations, and so on, because every time these individuals
appeared in a community there would be a dozen, 15, 25 or
30 letters received from that area. Sometimes they were
Xeroxed letters with different names and addresses on
them, and quite frequently they came in envelopes on
which the name of a commercial company had been scored
out. It was quite obvious that is was an organized campaign, and very well organized at that.
Against the more rabid anti-gun control letters there
were dozens of letters that were thoughtful and constructive. Some were from those who basically were not in
favour of the bill but, nevertheless, wished to express their
views and suggested that if we were considering legislation of this type they would like their viewpoints to be
considered. Many of the anti-gun control letters suggested
that the intent of the bill would, among other things,
result in the confiscation of all privately owned guns and
gun collections. The estimated cost of reimbursement by
the government to the owners would be a minimum of $25
million. Others argued that gun collections worth many
thousands of dollars would be confiscated and would
revert to the Crown, and the government would have to
pay a large sum of money to take over these collections.
Still others stressed the idea that an enormous and costly
bureaucracy would be necessary to enforce any further
controls. An example of the type of letter which came in is
the one I will now quote in part, which said that I was
doubtless sincere, but misguided. It comes from the province of my friend Senator Rowe, from a friend of his, I
believe, Mr. D. J. Morris. I am quoting from this letter
because it is typical of many letters of this nature:
The RCMP estimates that there are 500,000 handguns registered in Canada.

I would like to track down the source of that figure,
because one of the frustrating aspects of this particular
debate is that I have not been able to get any statistics
which seem to be authentic. The letter continues:
If the government were to prohibit ownership of these
guns and was forced to purchase them from their
owners at an average worth of $50, it would cost
$25,000,000, plus paperwork ... Licensing all firearms
(including rifles and shotguns) would require a
bureaucracy and an expenditure almost equal to that
currently expended on automobiles. There are 5 million rifles and shotguns in Canada, almost as many
guns as cars.
The cost of testing for "competence" of gun owners
would be as economically out of reach as testing for
"competence", in a meaningful way, is for driver
licensing.
Canada's present handgun control laws are among
the most stringent in the world. Handgun owners
must have a permit, and another permit is required to
transport these guns. Despite these laws unregistered
handguns are used in crimes. Strict gun control laws
fail because those who want to use guns for illegal
purposes simply ignore the law. Those who obey the
law, collectors and competitive shooters, do not wish
to use their guns for violent purposes, and these are
the only people whom stricter laws would affect.
While I agree that effective measures must be taken
to reduce crimes of violence involving firearms, I feel
that the most effective measures would be as follows:
1. Tougher penalties for the use of firearms in perpetration of a crime.
2. Strict adherence to these penalties by Canada's
courts and the related legal systems.
3. More effective enforcement of Canada's gun control laws.
It is a good letter and it is typical of many. Another
letter is from Mr. David G. Lawrence of Lindsay, Ontario,
who writes:
To administer the program would cost from $1 to $70
per firearm depending on the restrictions of the actual
program. Very roughly, we are talking about $450
million if we institute measures similar to the Sullivan Laws of New York.
His brother, Mr. R. Douglas Lawrence, a very thoughtful
person, bas sent me a document that is almost a small
book. It is based on research carried on in the United
States, and it is some evidence of how seriously people are
treating this subject. I will not take the time to go into
that research project at this time of the night, but these
letters are typical of the hundreds which have come in.
Many have attacked any form of gun control legislation
on a number of grounds, of which the following are the
most important:
1. The costs. In the study in the United States which Mr.
Lawrence referred to in this volume which I have here,
entitled "A Preliminary Cost Analysis Prepared for
National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of
Violence in the United States" by the Research Associates
Incorporated of Washington, D.C. and published under the

SENATE DEBATES
date of December 20, 1968, first year costs of a national
registration of firearms are estimated at $25,500,000. The
second year and continuing costs are estimated at $22,500,000 additional.
2. The second costs are the indirect costs. In the United
States, according to the figures for 1967, the sale of hunting licences, tags, permits, et cetera, brought into the
federal treasury $81,500,000. The excise taxes and sales
taxes on ammunition brought in another $28 million.
This research group points out that if the government
were to forbid the ownership of guns it would lose over
$100 million a year in licence fees and permit fees. The
argument, therefore, is that the annual revenue of $100
million would be lost to the federal treasury if hunting
were curtailed or prohibited. With regard to bureaucratic
costs-and you hear some horrendous tales-the cost in
personnel, time and inconvenience is estimated to be
about $450 million per year. So, they are really getting into
a pretty inflated scale.

An authority who has been frequently quoted is Superintendent Greenwood of the Metropolitan Police Force in
the United Kingdom. Superintendent Greenwood made a
statement to the effect that no gun laws were worth the
paper they are written on. I propose to read some questions put to Superintendent Greenwood and the answers
he gave. Interestingly enough, these questions and
answers were reported in the American Riflemen, so honourable senators will understand that this met with the
approval of a very active gun lobby in the United States.
The questions and answers are as follow:
Q. Do you oppose the registration of firearms, the
requirement that each gun that a person obtains be
enumerated with the police?
A. It's a complete waste of time.
Q. You would just do away with this completely?
A. Yes.
Q. What do you think is the cause of rising crime in
Great Britain?
A. The one thing that I feel I have established is
that the problem is not the criminal use of guns. That
is a symptom. The problem is the increasing willingness of criminals to use violence. The innocent victim
is just as dead if he is stabbed or if he's shot. No single
factor is the cause, but I think the most important
factor in the crime increase is the abolition of capital
punishment.
It is rather interesting to note that throughout the correspondence on this subject time and time again there is the
plea to restore capital punishment, and if it does not go
quite that far there is the plea to toughen the penalties.
On many occasions the comment is made that life
imprisonment does not mean what it says, that it may
mean as little as seven years' imprisonment. The comment
is also made that a young fellow sometimes steals a car
while a member of a college fraternity, as one of the
requirements of the initiation ceremony. Too often, if he is
caught and brought before the courts he is let off with a
warning without further penalty.
[Hon. Mr. Cameron.]

April 2, 1974

There was a case last month in either Kitchener or
Waterloo of a youngster being involved in a serious crime,
for which he was sentenced to one week in jail. The case
bas been appealed by the Crown.
In the April 1st issue of Time magazine there is an
article concerning a gang of youths in Quebec who were
responsible for several murders. This significant statement was made by one of the witnesses:
"Sure I'm scared," admits one Sherbrooke girl. "But
you know what really frightens me is that the police
are scared of the motorcycle gangs."
That is the kind of situation that develops from the
increased use of firearms in the commission of crime.
There are those who suggest that it is wrong to prohibit
the use of shotguns and rifles, that most murders are
committed with handguns. That is true of the United
States, but it is not true of Canada. Within the past month
I have seen information to the effect that 57 per cent of
murders committed in Canada during the past three years
were committed with shotguns or rifles. So, there is a
changing pattern there.
It is not my purpose to go into this aspect in detail,
except to say that a similar bill was introduced in the
House of Commons by the Honourable Warren Allmand
when he was a private member. Now that he is in a
position of greater authority, it is to be hoped that we shall
be able to count on his support when this bill reaches the
other place.
In its present state, the bill is not entirely satisfactory.
We had to consider whether we would redraft it or whether we should discuss it in its present form and send it to
committee. If the bill receives second reading, I shall
propose that it be sent to the Standing Senate Committee
on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Did the bill go to that committee last
session?
Hon. Mr. Carneron: No, it did not get that far, because
the Parole bill took longer than was expected. The bill
before us can be improved in many respects. Certain
sections require greater definition, and the best place to do
that is in committee. Changes are required with respect to
the age at which a person may use a firearm. I believe the
minimum age at present is 16 years. For those who live in
isolated areas, in the north country or in bush country,
where a youngster may be required to shoot Prairie chickens and other game to provide meat for the table, the age
might well be reduced to 12 years. Various matters affecting the use of firearms should be discussed, and this can
best be done in committee.
A number of knowledgeable and able people are ready to
appear before the committee, and I would say to Senator
Goldenberg and his colleagues that the committee might
be required to hold a lengthy sitting-and rightly so
because this is an important piece of legislation. It is
exercising the minds of many, and it is of special concern
to the RCMP, who have the responsibility of examining
the applications of persons wishing to possess firearms. If
it becomes necessary to register every gun in use in
Canada, it might be impossible for the RCMP to handle all
applications for permits. Some of that responsibility
would be eased-and I understand the RCMP would like

April 2, 1974
April 2, 1974

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

to be relieved of part of the responsibility-if local magistrates or police officers were asked to assist in examining
those who seek permits.
There are others who argue, with some validity, that
examinations by the RCMP alone would make for a uniform standard of criteria across the country. The RCMP
also have the advantage of having their own computer for
record purposes. These facilities would make for a more
uniform assessment of the criteria on which permits were
granted. All these matters can be brought before the
committee.
The purpose of clause 1 is to place machine guns and
shortened guns-namely, sawed-off shotguns-which are
now restricted weapons, in the category of prohibited
weapons. It also places rifles and shotguns, which are now
unrestricted, in the category of restricted weapons. As a
result, all weapons will be either prohibited or restricted.
Many people are opposed to that provision, and by sending
this bill to committee all points of view may be heard and
an acceptable solution reached.
Clause 2 makes all transfers of weapons, whether commercial or private, subject to authorization.
The purpose of clause 3 is to make all offences relating
to guns indictable ones, and consequently to eliminate all
summary convictions.
Section 92 becomes unnecessary due to the new section
87.
Clause 4 requires a permit for all restricted weapons,
which in fact include all firearms.
A good deal of work will be involved in screening those
who are entitled to possess weapons. This is the basis for
the charge that we will be simply building up a tremendous bureaucracy, taking up a great deal of time and
costing a lot of money. But I am sure there are ways in
which this can be handled without causing the inconvenience and cost which some people suggest will be the case.
*

(2150)

Dealing with clause 5, under our present law a judge
may order that a person involved in a crime be prohibited
from possessing any firearm for a maximum period of five
years. This amendment would require the judge to make
such an order of prohibition for at least a period of ten
years.
Finally, dealing with clause 6, the purpose of subparagraph (e) of paragraph 97(2) (d) is to provide that a permit
may be granted for the use of a rifle or a shotgun for
hunting, subject to the granting of a hunting licence. The
requirements for getting a hunting licence are precise and
are spelled out in some detail.
The new paragraph 97 (2A) (a) makes it mandatory that
a test be passed before any permit for a weapon may be
granted. This test would cover the individual's knowledge
of weapons handling and the laws pertaining thereto.
Paragraph 97 (2A)(b) sets out those persons who are
prohibited from being granted a permit for a weapon. This
would apply to persons who have been convicted of an
offence, people who are mentally disturbed, and so forth.
There is no question that this is becoming an increasingly
important subject. It is on the minds of many people.

Some improvement in our gun control legislation must be
brought about.
In 1971 over 9,000 murders in the United States involved
guns, and that figure is increasing all the time.
Hon. Mr. Martin: How many murders were there all
together? You say there were 9,000 murders involving
guns.
Hon. Mr. Carneron: Yes, 9,000 in 1971.
Hon. Mr. Martin: And 682 of those were in Detroit.
What was the total number of murders in 1971, regardless
of the weapon used?
Hon. Mr. Carneron: The total would have been much
greater than that. I do not have the exact figures in front
of me. However, more Americans have been killed by guns
in the last 60 years than have been killed in all of the wars
in which the American people participated since the Declaration of Independence. The number is astronomical.
The ordinary citizen just does not realize it.
Some senators may have noticed a news item emanating
from Washington which appeared in the Ottawa Citizen of
September 23, 1973. It read:
A national crime commission recommended today
that all Americans other than law-enforcement and
military personnel be barred from possessing handguns by 1983.
Noting that handguns were used in 9,000 murders in
1971 alone, the national advisory commission on criminal justice also urged that each state prohibit their
manufacture and sale, acquire existing handguns and
render inoperative those held as collectors' items.
The report said Americans are accumulating handguns at the rate of 1,800,000 a year.
This statement is from a crime commission in the United
States. It is hard to believe.
Superintendent Greenwood has been quoted to me ad
nauseam by people attacking the gun control legislation. It
was interesting that the Secretary of State for the Home
Department and the Secretary of State for Scotland of the
previous Government of the United Kingdom, the Honourable Robert Carr, had a green paper on firearms prepared
dealing with the situation in the United Kingdom. That
green paper is dated May 1973, and it analyzes in great
detail the reasons behind the legislation in the United
Kingdom. As honourable senators are aware, it is accepted
that the United Kingdom has the best gun control legislation in the world. However, in spite of that legislation,
homicides in the United Kingdom are increasing. The
point is made in the green paper that by making it more
difficult for the person with criminal intent to acquire a
gun, you cut down on the number of murders and assaults
involving guns.
Honourable senators, that is a very sketchy re-introduction of this legislation. As I indicated, if the bill receives
second reading I propose to refer it to the Standing Senate
Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.
Hon. Mr. Rowe: I wonder if you would permit a question, Senator Cameron. The figure you cited of 9,000 murders involving the use of guns of one kind or another is the
officially recorded figure, is it not? Am I correct in inferring that beyond any shadow of a doubt there were at least

SENATE DEBATES
9,000 murders, although the actual number, as everyone
knows, is much higher than the officially recorded
number? Therefore, by inference the number of gun murders must be much higher as well. Honourable senators
are aware that many hundreds of murders in the United
States are never solved, because the victims disappear and
no one really knows what happened to them. Am I correct
in drawing the inference that a significant proportion of
these victims were murdered by persons using guns?
Hon. Mr. Cameron: You are correct.
Hon. Mr. Hastings: Honourable senators, I have one or
two very brief questions for the sponsor of the bill. Did he
say that 67 per cent of murders in Canada in the last three
years were committed by the use of rifles or shotguns?
Hon. Mr. Cameron: The figure is 57 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Hastings: And that was by the use of rifles,
shotguns, or other firearms?
Hon. Mr. Caneron: Rifles or shotguns.
Hon. Mr. Hastings: My second question is: Are you
implying that the restriction of weapons and firearms will
decrease the number of homicides in any given
jurisdiction?
Hon. Mr. Carneron: The experience of the United Kingdom, as well as that of Germany, Belgium and, particularly, Japan, is that the unavailability of guns tends to
decrease the number of assaults involving the use of guns.
This is the experience of countries who have effective gun
control legislation.
Hon. Mr. Martin: People are too gun crazy.
Hon. Mr. Hastings: But are you saying that it will
decrease the number of homicides?
Hon. Mr. Carneron: I think not. The number of homicides has been increasing. The argument, however, is that
it might have been much worse were it not for the gun
control legislation. One factor which most of these discussions have not taken into account is that much of the
increased use of guns in crime today stems from the
growth of the drug culture in the last few years. Youngsters, as well as older people, on drugs will do anything to
obtain them. A good portion of the increase in crime,
particularly in the United Kingdom, the United States,
and Canada, is attributed to the growth of the drug culture. It is now beginning to decrease. It will be interesting
to see what happens in the next three, four or five years,
assuming the drug culture curve continues to go down as
it is apparently now doing. It will be interesting to see
whether or not the number of crimes committed by those
on drugs also decreases. The expectation is that it will, but
at the moment we do not have verifiable evidence to that
effect.
Honourable senators, I now have the particulars in
regard to deaths in the United States, if I may give them
now. This is from the Congressional Record of June 10,
1968:
Far more people have been killed by firearms in the
United States since the year 1900 than have died in all
its wars frorn the American Revolution to Vietnam.
Between 1900 and 1966, firearms have been responsible for 280,000 murders, 370,000 suicides and 145,000
[lion. Mr. Rowe.]

April 2, 1974

deaths by accident-making a grand total of 795,000
people. Against this figure the total number of American war dead since the beginning of the nation to the
war in Vietnam stands at 550,000.
In other words, over 200,000 more people were killed by
guns than were killed in all their wars.
On motion of Senator Molgat, debate adjourned.

PRIVATE BILL
EASTERN CANADA SYNOD OF THE LUTHERAN CHURCH IN
AMERICA-SECOND READING

Hon. Eugene A. Forsey moved the second reading of
Bill C-264, respecting the Eastern Canada Synod of the
Lutheran Church in America.
He said: Honourable senators, I can be brief. The purpose of this bill is pretty well stated in the actual description as it appears in the title. At present the Synod of the
Lutheran Church concerned has come into possession, as
the result of the sale of what used to be called Waterloo
Lutheran University, now Wilfrid Laurier University, of
some $3 million. Under the present terms of its powers to
invest it may invest its money only in government debt. It
is anxious to have the power to invest these moneys in all
types of investments permitted by the Canadian and British Insurance Companies Act.
The ordinary way of proceeding here would be through
the provisions of the Canada Corporations Act, but this
would involve considerable delay. I am informed by counsel for the Synod that it would involve a delay of something like a year, because the Synod would have to meet in
June, and then there would be various formalities to be
gone through there, and afterwards with the government
department concerned. Therefore, the Synod decided to
proceed in this way.
In order to make quite sure that this was the will of the
Church, the members at the last meeting of the Synod,
some 295 in number, were polled by letter and a most
elaborate questionnaire setting forth the whole situation.
My recollection is that some 227 of them replied, and
something like 217 replied in the affirmative. I have the
figures here if there is any necessity to give them. Therefore, I think there is no question at all but that it is the
desire of the authorities in the Synod of this Church to
have these wider powers to invest in the securities
allowed by the Canadian and British Insurance Companies Act. There is ample security there that the funds will
be properly invested.
I do not think there is really anything contentious about
this matter, and at this hour of the night I do not wish to
go into the matter any further, though I am prepared to
answer any questions honourable senators would like to
raise.
Hon. J. Carnpbell Haig: Honourable senators, I can add
that in lune 295 people were polled by letter; 227 responded, of which 218 approved. The parliamentary agent for
the Synod stated in a meeting of the committee of the
other place that Waterloo University-of which, by the
way, the honourable Leader of the Government is Chancellor-received from the sale of its land and buildings to

SENATE DEBATES

April 2, 1974
April 2, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

the Province of Ontario approximately $3 million. Under
present legisiation the Synod's investment powers are
restricted.
Ail this bill does is allow the executive committee of the
Synod to invest in securities that are allowed insurance
companies carrying on business under the Canadian and
British Insurance Companies Act. There is, therefore,
ample protection for the Synod and the university, of
which it is part.
The reason for the sale to the Province of Ontario was
that the university divested itself of any religious connection. It is now a university of the Province of Ontario, and
entitled to receive grants.
The Synod wishes this bill referred to a committee and
passed quickly, so that they can start to invest the $3
million. I would certainly approve the reference of this bill
to the appropriate committee.
Motion agreed to and bill read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
On motion of Senator Forsey, bill referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional
Af f airs.
SUSPENSION 0F RULE 95
Hon. Mr'. Forsey moved, with leave of the Senate and
notwithstanding rule 45(l) (a), that rule 95 be suspended
with respect to Bill C-264, respecting the Eastern Canada
Synod of the Lutheran Church in America.
He said: Honourable senators, I do this to make it possible to have this matter dealt with expeditiously.
Hon. Mr'. Grosart: On a point of order. I do not believe
that rule 95 applies at ahl, because it refers only to a
private bill originating in the Senate. I do flot think leave
is required.
Hon. Mr. Martin: This bill originated in the House of
Commons.
Hon. Mr'. Forsey: I was merely being guided by the
advice I received from the Table. If I have erred, I have
erred in distinguished and learned company.
Hon. Mr'. Grosart: Perhaps I should read rule 95. It says:
A private bill originating in the Senate, of which
notice is required to be given, shaîl not be considered
by a committee until after one week from the date of
referral to such committee and, in the case of any such
bill originating in the House of Commons, until
twenty-four hours thereafter.
Hon. Mr'. Forsey: That is the point we were considering,
the 24 hours.

Hon. Mr. Gi'osart: You would have plenty of time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I am flot
sure I heard the last remarks. I think the reason leave is
required is because rule 95, in referring to bis originating
in the House of Commons, requires 24 hours. That is why
this motion is necessary.
Hon. Mr'. Forsey: It is hoped that this non-controversial
bill might be deaht with by the committee tomorrow after
the Senate rises. This is the only purpose in moving this
motion. This unusual procedure is being asked for because
of the long dehay that might otherwise arise, with considerable prejudice to the interests of the Synod.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, perhaps h
should read rule 95:
A private bill originating in the Senate, of which
notice is required to be given, shaîl not be considered
by a committee until after one week from the date of
referral to such committee and, in the case of any such
bill originating in the House of Commons, until
twenty-four hours thereafter.
There seems to be urgency, and that is why Senator
Forsey would like rule 95 suspended in respect of this bill.
Motion agreed to.

BUSINESS 0F THE SENATE
Hon. Mr'. Martin: Honourable senators, may I make a
suggestion to Senator Forsey, in view of the fact that the
Senate now has agreed that his bill may be considered by
the committee tomorrow? I understand that arrangements
have been made with Senator Goldenberg for a meeting of
that committee tomorrow af ternoon.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: That is what I understand.
Hon. Mr'. Martin: The Senate will be sitting at 2 o'clock
in the afternoon. It is likely that the sitting will not be as
long as usual, because arrangements have been made for
committees to sit, including that particular one. I suggest
to Senator Forsey that hie take responsibility for discussing the matter with Senator Goldenberg again, to make
sure that Senator Langlois and others are there.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: I notice that Senator Goldenberg is
not here. He had arranged with Senator McIlraith that hie
would preside over the committee. In that case I shahl be
happy to discuss the point with Senator Mcllraith.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Senator Mcîhraith is the former
Solicitor General. Now I know why hie was pressing me a

The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.

GEORGES POMPIDOU
TRIBUTES TO THE LATE PRESIDENT 0F FRANCE

Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, may 1 cati the
attention of the house to the fact that in the other place
the Prime Minister will be paying tribute ta the late
President of France.
[Translation]
Honourable senatars, the Prime Minister has sent ta the
French people a message of sympathy on the death of the
President of the French Republic, Mr. Georges Pompidou.
This expression of sympathy extended ta his famîly,
Mrs. Pompidou, the French government and the French
people is a sincere and tangible testimony of al
Canadians.
Canadians have maintained close ties of friendsbip and
a cammunity of înterests with France.
Our own bistory is sa clasely interwoven with that of
France and Britain that the important events which occur
in each of those cauntries have an effect on ail Canadians.
The assaciatan of Canada witb France has deep roats in
aur bistory. Comrades in arms-we are also partners in
NATO. We share witb France ber culture and what that
culture means ta Europe and the world.
The office of President of the French Repubtic is quite
powerful in European affairs as well as on the internationai level. The individual wbo accedes ta that pcst-as did
Mr. Pompidou and bis predecessors-must show leadership and bc cndowed witb great qualities.
I met Mr. Pompidou for the first time when he was
Prime Minister and General de Gaulle was President.
My dealings with him have shown me that he was a very
talented, competent and prepossessing man.
[En glish]
Throughout bis public life the late President Pompidou
was regarded by his fellow countrymen as "a Frenchman
like any ather." Indeed, he was a self-made man, a classic
example of the French systemn which finds its origins in
Napoléon's statement that every soldier carrnes in bis
knapsack tbe bâton of a marécbal.
Born in 1911 in a village in the Auvergne, President
Pompidou was cf peasant stock. His father, a fottower of
the great socialist leader Jean Jaurès, passed ta his son bis
own ideals, and in bis yauth Georges Pompidou was himself an active member cf his father's political leaning. His
tastes were, however, not in the area cf palitics but in the
fields cf literature and art. In addition ta beîng a Prof essor
cf Greek and Latin, he composed several anthologies cf
French pcetry and seemed destined for an academnic

career. Yet bis love cf the cultural wortd toak second place
ta his lave cf country and, in this respect, be epitamized
tbe vigarous, modemn spirit cf the French nation. Called
upon by Generat de Gaulle in 1962 ta lead the gcvemnment,
Mr. Pompidou willingly left bis home an the I1e Saint
Louis ta take up residence in the Hôtel Matignon. It was
during the years cf bis premiersbip fromn 1962 until 1968
that Mr. Pompidou displayed those exceptional qualities
cf potitical leadership that made hlm the choîce of tbe
French people and President cf the Republic.
Indeed, a truly significant man bas passed away.
[Translation]
We att feel it on this day cf mcurning. As a closely
related nation, we affer aour mcst sincere condolences to
Mrs. Pompidou, ber family, the gavernment and tbe people
of France.
Hon. Lionel Choquette: Honourable senatars, France

The President cf the Republic, Georges Pompidou, was a
wîse and devoted head cf state. He was a man cf great
foresight, a man cf great insight.
He worked tirelessly and with remarkable success
towards imprcving the welfare cf bis people. Hîs concern
for the French people was truly moving.
But, in spite cf bis special interest in the domestic
prcblems cf bis country, he neyer failed ta give cansiderable attention ta the rate and responsibîtîties of France on

Even today, four years after the death cf Chartes de

SENATE DEBATES
VETERANS' LAND ACT

BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned
debale on the motion of Senator Connolly (Ottawa West),
for the second reading of Bihl C-17, to arnend the Veterans'
Land Act.
Hon. L. P. Beaubien: Honourable senators, f irst of ail I
wish to off er rny very sincere congratulations to Madarn
Speaker for her excellent performance as our presiding
off icer. I want to point out, however, that the day Madarn
Speaker turns over ber high office to a rnere man, he is
going to have a difficult tirne trying to fiii ber liltle sboes
adequately.
An Hon. Senator: It rnigbt be another lady.
Hon. Mr'. Beaubien: Yes, that is possible, of course. Next
I wish 10 welcorne the new senators who have joined us
lately in this cbamber. I should like to congratulate those
of them who have already spoken, and I arn looking
forward to getting to know thern better over rnany years
to corne.
I now turfi to Bill C-17, to arnend the Veterans' Land
Act. The bill was extrernely well explained by Senator
Connolly, as usual, and theref ore I arn not going to go into
much detail. Unfortunately, this is a rnoney bill and theref ore it would flot be appropriate for the Senate to move
any arnendrnents, but I should like to point out sorne of the
bill's shorlcornings.
First, let me point out that the Veterans' Land Act is
dead. For the last five years, only those who obtained
valid qualification certificates before October 31, 1968,
were entitled to apply for f inancial assistance under the
Veterans' Land Act; but their application bad to be submitted bef ore March 31, 1974. Bill C-17 simply extends the
deadline by one year. There are about 140,000 valid qualif ications outstanding.
I tbink, bonourable senators, there can be no question
that the Veterans' Land Act served a useful purpose.
Approxirnalely 140,000 veterans took advantage of il, borrowed rnoney under its terrns wben they carne out of tbe
war and were hooking for places to setîle. Tbey went into
the country and they bougbt farms. However, of late years
tbe Veterans' Land Act bas flot been very belpful to the
veterans because il contained outdated restrictions, and in
rny view the act sbouhd be arnended.
We are now approacbing anotber period wben the veterans need a hand. Tbey carne out of tbe war baving been in
the arrned forces four or five years, and now quite a few
will be approacbing retirernent age. The war ended nearly
30 years ago. Within the next four or f ive years a great
rnany more will reach retiring age and it wouhd be a great
behp to tbern if they could borrow money on reasonable
terrns. They could buy tbeir own bornes and so forth.
Therefore tbis bill should be allowed to die.
I now refer to two of the main provisions in the legishalion, whicb were enacted in 1942, one of tbern saying tbat
the veteran mnust buy at least baif an acre. Well, haîf an
acre is rougbly 22,000 square feet and would involve 'a lot
of 100 feet by 200 feet, or sornetbing more than two ordinary city lots.. I do flot think this is realistic. The units
should be srnaller. Then the arnount that can be borrowed
was set at $18,000 maximum hess a deposit of rougbly

27601-15

$2,600. So that one provision says that you need to have a
larger lot and the next says that you can only have a littie
money. Between the two of these things, it just does flot
work.
Wbat I think we should do bere is to impress on the
Leader of the Governrnent in the Senate that be should go
back to his colleagues in the Cabinet and tell tbem that as
f ar as the Senate is concerned this bill urgently needs
some amendrnents.
Han. Chesley W. Carter: Honourable senators, I sbould
like to say a f ew words on this bill. At the outset 1 should
like to congratulate Senator Connolly (Ottawa West) for
the excellent exposition that he gave us last evening. I
think he made about the best case frorn the government's
point of view that could be made. But I would like to deal
with it today frorn the standpoint of the veteran, because
there is quite a contrast in the two viewpoints and the
veteran's viewpoint should be taken into consideration.
Speaking as a veteran, I must support this bill because it
does extend the deadline for one year, and haif a loaf is
better than none. But, bonourable senators, in the eyes of
the veteran it is not rnuch better. I arn disappointed that
the deadline was flot extended for at least three years, and
that the total benef ils under the act were flot brought up
to date.

a

(1420)

We should think first from the veteran's point of view in
terms of need. Is there a need for this bill? Is there a need
for the extension and is there a need for the upgrading of
its provisions? Senator Connolly (Ottawa West) answered
that hirnself last night when be pointed out that during
the year 1972-73 there were 5,200 applications, and that
during the year just ended there were 7,500 applications,
an increase of over 2,000. Certainly that indicates there is
a need for tbis legisiation to be extended. 1 could add that
the Dominion Commrand of the Royal Canadian Legion
bas over the past year conducted a survey among Legion
members and veterans generally. They have discovered
that there are still several thousand veterans wbo would
like to take advantage of this legisiation, but would flot be
able to do so unless the deadline were extended. I doubt if
the extension of one year is sufficient to enable ahl those
veterans who wish to take advantage of it to do so.
I can understand frorn the government's point of view
that this act bas been on the books for many years, that
the veterans are growing older and the time has corne to
wind up this legislation and rernove il frorn the statute
books. As I see it, however, the goverinent itself is flot
witbout blame in this matter. Senator Connolly told us
last night that 300,000 certificates bad been issued and of
this nurnber only 140,000 had been used, and an estirnated
140,000 had flot been used. I subrnit that one of the main
reasons for these 140,000 certif icates flot being used is that
over the years, througb the inaction of the goverinent,
this legislation lost its attractiveness. The granîs available
under it have not been up-daled for nine years. If we
assume that inflation has grown at an average rate of 4 per
cent per year, wbich I think is a fair assumption, it means
that the grant today is worth only two-lbirds of its value
of fine years ago. Ahl sirnilar pieces of legisiation, such as
the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation Act, the
Farrn Improvernent Loans Act, the Srnall Businesses

SENATE DEBATES
Loans Act, the Fisheries Improvement Loans Act, have
been brought up to date and kept up to date to compensate
for inflation. This veterans' legislation, however, has not
been touched for nine years, and as a result of this inaction on the part of the government itself, veterans have
been prevented from taking advantage of the legislation.
Veterans should not be put in the position of being penalized for government inaction.
There remain a number of veterans who had not heard
of this legislation or the benefits available to them until
the Legion conducted the survey I mentioned. I know that
in my own province there is a tremendous interest in it. It
is only now that the ordinary Newfoundlander, the fisherman, the type of person who joined up in either of the two
World Wars, is sufficiently affluent to take advantage of
it. I say it is quite wrong that at a time when they are able
to take advantage of this legislation they should be denied
the opportunity to do so.
I said earlier that in my opinion it represented less than
half a loaf, the reason being that the grants are so unattractive today that there is not much point in a veteran
applying for one.
We should be motivated by the principle that all veterans should be treated alike. Unless this legislation is
updated and the grants improved, veterans who wish to
take advantage of the legislation will be discriminated
against in comparison with those who took advantage of it
in previous years. The legislation should be extended for
more than one year, and it should be improved to bring it
in line with the original grants in order that its benefits
might apply equally to all veterans.
It is quite true that most veterans are now getting along
in years, even World War II veterans. Most World War I
veterans are over 70 years of age and are not likely to be
interested in this legislation, but World War II veterans
average around 60, and many have a few more years left.
I should like to point out that implementation of this
legislation is not likely to cost the government a great
deal. I cannot remember the total number of accounts, but
the total income to the government from repayment of
loans and mortgages will be in the vicinity of $50 million
per year. The remainder can be borrowed. There is no
reason why the borrowed money need be subsidized. When
similar legislation was first introduced, 3 per cent was a
fairly high rate of interest. That figure means nothing
these days. I have no objection to that aspect of the
legislation being brought up to date, but I would like to
see the principle preserved.
There is no better asset today than housing. A veteran
does not own his house. The title deed is vested in the
Director General of the Veterans' Land Act until the
house is paid for. Even if a veteran owns his house, under
the provisions of the act he cannot dispose of it in less
than 10 years.
If a veteran who is well advanced in years wants to take
advantage of this legislation, the government owns an
asset that will not depreciate as the years go by. Even if
that were not the case, the loans can always be insured as
is done with respect to Central Mortgage and other loans.
Why not have that applied also to veterans' loans? I am
not impressed by the argument that because veterans are
[Hon. Mr. Carter.]

April 3, 1974

getting along in years or because we are concerned about
costs, that this legislation should be terminated. Thosc
costs are minimal when compared with maintaining the
principles and tradition of the veterans' charter, as bas
been done through the years.
Before I resume my seat, I should like to say a few
words with regard to sending the bill to committee. I
appreciate the point made by the Leader of the Opposition
that we cannot do anything about upgrading the benefits
because this would involve expenditure and be out of
order. However, I still believe that a useful purpose could
be served by sending the bill to committee.
a

(1430)

Senator Thompson raised some pertinent questions last
evening. Such questions as those could be the subject of a
good discussion in committee. I think the Senate should
know more about the administrative aspects of the bill.
There are many angles to this which we do not have time
to explore now, but which we ought to know about. Even
if we are not going to change the bill, or improve it in any
way, we can always make recommendations based on our
study. I feel the Senate should be well informed on these
matters so that we can make recommendations which may
be acted on in the future. For those reasons, I hope this bill
is sent to committee.
Hon. Sidney L. Buckwold: Honourable senators, I am
pleased to participate briefly in this debate. I want to
congratulate Senator Connolly, the sponsor of the bill in
the Senate, for what I felt was a thorough explanation.
I was pleased to see an amendment brought forward in
the other place which allows for the re-opening of this
subject on the request of 20 members. That amendment
will provide for a complete review by the government of
the entire situation. As many speakers in this debate have
already said, a review of the entire act is necessary.
Speaking as a veteran, I feel that our veterans are
entitled to continued consideration by the Government of
Canada in return for the sacrifices they made during those
crucial years of war. I would remind honourable senators
that the changes that have taken place over the years have
been gradual, and perhaps hindsight is better than foresight. Up until 1959 there was no terminal date in any of
the provisions of the Veterans' Land Act. Indeed, there
was no terminal date in many of the other programs of
interest to our veterans. But in 1959, Bill C-50 was introduced, which established a time limit for veterans who
wished to obtain the certificate of qualification which was
discussed earlier. The time limit was set at 15 years after
September 30, 1947, or 15 years after the veteran's discharge, whichever was later. I suppose the members of
both houses at that time felt that such a time period was
adequate to take care of a program which most people
wanted to see phased out.
Next came Bill C-80, which was introduced in 1962. By
that bill, the date was extended to October 31, 1968, which
corresponds to the final date for the use of the re-establishment credit. That is the history connected with the
phasing out of these programs. For the purposes of phasing out VLA lending operations in an orderly manner, Bill
C-128 was approved by Parliament in 1965. That bill established terminal dates for submitting loan applications and

April 3, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

for commencing work related to construction or affecting
other permanent improvements.
From that background, honourable senators can see that
there has been a long-term plan to phase out these operations, and I think it has been a reasonably well accepted
pattern. The government should now recognize that it is
just not possible to reject a further review of this program,
in fairness to those who still seek benefits under this
legislation.
I congratulate Senator Beaubien and others for the presentations that have been made, because it indicates that
there is a need for increased loans, establishing smaller
land areas, and the provision of a variety of other needs
that I know would be useful to veterans.
It is interesting to study some of the other speeches.
Senator Thompson asked whether a married couple who
were both veterans would both be entitled to benefits and
loans. That is a practical example, perhaps in the case of
the sergeant who married his officer. A problem that does
develop for women comes to light because of the lack of
joint tenancy regulations. If a veteran takes a loan, gets a
bouse or smallholding and then separates from his wife, if
his wife continues making the payments on the house in
which she is living, technically the man would still have
the right to dispose of the property because it was in his
name. From what I gather, there is no way in which title
can be transferred or joint tenancy established. There
would seem to be a need for a significant reappraisal of
the situation in order to protect wives who may be
involved in these properties.
Another interesting suggestion was that the purchase of
condominiums should be allowed under this act. Today
many veterans who are getting older find it difficult to
live in semi-rural areas, or larger urban sites, where the
act originally contemplated they would settle, and they
would like to move into condominiums and be able to
participate, through the act, in home-ownership in that
way. Those are some of the things that could be reviewed,
and I sincerely hope they will be. Cooperative housing is
another aspect, of course.
There are advantages to the act. I suppose the real
advantage is the 31/2 per cent interest rate on the first
$6,000, which is a very substantial saving.
Consideration should certainly be given to the housing
aspect rather than the original land resettlement idea.
Perhaps the administration of the act should be taken
away from the Department of Veterans Affairs and
brought within the scope of housing under the Central
Mortgage and Housing Corporation. It seems to be more
logical to have the program under that corporation, which
is geared to housing, than indefinitely continue supervision of the program by the Department of Veterans
Affairs. That, I suggest, could be a very important facet of
any future review.
Senator Carter indicated that perhaps interest rates
could be reviewed. Perhaps 3½ per cent involves too much
of a subsidy, although I think if that rate were raised there
would be a great deal of resentment and opposition from
those who qualify for loans. But it does bring into focus
the fact that there is a need in the country for some form
of subsidized interest rate, because the real appeal of this

27601-15!,

program has been the fact that there has been a subsidized
interest rate.
*

(1440)

Again I think consideration should be given to moving
this program into the jurisdiction of the Ministry of State
for Urban Affairs and under the guidance of the Central
Mortgage and Housing Corporation. These are the kinds of
things that should be discussed when the time comes for
reconsideration.
It seems to me that the bill as we have it now deserves
to be passed and should be passed, extending the deadline-because that is all that it really does-giving the
opportunity to have the subject re-opened and in due
course a complete discussion undertaken by either of the
houses in this very important field.
I must admit that I do not see at this point any significant reason for sending it to committee. The purpose of
the bill now is to pass on the benefits of the Veterans'
Land Act for another year. During that time, action should
be taken by this house or by the other place, for further
consideration of the items we have discussed. I personally
hope that the bill will be supported, that we will get it
through rapidly and provide for the veterans of Canada
those benefits which they so justly deserve.
Hon. Guy Williams: Honourable senators, I for one do
not think I will vote for the extension of this legislation.
From my experience with Indian veterans, this is one of
Canada's most discriminatory pieces of legislation. One of
my tribesmen who joined the armed forces and fought on
the fields of battle did qualify under the Veterans' Land
Act upon his return. He was mentioned in dispatches
during the war. He alone captured 28 prisoners at one
time. I asked him how he did it and he said, "I didn't
surround them." His house is still only two-thirds finished, because the Veterans' Land Act allowed the Indian
veteran only two-thirds of what was allowed other
veterans.
If there is consideration given to what Senator Carter
has said, that all veterans must be treated alike, then I
will vote for this bill.
Hon. Hazen Argue: Honourable senators, when there
was an announcement that this legislation was about to be
terminated, I took it upon myself to write a letter to the
Minister of Veterans Affairs, the Honourable Dan MacDonald, setting forth reasons as I saw them as to why the
act should be extended. I am happy that we have before us
a bill which provides at least for a minimum extension in
the act.
For my part, this one-year extension is really a confirmation that the powers that be are determined to bring
this act to an end. This one-year extension came about
only after the greatest amount of pressure. Therefore, I
wish to affirm that I think there should be no termination
date whatsoever. Our veterans from World War I and from
the Korean War are getting on in years. The termination
of this legislation will come about when those veterans are
no longer here. Surely it is not necessary for the government to choke off the rights that were provided by Parliament for those veterans over many years. Therefore, I
think that this extension, while welcome, does not go
nearly far enough.

SENATE DEBATES
I agree with Senator Buckwold that in order to keep the
provisions of this act alive and, if necessary, to remove
what may be far too large a bureaucracy-and I have no
information on this point-this legislation could be maintained by having certain provisions administered under
the National Housing Act, by having the land features
administered under the Farm Credit Corporation.
Senator Buckwold said that when this act is opened up
once again the Senate can say what it wishes. I do not
think the Senate should wait until some future date. The
act is before us now. Surely if the Senate has an opinion,
now is the time to express that opinion.
I do not know whether this bill will go to a committee,
but I would like to see that happen. If at some future date
the Senate might take a stand on this legislation, extending it or modifying it, I cannot see why the Senate should
not do so now. If the bill were sent to a committee, that
committee should bring in a report pointing out to the
government the opinion of the Senate as far as the future
of this legislation is concerned. I am not going to quarrel
with those who say-although I think an argument could
be made up on the opposite side-that we cannot bring
about any amendment involving the expenditure of additional revenue. I am not bringing up that point.
I have taken the trouble, in my own way, to write out
the kind of recommendation which in my opinion a committee of this Senate should make to the government. It
would go something like this:
This committee recommends that the Minister of
Veterans' Affairs should conduct an inquiry to ascertain the extent to which veterans and veterans' organizations desire
(a) Extension of the Veterans' Land Act beyond
March 31, 1975, and
(b) Changes in the provisions and administration of
the act, and more particularly to consider the advisability of
(i) removing the cut-off date for applications
under the act,
(ii) increasing the ceilings applicable to loans
under the act, and
(iii) eliminating the minimum lot size requirement, which would make it possible for veterans
to obtain houses on smaller lots, perhaps condominiums, and so on.
With the suggestion that the minister should bring in
such a report and make the result known within
thirty days of the opening of a new session of Parliament or January 1, 1975, whichever date comes earlier.
I had a long experience in the House of Commons and
my opinion, as an observer there on the Opposition side, is
that sometimes, when the government is not certain which
way it may go when it is making up its mind, one extra
opinion, one additional opinion on one side of the question, may influence it to take a particular position. I think
that, denigrated as the Senate is in many other ways, an
opinion from it at this time along the lines I have suggested might well influence the government, six months or
nine months from now, or at some date before the expiry
of the twelve-month period, to extend the act.
[Hon. Mr. Argue.]

April 3, 1974

(1450)

I have had advice from an eminent authority on the
rules, and it has been suggested to me that it would be in
order to move an amendment such as the following:
Subparagraph 48(1)(e) of the Veterans' Land Act is
repealed and the following substituted therefor:
(e) The condition subject to which the land may be
acquired for the purpose of this partthat is, providing for regulations; and these are the operative words.
-except that no minimum acreage or size may be
specified by regulation.
It would not say that the government had to spend more
money or less money. It would just say that a provision
which required a certain amount of land to go with a
certain house would no longer apply. It would not say that
to get a house you must also have somebody who would
throw in a half -acre of land.
I strongly suggest to the sponsor of this bill that it be
referred to committee, and that the committee consider
whether, in bringing in a report on the bill, it wished to
make a particular recommendation to the government.
That is something that I think would be very much in
order. In fact, I am sure that the Minister of Veterans
Affairs, anxious as he is to do his absolute best for the
veterans, would value the opinion of the Senate in this
matter.
Hon. David A. Croll: Honourable senators, I should like
to adjourn the debate until later this day, in view of what
Senator Williams said about discrimination against the
Indians, which is inconceivable to me.
I was a member of the House of Commons Committee on
Veterans Affairs from the day I arrived there until the day
I left, and I was intimately connected with Colonel
Rutherford, who looked after this legislation. He was not
only an outstanding soldier but a friend of veterans. In the
light of that, what Senator Williams had to say came as a
great shock.
I move that this debate be adjourned until later this
day.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Is the sponsor of the bill aware
that such discrimination exists in the act?
Hon. Mr. Croll: No, not at all. He wants to get this
information as well.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: We all do.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): The point is that we
want to make sure the information we have is accurate,
and that it is all that the Senate needs. I have an answer
here, but I am not quite satisfied that it is in the form in
which it should be given to the Senate, or that it completely covers the situation described by Senator Williams.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I am sure Senator Connolly will tell
us that he expects the officials to be here shortly.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): In fact, I think I
have all the information now, but I want to check to make
sure. It is a technical point. I can deal with it in perhaps
ten or fifteen minutes.

SENATE DEBATES

April 3, 1974

On motion of Senator Croll, debate adjourned until later
this day.

To anyone familiar with the scene it was immediately
apparent why that meeting was called. As long as the Arab
nations, which were labelled the aggressors in that war-

UNITED NATIONS

Hon. Mr. Choquette: They are always labelled the
aggressors.

TWENTY-EIGHTH MEETING OF GENERAL ASSEMBLY-DEBATE
CONTINUED

Hon. Mr. Buckwold: I believe they were the aggressors.

The Senate resumed from Tuesday, March 26, the
adjourned debate on the inquiry of Senator Hicks calling
the attention of the Senate to the Twenty-eighth Meeting
of the General Assembly of the United Nations, and in
particular to the discussions and proceedings of the
Assembly and the participation therein of the Canadian
delegation.
Hon. Sidney L. Buckwold: Honourable senators, I am
pleased to follow Senator Hicks who introduced this subject. Senator Hicks had the honour of being part of the
Canadian delegation for the entire Twenty-eighth meeting
of the General Assembly in New York. I was given the
privilege of being an observer for a period of one week,
along with other parliamentarians, and that did give me
the opportunity to see the United Nations in operation and
get a most thorough briefing with respect to the general
procedures and problems and, indeed, frustrations facing
that body.
I hope that the Department of External Affairs continues to send members of Parliament, among whom senators
are included, to act as observers there. One week is not
really that long a time, but I am sure those of us who have
had the privilege enjoyed it very much. Personally, I
found it a most stimulating experience.
Honourable senators, the reason I want to participate in
this debate now is to express my feeling of disappointment
in the actions taken at the United Nations during the
period I was there, which happened to coincide with the
war in the Middle East-the Yom Kippur war. Because of
my own background, I am quite interested in this subject.
Personally, I have been a life-long supporter of the aspirations of the Jewish people to re-establish a national homeland in what was Palestine. Being in the United Nations
during those very crucial days-when the future of the
world was in jeopardy because of the danger of a major
war breaking out at any time-was of real and significant
interest to me not only as a senator but as an observer of
the scene.
I must say that, during the period I was there as part of
the Canadian delegation, the Security Council did not
meet on this subject at all until the very last day of my
stay, which was late on a Sunday. It seemed almost
unbelievable that a major war could be under way, while
at the same time in the halls of the United Nations, in the
General Assembly and the committee meetings, one would
hardly know that anything of such magnitude was taking
place-that at that very moment men and women were
being killed as a result of military action.
As I say, nothing happened until the Security Council
was ready to move, and that move only came on Sunday,
October 21, 1973-I believe that is the correct date-when
a special meeting of the Security Council was called at
almost midnight.

Hon. Mr. Choquette: They are always the aggressors.
Hon. Mr. Buchwold: As Senator Hicks indicated in his
speech, and as the Honourable Mitchell Sharp has indicated, too, in this particular instance, certainly, there is no
doubt that the Arabs were the aggressors.
The point I am making is that so long as the Arabs were
on the offensive and things looked favourable for them, no
action was taken by the Security Council, but when the
forces of Israel started reversing the situation and it
became apparent that the Arabs were in serious danger of
being overrun by Israel, then the Security Council acted.
The Israeli troops were within 20 or 25 miles of Damascus,
and were moving forward on the Golan Heights. The
Egyptian Third Army of almost 20,000 men was surrounded, or nearly surrounded, and the Israeli forces on the west
bank of the Suez had progressed to within 40 or 50 miles of
Cairo. At that stage, suddenly, the Security Council acted
quickly to bring the war to a stop. Fortunately, the war
was stopped.

a

(1500)

The point I am making is that the cease-fire did not
occur until that took place. I suppose I may be considered
pessimistic, but personally I believe that if the tide had
gone the other way, and the Arabs had continued their
forward momentum, the war would have gone on for much
longer before the Security Council took action.
Honourable senators, the impotence of the United
Nations in dealing with matters involving Israel's interests is historically apparent. We have the problems of air
piracy and acts of terrorism, we have all these terrible
things going on, but they have never been discussed in any
United Nations forum with results that have amounted to
anything more than a little rhetoric. In fact, the record
shows that the Security Council has adopted Middle East
resolutions only when they do not specifically criticize the
policies or actions of Arab governments.
Six countries which are currently members of the Security Council-and that represents more than one-third of
that body-have no diplomatic relations with Israel. These
include two of the five permanent members of the Security Council members, namely, Russia and China. These
countries, because they are permanent members, are able
to veto any substantive resolution that is put before the
Council. That is the situation that exists in the Security
Council.
It is interesting to note that 38 of the 132 member states
of the United Nations have no diplomatic relations with
Israel, and 13 of the 32 states constituting the Human
Rights Commission in the year 1972-which is the latest
year for which I could get figures-maintain no diplomatic
relations with Israel. We see developing in the United
Nations these rigid power blocs, in which the interests of
the power blocs become paramount, superseding and overriding any particular individual problem of a single

SENATE DEBATES
nation. There are power blocs that are based on African
states, Arab states, and Communist states and it seems to
me that more and more the United Nations is developing
in that way.
It was my special interest to attend the meetings of the
Human Rights Committee. Last year the United Nations
celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of its Declaration
of Human Rights. I want to read to members of the Senate
the kind of statements that are made in so far as human
rights are concerned, as they affect Israel and the Middle
East. I have a copy of the statement made by the Israeli
delegate at the meeting of the Human Rights Committee,
part of which reads as follows:
When we deal with Human Rights such as freedom of
speech and expression, freedom of assembly, freedom
of movement, equal treatment before the law as well
as social and economic rights, I can firmly state that
the Arab population under Israeli administration
enjoys a measure of Human Rights unknown to it in
the past.
No amount of repetition of the so-called crimes of
Israel will undo the facts as seen by hundreds of
thousands of visitors from all nationalities and walks
of life who are free to visit and speak with whomever
they like, among them hundreds of thousands of
Arabs who live in neighbouring countries and come on
repeated visits to their families.
This is borne out by the attitude of the one million
Arabs within areas cortrolled by Israel in these trying
days in the wake of the Syrian and Egyptian aggression since October 6.
I will quote the response of the delegate from Syria,
taken from the record given to me by a member of the
Canadian delegation. The representative of the Syrian
Arab Republic, exercising his country's right of reply to
Israel on October 18, 1973, said:
Israel's statement could perhaps have raised money
in the streets of New York, but in the United Nations
Israel meets the opposition of at least 130 nations.
Israel, you survive like vampires on Arab blood.
You control nothing outside the United States of
America, you lost the world's sympathy, you are the
new nazis.
Your cynical doctrine of so-called supremacy will
end in nothing.
If you have things to sell, go to the streets and sell
them, but do not come here. We have business to do.
The road to Damascus does not pass through the
United Nations. Your road to Damascus just passes
through Hell!
That is the Syrian delegate speaking to the Israeli delegate
in the Committee on Human Rights. Syria, the nation that
only under the very greatest pressure after the cease-fire,
finally had the decency to give a list of the names of
Israeli prisoners of war, in accordance with the Geneva
Convention.
Honourable senators, this is the situation that exists,
and this is the position that countries like Israel and
others find themselves in when they are involved in a
confrontation with the power blocs.
[Hon. Mr Buckwold.]

April 3, 1974

Having said all that I am still a firm believer in the
United Nations, and I am sure that the government of
Israel has no intention of using any means other than this
world forum to present the case of Israel. The United
Nations must continue, is spite of the problems I have
pointed out, and I would hope that Canada and other
nations which have always adopted a neutral attitude in
these affairs, and which have seen fit to respond to cases
of injustice and shown concern where concern is needed,
will continue to maintain their support of the United
Nations so that in due course such injustices will be
eradicated, and the world will indeed be a place where war
is banished forever.
On motion of Senator Martin, debate adjourned.
VETERANS' LAND ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from earlier this day the adjourned
debate on the motion of Senator Connolly (Ottawa West),
for the second reading of Bill C-17, to amend the Veterans'
Land Act.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Honourable senators, Senator Connolly
will speak at this time.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: I wish to inform the Senate that
if the Honourable Senator Connolly speaks now his speech
will have the effect of closing the debate on the motion for
the second reading of this bill.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: On a point of order, honourable
senators, I believe it is quite possible for Senator Connolly
to respond to the question asked without necessarily closing the debate.
The Hon. the Speaker: I assumed he was closing the
debate. I would ask the Honourable Senator Connolly if he
is replying to questions?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I can do both at the
same time, but I suggest that I reply only to the questions
at this time, and that will not have the effect of closing the
debate.
Senator Thompson asked some questions last night, the
first of which was as to whether, if a husband and wife
were both veterans, each would be eligible for benefits
under the Veterans' Land Act.
The short answer to that, honourable senators, is that
section 14 of the regulations under the act provides that if
a husband and wife are both eligible veterans, and a
certificate of qualification is issued to each of them, only
one such certificate shall be in effect at any one time
unless evidence is submitted as to legal separation. In
other words, either of them can use it, but they may not
both use it at the same time and meet the other requirements of the act.
The second question that Senator Thompson asked was
as to eligibility of a veteran, who has received alternative
benefits in the form of university training, to apply for
benefits under the Veterans' Land Act.
*

(1510)

I am informed that university training benefits were
available under the Veterans Rehabilitation Act. Section

April 3, 1974

April 3,1974

SENA TE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES

10 of that act states that a veteran who received such
benefits for a period not exceeding nine months is eligible
to apply for financial assistance under the farming, smallholdings or commercial fishing sections of Part I of the
Veterans' Land Act if he repaid the assistance he received
under the university training program.
I come now to Senator Williams' remarks in which he
indicated that it is his understanding that veterans who
are Indians are entitled only to two-thirds of the benefits
which other veterans might be able to qualify for under
the provisions of the Veterans' Land Act. I am informed,
first of all, that an application from a veteran who is an
Indian for a loan under the Veterans' Land Act for the
purpose of acquiring land-either a large holding or a
smallholding-or operating a commercial fishing enterprise, for operations which are not to be conducted on
lands reserved for Indians-that is to say off a reserve-is
treated in the same way as any similar application from a
non-Indian, and the same criteria apply. That is the first
point, and I think it is one that should be made very clear.
I hope that I have made it clear, or at least as clear as is
necessary.
I have some further information here which may be of
interest to honourable senators. I am sorry Senator Williams is not present to hear it, but no doubt he can read it
in Hansard when he has an opportunity. If a veteran who
is an Indian wants to settle on Indian reserve lands under
the Veterans' Land Act, he can get a grant-not a loan, but
a grant-of $2,320. This grant is non-repayable if he meets
the normal criteria under the Veterans' Land Act, and
remains on the land for a period of 10 years. I am informed
that it is very difficult for the Veterans' Land Act
administration to police these situations, and so it is done
through the co-operation of the Department of Indian
Affairs.
I think honourable senators will also be interested to
know that the same rules apply with respect to the grant
of $2,320 to both Indians and non-Indians who want to
settle on federal or provincial lands, and the administration under the Veterans' Land Act administers this program. This program is dealt with in section 45 of the act.
The program which involves an Indian settling on reserve
lands, and getting a benefit under the Veterans' Land Act,
is dealt with in section 46 of the act.
It may be of further interest to honourable senators to
know that in the annual report of the Department of
Veterans Affairs, 1972-73, at page 73, the following footnote appears.
In addition, 1,783 Indian veterans have been approved
for settlement on Indian Reserves; 1,701 of them have
been settled, and $3,819,306 have been expended on
this.
I think that that perhaps answers the questions.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I think the matter is closed.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators, before the
debate is concluded I am going to suggest to the Senate
that there may be a way out of the difficulty with which
we are faced. I think the difficulty lies in the fact that for
various reasons it might not be an appropriate action to
refer this bill to a committee, and thereby hold up third
reading and royal assent. Nevertheless, there seems to be a

231
231

general feeling in the Senate that a committee of the
Senate should immediately, or as soon as possible, make
an inquiry into various matters that have been raised by
honourable senators.
It is a matter of wonder to me, because I have not been
closely involved with the question of the Veterans' Land
Act, that these viewpoints have not been put to the minister before now, or certainly have not been put in a way
that has been effective. I say that because as recently as
March 1 the minister informed the other place that he had
looked into the whole matter and that he had decided to
make no changes. I do not criticize the minister on this
account, but we are faced with a situation in which we do
not have the time to give the attention to this bill that
obviously many senators would like.
I suggest, therefore, that a solution that might be acceptable to honourable senators would be to apply the "Hayden formula" in reverse. That formula, as we are all aware,
consists of obtaining the permission of the Senate for the
Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce to inquire into either the subject matter of a bill, or
the bill itself, before it comes before us. My suggestion in
this instance is that we reverse this procedure, and accept
a motion that the matter be referred to the appropriate
committee of the Senate, such reference to take effect
immediately after the bill has received the royal assent.
The committee would then be able to go to work immediately, and immeasurable benefits to veterans might result,
as has been suggested by many speakers.
I believe such a motion would be in order under rule 36,
which reads:
(1) When a question is under debate a motion shall
not be received unless to amend it, to refer it to a
committee, to postpone it to a certain day, for the
previous question, or for the adjournment of the
Senate.
I realize that a motion to refer this bill to a committee at
this time would impede its progress, so I move, therefore-and I hope I have a seconder-that the subject
matter of the bill be referred to the appropriate standing
committee of the Senate, such reference to take effect
immediately after the bill has received the royal assent.
Hon. Leopold Langlois: Honourable senators, I have the
honour to be one of those ex-members of the House of
Commons who had the privilege, shortly after the war, of
sitting on the non-partisan Veterans Affairs Committee of
the other place which worked for several months on the
drafting of the legislation known today as the Veterans'
Charter. I am very proud of having participated with my
other colleagues of the Senate and the House of Commons
at that time on this important legislation.
I agree heartily with the suggestion made by Senator
Grosart. I even discussed a move of this kind with Senator
Argue before I came into the bouse this afternoon. I
should say, however, that I do not feel that we need to
form a special committee to carry out the study. This
matter could be referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welf are and Science.
*

(1520)

Hon. Mr. Grosart: I should inform the honourable senator that my motion-and I presume he is speaking to the

SENATE DEBATES
motion, because it was seconded by Senator Carter-is
that the subject matter of the bill be referred to the
appropriate standing committee.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I understand also that your motion
is not to amend this bill?
Hon. Mr. Grosart: No.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: And this reference is to take effect
after the bill has received royal assent?
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I am in full agreement with that,
and hope that this will be done as soon as possible after
the Easter recess.
Hon. W. M. Benidickson: Honourable senators, it satisfies me if senators are to examine later some of the
complaints regarding the existing statute which were
referred to in the debate yesterday and today. Senator
Connolly has just given to us a reply to the question
raised by Senator Thompson yesterday. I also have had
representations from women veterans, who point out to
me that the definition of "veteran" contained in the act
should be prevailing over all. The women veterans represent that there should not be introduced simply in a
regulation a discrimination that is in contradiction to the
definition of a "veteran" in the main act. In my opinion,
the committee should consider this point. Senator Connolly, who is learned in the law, could glance at the definition
of a "veteran" in the act even before he closes this debate
and see if regulation 14 is not a contravention of that
definition in respect of rights of both a husband and wife,
each of whom is a veteran.
Hon. Hazen Argue: Honourable senators, as a member
of the Senate who wishes the Senate to take action on this
question, I welcome Senator Grosart's motion. We were
discussing this general question a few minutes ago outside
the chamber, but I did not tell him that I had discussed
with Senator Langlois the possibility of a motion such as
this. Senator Grosart said "You know, I think we could
use the Hayden formula in reverse. Why do you not do it?"
I told him that he was an authority on the rules, and that
he was the man to do it because he had a standing in the
Senate. I said that if he moved the motion it would be
adopted, but if I moved it some would say, "Oh, just
another harebrained idea."
In any event, I believe it to be an excellent idea. The
Senate committee, I believe, will do a good job, and will
bring in a recommendation that will be supported by the
veterans of this country. I suggest that whatever government is in power a year from now-I think it will be a
Liberal government-will consider the report of the committee favourably. The support that the report will receive
will influence the existing government to continue and
improve the act in the interests of the veterans, and the
Senate will have played an important part.
Hon. Andrew Thompson: Honourable senators, I was
also in the corridor with Senator Grosart and Senator
Argue. I told Senator Grosart that I would support his
motiorn, and it is for that reason that I rise. It is also
because I appreciate very much the detailed replies to my
two questions that Senator Connolly received from the
minister.
[Hon. Mr. Grosart.]

April 3, 1974

However, I agree with Senator Benidickson, and would
like to follow up the matter of the married couple who are
veterans, because I feel that should receive further study.
For example, we know that the principle of the Canada
Pension Plan is that those who contribute, man and wife,
will receive their individual benefits. I feel that there is no
question that the women who served in the forces made
their own individual contribution, as did the men.
I know also that when I was in the navy Senator Connolly travelled over to inspect the naval headquarters at
Niobe, and that he must have used the very efficient and
dedicated service of the Wrens there. I am sure that
Senator Neiman, who was a distinguished officer in the
WRNS, would support a more thorough study of this
matter. Therefore, I agree thoroughly that this matter
should be referred to a committee for further study.
I would say also that a point that concerned me was one
raised by Senator Beaubien, that really this is a dead issue
because of the fact that those veterans who have not made
a declaration of intent in the past to take advantage of
these benefits are no longer entitled to receive them. I
noticed in the answer to my question with respect to
veterans who have received benefits other than those
provided under the Veterans' Land Act, such as educational or technical assistance, that provided they repay an
amount they are eligible under Part II of the act. I believe
that a number of veterans are still unaware of this, and
perhaps we who are veterans should blame ourselves
because we are not up to date on it. A number of senators
have remarked to me that they did not know this, and will
pass the information on to other veterans. However, I did
understand from the matter raised by Senator Beaubien
that unless the veteran had made a declaration in the past
he will not be allowed to apply for any benefits under this
legislation.
By referring the question to a committee, as proposed by
Senator Grosart, we will be able to look further into these
matters. Therefore, I heartily endorse his motion.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Honourable senators, by way of
explanation, I would say that I hope the revelations of
what took place in a certain caucus will not be regarded as
precedent.
Hon. Charles McElman: Honourable senators, I would
simply like to say that I was the fourth member of that
unlikely meeting outside the doors. I support fully the
proposition put forward by Senator Grosart. In my opinion, it is an excellent solution. The problems which still
face us and the veterans in relation to this piece of legislation should undergo careful study. I agree that the
representations that will be made after such an examination should have a real effect on the government. I support
the motion.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Who is the chairman of your caucus?
Hon. Mr. Argue: Senator Grosart.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, there is a
motion before the house for the second reading of this bill,
and I have strong doubts as to whether another motion
can be considered at this time. I think I should allow the
Honourable Senator Connolly to speak to his motion at
the present time. I should also inform you that if he does
speak he will close the debate on second reading.

April 3, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Mr. Grosart: On a point of order, honourable
senators. May I ask if it is not the intention to put the
motion?
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, it does not
seem to me that this is the appropriate time for this
motion. If it is the intention of the HGnourable Senator
Grosart to move such a motion, then the time to do so is
after this bill has been passed. Perhaps he can obtain an
undertaking from the opposite side to agree to such a
motion, but it is my opinion that this is not the time for it.
0 (1530)

Hon. Mr. Martin: It seems to me that no motion is really
necessary. We understand the nature of Senator Grosart's
suggestion, the principle of which was discussed before we
came into the chamber. His intervention was helpful, but
Senator Argue or any other honourable senator can move
immediately after Easter that this matter be referred to
the Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and
Science for study. There would be no problem. We all
agree that this can be done.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I make it clear that I am in no way
questioning Your Honour's ruling. The reason why I made
the motion at this time is because the kind of motion now
suggested would require notice, and it would involve a
longer process. That is why I suggested that we should
deal with it in this manner. I would merely ask whether
Your Honour foresees any time during the progress of the
bill through the Senate when such a motion might be
acceptable. Would it be on third reading, or following
third reading?
I ask for Your Honour's opinion, which you may not
wish to give at this moment. Perhaps in due course Your
Honour will be able to advise me as to when you would
regard such a motion as being in order.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Does the honourable senator not
think that he could give notice? We could require that he
give notice, and have a more extended debate before referring the matter to committee. A great deal could be
achieved by such a general discussion. The consensus is
clear, and a consensus is every bit as good as a formal
motion.
It would seem that the point made by Madam Speaker is
valid, that the introduction of the motion at this stage is
clearly not in order, but we are all in agreement with the
suggestion.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I have not questioned Her Honour's
ruling.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, it is my
understanding that the Senate can do anything it wishes.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Certainly.
The Hon. the Speaker: Perhaps the honourable senator
would like to move his motion after the bill has received
third reading. I ask the house whether it so agrees. Despite
other rules, the Senate can do what it wishes in respect of
this matter.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Honourable senators, on a bill which contains so few provisions, this has
certainly developed into a spirited and informative debate.

27601-16

In general, it can be said that the Senate is genuinely
interested in the legislation and would like to do as much
as it can-I think this is the unanimous view of senators
on both sides of the house-to assist veterans who require
help.
I am indebted to Senator Beaubien for his views. He said
that what is now required is a review of the use and
purpose of the programs operated under the aegis of the
Veterans' Land Act.
Senator Beaubien suggested, in effect, that a new policy
is now needed for veterans, not only in respect of matters
covered by the provisions of the act, such as the size of the
lots, the ceiling on loans, and so on, but also in respect of
veterans who qualify or could qualify under this bill, and
who have now retired from positions in civilian life.
It would be a major policy change to propose that the
provisions of the Veterans' Land Act be invoked for the
purchase of condominiums, because the provision respecting the purchase of land by veterans was to enable veterans to settle on the land. Perhaps I do not know very much
about condominiums but I think that when one is living in
a condominium one is as far from the land as it is possible
to be. However, that does not detract for a moment from
the merits of the proposition, that this kind of benefit
should be available to veterans who wish to acquire a
condominium.
Senator Carter stressed the importance of changes in
policy, and suggested an extension of the time period in
which a veteran could apply for a loan. He also mentioned
unrealistic ceilings in the light of economic conditions
presently prevailing in the country. We should ask ourselves-I think this is something that honourable senators
might consider when they decide to investigate the policy
behind, and purposes of, the Veterans' Land Act-whether, by making such changes and providing a better deal for
veteitans who apply later rather than earlier, some of the
earlier applicants might be disaffected in some way.
Senator Buckwold, if I understood him correctly, mentioned a point that should be of concern to the Senate. He
suggested that the program might be shifted from under
the umbrella of the Veterans' Land Act, or from the
administration of the Department of Veterans Affairs, to
the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation.
Those who are genuinely interested in the problems of
veterans might be a little concerned about such a step. I
am of the opinion that veterans are probably happier in
having their affairs administered by the department
which was set up to look after their interests. Personally, I
would be a little afraid that if a program such as this were
shifted to another department, away from the Department
of Veterans Affairs, the welfare and interest of veterans
might be lost. However, that is a matter for consideration.
Honourable senators, I come now to the matter of
having the bill considered in committee. The consensus
arising from today's debate seems to be that since arrangements have been made to have royal assent given this bill
later this day, the bill should not be referred to committee
before royal assent. That being the consensus, I shall not
move a motion to refer the bill to the appropriate
committee.
With reference to Senator Grosart's motion, as the
Leader of the Government has said, we are all in agree-

SENATE DEBATES
ment with the idea behind it. I was impressed by the
suggestion of the Leader of the Government that if a
notice of motion is put on the Order Paper, a debate could
follow. Perhaps we do not need any further debate than
that held yesterday and today, but such a motion could
engender a debate on the importance of reviewing not
only the administration of and policy behind the Veterans' Land Act but also other aspects of the Veterans'
Charter.
I do not think that we can have two motions before the
Senate at the same time, unless one is an amendment of
the main motion. Perhaps the easiest way of dealing with
the problem-and Senator Grosart indicated as much-is
to have a notice of motion placed on the Order Paper at
the convenience of Senator Grosart or any other honourable senator who might agree to sponsor it. It is, of course,
open to any honourable senator to move a motion on
almost any subject at any time. It is true that notice has to
be given, but that is the right of any honourable senator.
*

(1540)

Honourable senators, I think I have dealt with all the
points that have been raised. I hope that there will be a
reference to the appropriate committee of the questions of
policy and other details that have been raised in this
debate. Such matters are worth considering, and I think
the Standing Senate Committee on Health, Welfare and
Science would be the appropriate committee to do that.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

VETERANS' LAND ACT
SUBJECT MATTER OF BILL C-17 REFERRED TO STANDING
SENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH, WELFARE AND SCIENCE

Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators, in deference to the opinion expressed by Senator Connolly, I
move, with leave of the Senate and notwithstanding rule
45(1)(e), that the subject matter of Bill C-17, to amend the
Veterans' Land Act, be referred to the Standing Senate
Committee on Health, Welfare and Science, such reference
to take effect when the said bill has received royal assent.
In explanation, honourable senators, the reason I am
putting this motion now is that there has been some delay
in this bill's reaching the Senate. We have been accused of
delaying it unnecessarily. I think this motion at this time,
rather than at some later date, will indicate to all who may
be concerned the determination of the Senate to discharge
its duty in relation to this matter, as well as other matters,
notwithstanding delays that are beyond our control in
bills coming before us.
Motion agreed to.

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Honourable senators, in view of the consensus at this time, with leave of
the Senate and notwithstanding rule 45(1)(b), I move that
the bill be read the third time now.
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.

(1410)

Honourable senators, as usual I should like to give the
house an idea of the workload for the week ahead. On
Monday evening we shall proceed with third reading of
Bill S-3 which was reported on this afternoon, and also
with second reading of Bill C-5, the Canadian National
Railways Financing and Guarantee bill. It is hoped that
Parliament may adjourn on Wednesday for the Easter
recess.
In addition to the Canadian National Railways Financing and Guarantee bill, there are a number of inquiries on
the Order Paper which we hope to proceed with next
week. Senator Norrie has given notice this afternoon that
on Monday next she will call the attention of the Senate to
land use in Canada. Bill S-2, to amend the Animal Contagious Diseases Act, is still in the Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture and I understand that a number of
witnesses are still to be heard. I further understand it is
likely that a motion will be made on Monday evening, or
sometime next week, authorizing this committee to sit
during the Easter recess so that it may complete its work.
We shall continue our consideration of Bill S-4, to
amend the Criminal Code (control of weapons and firearms), introduced by Senator Cameron. It is hoped that
this bill will receive second reading, after which it may be
referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and
Constitutional Affairs. However, I am informed that
before that happens there are several senators who are
interested in speaking on second reading.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, I understand that
when Senator Langlois referred to the intention of Parliament to adjourn on Wednesday next he meant the louse

April 4, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

of Commons, of course. The House of Commons has
indicated its desire to adjourn next Wednesday.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: We would like to do so, too, and that
constitutes Parliament.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I should like to know what it is expected that we should do before Wednesday next, not taking
into account the opinion of that honourable member of the
other place who is always mean-mouthing us. What is to
be dealt with urgently before we adjourn?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: It is expected that we may be able to
dispose of the CNR Financing and Guarantee bill, but
that, of course, is up to the Senate. Then probably there
will be third reading of the Motor Vehicle Tire Safety bill,
which was read a second time, sent to committee and a
report of which committee was adopted today. I do not
think there will be anything else.
Hon. Mr. Martin: We do not expect to deal with the bill
to amend the Animal Contagious Diseases Act.
Motion agreed to.

QUEBEC PROVINCIAL POLICE
FINANCIAL COMPENSATION FOR MAINTENANCE-QUESTION

Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, I should like to
put a question to the Leader of the Government.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I hope it is not very difficult.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: No, but the honourable leader will
remember that on March 13 I asked whether the Solicitor
General had taken a decision with regard to the request
addressed to him by Quebec's Minister of Justice concerning financial compensation for the maintenance of the
Quebec Provincial Police. Subsquently the leader said that
he expected the answer within a few days. Does the delay
result from the fact that the Solicitor General finds it
difficult to formulate his answer?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, as I told Senator
Flynn the other day in answer to the question that he had
put to me in my absence and which was replied to by
Senator Langlois, the Solicitor General told me that his
reply was not yet ready, he was preparing it. Now I am
asked if it is because the Solicitor General is finding some
dif ficulty. Well, that could be one of the reasons.

CRIMINAL CODE (CONTROL OF WEAPONS AND
FIREARMS)
BTLL TO AMEND-SECOND READING-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Tuesday, April 2, the
adjourned debate on the motion of Senator Cameron for
second reading of Bill S-4, to amend the Criminal Code
(control of weapons and firearms).
Hon. Gildas L. Molgat: Honourable senators, I find
myself in the same position as did the mover of this bill in
that I did not participate in the Throne Speech debate.
Therefore, before speaking to the bill I wish to associate
myself with his comments and those of senators who
participated in the Throne Speech debate in congratulating the mover and seconder of the motion for an Address,

Senator Robichaud and Senator Perrault. I was particularly interested, as a francophone not from the province of
Quebec, in the comments of Senator Robichaud about
minority groups in other provinces who hold strongly to
the bilingual position and who feel that this is a national
problem rather than a regional one.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Molgat: I also wish to say, Madam Speaker,
how pleased I am to see you once again gracing the
position that you hold as presiding officer of this chamber. You are doing a tremendous job, not simply for the
women of Canada but for all Canadians. The initiatives
you have taken have been good for the Senate and for
Parliament.
Honourable senators, Bill S-4, as the mover indicated, is
a repetition of the bill that was introduced last year. I
therefore do not propose to speak at length at this point. I
should like, however, to emphasize again that whatever
we do we should not allow the situation south of our
border to determine what we do as Canadians. We should
consider this whole question of gun control in a Canadian
context and not be overly influenced by what happens
across the line. The backgrounds and attitudes of Canadians and Americans are very different in this regard. I am
afraid that we often tend to be influenced by news stories
coming across our border. We should isolate the American
picture completely and look at this legislation from a
Canadian viewpoint. As I say, in this regard the background of Canadians is very different from that of Americans. It has never been the common practice for Canadians
to carry handguns. But it is a different thing across the
border. There has been control of handguns in this country
for many years, and I think successful control.
* (1420)

I intend to support second reading of the bill and I
approve the suggestion that it be referred to committee. I
hope the committee will take ample time to study the
legislation and allow Canadians the opportunity of coming
forward to express their views. Senator Cameron indicated that he had received considerable correspondence dealing with both sides of the issue. It is important that
Canadians who are concerned about this matter should be
permitted to come forward and express their views. I
recognize the cost involved in holding committee sittings
across the country. The Leader of the Government is
looking at me with some surprise, but I suggest that it
might be worthwhile to hold hearings outside Ottawa.
Hon. Mr. Laird: Would it be possible for the committee
to go to Florida?
Hon. Mr. Molgat: I doubt whether I could approve of
that venue, but certainly there are places in the Maritimes
and in Western Canada where the committee could meet.
A great deal of good could be achieved by having the
committee move across the country. I am sure that those
senators who worked on the Special Joint Committee on
the Constitution of Canada were very much aware of the
benefit to the Senate from the fact that the committee met
outside Ottawa. However, the greater benefit would be to
Canada as a whole. It is more convenient and economical
to meet in Ottawa, but we have a greater responsibility
than that. While this subject might not appear to be of

SENATE DEBATES
great national concern, there is a good deal of individual
concern, as Senator Cameron has discovered. It is a matter
of concern to many Canadians. They cannot be expected to
travel to Ottawa at their own expense to make their views
known. We have a responsibility to make it easy for them
to express their views. I therefore suggest that the committee consider holding meetings outside Ottawa.
To many urban dwellers in Canada this issue may not
appear to be important, but it is to those living in rural
areas. It affects not only their livelihood but their whole
way of life. As a parliamentary body we should give the
public every opportunity to be heard, and the best way of
doing that is by holding meetings in various parts of the
country.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: I should like to ask the honourable
senator whether this is a public bill that was introduced in
the Senate?
Hon. Mr. Molgat: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: What kind of response does the
senator think the committee would receive in Calgary
among a group of cowboys who carry revolvers on their
hips?
Hon. Mr. Molgat: I am afraid you are influenced by the
American vision in that regard, Senator Choquette. That
is what I was referring to earlier. I do not think that is the
Canadian concept. Our cowboys do not go around with
revolvers on their hips. It is true that in certain parts of
Canada firearms are used as a commonplace day-to-day
thing. The people in Calgary or Bow River may have very
different views on this subject than, say, the people of
Ottawa, Toronto and Montreal.
So I think it is important that we allow individuals in
Calgary or Bow River, or wherever, to express their views
before our committee, and quite frankly I don't think we
can accomplish that by sitting only in Ottawa.
Hon. Mr. Williams: Would your suggestion include
hearing Indians who live in the northernmost parts of
Canada and in the Arctic, many of whom live by hunting?
Hon. Mr. Molgat: That is another reason we should
travel throughout Canada, including the northern regions.
It is obvious that recommendations we propose might be
acceptable to people in urban areas but not to people in the
northern regions, particularly the Indian people. This is
something we will have to look at in its totality. I am
convinced that great benefit would be derived from
having the committee travel across Canada. We just have
to look at the experience of the Special Joint Committee
on the Constitution, which found it very useful to have
travelled. The whole of Canada benefited from it. It enabled many more Canadians to appear before the committee than would otherwise have been the case. In a sense, I
suppose, a committee serves the function of an ombudsman, and when a committee travels it brings Parliament
closer to the people.
Hon. Frederick William Rowe: Honourable senators, I
had not intended to speak on this subject this afternoon,
but Senator Molgat has made one or two points which
motivate me to say a few words. This is a very important
matter to me. May I preface my remarks by saying that
Senator Molgat's suggestion that hearings be held in dif[Hon. Mr. MoIgat 1

A pril 4, 1974

ferent parts of Canada is very important. Certain areas in
the provinces and territories, as Senator Williams said,
have hunting populations. Many of the inhabitants make
their living by the use of firearms. It is very important
that those people have no misunderstandings as to what is
being considered or proposed, and such misunderstandings
could easily arise. As Senator Cameron indicated the other
day, they could arise largely as the result of the unholy
propaganda that we in Canada are being subjected to, as
are our friends in the United States.
Senator Molgat made a very important and valid point
in saying that our actions should not be influenced by
what happens in the United States. On the other hand, I
am sure Senator Molgat would agree that we cannot
ignore the fact that, whether we like it or not, we aite
every hour and every day of our lives being subjected to a
barrage of propaganda from the United States. One can go
to a newsstand right now and pick up these so-called
outdoor magazines. This is not a sudden thought on ny
part; I have realized this for decades. A number of these
magazines are nothing but bouse organs for the National
Rifle Association and gun manufacturers and gun sellers
in the United States. One does not need to read more than
one issue to realize that; one has only to look at the
advertisements and the editorial content.
*

(1430)

As a matter of fact, for years and years when I was in
more active politics, although I never subscribed to any of
these periodicals I found them on my desk religiously
every week, every month, or at other periodic times. Howx
did they get there? They were sent to me. Time and Life
magazines did not send me copies of their issues. Why the
difference? The difference is that the former types of
magazine are propaganda machines. I saw it stated the
other day in an American publication editorial, wvith
which I agree, that the most potent single lobby in the
United States today is the National Rifle Association.
There is no doubt at all that that association is spending
hundreds of millions of dollars, not to convey the truth to
the people of the United States, and inferentially to
Canada, but to distort the truth.
Statisties, which are just as valid in Newfoundland as
they are in the State of Michigan, demonstrate that
undoubtedly there is a direct correlation between the
number of guns in circulation and the murder rate, In my
own province we have, I am happy to say, one of the
lowest murder rates anywhere in the world. Most murders
there are committed on the spur of the moment, and nany
of them are related to family disputes, yet most of then
are committed with a gun of one kind or another. I cannot
help thinking that if a gun were not available there on the
wall, which is where most Newfoundlanders keep their
guns, with ammunition ready to the hands of anybody
who wants to use a gun, the murder rate would be even
lower than it is in Newfoundland.
I do not know of anyone who has made a study of this
subject in the United States who does not agree that there
is a direct correlation between the murder rate and the
number of guns in circulation. As the number of guns in
circulation rises, so the murder rate rises. There is io
doubt about that. That, of course, does not invalidate what
is obvious, I think, to everybody, that even if there wer

April 4, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

no guns, but only clubs, knives, rocks or what have you,
there would still be a murder rate. Of course there would. I
do not know if this is a contradiction in terms or not, but
if there were no guns we could perhaps keep the murder
rate at a reasonable level-if there is such a thing for
murder rates.
Hon. Mr. Molgat: I wonder if I could ask a question of
Senator Rowe. You referred to a weapon on the wall being
used in a murder. How would registration change that?
The weapon would still be on the wall, would it not?
Hon. Mr. Rowe: Yes. It probably cannot be changed. I
was referring to that more to bolster the main argument,
that the presence or availability of a gun is a factor in the
picture. For example, in recent years there have been two
or three murders committed by Eskimos with guns. I do
not know how one could control that situation where
Eskimos must have guns in order to hunt seal and caribou,
but the fact is that even within that limited community,
the Eskimo community, there is a correlation between the
availability of guns and the murder rate. I am quite sure
that in some cases there would have been no murder if a
gun had not been immediately available. Very often
murder is committed-certainly in my province-after the
consumption of alcohol. I do not know the answer to
Senator Molgat's point, but the fact is that when a man
has a gun available it is easier for him to commit an
assault on another individual-particularly a lethal
assault.
Hon. Mr. Molgat: Honourable senators, I do not want to
pursue the matter. We can deal with these points in committee. However, I would just ask Senator Rowe if we are
talking about availability, or about registration.
Hon. Mr. Rowe: Honourable senators, I was not trying
to deal too specifically with either of those two things. I
was trying to enunciate the general principle that we
should not lose sight of. Almost every hour of the day we
are being propagandized in this way. An effort is being
made to convince us that there is no correlation between
the availability of guns of any kind and the murder rate.
This is not true. That is the point I am trying to establish.
The second point is that while I agree wholeheartedly
that we should not be unduly influenced by what happens
in the United States of America, nevertheless we cannot
ignore the fact that we are the subjects of their propaganda, just as much as the people living in New York or in
Texas. I have said before that a number of those great
corporations are prepared to go to great lengths to seduce
the young people of the United States and of other countries as well. Whether that seduction is in influencing the
thirteen-year-old girl or boy to take up the cigarette habit,
or whether it is a seduction in some other way, it is there
all the time.
Hon. Arthur Laing: Honourable senators, because of the
remarks of Senator Molgat and Senator Williams I would
like to add a few words. I am familiar with the north
country, and the people who make a living by the gun. A
gun and a knife are just as important to them as a reaper
is to those who harvest the Prairie crops. While I understand the bill is aimed at reducing crime, as it stands I
consider it would inflict an impossible requirement on
many Canadians in other parts of the country. It would be
impossible to ask them to hand over their guns, and be

tested as to whether or not they are competent to use a
gun, at a central point in Canada. So far as the North is
concerned, this is utterly impracticable and will not work
at all.
I was raised on a farm not far from Vancouver. There
were always four or five guns around. They were not used
or kept there to hold up banks, or to facilitate marriages. I
was born at a time when living off the land was at least
part of farming which was a way of life then, and in a
great part of Canada that is still so. My father had a
ten-gauge shotgun, a real blockbuster. I remember it was
the first one I ever shot a pintail duck with. I almost blew
my shoulder off at that time, because I was then aged nine.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: What happened?
Hon. Mr. Laing: I do not know how you qualify any
person to teach another how to use a gun. We were told at
an early age which end of a gun to stay away from. We
were warned, "Don't ever point that thing at anyone." We
were warned, on going through a barbed-wire fence, to
push the gun through first, and ourselves afterwards;
never to drag it through after us.
e (1440)

So how are you going to get anybody to inspect a
person's ability to use a gun? I cannot tell you. Either the
fellow has the ability, or he has not. The accidents which
have occurred have been caused by carelessness, by people
not thinking about the correct way to handle a gun.
I know that the bill is aimed at reducing crime, but I
think that Senator Molgat and Senator Williams were
right in their representations with respect to this bill. You
must consult the people to whom a great disservice would
be done if this bill is passed. It would be most impractical
for them to deliver themselves and their guns to a central
point to be inspected as to their ability to handle guns.
There are two kinds of people who know how to handle
guns-the people in the North, and the guys in the city
who want to hold up banks. Both know how to handle
guns. They do not need any help, but this bill will not
regulate either of them.
We should find out what the laws are at all levels of
government in Canada. I am not sure whether it is a civic
or provincial ordinance, but in Vancouver it is necessary
to register all handguns. The only guns not registered in
Vancouver are those in the hands of criminals. They don't
register them. They show up only after a fellow has held
up the bank and been arrested.
With all respect to Senator Cameron, who spoke well on
this bill and its objectives, I think we should follow the
advice given this afternoon and consult the people whose
living would be seriously affected. We should consult
them, as well as people in the cities of Canada generally.
Hon. Chesley W. Carter: Honourable senators, I supported this bill last year when it was before the Senate,
and I should like to indicate my support again at this time.
Like Senator Cameron, I received a large number of
letters from individuals and organizations most of whom
were against the bill. The reason for that seemed to be that
they had a misconception of what the bill is intended to
do. Somehow or other they had the idea that the purpose

SENATE DEBATES
of the bill was to deprive them of the privilege or right to
possess firearms.
As Serator Molgat pointed eut, the main purpose of the
bill is te regîster firearms, flot necessarily te deprive
persons, particularly those for whom firearms are a necessity, of their rights.
In my opinion, the registration of firearms, having
regard te the tîmes in which we live, is a necessity. It is
nlot so long ago-just three or four years-when terrerists
were breaking inte gun shops, hardware stores and armouries te steal ail kinds of rifles and ammunition, as well as
dynamite. When one sees wbat the world has become, with
50 many terrerist gangs springing Up and making use of
weapons, one begins te, realize that it is absolutely necessary te have seme method of tracing weapons once they
have been sold. I believe that registering weapons would
go a long way te acbieving that end. In my opinion, if it
were necessary te register firearms it would be much more
difficuit for the wrnng people te come by them, o-r te
retaîn them illegally.
Although 1 think the registration of firearms is necessary, I do flot feel we should convey the idea that it is the
purpose of the bill te deprive people of the legitimate use
of firearms.
I would further support Senator Molgat's suggestion
that the committee travel around Canada in order te get a
better understanding of the situation with respect te firearms. We sheuld find eut in what parts of Canada, as
Senator Laing has suggested, firearms are as essential te
their owners as the harvester is te the farmer. By doing
that we would be perferming twe services. we weuld be
making the Senate better knewn te the people of Canada,
te whom it is perhaps just a name, and, at the same time,
we weuld be ebtaining information te enable the committee te make useful recommendations te this chamber.
Before clesing my remarks I should like te ask a questien, which perhaps Senater Cameren could answer in the
absence of the chairman of the cemmittee. Last year thîs
bill was referred te the Standing Senate Cemmittee en
Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Se far as I cao discover,
it was neyer reperted. I should like te knew what measures could be taken te prevent a recurrence of that, and
alse whether any hearings were held by that cemmittee
last year.
Hon. Mr. Laird: Honourable senators, in the absence of
the chairman of the cemmîttee, perhaps 1 cao answer
Senator Carter's question. The bill was referred te the
Standing Senate Commîttee on Legal and Constîtutienal
Affairs. At that time, the commîttee was întensely
engaged in its study of the parele system, and ceuld net
devote time te anything tise. We înformed Senator Cameron at the time it was impossible for us really te de
anytbîng abeut thîs bill because ef our efferts te presenit a
report on the parele system. At thîs tîme, however, we are
net in that pesition, and we should be able, I weuld say, te
tra\'el fromn coast te ceast, up North and ail ever the
country. 1 am ratber loekîng forward te that.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: I suggest a geed mette for this
committee would be: "Have gun, will trdvel."
Hon. Mr. Laird: You gîve us the gun, and we'll do the
res t
Ii-on, Mr. carter.

Hon. Mr. Molgat: Would it be a registered gun?
Hon. Mr. Carneron: Honourable senators, apropes of
Senator Martin's suggestien that we dispose ef this bill
before we adjourn next week, I have a list of betwccn 12
and 20 individuals and erganizatiens wbe want te appear
before the cemmittee. I imagine, therefore, that the comn
mîttee bearings will go on for some time. The people on
this list reside ail over Canada, from Halifax te Vancouver. I suggest that, once the debate has concluded and we
have referred the bill te committee, the committee be
convened after the Easter recess, because these people do
have te bave some notice.
In that connection I beartily enderse Senator Molgat's
suggestion that the.commîttee beld bearings in certain key
cities such as Hamilton, Windsor, Winnipeg and Teronto,
because there is tremendeus interest in these areas.
Hon. Mr. Molgat: I am pleased te bear Senater Cameron

acceptance ef the proposition.

PRECINCTS AND CLERESTORY 0F CHAMBER-JEBATE

Hon. John J. Connolly (Ottawa West) rose pursuant te
notice:
That be will call the attention of the Senate te
certain elements witbin the precinctsoef the Sonate
Chamber and in partîcular te its clerestory.
He said: Honourable senators wîll be aware that a proj ect was recently completed in the chamber of the House
ef Cemmons whereby stained glass bas been installed in
ahl of its large windows. Each window was dedicated te a
province or territory. The theme adopted centcred around
the typical flower of the area. Miss Eleanor Mîlne, wbe bas
been in charge of the stene carvîng in thîs building for a
geed many years, was the movîng force behînd that
project, and I thînk it is a very worthy one.
I bave learned that a proposal bas been made te instaîl
stained glass in the clerestery of thîs chamber-that is te
say, in the eight apertures in the upper walls of' the
chamber proper, and three in the area of the north and
south galleries. If thîs is te be done, I believe that the
present generatien of senaters sheuld try te ensure that
the work is well planned, and that the subject matter te be
treated be fully appropriate.
I tbînk it wîll be agreed that the chamber of the Senate
of Canada is one of the most beautiful rooms in thcountry. Its architect had a fine idea of both design and
functien. He carried it off by imparting te thbe structure a
great dignity, without making it luxurieus or ostentations.
Many of its features are apprepriately symbolîc, as they
should be. The hîgh standard set in thîs chamber in cci lier

April 4, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

This chamber is an important place in Canada. It is the
only place in the country wherein the three elements of
Parliament meet at the same time. This happens only at
the opening and closing of sessions, and for royal assent.
Here we have the Throne, symbolic of the monarchy.
Indeed, it has been used by various of our monarchs, and
by the monarch's representative, the Governor General.
Here, too, we have the area used by the Senate, the second
element of Parliament. Here, too we have the bar and the
podium for the Speaker of the House of Commons, the
representative of the House of Commons, beyond which
the members of the lower house, by long tradition and
usage, cannot advance. Even the fourth estate, the press,
has an area allocated to it in the north gallery, although
with the advent of television the media, because proper
facilities elsewhere are lacking, have on occasion invaded
the f loor of the chamber itself within the bar.
Again, at the opening of each session, this chamber is
the unique place where the three major elements of our
constitutional establishment--the legislative, the executive and the judicial-meet together formally.
If the structure and the embellishments of the Senate
chamber convey a sense of the dignity of Parliament, the
periodic gatherings here of the elements of our parliamentary system and our constitutional organization proclaim
the importance, authority and responsibility of the central
element of our federal state.
The bountiful natural and human resources of our country have contributed mightily to the embellishment of the
chamber. The gold leaf in the ceiling is from within our
very earth. Inspired designers and craftsmen have impaled
upon it the symbols of our founding peoples-the fleur de
lis of France, the lions rampant of England, the lion of
Scotland, the dragon of Wales, the harp of Ireland, and
then, of course, the maple leaves. There are many other
peoples in this country now, and in time their symbols
must.find their place in this chamber.
All around the borders of the ceiling are the names of
some of the earlier governors general. I do not recite all,
but on the east border we find, starting at the north end,
the names of Grey, Stanley, Lansdowne, Connaught,
Minto, and Lorne. Most of the contemporary connotations
associated with these names are related to athletic
endeavour in Canada, and for that reason I call the east
border "the border of the sportsmen."
Stone from our rich rocks, fossilized Manitoba limestone, is here too, and it has been carved and shaped
beautifully to harmonize with the other embellishments,
and to emphasize how sturdy and responsible the lawmaker must be.
Wood from our pristine forest, white oak, is here, polished to reveal its inherent beauty, carved, shaped and cut
by the hands of master craftsmen. All of the carving is full
of appropriate symbolism.
I have long thought that the area of the Throne was less
appropriate than the other arrangements in this chamber,
and that we could do better. The lines of the dais with the
canopy have been borrowed, appropriately, from the
Throne area in the House of Lords at Westminster. However, I think them a poor imitation of one of Pugin's

masterpieces, and if we are not to have an appropriate
Throne, there may be another way.
At present we have a rather theatrical structure and the
clever use of light to focus attention on the Throne when
the house is not in session, and the presence of the Speaker when it is. The hidden frame of this structure is made
of lumber. It is draped with heavy red material. The chairs
are ornate Victorian furniture, and traditional use cannot
give them, in my view, either beauty or comfort.
Behind this dais could be installed an immense slab of
native Canadian rock, and upon it we could have carved
the Canadian coat of arms. Instead of the existing contrivance, I think a stone carving, with our coat of arms
engraved upon it, would be an appropriate background for
the Throne area. Even if stark, it would be genuine, it
would be true, and it would be basically Canadian.
If we are not to have a Throne in the traditional form,
then consideration should be given to the use of two chairs
of estate, similar to those used by the monarch and the
consort before the anointing at the coronation. The chair
of estate embodies at once a grace of design and a utility
which is appropriate. It should not overburden our imagination to devise a suitable canopy to be affixed to the
stone background, and a fitting platform for the Throne
and the Speaker's chair, also perhaps of stone.
There remains the question of the chair of the Speaker.
In the House of Lords the Lord Chancellor, as honourable
senators know, presides from the woolsack.
Hon. Mr. Martin: He sits on a woolsack.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Yes, and he presides
from it too.
Hon. Mr. Martin: He does?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Yes, indeed.
The inspiration for the woolsack is in a significant
element-of early imperial trade. We should be able to find
some elements of Canadian life and culture around which
to build a Speaker's chair to harmonize with a new Throne
area, if we have one.
I say nothing here about the pictures which hang in this
chamber, and which were commissioned by Lord Beaverbrook and others, in some cases of Canadian artists, in the
First World War, and presented by him to Canada. While
Senator Paterson, whose experienced judgment in such
matters we all respect, has praised them, other opinions do
exist. In any event, the original plans for the chamber call
for galleries on either side of the chamber, and if they are
ever provided, the pictures would be removed.

e

(1500)

Honourable senators, it has taken me too long to come to
the question raised by the inquiry, and I temper my
apology with the plea that whatever is done in the clerestory should harmonize with both the existing structure
and its embellishments and the historical and symbolic
features which they portray.
The chamber's clerestory has four large apertures on
each of the east and west walls, and each aperture has
three arched openings supported by graceful fluted marble
pillars. These pillars and their reddish hue provide a
lightness in colour and structure which is a credit to the
designers of the windows. Each of these arched windows

SENATE DEBATES

April 4, 1974

or openings has two long narrow leaded lights set in stone,
and above each light there is glazed tracery in the stone.
In the north gallery the two apertures are of similar
design but of two arches only, while in the south gallery
there is one aperture and it has three arches.
The theme or subject matter of any stained glass to be
installed here is of great importance. As they were in the
gothic cathedrals of the middle ages, good stained glass
windows can be stories which reach the heart through the
eyes instead of entering at the ears. They can be epic and
heroic poetry in colour, and if the poetry is historical and
didactic it will both teach and inspire.

Hon. Donald Cameron: Honourable senators, I hesitate
to follow the eloquent presentation of Senator Connolly,
and consequently my interjection will be brief.

We are gradually making of this building which houses
our Parliament a national shrine worthy of a great people.
We commemorate our heroic dead of the wars in the tower
dedicated to the peace for which they fought and died. In
stone we tell the stories of our historic roots, of our
teeming resources and of the activities of our people. We
can continue this work in the glazing of this clerestory.
We can fill its lights with beautiful and glorious colour
to record great events and great men from our earliest
days.
And we have options. One of the options for the installation of stained glass in these windows surely would be a
memorial to the discoverers, the explorers and settlers of
our territory from its beginnings. In this concept the
aboriginal people would not be forgotten. Here too would
the Europeans be found, those Europeans who came here
and mapped our coasts-Cartier, Cabot and others in the
East; Cook and Vancouver in the West; Frobisher, Hudson
and others In the North. Champlain and his brothers and
the early missionaries would not be forgotten for their
heroic penetration of the central wilderness, nor would La
Vérendrye who, in the words of Professor Lower,
"revealed the Prairies to the world," Frazer, who reached
the Pacific first on the overland route from the East, and
Mackenzie, the first to see whales in the inlets of our
northern sea.
Honourable senators, who is to deny the title "explorer"
to the early traders, to the first railroaders or the early
prospectors? And who is not to say that there are Canadian explorers yet to come in sciences which deal with the
sea and with space, or any of the branches of physical,
biological or sociological learning, or in the arts? Perhaps
the designer of such windows should be endowed with a
little of the wisdom of both the seer and the prophet.
I hope that some of these ideas will commend themselves to the interest of my colleagues in the Senate.
Perhaps we should consider the establishment of a small
committee, and invite historians, architects and artists to
contribute to our deliberations. From such deliberations, I
believe, a further theme and plan would emerge for the
installation of stained glass in the clerestory.

Senator Connolly's suggestion that their place be taken
by a series of paintings illustrative of the variety and
growth of this country from the indigenous peoples right
through to the modern industrialized country we see today
would enrich the chamber. In my judgment, an expenditure on something like this would be much more appropriate than the expenditures on the so-called works of art we
see in front of the Lester B. Pearson Building and other
buildings in Ottawa, for which we have paid some very
high prices. The same amount of money spent on the kind
of paintings Senator Connolly has suggested would, in my
view, be a move in the right direction, and would be most
appropriate.

In any event, honourable senators, our objective should
be to provide in this chamber of Parliament a shrine to
embody the symbols of parliamentary institutions and the
great events and great people of our past. It could ennoble
the aspirations of future generations of Canadians, it
could inspire our youth for generations to come, by portraying the magnificence and grandeur of the human
achievement by which our beloved country was founded.

Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, I think we
have every reason to be grateful to Senator Connolly for
raising this matter in the Senate at this time. It may not
be one of the burning issues facing government, Parliament or the nation, but it is one of great importance to
Canada. The beauty and dignity of this chamber should be
preserved. Steps should be taken from time to time to
strengthen its charm and architectural excellence.

[Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West)

Some of you will recall that the late Senator Roebuck on
more than one occasion decried the paintings decorating
this chamber. I do not wish to reflect on those paintings in
any way, but it occurs to me that it would be much more
appropriate to have these moved to the new National
Defence building-now that we have a National Defence
building. If there is not a place for historical paintings of
this kind there, then there should be. I think they would
be much more appropriate in those surroundings.

I heartily support the suggestion that a committee be set
up to plan and submit to the appropriate authorities a
program for the replacement of those paintings. Let me
say again that this is no reflection on the paintings. They
are good of their type, but I do not think they are suitable
for this chamber. They would be much more fitting in the
National Defence building.
Hon. Lionel Choquette: Honourable senators, may I add
one or two words which I think would be appropriate in
this context.
It was my privilege in September 1971 to visit Westminster and the House of Commons. That place, as we all
know, is not as beautiful as what we have here. It was
suggested to me at that time that I should report to the
Senate, but I did not do so because I was not there in an
official capacity.
Let me say, first of all, that there is not even a place
where the members can sit down and write notes; there
are simply long benches. I was shown a table in the centre
of the House of Commons chamber, which is somewhat
like the one we have here. It is, in fact, a gift from Canada.
But the front benchers usually put their feet up on top of
this table while the debates are going on, and the table is
consequently quite worn by those feet resting thereon.
The suggestion was made to me that at some time Canada
might donate a bar to be placed along that table, on which
those front benchers might put their feet.

We in Canada should be aware of the splendour of not
only the Senate chamber but the Parliament Buildings as
an ensemble-including the House of Commons and, of
course, the magnificent Peace Tower. I do not think I have
ever seen Parliament Buildings as monumental as ours.
They were built following the fire that destroyed the
former building towards the end of the First World War.
I have been a member of Parliament now for over 38
years, six years in this house and almost 33 years in the
House of Commons. I suppose i is because of this length
of tenure, for the longest part through process of election
and partly because of appointment, that I have come to
feel that these precincts are very much part of my life. We
all look upon them in that way, just as our homes are a
part of our lives, wherever they are and no matter how
humble or great and affluent they may be.
We point out to visitors, not in the careful detail Senator
Connolly did today, the symbolism which is to be found
in both houses. We remind them that, whatever may be
the weaknesses of the parliamentary institution, if it did
not exist there certainly would be a real threat to freedom
itself in our society, in our country. It is important for that
reason, and all the ancillary reasons which flow from that
concept, that we should give consideration to ways and
means of bringing home to the Canadian people, not only
the meaning, but the very charm and quality, the pretium
affectionis, that attends this chamber and the other bouse
of Parliament.
We only have to look at the Parliamentary Library, the
remaining monument of the buildings destroyed close to
the end of the First World War, to see the difference in the
structure and substance, but not necessarily in the beauty
or charm. We have continued the original architectural
concept of the earlier building, except that the tower is
now, of course, a much higher structure than the tower in
the old building.
So, Senator Connolly, a former Leader of the Government in the Senate and a long-standing senator, bas done
us, the nation and Parliament a service today by speaking
of these matters, matters that will certainly have a longterm value, which in any country is important indeed.
It is not, however, the Senate only that possesses this
charm, this beauty; it is the whole compound of the Parliament Buildings itself. There is the Centre Block, and I do
not overlook the architectural splendour of the East Block.
Then, too, there is the history, the beauty and charm of the
West Block.
I well remember-as I am sure Senator Laing, Senator
Lamontagne and perhaps other colleagues recall-the discussion which took place in the Cabinet before 1957, as to
what should be done about the West Block. A proposal was
made at that time by one of our colleagues that a new
external face should be given to the West Block, and that
there should be fundamental changes made to the interior
of the structure. The suggestion was even made that the
building should be torn down, and a more modern structure built to take account of the growing needs of government on Parliament Hill. I can say that that suggestion
was not accepted by the members of the Cabinet of that
day, who wished to preserve the external features of the

West Block. At very great expense, admittedly, internal
changes were made which have made that building more
functional and, in my opinion, more satisfactory. But the
exterior has happily not been altered.
Allow me to return to another feature of these Parliament Buildings-the tower itself. Sometimes one lives so
close to a building, or a painting, that one does not fully
appreciate the significance of what one sees. I believe,
however, that our tower is not only a great monument, but
a thing of beauty, to quote the very words of one of the
English poets. I worked under that tower as Minister of
National Health and Welfare for eleven years. It has
become almost as much a part of my personal tradition as
the building itself.
We should speak of these things to the students who
visit us, and to the people of the country, who sometimes
find Parliament irrelevant, not as meaningful as it might
otherwise be. We should remind them that this structure
was here before any of us were around, and will be long
after all of us are gone, and is a symbol of the strength of a
free people who choose their own representatives in government, who provide and prescribe the laws of the
nation. These are matters of which statesmen and politicians should speak as part of the service that the parliamentary institution renders.
I took into the Remembrance Chapel not very long ago a
distinguished American soldier, a man who played a
notable part in the service of the United States. He was
moved when he saw the Remembrance Chapel and was
told of the names of those in the wars who had given their
lives to preserve decency and civilization. He thought that
there could not have been, and that there was not elsewhere, a finer monument to military valour than the
Remembrance Chapel.
Senator Connolly spoke of the area occupied by the
Speaker of the Senate, and I must say that was the first
time I had ever heard anyone speak of a desire for changes
in that area. It may well be that he bas presented a strong
argument for consideration to be given to the improvements he suggests. These would embody the use of
Canadian substances, thereby adding to the symbolism
that little by little is being exemplified in this Senate by
those who skilfully make their carvings on the stonework
of the chamber.
a (1520)

Senator Connolly spoke also about the chairs on the
dais. It had never occurred to me that there was anything
wrong with these. I am not sure that there is, but nevertheless he has made a suggestion which I think merits
study and consideration.
By way of parenthesis, Senator Connolly said also that
the Lord Chancellor presides over the deliberations of the
House of Lords. I did not understand that to be the case. I
know that the Lord Chancellor sits on the woolsack, but I
had always understood that he did not preside. Perhaps at
some future date Senator Connolly could explain his
viewpoint.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Senator Denis could tell us. He
was sitting in the Speaker's Chair yesterday.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Yes; I am sure he could tell us a great

SENATE DEBATES
Much has been said about the paintings in the chamber.
They have the appearance of murals, and Senator Connolly reminded us that they were given to the nation by a
great Canadian, Lord Beaverbrook.
I know of Lord Beaverbrook's attachment for Canada
and the reason why he donated the paintings. They are
distinctive paintings, and many people have inquired of
me and other senators whether consideration might be
given to displaying them now in another location. I am not
agreeing with or opposing such a move. I merely say that
such a suggestion is worth considering.
Of course, we shall never forget what these paintings
represent. As a young lad I was unable to take part in the
First World War, of which the paintings are demonstrative. However, I was not so young as not to appreciate
what the paintings represent for so many millions of
Canadians, not only former soldiers but also those who
lost sons, husbands and relatives in the First World War. I
was conscious too of the battle areas which the paintings
portray.
In front of me is a painting depicting the Battle of
Ypres, not far from the Menin Gate, that great monument
to Canadians who fell in the First World War. There have
been other wars since, and one might argue that the heroes
of the Second World War, the Korean War and other wars
should be immortalized in this chamber.
Senator Connolly's suggestion that a committee be
established to study such matters is a worthy one.
Although there might be less urgency attached to such a
committee than to others, its deliberations could be of
importance and value.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: It might be handled by the committee dealing with the gun legislation.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I do not know what mechanism might
be involved in the formation of such a committee. I do not'
know what decision might be made concerning the location of the paintings, or changes to the Speaker's area. I do
not know whether authority exists for making final decisions in that regard, for the simple reason that I have
never looked into the matter. Perhaps Senator Laing, who
was formerly a Minister of Public Works, can assist us.
At a later date we can consider how such a committee
might be established. I am sure that it could render valuable service
to our parliamentary
tradition and
infrastructure.
Senator Connolly deserves our thanks for raising this
question, for giving us the opportunity to reaffirm our
belief in the parliamentary institution, and for giving us
an appreciation of the charm of this chamber and that of
the House of Commons-all of which attest to our strong
conviction that there is no better parliamentary system
than our own.
On motion of Senator Heath, for Senator Forsey, debate
adjourned.
FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION CEREMONIES

Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, I think that
Senator Laing, who was appointed by the government to
attend the inauguration ceremonies of the new President
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

April 4, 1974

of Brazil, might wish to report on his visit. There is no
notice standing in the name of the honourable senator, but
I pointed out to him that the Senate has power to deal
with its rules in its own way. I for one would be pleased to
hear his report on the recent inauguration ceremonies in
Brazil.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, is it
agreed?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Arthur Laing: Honourable senators, this appears
to be the day for recounting adventures which are of
moment to Canada. In taking a few minutes to give my
impressions of my short visit to Brazil, I might say with
some conviction that Brazil is of great importance to
Canada.
I am indebted to the Secretary of State for External
Affairs and to the Leader of the Government for selecting
me as Canada's special representative in Brazil on the
occasion of the inauguration of His Excellency General
Ernesto Geisel, President-elect of the Federative Republic
of Brazil, who replaced President Medici and his government which had been in power for four years.
One of the most embarrasssing aspects of visiting a
country is that within 24 hours of one's arrival one meets
someone who asks, "What do you think of our country?"
On such occasions one bas usually not had sufficient time
to form any opinion.
While I was there I confessed to people day after dayand I have been confessing to people ever since-my
astonishment at what I saw. Brazil is an immense country.
In area it is the fifth largest nation in the world, with a
population of 102 millions. It is highly rated among manufacturing and industrial countries. As many Canadians are
aware, Brazil is known as the coffee country, being first in
world production of coffee. It is also third in world production of leather shoes; fifth in cotton lint, first in castor
beans, third in manganese ore, sixth in iron ore, third in
cacao, fourth in cattle, eighth in meat and rice, and tenth
in synthetic rubber and cars.
a (1530)
I was astonished at the amount of shipbuilding going on.
I saw eight brand new ships not yet commissioned in the
stream, and four more in the stocks. These were ships of
16,000 and 18,000 tons. They have constructed a tanker of
125,000 tons.
I pay tribute, first of all, to our Ambassador to Brazil,
Mr. Barry Steers, and I want to compliment the External
Affairs Department because diplomacy in that country in
the future is going to be related to industrial and commercial matters. Mr. Steers, prior to coming to the Department
of Trade and Commerce in 1952, was in business in
Colombia, South America, where, incidentally, he married
a Colombian wcman. She is a quite remarkable woman,
and a tremendous help to him and to Canada. In my view,
we have a superb ambassador to Brazil in Mr. Steers.
We are arriving at a time now where those countries of
the world rich in resources will be producing the requirements of a population that will perhaps reach 6 billion by
the year 2000. Brazil is certainly one of those areas, as are
Canada, the Soviet Union, Australia and Africa. These are
the areas of the world which will be producing the world's

April 4,1974

Apri 4, 974SENATE
DEBATES

requirements in raw materials. Brazil is very close to the
top in terms of the interest of those nations who want to
use raw materials and, indeed, develop raw materials
within the country.
Canada has had a long association with Brazil, going
back, I think, to the late 1880s when the first Canadian
investmnent was made in Brazil. The major Canadian
investment was Brazilian Traction, now Brascan Corporation. That, together with the other Canadian investments
in Brazil, total about $134 billion at the present time.
Ail those firms are today headed by Brazilians, members
of familles who have been in Brazil for one to four
generations. I got the impression that ail Canadian companies in Brazil are regarded as good corporate citizens, and
the relationship between them and the Brazilian people
and government is excellent.
I want to say a word about Brasilia, the capital city of
Brazil. They started it 14 years ago, and there are today
430,000 people resident there. They have some remarkable
architects, as the buildings disclose. The building which
houses their eiected representatives, the Congresso, has a
great concave bowi as a roof, probably 100 yards wide.
This is to catch the thoughts, the inspirations and the
dreams of Brazilians. They also have a Senate, the roof of
which is the other way around-convex. This is their
chamber of sober second thought, reviewing the ideas that
fail into the great pan over in the other place. The layout
is magnificent. I think the area between the two buildings
is almost a quarter of a mile wide.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Do their Congress and Senate functien there now?
Hon. Mr. Laing: Yes, indeed. The area between the two
uines of buildings is entirely given to gardens.
I try to sing for my supper wherever I go. Gratef ully, my
wife was along with me on this occasion. We went to Rio
de Janeiro and Sàro Paulo. Sào Paulo is a city of 8,200,000,
and is in the industriai heartland of Brazil. There are
Canadian firms there, such as Massey-Ferguson which is
actualiy manufacturing farm equipment for expert to
Canada as well as to Europe and other parts of the world.
Alcan is aise there, as I have mentioned before, and is
doing a very successful job. In many parts of the country
Canadian consulting firms are being retained in respect of
agriculturai progress, the damming of rivers, and forestry.
Some of our larger Canadian forestry companies are visiting Brazil with a view to investing.
I found that the investing countries of the worid, principally Japan, are in Brazil with tremendous energy and
force. One Japanese f irm is going to build a 12 million ton
per year steel plant. Out of a port called Vitôria, which is
probably the ciosest port to Europe, they shipped 33 million tons of iron ore last year. Brazilian iron ore is of a
very high grade, being 68 or 69 per cent, with no phosphorous content at ail.
There is also a tremendous agriculturai potentiai in
Brazil. I was not aware that they produced 7 million tons
of soya beans last year, second oniy to the United States.
Their climate is one which aliows planting at aimost any
time of the year, and the soul is excellent. The lowest
recorded temperature in Rio de Janeiro in history was 57
degrees. So the potentiality for agriculture is very great.

We met a number of peopie whiie there, one of whom
was Dr. Antonio José Rodrigues Filho, who is Vice Governor of the city of Sào Paulo. He is aiso a farmer and owns
12,000 acres on which, as he proudly said, he has 14 tractors, ail but two of which were Massey-Ferguson tractors.
I asked him what he grew, and he said he grew a great
number of things. He toid me he had 48 or 50 people as
permanent empioyees on his ranch.
We took time off to pay a courtesy cali to the Mayor of
Sào Paulo, a young man of 35. He was educated ahroad,
and had taken a course in engineering in Pittsburgh.
There are many such bright, competent young men holding important positions in Brazil. This young man is now
interested in town planning. He is looking at ways of
ensuring a safe water suppiy and a reasonabie sewage
disposai system.
We met Mr. Jorge Fragoso, of Alcan Aluminio do Brasil,
and another gentleman, Mr. J. A. Engeibrecht. As you can
understand from these names, the inhabitants of Brazil
came from ail over the world. Mr. Engeibrecht, for exampie, is third generation German. There are 750,000 people
of Japanese origin in Brazil. The Japanese went to the
South American continent at the time they came to our
continent, at around the turn of the century.
* (1540)

I am going to be brave enough to record the one thing
they proudly repeat, which is, "We are a melting pot of ail
kinds of people in the worid, but we have one ianguage
only, Portuguese." It is a remarkable thing to hear a black
man speaking to a Japanese, and both of them taling
Portuguese.
They have a inilitary guvernment. I do net think anyone
from Brazil, even His Exceiiency the Brazilian Ambassador to Canada, will mind my saying it is my opinion that if
that government remains ciean, and if they can retreat a
littie bit from the pressure put upon individuals in the
country-which President Geisel said was his objectivethen they wiii have a very great country mndeed. Their
future wiii be assured with democratic aims. Repeatedly
in his acceptance speech the President said that aul progress, materiai as weil as social, depended upon an ordered
society within their country. Their history over the iast
several years has indicated that there were infusions of
influences from other countries that wouid be the opposite
to the ideai of an ordered society. Unquestionabiy, they
took action to eradicate those elements, and it was donc
more roughly than our country would stand, but probably
with the roughness that was required under the circumstances, because this is a frontier pioneering country and
people.
Sâro Paulo is just full of automobiles-and dangerous
drivers, too.
Hon. Mr. Martin; What else wouid you expect in a
Latin-American country?
Hon. Mr. Laing: I was toid that 3,200 people were kilied
in Sào Paulo last year by automobiles. You have to watch
out. There is a rule down there that everyone should keep
out of the way of the buses, hecause the buses carry no
insurance. If a bus hits you, it is just too bad.
We stayed in a very good hotel in Sào Paulo. There you
are surrounded by people who have corne in from the

SENATE DEBATES
hinterland of Brazil to get jobs where the industries are.
There is a tremendous movement of people. The government is looking seriously towards the Amazon, because
they are hopeful of an extension of the oil and gas finds
that have been made where the Amazon rises. I was told
that they are determined some day to build a railway
across to the Pacific. At the present time they are building
8,000 miles of roads. There is mining and agriculture. All
of these things are of great importance.
I have a suggestion to make for the days that lie
immediately ahead, in view of the splendid connection
Canada has there at present. This shows a marked
improvement from our attitude of many years ago. I have
always felt that we in Canada were of the opinion that we
could not do much in Latin America, principally because
of that great elephant that the Prime Minister described,
which is between us and them. American technology and
American funds seemed to lower a curtain between us and
South America. I believe that is changing.
I have already mentioned that the best of relations and
the most admirable situation bas developed from the
activities of the Canadian firms that are there. That now
gives us an opportunity that we have not had before, in
competition with German, British and Japanese firms, to
participate in the development of that country. We will
meet a type of competition rougher than we have met in
the past. I think we should strengthen the hand of our
ambassador, and increase his representation there if he
asks for it. I have enough confidence in him to say that if
he asks for help we should do what he suggests.
Water, freight rates north and south between South
America and, say, Montreal, or even the West Coast, are
infinitely higher on a per ton basis than they are across
the Atlantic. I would guess that they are double. That may
have something to do with the volume and regularity of
the service from the West Coast. The route from the West
Coast to Brazil is served regularly today by the Grace
Line, which bas a splendid combination of passenger and
freight ships. There is a line that goes occasionally to
Montreal. However, the freight cost is one of the factors
against us at the present time.
We must keep on the alert there, because there was a
general assumption by independent people to whom I
talked that the dominating force and influence in South
America from now on will be Brazil. It is imperative,
therefore, that we develop our relationships with the Brazilians having regard to the immense, almost unbelievable,
resources that they have. They are an active and dynamic
people. They are people who have gone there to pioneer
and improve their lot; they have gone there to ensure their

April 4, 1974

future and that of their children. There is a tremendous
amount of dynamism in the country.
I repeat that I deeply appreciate the opportunity I had of
going there, even for a short time. I came away with
certain impressions, mainly of astonishment at what is
going on. Next month Brazil will be visited by representatives of the Government of Alberta, which is sending
down a minister. The Albertans hope to sell a considerable
amount of sulphur in Brazil. Brazilians are also interested
in coking coal. Whether we can move coking coal out of
the Rocky Mountain area to Vancouver by rail, and then
on to Brazil by that long route, I do not know. However,
they want coking coal very badly.
Saskatchewan has just completed the sale of one million
tons of potash to Brazil, where they hope to use in the
coming year double the amount of fertilizers that they
used last year.
The country is exploding, and because of the good reputation Canadian companies have earned down there-I
heard about this everywhere I went-and the good reputation that our ambassador bas, we should pay particular
attention to Brazil. I am told by the Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce that this year we shall sell them
between $200 million and $300 million worth of wheat. In
the past our trade relations have been such that we were
selling them about two and a half to three times as much
as we were buying from them, in the order of $80 million
or $90 million. This is suddenly to be stepped up by $200
million or $300 million. When this opportunity is open to
us, we should consolidate our position.
We must pay more attention to Brazil, and get to know
more about its people. If, in the endeavour to obtain a
development relationship with that nation, with the competition that lies before us, Ambassador Steers asks for
reinforcing help from Canada, then he should have it at
once.
Let me give you an idea of what he bas done to bring
Canada to Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Brasilia. The
Winnipeg Ballet is going down there. Ambassador Steers
did not come rushing to the Government of Canada for a
grant to take them down there. He went to the Canadian
firms who are there, and obtained the money to move the
Winnipeg Ballet both ways. In São Paulo he bas organized
a Canadian-Brazilian Chamber of Commerce with 200
members. He is doing that sort of thing for us there. If he
asks for a little support we should grant it to him. He is an
outstanding man.
Honourable senators, I appreciate this opportunity to
tell you of my impressions from a very short visit to a
country that could mean a great deal to us, and could
provide a real consolidating position for Canada on the
continent of South America.

NATIONAL PARKS ACT
BILL TO AMEND-FIRST READING
The Hon, the Speaker pro tem informed the Senate that
a message had been received from the House of Commons
with Bill C-6, to amend the National Parks Act.

Bill read the first time.
The Hon, the Speaker pro tem: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Next sitting.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, I must indicate to
the Senate that if this bill is to be placed on the Order
Paper for second reading tomorrow, then it will have to be
with leave of the Senate and notwithstanding the appropriate rule. Leave to set aside our rules is something that
we shouîd discuss flot only with respect to this bill but

also with respect to the other bis that have been passed
by the other place and are now to be deait with by us.
Therefore, I suggest that we stand the motion to have this

bill put on the Orders of the Day for second reading
tomorrow until we are made aware of the program for this
week. We shouîd be told specifically which bill or bills the
goverfiment considers should be dealt with urgently 50
that it or they may receive royal assent bef ore we adj ourn.
I understand that the House of Commons plans to adjourn
Wednesday evening. If there is no urgency requiring that
place to, remain in session beyond Wednesday, then there
is no urgency for us to pass these bills. It might be sensible
at this point for us to deal with the program for this week
so that we may know what is expected of us.
Thé Hon. the Speaker pro tem: Honourable senators, if I
may deal first with the point of order raised by the Leader
of the Opposition-

Hon. Mr. Flynn: Well, it was not exactly a point of

order.
The Hon, thé Speaker pro tem: It was in the nature of a
point of order. Our rules provide for a specific delay bef ore
second reading is proceeded with, and if the Leader of the
Government wants to move that such time be abridged, he
should do so with leave of the Senate.
Since the Leader of the Opposition has asked at this
time for an outline of the program contemplated for the

Senate, perhaps it would be as well to leave this matter in
abeyance until such time as the Leader of the Government
has given an outline of this program.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: It could stand until later.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Agreed.
Thé Hon. thé Speaker pro tem: I want to make it very
clear that the motion now is that the order stand.

Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, there is no
doubt whatever that Senator Flynn is right as is His
Honour the Acting Speaker. Our rules require that a specific notice be given, and in this case that notice has flot
been run its full course. Therefore, the Leader of the
Opposition and I are not in disagreement. We should
proceed in an orderly way. This would mean that the bis
now on the Order Paper-the bill to amend the National
Parks Act, the bill to amend the Fisheries Development
Act, which is a short bill, the bill to amend the Yukon Act,
the Northwest Territories Act and the Canada Elections
Act, and the Canadian National Railways Financing and
Guarantee bill-might not be concluded. We shaîl have to

see what progress we have made on Wednesday, but I
assure the Leader of the Opposition that there is no intention of forcing the pace. If we did finish, it might flot be
necessary for us to return on April 22. However, I can
understand that it may be desirable for us to return on
that date-particularly if there is legislation with which
we have yet to deal. We will have a better appreciation,
and be in a better position to make a determination on
Wednesday.
a (2010)

Tomorrow when we reach this stage of our proceedings I

will ask, again with leave, that we proceed to second

reading, and we must then determine exactly the wish of
honourable senators.

Thé Hon, thé Speaker pro tem: Do I understand that the
Leader of the Government is now asking to put this
motion with leave of the Senate?
Hon. Mr. Martin: No, we are having first reading
tonight, and we wiIl deal with that issue tomorrow.
Thé Hon, thé Speaker pro tem: Honourable senators, I
ask again: Is it your pleasure to adopt the motion that the

SENATE DEBATESApl8,17
bill be placed on the Orders of the Day for second reading
at the next sitting of the Senate?
Hion. Mr. Flynn: No. It should be placed on the Orders
of the Day for Thursday next. There is a problem with
regard to our rules. It is a rather difficuit and technical
problem. It would be preferable to discuss the whole program at this time. With leave of the Senate, we could have
the Leader of the Government explain the program and
point out what must, in the government's view, be passed
before Wednesday evening and what can wait. As has been
indicated by the leader, we know that other than the bil
to amend the National Parks Act, we will receive messages
from the House of Commons with Bill C-2, to amend the
Fisheries Development Act, and Bill C-9, to amend the
Yukon Act, the Northwest Territories Act and the Canada
Elections Act. These bis do not ail have the same degree
of urgency about them and do not require, I would suggest, action of the Senate before we adjourn on Wednesday. But that is the very question that should be clarified
now, before we go any further. Let us have a discussion
with a view to agreeing on what we should do bef ore we
adjourn on Wednesday. With leave of the Senate, I would
ask that the government leader be allowed to explain the
government's intentions.
Hion. Mr. Martin: As the Leader of the Opposition has
properly foreseen, the House of Commons will adjourn on
Wednesday night and, for the reasons that he mentioned, I
would propose that we adjourn at the same time. The
House of Commons will return on April 22, and if we are
stili debating: the legisiation that is before us now, or
whatever may be added, then I think we should return on
April 23.
With respect to the bills presentîy before us, the bill to
amend the National Parks Act, the Leader of the Opposition will recail, was a bill introduced in the Senate at the
iast session. We have been all through that, but there is
nothing to prevent our going ail through it again if that is
desirable. The bill to amend the Fisheries Deveiopment
Actlion. Mr. Flynn: Before he leaves the subject of that
bill, may I point out to the Leader of the Government that
several amendmnents were made to that piece of hegisiation
in the other place.
lion. Mr. Martin: That is right. There were several
amendments made in the other place to the bill to amend
the National Parks Act. The Fisheries Devehopment bill is
a one-paragraph bill, and I doubt if there wilh be much
controversy about it.
The bill to amnend the Yukon Act, the Northwest Territories Act and the Canada Elections Act is a more extensive bill. There are perhaps good reasons for passing that
measure as quickly as possible, after giving it proper and
careful consideration.
The other bill before us is the Canadian National Railways Financing and Guarantee bill, to which a number of
senators wish to speak. The Motor Vehicle Tire Safety bill
has already been before the committee, and we shahl be
seeking third reading later tonight.
There is also Senator Cameron's bill to amend the Crimmnai Code, on which some senators wish to speak, and
there are inquiries standing in the names of Senator Hicks
[The Hon. the Speaker.]

April 8, 1974

and Senator Connolly. There is also an inquiry in the
name of Senator Deschatelets which has flot yet been
proceeded with. The Leader of the Opposition has a special
interest in these inquiries.
Hion. Mr. Flynn: There is no urgency, and 1 do flot
expect any decision in the near future.
Hion. Mr. Martin: 1 suggest that we await what happens
tomorrow and the next day.
Hion. Mr. Flynn: I have been told that if the Prime
Minister should decide to dissolve Parliament during the
Easter recess-as the Leader of the Government knows,
rumours are circulating to that effect-the provisions of
Bill C-9 would be entirely lost because four months are
required to organize the elections provided for in that
measure.
Consequently, there appears to be some legitimate
urgency in connection with Bill C-9, but flot the same
urgency in connection with Bis C-6, C-2 and C-5. Bill
C-5, the Canadian National Railways Financing and Guarantee bill, has been around for such a long time that I
cannot see that three weeks, or even three or four months,
would make any substantial difference. I should like to
hear from the Leader of the Government whether I arn
right in that assumption.
Hion. Mr. Martin: I agree with the Leader of the Opposition with regard to Bill C-9. I doubt whether there is any
reason for him to be concerned about dissolution. I do flot
think that honourable senators should be particularly concerned about that.
Hion. Mr. Flynn: We are flot concerned with dissolution
as such.
Hion. Mr. Argue: It will not happen that soon.
Hion. Mr. Martin: The question is academic at this stage.
When the Leader of the Opposition has had an opportunity of- studying the bill to amend the Fisheries Development Act, he might consider the proposed change
desirable.
Hion. Mr. Flynn: Before the Easter recess?
Hion. Mr. Martin- I would think so. I fully expect to see
the honourable senator in the same seat when we returfi
from the Easter recess.
Hion. Mr. Flynn: 1 shaîl be f aced with the same sad
sight.
lion. Mr. Grosart: Honourable senators, is it the intention of the Leader of the Government to ask leave of the
Senate to suspend its rules during the next three or four
days in respect of any of the bis bef ore us?
There has been a good deal of comment about various
which are on the Clerk's Scroll but which do flot
bis
appear on the Orders of the Day, and much discussion of
about which some of us on the back benches are
bis
somewhat ignorant. The situation might be ciarified if the
Leader of the Government would teli us whether it is his
intention to ask for leave to suspend the ruies of the
Senate in order to speed progress of certain bills within
the next three days?
lion. Mr. Martin: We are here to conduct the business of
the Senate. Tomorrow I intend to ask for leave to proceed

April 8, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

with certain bills, but I would not regard it as calamitous
if leave were not given.
*

(2020)

Hon. Mr. Grosart: I am not suggesting that. I specifically asked the Leader of the Government to let us know in
relation to what bills he would ask that we suspend our
rules. I ask him to let us know what the bills are now so
that we know exactly where we are.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I have already indicated what they
are, but, to repeat, they are Bill C-9, Bill C-2, and Bill C-6.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: And not Bill C-5?
Hon. Mr. Martin: We will be proceeding with that
tonight.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Without the suspension of our rules?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: We do not need the suspension of
any rule tonight with respect to Bill C-5.
Hon. Mr. Martin: We got that last week.
The Hon. the Speaker pro tem: Order. Honourable senators, Bill C-6 bas been read a first time, following which I
put the question: When shall this bill be read a second
time?
Perhaps the Leader of the Government would be kind
enough to repeat his motion.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Next Wednesday.
The Hon. the Speaker pro tem: I should like to have the
motion before I put the question.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Next Wednesday.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Under the rules, this bill will obviously be placed on the Orders of the Day for second reading
on Wednesday next. However, that does not preclude leave
being granted tomorrow to proceed with the second reading of this bill.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: You can ask for leave tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Martin: When we say "next sitting," it does
not necessarily mean tomorrow. It just means next sitting.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: With leave, next sitting.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: No, no. Next Wednesday. We will likely
see the government leader begging again tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Likely.
The Hon. the Speaker pro tem: It is moved by the
Honourable Senator Martin, seconded by the Honourable
Senator Langlois, that this bill be placed on the Orders of
the Day for second reading on Wednesday next.
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the
motion?
Hon. Mr. Martin: No.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Wednesday; Wednesday. The rules!
Hon. Mr. Martin: May I ask the Leader of the Opposition this question: What if tomorrow we have no legislation before us? I suggest to himHon. Mr. Flynn: We will play golf.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I suggest to him that at least the
sponsor of the bill should be allowed to move second

reading, and explain the bill. Does that preclude leave
being granted to do so?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: As the Leader of the Government has
indicated, he can ask again tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Fine.

That the Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture which was empowered by the Senate on 28th
March, 1974, without special reference by the Senate,

That the committee have power to sit during

EASTER RECESS
TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS FOR SENATORS

Hon. Donald Smnith: Honourable senators, before the
Orders of the Day are called, may I have your indulgence
in order to carry out a commitment I made to Senator
Buckwold after I returned to Ottawa this evening. I
should mention that Senator Buckwold is acting on hehaif
of the government at a public event out West, and for that
reason cannot be here.
Senator Buckwold had been in contact with off icials of
the Ministry of Transport and others with respect to
arrangements for transportation for those who desire to
take their wives and children to either the Western or the
Eastern provinces. He was able to have the following
notice sent to ail senators from the Atlantic provinces:
There will be a DOT plane leaving on Thursday, April
il at 9 a.m. for Eastern Canada, for senators, their
wives and familjes. Would you please inform my
office by Wednesday, April 10, if anyone will be going,
and also whether your wife's name is to be included in
the list. If children are expected to be travelling with
their parents, please also include their names and
ages. It would also be appropriate if you would leave a
telephone number where you can be located in
Ottawa, as well as your office, in case it is required to
make some other arrangements.
Honourable senators, where the aircraf t will be landing
in each of the Eastern provinces has not yet been conf irmed, but when the list of passengers is complete that
will be determined.
Arrangements respecting transportation to Western
Canada have not yet been completed. They are presently
being discussed and it is hoped that it will soon be possible
to send notices to ail senators who might desire to avail
themselves of such arrangements.
Hon. Mr,. Ril.y: Honourable senators, may I ask whether
Senator Smith can tell us what type of DOT aircraft will
be available to take us home?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Are you worried?
Hon. Mr. Riley: I am wondering whether it will be
possible for us to get home before Easter Sunday.
Hon. Mr. Smnith: If that is a serious question, I can only
say I do not know what kind of aircraf t it will be. I hope
there will be better flying conditions than those on Thursday evening last. It took me until 6 o'clock the next
morning to get to my place of residence. However, that
was due to weather conditions and not the type of equipment used.
Hon. Mr,. O'Leary: Honourable senators, I would like to
suggest that matters of this kind which involve details of
housekeeping should be discussed behind closed doors.

Hon. Mr. Aaaelin: I would like to ask the Leader of the
Government whether he can say when the next budget
will be introduced.
Hon. Mr~. Martin. The date has flot been set yet but I
can tell the honourable senator that it will he after the
Easter recess.

MOTOR VEHICLE TIRE SAFETY BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. Joan Neurnan moved third reading of Bill S-3,
respecting the use of national safety marks in relation to
motor vehicle tires and to provide for safety standards for
certain motor vehicle tires imported into or exported f rom
Canada or sent or conveyed from one province to another.
She said: Honourable senators, this bill was reported
without amendment by Senator Haig, Chairman of the
Standing Senate Committee on Transport and Communications, at our last sitting. I should like to take a moment
to answer a question put to me earlier this afternoon by
Senator Benidickson.
Hon. Mr. Bonidickson: It was a question I raised at the
first meeting of the committee.
Hon. Mra. Neimnan: Yes. It was with regard to studded
tires and whether they would be covered by this legisiation. Senator Benidickson indicated that he would like
this question raised again, but, unfortunately, he was not
able to be present at our second meeting, when the bill
was reported, and 1 did flot raise the question myseif
because I had expected him to do so. However, I have
obtained some information from the Ministry of Transport
which may be of some assistance.
Senator Benidickson had brought to my attention that
there had been a certain amount of publicity recently in
the papers about studded tires and the controversy, which
apparently is stili raging, with respect to whether they
should be banned in Ontario. As a matter of fact, this
question is of concern flot only to Ontario but also to those
parts of Canada which are generally regarded to be within
the snow beit.
Mr. J. P. Vaillancourt, Assistant Director of Motor Vehicie Programs of the Road and Motor Vehicle Traffic Safety
Branch, has provided me with a document entitled "Winter Tests," which has to do specif ically with the testing of
non-studded tires and studded tires. It is a comparison of
studded tires with other types of tires, which was first
carried out by the Canada Safety Council and later was
done in conjunction with the provinces of Ontario and
Quebec. Mr. Vaillancourt; went over these resuits with me
carefully and they seemn to indicate clearly that, as regards
safety, there is no appreciable difference between studded
tires and non-studded tires under practically ail conditions of travel. Mr. Vaillancourt made the point that
because there is no significant difference, the whole area

252

SENATE DEBATES

is not one into which the federal government would interject itself. For this reason, therefore, it has been left to
Ontario and Quebec to decide whether to legislate in this
matter, and, as you know, Ontario has already decided to
ban studded tires. There is reason to believe that Quebec,
while it has the problem under active consideration at the
moment, is also likely to ban studded tires in the near
future. However, that is not something we can predict
with any certainty at the moment.
I do not believe there are any other matters of import so
far as this bill is concerned: it was discussed at length in
our committee under the able leadership of our chairman,
Senator Haig, but if there are other questions which senators would like to ask I should be delighted to try to
answer them.
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.

CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS FINANCING AND
GUARANTEE BILL, 1973
SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED
Hon. Leopold Langlois moved the second reading of Bill
C-5, to authorize the provision of moneys to meet certain
capital expenditures of the Canadian National Railways
System and Air Canada for the period from the lst day of
January, 1973, to the 30th day of June, 1974, and to authorize the guarantee by Her Majesty of certain securities to
be issued by the Canadian National Railway Company
and certain debentures to be issued by Air Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, Canadian National Railways financing and guarantee bills have been presented to
Parliament annually with the exception of the 1963 bill
which covered both 1962 and 1963, and the 1966 bill which
covered 1965 and 1966. Honourable senators may recall
that the 1971 bill, which made certain provisions relating
to 1971 and 1972, had not completed second reading in the
other place at the time the 28th Paliament was dissolved.
The present bill, which covers 1973, picks up those provisions, as required.
This 1973 bill sets out, in summary form, the amounts of
CNR's capital expenditures for 1973, as presented in its
capital budget for that year, totalling $225,500,000. The bill
also authorizes Canadian National Railways to make
expenditures not exceeding $75 million between January 1
and July 1, 1974, for obligations incurred prior to January
1, 1974, and to enter into contracts before July 1, 1974, for
capital expenditures not exceeding $167,500,000, for which
payment will not come due until after 1973. These expenditures and commitments are in accord with the CNR's
1973 capital budget which was approved by the Governor
in Council.
Six main objectives are being sought in this bill, most of
which have had similar expression in previous financing
and guarantee bills.
First, there are provisions authorizing Canadian National Railways to borrow up to $21 million for financing
branch line construction. This amount includes the financing of branch lines in excess of 20 miles authorized by
special statute as well as the financing of those lines
under 20 miles which do not require special legislation.
[Hon. Mrs. Neiman.]

April 8,1974
April 8, 1974

Here I would like to open a parenthesis to recall to
honourable senators the fact that in 1967, under the
National Transportation Act, the authority to build a
branch line without special financing authority was
extended from seven to 20 miles.
Second, the bill provides for the continued purchase by
the Minister of Finance of Canadian National Railways
four per cent preferred stock through 1972 to the end of
the calendar year 1973. This continues the practice of
previous financing and guarantee acts. The 1970 financing
and guarantee act extended to December 31, 1971, the
expiry date of the authority granted by the Canadian
National Railways Capital Revision Act of 1952 for the
purchase of such stock equivalent to three per cent of the
company's gross revenue.
Third, as in previous years, the bill provides authority
for the government to make temporary advances to
Canadian National Railways and Air Canada to meet
deficiencies in operating revenues during the period from
January 1, 1973, to June 30, 1974. Such advances are repaid
later in the year from the companies' revenues. If the
revenues prove inadequate, the insufficiency is covered by
a parliamentary appropriation.
Fourth, the bill contains an option similar to that contained in the 1970 financing and guarantee act which
would enable Air Canada to borrow $140 million during
the period from January 1, 1973, to June 30, 1974, either
directly from Her Majesty or by means of a guaranteed
public issue.
It also would renew the authority for the Minister of
Finance to guarantee debentures amounting to the equivalent of £13 million, to be issued in the period from May 1,
1972 to December 31, 1976 by Air Canada in accordance
with contractual obligations assumed by the airline prior
to July 1, 1972. This is explained because the signing of
these contracts, mostly with Rolls Royce of England, was
delayed due to the financial and other problems which
Rolls Royce had. That is the reason why authority is
sought to finance these contractual obligations only at this
date.
Fifth, the bill contains a section to increase to $1 billion
the limit on the amount of substituted securities that may
be issued by the Canadian National Railways in respect of
any refunding pursuant to the provisions of the Canadian
National Railways Refunding Act, 1955. The total amount
allowed or authorized at this time is $680 million, which
will be raised now to $1 billion.
Sixth, and finally, the bill provides under clause 14 for
the appointment of auditors for the years 1972, 1973 and
1974 to 1978.
Honourable senators, I think, before closing my
remarks, I should stress the main points of this bill.
First, an important point is that it is essentially in the
same format as in previous years; second, it provides
Parliament, on a regular basis, with the opportunity to
approve certain financing and guarantee authorities
which both corporations require; third, loans to Canadian
National Railways in the 18 months ended July 1, 1974, for
financing capital expenditures, will be required only in
respect of branch line construction. It is anticipated that
the self-generated funds, and the proceeds of the preferred

April 8, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

stock issue, wihl be sufficient ta finance ather capital
expenditures. Loans for that refunding are covered, as
honourable senators know, by separate legislation.
Finally, the provisions for financing Air Canada are
intended ta continue the practice of covering the airlines
borrowing requirements until such time as it i. opportune
ta pass a bill ta amend the Air Canada Act.
Hanourable senators, I conclude by cornrending this
legisîstion ta your favourable consideration, and I remain
at your disposai ta supply you with any further explanation that you may wish ta obtain in connectian with it.
Hon. M1r. Groaart: Honourable senatars, I do not intend
ta speak ta the bill at the moment, but I would like ta
direct one or two questions ta the sponsor.
He said that such bills as this have been presented
annualhy with the exception of certain years. la this the
bill that i. usually called "the annual CNR financing bill?"'
Hon. Mr. Laniglois: Well, it i. not called "the annual
bill," but it is presented annually as a rule.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: May I ask the honourable senator
when such a bill was last passed by Parliament?
a (2050)

Hon. Mr. Langlois: Well, I arn gaing ta go back ta what I
said a short while ago. The 1971 bull, which dealt with 1971
and 1972, had flot received second reading when the last
Parliament was prorogued. Sa, ta answer your question
directly, the last bill was passed in 1970.
Hon. Mr. Grouart: Might I alsa ask the sponsor of the
bill-and I draw attention ta the fact that the bill is, by its
title, a bill ta "authorize the provision of maneys ta meet
certain capital expenditures"-how have the CNR and Air
Canada been able ta carry on their activities without
authorization in the meantime?
Hon. Mr. Langlois.: It i. simply because the CNR and
Air Canada are nat by this bill seeking authority ta spend
money. This authority is given as soon as their capital
budgets are approved by the Governor in Council, and the
capital budget covered by this bill has been approved by
the Governor in Councîl. This bill merely seeks authority
ta finance those expenditures which are not financed
through generated revenues. I do nat know if my honaurable friend quite understands the distinction I arn making,
but it i. a very important one.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I arn fully aware of the distinction,
but I would remind Senator Langlois that the title of the
bill is "An Act ta authorize the provision of moneys-"
Hon. Mr. Langlois: It i. the Canadian National Railways Financing and Guarantee Bill, 1973.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: May I just ask the sponsor if it i. not
s0 that the f inancing has been provided under the Canadian National Railways Refunding Act?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I cannot answer that question
specifically, and I would like ta take it as notice. I think
the raihway ha. been f inanced either through generated
revenues or advances and boans provided by the Mînister
of Finance.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Honourable senators, this wîhl be my
hast intervention. I always appreciate the care that Sena-

tar Langlois gives ta questions such as these, and I would
refer him, because it might be helpful in answering my
last question, to the printed proceedings of the Standing
Comrnittee on Transport and Communications of the
House of Commons, Issue No. 18, dated November 8, 1973,
where the minister is reported to have said:
-because this bill ha. not been passed for a couple of
years, have been made under the CNR Refunding
ActHon. Paul D.urulsa.aux: Honourable senators, I thank
Senator Langlois for explaîning thîs bill this evening,
because I do flot think we shall have much time ta discuss
it.
Bill C-5, ta authorize the provision of moneys ta meet
certain capital expenditures of the Canadian National
Railways and Air Canada, and ta authorize the guarantee
of certain securities ta be issued by the Canadian National
Railway Company and certain debentures ta be issued by
Air Canada, was introduced in the other place on March
19, 1973. Its retroactive provision is with respect ta the
year 1972. This appears in clause 13. The bill covers the
CNR and Air Canada financing for the period from January 1971 to June 30, 1974, a period of three and one-haîf
years.
In the last Parliament, the predecessor of this bill was
introduced as the Canadian National Railways Financing
and Guarantee Act, 1971, and it covered the financial
period fram January 1, 1971, ta June 30, 1972. That bill was
brought forward for second reading on March 6, 1972, and
on April 2, 1972, second reading was adjourned. Second
reading was not resumed until the present session.
I arn not an experienced parliamentarian, but 1 cannot
help but feel that we are only trying ta meet imaginary
deadlines if we aim ta, have a dlean slate at the time we
recess for Easter. The history of this bill should be noted,
and it deserves to be consîdered fully by us. I have the
feeling-perhaps wrongly, but I don't think so-that too
often we infuse into our thinking the idea that when a bll
is sent here for consideration we have ta pass it rapidly.
My personal belief, and I have said this before, is that this
kind of thinking and philosophy is wrong. It sometirnes
disregards the essential duties of senators and at times,
îndeed, is harmful ta the Senate. Bills should neyer be
rushed through this house for the accommodation of any
pattern of thinking on the part of any one or any place.
The time necessary should be estimated beforehand, and
that time should be allowed the Senate for the proper
consideration of any bill, even if there is a deadline ta be
met.
I say again, honourable senators, that before dealing
with this bill, the Senate should, on its own and without
interference or pressure frorn anywhere, decide what its
own scheduhes are, while respecting the normal recesses of
Parliament. In the case of this bill, no harm can result if
the necessary time is taken for a serious study of its
clauses.
[Translation]
Honourable senators, this is a bill of major importance.
There remain, however, a number of constructive remarks
which the members of the Senate could make. Actually,
this bill deserves to attract our attention longer, without

SENATE DEBATES
necessarily interrupting part of our holiday or, for that
matter, our parliamentary recess. I believe that in thjs
case it is both the right and duty of the Senate to make
recommendations for the purpose of improving this bill
and increasing the effectiveness of operation of these state
agencies.
During a recent financial lecture before the Winnipeg
Society of Analysts, someone explained, in connection
with the Canadian National Railways and Air Canada,
how the government fumbled and goofed in its administration of various businesses under its jurisdiction. I do
not mean this as a criticism, for it bas already been
recorded that the governrnent sorne day will have to
answer for that.
The books of these important state agencies indicate
assets of over $4 billion, but there has been no formai
audit made for 1972 and 1973. Sorne people have claimed
that this was due to a schism within the Cabinet, because
the ministers could not agree on the person to be appointed as auditor for these state agencies. This does not appear
to me to be valid. In fact, clause 14 would designate the
people responsible for auditing in 1972, 1973, and, finally,
the accounting f irm which will be entrusted with the
auditing for 1974 up to 1978. The point is that for many
months nobody cared enough to carry out the annual
audit which is required by law from aIl Canadian public
agencies.
Bill C-5 was not given priority, nor was it considered
urgent, until it got to the Senate where its passing now
seems imperative before Parliament adjourns for holidays,
unless we wish.to sit here over that period.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Ahsolutely not.
Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: Would you kindly repeat?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Absolutely not. What you said to the
effect that we were under some pressure, that we were
asked to give up our holidays to consider this bill, is
absolutely contrary to what was said this evening by the
Leader of the Government and supported by the Leader of
the Opposition; that is, that we would take ail the time
required, that we would not give up any holidays; I arn
even ready to give them up, if need be, to corne back here.
Hon. Mr'. Desruisseaux: 1 thank Senator Langlois.
I must, however, point out that, for rny part, I have
heard that remark in the past, although it was explained
to me only this evening. I arn happy to learn that we will
not rush this bill through. I noticed a while ago that the
Leader of the Opposition seemed to indicate that he was in
perfect agreement on that point. The remarks of the senator could flot apply better. But I should also point out to
the Senate that this occasion was not the only one, that I
could mention rnany others where pressures were obvious.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Here there is no time limit.
Hon. Mr'. Flynn: Frorn now on.
Hon. Mr. Martin: We must take all the time required to
study the bills.
Hon. Mr'. Desruisseaux: I arn glad to hear the Leader of
the Government say this. I think that we shaîl have the
opportunity to insist on it ourselves. This was not the case
for certain bills during the last session, I have talked
[Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux.]

April 4, 1974
Arl417

about it and protested against the procedure used at that
time.
Hon. Mr'. Martin: I of ten agree wi th you.
Hon. Mr'. Desruisseaux: I cannot ask for more.
Hon. Mr'. Flynn: The road to Damascus!
Hon. Mr'. Desruisseaux: We are certainly not here to
submit on occasion to this kind of pressure. This is what I
wanted to say a moment ago. But this does not apply in
this case. I would point out to you that this bas happened a
few times in the last session. I do not think that this is
f itting nor acceptable for the Senate, and we should not let
it happen again.
Hon. Mr'. Mar'tin: I fully agree with you.
Hon. Mr'. Desruisseaux: I arn glad that the Government
Leader shares this point of view. 1 very much appreciate
the Governrnent Leader's opinion, especially now.

[English]
Paragraph 53 of the report of the Auditor General in
1973 underlined the fact that the financial statements of
both Air Canada and the Canadian National Railways
were unaudited. It says:
The CNR Financing and Guarantee Act, 1973, which
would retroactively appoint auditors for. . . the years
1972 and 1973 bas yet to complete second reading in
the House.
That is in the notes of the Auditor General. His rernarks
continue:
In the absence of the passage of this legislation the
crown corporation is unable to provide audited financial statements reporting on its 1972 operations. However, unaudited statements have been provided for
publication in the Public Accounts.
To every business person, unaudited financial staternents
in the case of a public corporation are highly irregular and
in an accounting sense unsatisfying.
Every public company is required to subrnit annual
statements under the penalty of law and breach of faith to
the public. In view of its obvious importance, why should
crown corporations, especially of the importance of the
Canadian National Railways and Air Canada, be excused,
even for a time, frorn their most important legal
responsibility?
In its l3th report to the House, presented in 1967, and
circulatedi, the Standing Comrnîttee on Public Accounts
wondered:
... that there is a weakening of parliamentary control
when Parliament if unable to take the trne to examine in detail the arnounts being requested..
.. parliamentary rules do not provide for immediate
consideration of the Estirnates ...
And, I add, bis requiring moneys. It is then stated:
...
after they are presented to the House so that the
proposed spending can be approved and interîrn
supply would not be required s0 extensively. It feels
that the rules could and should be changed in this
regard in order not only to strengthen parliamentary
control of public funds but to give the Executive the

April4, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

clear mandate it deserves in the discharge of its heavy
responsibilities.
*

(2110)

The report backs up the view that the Senate should be
allowed sufficient time to study the situation. The Senate
cannot disregard money bills merely because it feels that
it bas limited power in that respect. Such bills should not
be simply waved through.
It would appear that the Canadian National Railways
has only to give the government a promissory note for the
hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money it may
require, and if Air Canada requires money it bas only to
include the amount it requires on the face of that promissory note. For that reason a thorough survey should be
held to examine the amounts authorized by Bill C-5.
A f ew moments ago Senator Langlois gave a good explanation of the reasons for the bill. In my opinion, such
requirements should be considered in the light of the
country's economic position. Parliament, and therefore the
Senate, should be more selective in approving and authorizing such funds.
I have always been astonished that Air Canada is a
subsidiary of the Canadian National Railways. Both companies have now fully matured and should be independent
of each other, issuing independent reports and accounts to
Parliament.
The present confusion in the accounting system of the
Canadian National Railways and Air Canada should be
clarified and true operating results provided for the information of the public.
Both the present Minister of Transport and his predecessor have declared that the Canadian National Railways'
financial structure and the government's transport policies are in dire need of modernization and review. There is
also a morale problem affecting both the CNR and Air
Canada, the principal victim of which is the public. I
would not want the government to be exposed to public
criticism through closing its eyes to obvious and necessary
changes in this field.
A few months ago the former Minister of Transport said:
I again claim that a reorganization of the structure is
necessary in order that members and the country
generally can obtain more information and obtain it
more easily about all aspects of transportation.
With this objective in mind I propose to bring
before the House next session three important pieces
of legislation on which work is proceeding at the
present time.
The first is a bill designed to reconstitute Air
Canada as a separate crown corporation, thus divorcing it, as it were, from the CNR.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Is the honourable senator quoting
from a speech of the Honourable Mr. Jamieson in 1972?
Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: Both the Honourable Mr.
Jamieson and the Honourable Mr. Marchand have spoken
on this subject.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Senator Desruisseaux is referring to
the Honourable Mr. Jamieson.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: In 1972 it was Mr. Jamieson.

Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: Yes, I am referring to Mr.
Jamieson.
Hon. Mr. Martin: All the pearls were from Mr.
Jamieson.
Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: I shall continue to quote Mr.
Jamieson:
I will also introduce a Canadian National Railways
revision act and a companion piece of legislation covering amendments to the Railway Act.
You know how involved and far-reaching these
changes are. They have been asking for them for the
last f ew years.
We now have a new Minister of Transport, but I understand that his views concur with those of his predecessor.
However, nothing has yet been done. Action is overdue,
and until it is taken the efficiency and performance of
these
important
crown
corporations
will
suffer
unnecessarily.
Hon. Mr. Asselin: Who said that, Mr. Marchand or Mr.
Jamieson?
Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: Those are my words. I am
saying that. I believe that I have the support of many
members of the public, as well as senators, when I say that
unless action is taken the efficiency and performance of
these important crown companies suffer unnecessarily.
The Canadian National Railways and Air Canada are
outgrowing Parliament. They have gone beyond the priorities set in the National Transportation Act when those
companies were established. The time is now opportune to
examine to what extent Parliament is being bypassed by
the CNR and Air Canada.
I am not blaming the companies for what has happened.
Parliament makes the rules and the companies abide by
them. Any criticism that the passage of this legislation
would be delayed by examining the measure in committee
would be sheer nonsense. If passage were delayed, it
would simply mean that the Canadian National Railways
and Air Canada would have to borrow the money on the
commercial market until the bill was passed.
I wish now to raise another point. We are well acquainted with the poor quality of answers received from the
Canadian National Railways and Air Canada-and even
from the Ministry of Transport-to our questions. We
must seek better avenues of cooperation in order that we
may be provided with clear answers. In asking questions
we do not expect in reply to reap either confusion or
evasion, as was the case recently.
*

(2120)

I must say that both the Canadian National Railways
and Air Canada have contributed a great deal over the
years of their operations to the Canadian economy, to our
travelling comfort and our welfare generally. In spite of
imperfections, and curtailment of some of the services on
occasion, we are proud of their achievements and their
general good service to the public. Our criticisms at times
are aimed at correcting those imperfections and at helping
them reach new heights of good service to the public.
I would hate to think that by speaking in the manner I
have on this bill, I have only taken up some of the valuable time of this chamber-time that could have been

SENATE DEBATES

utilized in passing this bill quickly. There is no doubt in
my mind that Bill C-5 must be passed. The borrowing
power is to authorize what has already taken place, and
the guarantees are necessary to allow these crown corporations to obtain necessary revenues at more favourable
rates than those of the marketplace.
I will support Bill C-5. I do hope, however, that we will
be given an opportunity to study the bill thoroughly in
committee.
On motion of Senator Grosart, debate adjourned.

THE SENATE
PRECINCTS AND CLERESTORY OF CHAMBER-DEBATE

CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from Thursday, April 4, the
adjourned debate on the inquiry of Senator Connolly
(Ottawa West), calling the attention of the Senate to
certain elements within the precincts of the Senate Chamber and in particular to its clerestory.
Hon. Eugene A. Forsey: I apologize, honourable senators, for not being in my place. The pace was too good to
inquire, so to speak.
I rise with great pleasure to support the inquiry of the
Honourable Senator Connolly (Ottawa West), and with
even greater pleasure because I am going to speak very
briefly. One of my colleagues, soon after I came here,
reproached me for being much too verbose. I hope I shall
not merit that particular reproach tonight. The reason I

April 4, 1974

am going to be very brief is the excellent one, that the
preceding speakers in this debate, notably Senator Connolly himself and the Leader of the Government, have
covered the ground so thoroughly and so admirably that
there seems to be very little left to be said. I merely wish
to underline the points they have made in speaking of the
importance of this subject and to suggest that it very
much deserves, in my judgment, to be referred to a committee of this house for study.
I emphasize that last particularly, because I have heard
rumours that some person or persons unknown, some
authority or authorities unkown, have been toying with
the idea of doing certain things to the general decor of this
chamber without any by your leave from the Senate itself.
I think we should make very certain that anything that is
done to the arrangements of this chamber should be done
only by the decision of the Senate itself, or with the
consent of the Senate itself, after due inquiry into the
various proposals which Senator Connolly sketched out
for us and the various considerations which the Leader of
the Government and others laid before us the other day.
That is really all I wish to say. I hope I have not so
conducted myself that someone who is expecting to
adjourn the debate after me is not present and cannot do
so. If that is the case, I shall be glad to adjourn the debate
on behalf of that honourable senator, but I really do not
see why I should trespass upon the time of the house to
repeat badly what has already been said excellently by the
speakers who have preceded me.
On motion of Senator O'Leary, debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.

NATIONAL FINANCE
COMMITTEE AUTHORIZED TO SIT DURING ADJOURNMENTS OF
THE SENATE
Hon. Leopold Langlois, with leave of the Senate and
notwithstanding rule 45(1)(a), moved:
That the Standing Senate Committee on National
Finance have power to sit during adjournments of the
Senate.
Motion agreed to.

CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS FINANCING AND
GUARANTEE BILL, 1973
SECOND READING
The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned
debate on the motion of Senator Langlois for the second
reading of Bill C-5, to authorize the provision of moneys to
meet certain capital expenditures of the Canadian National Railways System and Air Canada for the period from
the lst day of January, 1973, to the 30th day of June, 1974,
and to authorize the guarantee by Her Majesty of certain
securities to be issued by the Canadian National Railway
Company and certain debentures to be issued by Air
Canada.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators, this is, as
we all know, a very important bill. I congratulate Senator
Langlois on a very thorough explanation of the amounts
in the bill, even though he did not consider it necessary to
go into some parts of the bill's background. I will attempt
to f ill in part of that omission.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: And I will f ill in after you.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: 1, of course, heard Senator Langlois'
speech but I regret to say that I have not read it. Perhaps I
should call attention to the fact that as late as a quarter to
two today it was impossible to obtain a printed copy of
yesterday's Senate Hansard. There may be some particular
reason for that, but I found it somewhat difficult in
preparing my remarks not to have before me Senator
Langlois' explanation. I have it now, but I have not had an
opportunity to read it in the last 15 minutes.
Honourable senators, this, of course, is not the only bill
that deals with the financing of the CNR and Air Canada.
There is a whole group of bills under which the operations
of these two important companies are carried on and
under which their financing is approved, not always, of
course, by Parliament. I shall have something to say about
that in a minute.
27601-17

These bills and this whole subject of the operation and
financing of the CNR and Air Canada are, as the house is
well aware, the subject of innumerable debates and discussions in the other place. When I called for the proceedings in the other place and its committees dealing only
with this bill and its immediate predecessors, the stack
was over a foot high. This is to indicate the amount of
discussion that has gone on about this important subject
now before us. However, it is not my intention today to go
into any of the ancillary matters that have taken up so
much of the discussion in the other place. Because of the
utter mess in which transportation policy is in Canada
now, and the long mess that has surrounded this whole
business of financing CNR and Air Canada, members of
the other place have naturally taken every opportunity,
regardless of what the bill was, or whether it was an
annual report of one of the companies, to ask questions
and air their grievances, treating these bills, in effect, as
supply bills.
Today I will not go into ancillary matters such as the
propriety of the STOL operation, the question of hostesses, which has been discussed, the landholdings of some
of these companies, the advisability or otherwise of the
expenditure on the CNR tower in Toronto, the situation in
regard to grain cars or hoppers, the deficiency of which is
alleged to have cost Western Canadian farmers $500 million this year, nor the question of level crossings and the
very high accident rate, which concerns many people, nor
the derailments, nor the somewhat extraordinary operations such as Air Canada's purchase of or buying into
Wardair and the Comstock Company, or the broader question of the CPR nationalization, which of course has been
discussed in these debates. All these matters are important, but what we have before us is this particular bill
which deals strictly with the financing of these two
companies.
I would call attention to the name of the bill:
An Act to authorize the provision of moneys to meet
certain capital expenditures of the Canadian National
Railways System and Air Canada for the period from
the lst day of January, 1973, to the 30th day of June,
1974, and to authorize the guarantee by Her Majesty of
certain securities to be issued by the Canadian
National Railway Company and certain debentures to
be issued by Air Canada.
Honourable senators who have been attending debates
here on this subject will not be surprised when I say that
some of the moneys this bill provides have already been
spent, and that some of the guarantees to be authorized
under this bill have already been made. This is the old
story, part of the mess of which I have spoken, which this
bill represents.
The bill itself deals basically with financing, with "parliamentary control," which I put in quotation marks

SENATE DEBATES
because the degree of parliamentary control over CNR and
Air Canada is about as minimal as the control of any
crown corporation can be, even of a proprietary corporation under the Financial Administration Act.
There is a long, long history of dissatisfaction with this
so-called annual bill. No matter how far you go back in the
records, I can find nobody who has ever said it is a good
bill. I have never heard of anybody, no minister introducing it, nobody supporting it, who has said that this bill is
in itself a good bill. On the contrary, I have heard many
other views. Honourable senators will remember, for
example, that the minister who preceded the Honourable
Mr. Marchand, namely, the Honourable Mr. Jamieson, had
this to say the last time this type of bill was before
Parliament:
I do not want to take responsibility for something
that has been embedded in the system for decades
really, but nevertheless it is something that, in my
judgment, we ought to get rid of or improve in some
way so that we do not have the kind of situation
where it is, in a way, an after-the-fact judgment.
S(1410)

That was the Minister of Transport in 1971, and this is the
year 1974.
Hon. Mr. Martin: What did Mr. Hees say in 1961? He
was very enthusiastic, was he not?
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I beg your pardon?
Hon. Mr. Martin: I was just wondering if in 1961 Mr.
Hees did not express himself in what might be called a
natural and typical form of enthusiasm.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I have to say to the honourable
Leader of the Government that I did not go back that far
in my research.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I just asked the question.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I am replying that I do not know,
because I did not go back that far. I very much doubt that
even Mr. Hees-who was perhaps one of the most
enthusiastic Ministers of Transport that we have had in
many years-would have said that this was a good bill.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: May I point out that the minister
responsible for that bill is the Minister of Transport, not
the Minister of Finance.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Of course. That is a very interesting
observation, because this is exactly part of the utter confusion-the multiplicity of bills. It is interesting that Senator Langlois should have raised the question. The Minister
of Finance, when he was before the committee, said over
and over again that it had nothing to do with him, that it
was a matter we would have to take up with the Minister
of Transport. He said that all he does is find out whether
they need the money, and then the Minister of Transport
is responsible for making sure, if he can, that the money is
well spent.
I said that this bill deals with financing, parliamentary
control, and auditing. The situation is that this "annual"
bill has not been before Parliament in the last two years.
We had the 1970 bill, which covered the provision for some
funding of the Canadian National Railways and Air
[Hon. Mr. Grosart.]

April 9, 1974

Canada up to June 30, 1971. That was the 1970 bill. There
was no 1971 bill, no 1972 bill.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: There was a bill in 1971 but it was
not passed before dissolution.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: There was no 1971 bill equivalent to
this. There was no 1972 bill. The bill we have before us is
actually the 1973 bill, which provides for the financing of
the Canadian National Railways and Air Canada for the
whole year 1973-which has gone by, of course; yet we are
being asked here to authorize the provision of moneys and
to authorize certain guarantees, all of which is retroactive,
but even this bill will run only until June 30 of this year. I
suppose that another bill will be introduced then-we
might get it in 1980-a bill which will be retroactive in the
same way as this bill is retroactive.
I say the bill is a farce. The title is misleading. At least
two presidents of the Canadian National Railways and Air
Canada made the point that the title is absolutely misleading, and the present Minister of Finance agreed that that
was so. The former president of the CNR had something to
say about this bill. I am speaking of Mr. Vaughan who,
when he was before our committee, actually said:
The Canadian National Railways and Air Canada
would like to see this mess cleaned up. We are prepared to submit to the government the kind of bill
that will make sense, that will get through Parliament
in the normal way. I would be glad, and my people
would be gladHon. Mr. Langlois: How could he guarantee that it
would get through Parliament in the normal way?
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I said that he said that was his hope
and that he was prepared to submit to the government a
mechanism, if you like, which in his view-and I would
respect his view-would provide the kind of bill that
Parliament could deal with more expeditiously than it
seems it can deal with this kind of bill. He said:
I would be glad and my people would be glad to advise
the government and assist the government in dealing
with this legislation and the improvement of this
legislation.
Nothing has happened. He points out that the problem is
the measure of accountability and control. He has asked
the government how proprietary corporations are to be
operated and what is the measure of control that the
Parliament of Canada is to have over them. Here is the
president of a corporation with assets of $4.5 billion, who
bas to say: "We would like to be told what our responsibility is to Parliament." And they have not been told.
I say the bill is a farce. There is no provision in the bill,
for example, for dealing with the problem of the spin-off
of Air Canada from the CNR; yet the Minister of Finance,
Mr. Turner, has himself said he is in favour of it. Even five
years ago there were expressions that this should be
brought about. Again we had the president of the CNR
saying that it made no sense that the CNR was the only
shareholder in Air Canada.
Clearly, it makes no sense that we should have a CNR
financing bill which provides for the financing of Air
Canada.

SENATE DEBATES

April 9, 1974

The bill is a reflection of the kind of absurdities which
can develop on a question of auditing. Honourable senators will be aware that although we have not had these
annual bills for the last two years, we have not yet had a
signed audited statement.
There are various theories as to why that bas happened.
I will not go into them now, except to say that a statement
has been made about the auditing situation by someone I
regard as an independent witness. This statement
appeared in the Financial Times of February 11 and is
headed, "Who cares that CN's report is unaudited?"
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Would the honourable senator
permit a question? Does he mean to suggest that there was
no auditing done? Is that what he is trying to say?
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Apparently the honourable senator
was not listening to me, because I made it quite clear
thatHon. Mr. Langlois:
question.

Would

you please

answer

my

Hon. Mr. Grosart: My statement was quite clear that
there had not been a signed audited statement. That is
what I said.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Do you admit that there was an
audit done, a continuing audit done, even if the auditors
were not appointed by Parliament?
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Of course I agree.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: You agree to that?
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I have not said that the statement
was not audited. I said that the auditors did not, would not
and could not sign it, and I suggest to the honourable
senator that if he were the director of a company and
found himself in the position where his auditors could not
and would not sign the audited statement, he would be
running for cover much faster than the government
appears to be running for cover in this situation.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: This happened in 1963, too.
Hon. Mr. Martin: And before that, too.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I am not particularly concerned with
what happened before 1963, or before 1867 for that matter.
I am only concerned with the present case.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Before 1963 you had a great deal of
influence, though.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: That allegation was made in some
headlines by the present Leader of the Government. I
denied it at the lime and I deny it now.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Well, I assure you that I never said
that before. I just said it to try to make my honourable
friend's course a little easier today. That is all.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: You are simply too humble.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: As a matter of fact, I thank the
Leader of the Government and any other senator who on
this particular occasion will help to make my course
easier. I confess that when I got into the evidence of this
mess I remembered my doctor's orders that I was not to
get excited, and I took a tranquilizer before entering the
chamber.

27601-17

Sorne Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: The statement that I referred to in
the FinancialTimes is to be found at page 9 of the issue for
February 11, 1974. The article refers to Mr. Richard Lafferty, head of Lafferty Harwood & Partners Ltd., a Montreal
firm of investment analysts. Apparently Mr. Lafferty, in
addressing the Winnipeg Society of Financial Analysts at
the beginning of February, stated: "The 1972 financial
statement of the CNR is not audited". I am not saying that
Mr. Lafferty is correct there, but he says that the 1972
financial statement is not audited "because there is a
schism within the Cabinet as to who should derive the
benefits of the patronage, and so the appointment of auditors is unresolved."

e

(1420)

I am not saying I know that to be true, it is just a feeling
that has been engendered apparently in the financial community. But he goes on further to say that he would like to
address himself to the question of:
how badly the federal government handles those businesses for which it is already responsible.
With that I leave the question of auditing, but I say
again that it is an utter disgrace that the financial statements of these two large and important corporations
should not have been signed by their auditors in these two
years, whatever the reason may be.
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: What two years?
Hon. Mr. Grosart: 1972 and 1973. They have not been
signed by the auditors for those two years.
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: We haven't even got the statements for 1973.
Hon. Mr. Martin: The bill was not passed.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Because Parliament did not legislate
at all.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I would be quite happy if the three
honourable senators on the other side wanted to carry on a
debate on this subject, but the only suggestion I would
make is that they should speak a little louder because I
would like to be in on it. I am not objecting, but I would
like to have heard what was going on, particularly what
Senator Benidickson said, because I am sure he will have
some comments on this. There is no member of this
Senate, as far as I am aware, who is so fully informed on
this matter as lie is. I shall be very much surprised if he
does not support some of the statements I have made.
Some reference was made in the front bench debate on
the other side to the fact that something was not passed
through Parliament.
Hon. Mr. Martin: No, not at all.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Well, I thought I heard that phrase,
but it does not matter.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I just said how well Senator Grosart
is speaking.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: If the Leader of the Government
keeps this up, then I will not have to take the other half of
that tranquilizer.

SENATE DEBATES
Then we come to the final statement on this matter, Mr.
Marchand's statement on March 7 that our transportation
policy was in a mess-and there must be a little Irish in
Mr. Marchand because he went on to say immediately that
we have no transportation policy. But I think we all got
the point of what he meant; that is, if we have one, then it
is a mess, and what we are dealing with today, of course, is
merely a part of that mess.
The question of the slow progress of these bills through
Parliament is rather interesting. CNR and Air Canada
operate on a calendar year and not on the fiscal year that
the government operates on. I have often wondered why
in these bills we have provision for a year, usually the
year just passed, and then for an ongoing period of six
months. That is the case with this bill. The CNR said that
the reason is that, "We are never sure if we can get these
bills through Parliament, and therefore we are giving
ourselves an extra six months so that when the bill does
get through, when the government manages to move it up
in the priority list to get it through Parliament, we won't
be too far behind." So we are in the happy position,
honourable senators, if it is a happy position now, of
having before us in this particular bill authorizations for
18 months of which only 16 have gone by. That is the
situation-16 months of the 18 months in spite of their
hope that by giving themselves an extra six months they
could put themselves in the position where they could
operate without going through some of the very, very
strange wordings that I will refer to in a minute.
One of the problems here, of course, as I said at the start,
is that we are dealing with so many acts of Parliament,
and just to mention a few-and these are not all-that I
have run across in my reading, there is, of course, the CNR
act itself, the National Transportation Act, 1967-now
generally described as one of the disasters of our time, and
a continuing disaster, apparently-the CNR Capital Revision Act, the CNR Refunding Act, the Maintenance of
Railways Operations Act, the CNR Financing and Guarantee Act which is this one, and the various regional acts
such as the Atlantic Region Freight Assistance Act, and
many more. Then, of course, there is the Financial
Administration Act which governs these companies in
their capacity as proprietary crown corporations.
When this bill goes to a committee of the Senate, and I
hope that it does go to such a committee and I shall speak
to that point laterHon. Mr. Langlois: It will.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: -I am going to suggest that this is
one of the matters that the committee could address itself
to. There is no reason in the world why all these acts could
not be consolidated into one act. This would be a tremendous improvement in the situation, because I have no
doubt that those who have not inquired into the situation
will be saying, "If there wasn't the annual Financing and
Guarantee Act covering 1971 and 1972, how did they carry
on? How did they operate?" Well, they do so in various
ways.
It is fair to say, I think, that I am not generally critical
of the CNR or Air Canada in their financing operations. I
have great sympathy with their problems, and it is also
fair to say that certainly in the case of the CNR, they have
generated out of their own revenues most of the capital
[Hon. Mr. Grosart.]

April 9, 1974

they have required. The large totals, to which one could
add up all the amounts in this bill, are in themselves
deceiving. We have had talk about "billions of dollars" of
public money, but I admit immediately that that is not the
case. There is probably not more than a million dollars,
most of it in loans, with probably $23 million or so in the
branch linesHon. Mr. Langlois: There are $21 million.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Yes, $21 million, and another $40
million-which would be two amounts of $40 million each
taking into account the two years 1973 and 1974-in the
purchase of preference shares. That, I think, is about the
total of actual demand on the government, and that is
about the total that we are required to authorize as an
outflow of government money. I say that because I want to
be fair.
Speaking of the slow progress through Parliament, it is
easy for the government to say, "Well, it is very hard to
get bills through Parliament." But the reason it is hard to
get this bill through Parliament is that it encourages
members in the other place to raise every kind of criticism
they have from the abandonment of a branch line to the
length of the skirts of the hostesses on Air Canada. If the
government were to restructure this-and I would hope
that this is something our committee might address itself
to-so that that kind of debate would take place on the
presentation of the annual reports of CN, Air Canada and
CP as well, which I think is the proper place, then the
debate on this bill could be limited to the problems of the
financial structure of CN and Air Canada, both of which
are totally inadequate to the discharge of the responsibilities that have been placed upon them by Parliament.
This bill, for example, is the grandson of Bill C-4, which
was the annual bill for 1972 and which the government
never got through Parliament, and the son of Bill C-164,
which would have been the 1973 bill, and now we have Bill
C-5 which is in fact almost a dead issue because it is only
effective for another two months. Indeed, so extraordinary
is the situation that the bill before us is only before us
because Parliament agreed to the ministry's suggestion
that the bill of last year, March 8, 1973 be advanced to the
report stage in this Parliament. In other words, they said
we will take all the discussion that has gone on in committee as having taken place with respect to this bill which, of
course, it did not. This is the kind of absurdity which the
government is getting itself into by its mismanagement of
Parliament.
*

(1430)

I said one of the problems here is the lack of parliamentary control. This complaint has been made for years.
Nobody has received this information, not even as I
quoted, the former president of the CNR and the president
of Air Canada, who have both pleaded with the government to advise them of their relationship to Parliament.
I do not intend to go into the whole long question of the
various types of crown corporations, their responsibilities
and the degree of parliamentary control of each kind of
corporation, but it is quite clear that there is no definitive
understanding on the part of Parliament, the government,
or these corporations as to what their relationship is to
parliamentary control. I am not saying that every crown
corporation should be completely subject to parliamentary

April 9, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

control in all its operations. That would be impossible, but
the limits, the parameters of parliamentary control must
be laid down. This is another case where a Senate committee could very well at least suggest, if not initiate, legislation to effect.
I said how did they get along for two years? Well, one
thing, as Mr. Turner knew well, is that there is an act
called the Canadian National Railways Refunding Act,
under which he could make some temporary loans, apart
from the fact that this bill is intended to cover this whole
area. But he said, "We will lend you some money under
that act but for the rest you will have to go and borrow
from the banks." In one, I think, unguarded moment the
minister said it was urgent to get this bill through. That
was last year. It was urgent that we get it through before
the end of the year. He was asked why. "Well," he said,
"because the bank rates are so high and the government
can lend the money at much lower rates." This is true, of
course, but this is merely another form of subsidy. I am
not sure that it would be the worst thing in the world if
the CNR and Air Canada were required to borrow their
money at current rates. It would result in some difficulties, but with the proper restructuring of both of them
they could be put in a position where they would be able
to go to the market for their money and not rely on some
of these very shadowy, if not shady, devices such as the
purchase of preference shares. This was again made possible under a former act-I think it was an act of 1952under which we were in the fiction that the government
bought preferred shares in the CNR but actually just gave
them the money, of course. It is true that those preferred
shares, I think during the war years, paid a dividend.
Perhaps that was also so in an odd year since the war, but
it certainly did not occur very often. In my opinion there
is a very general realization that the purchase of preferred
shares by the government, as is provided for in this bill, is
merely a fiction to cover up the real extent of the government financing of the CNR. Again, I am not critical. I am
not one who suggests that the CNR or Air Canada should
be required to show a profit every year. I am not arguing
that point. I am merely saying that it is important that we
clarify the situation and, instead of having all these
devices to cover up the deficits or to provide the necessary
capital, we have it clearly stated and done the way it
would be done in an ordinary business, which is certainly
not the way it is done here.
Mr. Turner, very much to his credit, did provide the
other place with two complete tables showing how the
CNR and Air Canada got along and what the sources of
their funds were during that period. The tables are to be
found at page 49 of the proceedings of the Transport and
Communications Committee in the other place of November 8. They are in an appendix.
I do not intend to take time to run down the various
clauses of the bill. Senator Langlois explained in perfectly
correct and valid language the meanings of these clauses,
and I have no quarrel with that explanation within the
limits of its intention.
At the moment there is, I think, a general tendency
around the country to say, "Well, let's not worry too much
about this." We have had Mr. Marchand's confession that
the whole thing is a mess, and on two occasions he has

made it clear that if he is not satisfied that it will be
cleaned up he will resign. He has said that twice. I see the
Leader of the Government looks askance, but I have the
references. He bas said twice, once on the radio, I believe,
and once in the House of Commons, that if this mess is not
cleared up, I take it to his satisfaction, he will resign. In
my point of view that is very heartening.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I only know of one administration of
which that seemed to be a habit.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: It has not been a habit of the present
minister, and that is probably what makes it all the more
significant. As a matter of fact, there is an administration
that has been in office now for about 10 years which has
had a good many resignations, due to some of which, I
must say, we in the Senate were great beneficiaries,
including that of the Leader of the Government.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Would you explain that a little more?
I find it subtle.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I am delighted that the Leader of the
Government f inds it subtle. Perhaps I should leave it at
that, because in my opinion it is always a mistake to
attempt to explain a subtle remark that is given as a
compliment.
Hon. Mr. Srnith: Some of us understand it.
Hon. Mr. Martin: If it was a compliment, I really wish
you would go into the details.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I will conclude my remarks by
saying that we are delighted to have this confession and
its implications but, as someone else said, and I think very
wisely, even a good confession is no substitute for
competence.
Hon. W. M. Benidickson: Honourable senators, Senator
Grosart indicated that I probably would, or should, say
something with respect to this bill. It is true that a bill in
this form is something with which I am familiar. For six
or seven years I was in the other place the sponsor of a bill
of a similar nature. Then, later, for a few years I was on
the other side in that house and was asked to speak, if
appropriate, in a critical manner with respect to such bills.
However, it is my recollection that in those years when
such a bill was presented it was more up-to-date in its
subject matter than it would appear this bill is today. As
Senator Grosart has pointed out, it is a very peculiar
situation. As I see it, in accordance with practice and, I
think, in accordance with law, the last properly presented
bill was for the annual calendar year 1970. Perhaps there
is some complicated method of explaining how the
Canadian National Railways and its subsidiary corporation, Air Canada, got funds to keep operating in 1971 and
1972, but I personally am not too well acquainted with it.
Today I rise chiefly to emphasize the importance of this
body in utilizing one of its committees to inquire and get
explanations of these rather unusual methods of carrying
on business of the substance of these two large
corporations.
*

(1440)

I want to avoid repeating what has been well said in this
debate by other senators, but I do not think there bas been
such mention of a point that I think the committee should
question particularly. I do not think it bas yet been point-

SENATE DEBATES

ed out that we are being asked in this bill to authorize
expenditures required chiefly for the calendar year 1973,
and we are doing so without having before us the annual
reports for the year 1973. The latest annual reports for the
CNR and Air Canada of which I am aware are those for
1972. I say that this bill should go to a committee for study,
and I do not think it is proper, or that it is perhaps even
contemplated by anybody, that we should dispose of our
inquiries prior to the proposed adjournment for Easter.
Indeed, it might take a considerable period of time after
Easter to inquire properly into some of the transportation
questions that have so far been raised in this debate, in the
press, and in many other quarters across the country.
With regard to the matter of urgency, I would say that if
we got along without legislative enactments for financing
expenditures in 1971 and 1972, and if we are going to deal
now in this bill with 1973 expenditures retroactively, I
cannot see too much pressure or urgency for action in this
chamber at this time. I therefore think that this bas no
effect upon either the time we rise for the Easter recess or
the time that we are asked to come back after that recess.
The failure to provide a 1973 report prior to the time we
consider 1973 operations is unfortunate. In addition, I do
not think it is necessary. Last week the Financial Post
published a fairly substantial advertisement, which doubtless was presented by the Canadian Pacific Railway, entitled in big letters, "1973 Annual Report." In smaller print
it goes on to outline some of the highlights of that report. I
personally have not yet received in the mail, as I usually
do, and as all members of Parliament usually do, a copy of
the report. But here is a summary in this publication.
Dealing with the financial figures, it gives a statement of
income in 1973 and compares it with the income in 1972,
illustrating increases and decreases as they apply. If a
committee is properly to consider the 1973 financial
requirements of the Canadian National Railways and Air
Canada, even in retrospect, we should at least have some
statements, even if they are not finally audited, about the
1973 operations. It has been possible to do that, as I say,
with the other large railway operation, Canadian Pacific
Limited.
When listening to Senator Grosart this afternoon, I was
reminded that the last time we had a debate in this
chamber of a similar nature to the one we are having
today, and continuing on from yesterday, was in 1971.
Some of the references Senator Grosart was making this
afternoon must really refer to what, for instance, Mr.
Vaughan was saying in 1971. It related to the necessity for
revisions of our statutes. It was in 1971, I think, that be
and senior officers of the Canadian National Railways
said that if invited they would be willing to assist officers
of the government in designing legislation that might
assure parliamentary control, and yet not be as cumbersome as experience forces us to believe the present legislation is. Even when the 1972 CNR report was presented in
Parliament as long ago as June 5, 1973, the minister was
obliged to say in presenting it:
The annual reportsThat is the reports of the Canadian National Railways and
Air Canada.
-are tabled now in order to conform as much as
possible to the existing legislation, and to give hon.
[Hon. Mr. Benidickson.]

April 9, 1974

members the opportunity to examine the activities of
Air Canada and the Canadian National Railways for
1972.
I suggest that if a committee is to undertake this examination, we should make some inquiries about what, if any,
statutes have been breached in the last several years, and
perhaps assist those responsible in designing, or making
suggestions for designing, alternative legislation that will
prevent a veiled excuse of this kind being necessary when
an important report of this kind is presented to
Parliament.
There is one other thing that I should like to draw to the
attention of the house at this time on second reading
debate on the subject. It has been intimated to me that a
convenient way of getting parliamentary authority for the
financing of these two crown corporations, as an alternative to the method that stems from existing statutes, might
be to eliminate the statutes and proceed simply by means
of items in the estimates. Senator Grosart and 1, and
others, have for many years been protesting the increasing
amount of legislating being done-recently less conspicuously-in this way, by language attached to items in the
estimates.
In this chamber there is no limit to the discussion of any
item in the estimates. Under the recent new rules in the
House of Commons, however, there is some limitation on
the time allotment for debate in that chamber itself of
items in the estimates. In committees of the whole for
discussion of supply, time is not limited but it is not as
widely made known. It is conceivable, therefore, that
while discussion might be limitless in committees, it might
come to a point where practically all the allotted time for
House of Commons chamber debate would have expired
before such large items as are mentioned in a bill of this
kind, if placed simply in the estimates, came before the
main chamber in that bouse.
* (1450)

Honourable senators, I want to say something about the
capital structure. From perusal of some of the last evidence of the committee on Transport and Communications
of the other place, which was heard last year prior to
December when a final report was made, I note that we
got, as we have over the years, particularly from those
with socialist ideas, the thought that we should again wipe
out some of the capital debt obligations of the Canadian
National Railways.
I would like to see the justification of this studied by
the Senate because, as I pointed out on I think, March 6 or
7, 1971, there was a massive revision of the capital structure of the Canadian National Railways in 1952. It seemed
to be a revision that had then endorsement from senior
officers of the Canadian National Railway Company.
There are some members of the other place-usually
those with deep socialist philosophy-who think that the
lot of a crown corporation should be made as light as
possible, without regard to standard business practice or
respect for obligations incurred and the ensuing obligation
to pay interest on borrowings that have occurred. I want
to repeat that I thought the revisions of 1952 made it fair
to the railroad to go ahead with the expectation that its
operations would generate income adequate to pay interest on the written-down debt as then arranged. The

April 9, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

revised capital structure seems to have been satisfactory
to all then.
If it has been forgotten, not only by some members of
Parliament but even now by some officers of the railroad,
I want to quote from the Annual Report of 1952, after
this financial revision, the words of Mr. Donald Gordon,
who was then the president of the CNR. Under the heading "Revision of the Capital Structure", he had this to say:
The Canadian National Railways Capital Revision
Act, 1952, which received Royal Assent on July 4th,
was based on the findings of the Royal Commission on
Transportation appointed on December 29, 1948, to
examine and report, among other things, on the capital structure of the Canadian National.
The effect on the Balance Sheet of the adjustments
made by the Act are illustrated on page 34. The major
changes can be summarized as follows:
1. Interest-bearing debt to the amount of $736,385,405,
representing half of the Borrowed Capital outstanding on December 31, 1951, was exchanged for 4 per
cent Preferred Stock, on which non-cumulative
dividends must be paid to the extent that earnings
are available after income tax has been paid.
2. Outstanding loans from Government to the amount
of $100 million were converted into a 3 5/8 per cent
twenty-year debenture maturing January 1, 1972, on
which no interest is payable for the f irst ten years.
Before I quote further from this reference to the revision of the capital structure of the CNR, I want to make a
personal observation. As Senator Grosart also pointed out,
in subsequent years some of this revised debt continued to
be a forgiven obligation with respect to interest.
In the 1952 annual report Mr. Gordon continued:
3. The capital stock of the Canadian National Railways Securities Trust was transferred to the
Canadian National Railway Company in exchange
for a like amount of the Company's capital stock.
Again as an aside, I would suggest that when the committee sits this year it inquire as to the dollar values of that
transaction. The CNR president added:
4. In each of the years 1952 to 1960 inclusive the
Government will purchase 4 per cent Preferred
Stock in amounts equal to 3 per cent of the annual
gross revenues, these funds to be used for financing
capital improvements.
Of course, these applicable dates have again also been
extended by statute. I think, however, we should inquire
as to the total funds provided up to the end of 1973 for the
purchase of low interest 4 per cent non-cumulative preferred stock. We should find that in the latest report we
have, but it is only an amount to the end of 1972. Certainly
we should now have not only some preliminary figures for
1973-1 am sure they are available-but we should be told
the amount of those advances from 1952 to date.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: They got $1.2 billion.
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: To the end of 1972?
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: Yes, it would probably be $1.2
billion to the end of 1972?

Hon. Mr. Grosart: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: Honourable senators, without
taking further time, I would like to draw attention to a
very good outline of the problems respecting railway operations today in the eyes of the present Minister of Transport. These views are outlined in a very prominent section
of the Toronto Star of April 6, last Saturday. The heading
is: "Our 'National Dream' Railway is Jean Marchand's
Nightmare." I will not even capsule the various items that
are said to be of great concern to him, and will be of
concern to our committee when it sits to discuss this
financing and guarantee bill.
Honourable senators, that is all I will say at the
moment. I feel the Senate could fulfil a very important
role by taking an objective look over the past, and having
a discussion with the Minister of Finance who has presented this bill for our consideration at this time. We
should examine also the Minister of Transport and his
relationships with senior officials of both crown corporations, and consideration could be given to what is-and I
agree with Senator Grosart on this-an urgent need for
revision and streamlining for the benefit of Parliament of
existing statutes that relate to this type of financing.

[Translation]
Hon. Martial Asselin: Honourable senators, I would like
to make a few comments concerning the bill now before
us. We need not go into detail since we will probably have
the opportunity of doing so before the Senate Committee
on Transport and Communications, and putting the questions that not only we but also the Canadian taxpayers
have been asking themselves for a while on the operations
of the Canadian National Railways and Air Canada.
I will confess quite frankly that I always found the bill
now before us extremely strange. If I remember correctly,
this bill is introduced annually even though an exception
was made in 1972 when the House of Commons did not
have time to consider it and neither did we. I find it
strange to hear a financierHon. Mr. Langlois: You are clever.
Hon. Mr. Asselin: As I say, what I find strange is that
Senator Langlois, a business man, the director of several
companies, should have accepted to move a bill through
which we are asked to pay the debts incurred, without a
financial statement having been submitted by the authorities of the company concerned.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: The godparents do not choose their
godchildren: the parents do.
Hon. Mr. Asselin: I know Senator Langlois as an
administrator and director of responsible companies, and
he is asking us to pay bills retroactively, when he has not
been handed a financial statement, when no financial
statement has been signed by auditors, as Senators Grosart and Benidickson pointed out. We are asked, under
articles 9 and 11 of the bill, to cover debts from January
1973 to July 1974, without in fact knowing whether those
debts have really been incurred. In addition, honourable
senators, we must study the income and expenditures of a
crown company, a company that must finance itself with
taxes from the income of the taxpayers. This is not surprising. I could not agree more with Senators Grosart and

SENATE DEBATES

Benidickson because I feel it is high time that the transport and communications policy in Canada should be
straightened out.
A few days ago we heard a statement which has awakened a number of people when the Minister of Transport,
the Honourable Jean Marchand, stated in the House and
outside that he had no power to implement the policies
which are required to modernize transportation in
Canada. Throughout the country, whether in western or
eastern regions, attempts have been made for several
years to correct our transportation policies. Prime Minister Pearson and his Cabinet tried, I think, in 1968.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: In 1967.
Hon. Mr. Asselin: In 1967. They tried to give Canadians
a better transportation system. That was seven years ago
and now the Minister of Transport says that no tangible
results have been obtained.
I think it is obvious to those who pay for the financing
of crown corporations that the time has come for an
in-depth study of the policy of crown corporations. Transportation should follow the modernization of industrialized countries such as ours. For the last few years, Canada
bas been modernized at an extremely rapid rate and our
transportation policy in its present form did not follow
that rate and consequently, both in the western and eastern regions of Canada, we find acute transportation problems which are basically affecting our economy. This is
why I hope that the mover of this bill will agree that we
should not pass this bill immediately.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Nobody suggested that.
Hon. Mr. Asselin: No, but I am always afraid of the
attempts made by the government leader to make us pass
the bills too quickly.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Take your time.
Hon. Mr. Asselin: We have always been told that this
house-and I try to understand the government leaderthe Senate, is the place where bills are passed swifter than
elsewhere.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Quicker than elsewhere.

e

(1500)

Hon. Mr. Asselin: Quicker also and with perhaps happier implications, because we are here not to face the electorate, but to help the people of the other place to consider
more thoroughly the bills before us.
Now, the government leader should not tell us that be
has never been tempted or never sought, honourable senators, to have the bills swiftly passed.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Who is never tempted?
Hon. Mr. Asselin: I understand. We could give him
many examples of the eagerness he has often shown when
seeking the approval of the policies of his government.
In any case I am glad-this is Holy Week-that the
Leader of the Government decided to make good resolutions and tell us that we will have all the time we need to
examine and scrutinize this bill before us in committee.
Those were the remarksHon. Mr. Martin: I am merely raising a point, I am
sorry. This bill could even be discussed during the Easter
[Hon. Mr. Asselin.]

April 9, 1974

recess. We must take all the time necessary to make that
examination.
Hon. Mr. Asselin: I have no objection to staying here
during the whole Easter recess provided the Leader of the
Government can have some Easter water for us if he still
believes in that.
In any case if this bill is sent to committee, as it will be,
I will certainly have important questions to ask CNR
officials about the implementation of their policy, especially in remote areas of this country because I think that
crown companies must serve people in remote areas who
are economically weaker.
In passing I would like to give you only one example. I
think that in an area such as Charlevoix on the south
shore where highway transportation is more difficult, the
CNR and Air Canada should play more important roles in
trving to help the economy of those remote areas. That is
the function of any crown company.
Now, I should say incidently that in spite of the port
facilities we have at Pointe-au-Pic, with companies operating in that area, we have not been spoiled by the CNR in
our efforts to get preferential rates so as to develop the
economy and the port facilities of that region of our
country. Of course, that might be outside the bill before
us.
I just wanted to show that if this bill is sent to committee several senators will have important questions to ask.
An extensive review of this bill is required. As Senator
Grosart said, we have to develop a more consistent policy
of the many bills respecting the Canadian National and
Air Canada. I think that it will be necessary to stop at one
point to find a more logical, more understandable legislation and to give these crown corporations the means to
make proper use of the moneys they are provided with by
the taxpayers so as to serve the general public.
Therefore, I would thank the sponsor of this bill, especially the Leader of the Government who has agreed that
the bill be referred to committee. I think that this bill is of
interest to all honourable senators and that a serious study
in committee will be of benefit to Air Canada, the Canadian National as well as the population of Canada in
general.

Hon. Leopold Langlois: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I have to
inform the Senate that if Senator Langlois speaks now his
speech will have the effect of closing the debate on the
second reading of this bill.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, I shall limit
my remarks to answering some of the questions which
were put to me last evening and this afternoon in connection with this bill.
My first reference will be to the remarks made by my
honourable friend, Senator Grosart, who yesterday
seemed to be surprised to see that this bill, which seemingly provided funds to the CNR and Air Canada, was presented to this chamber after the expenditures had been
made. I think this impression of his is due to the fact that
he must have read the title of the bill too rapidly. To my

April 9, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

mind, the title of the bill is quite clear. Even though it
makes reference to moneys, it is not a money bill. It is not
a bill to provide the CNR or Air Canada with funds to
carry on, or authority to spend the money provided in
their capital budgets.
The title of the bill is as follows:
An Act to authorize the provision of moneys to meet
certain capital expenditures of the Canadian National
Railways System and Air Canada for the period from
the lst day of January, 1973, to the 30th day of June,
1974, and to authorize the guarantee by Her Majesty of
certain securities to be issued by the Canadian
National Railway Company and certain debentures to
be issued by Air Canada.
Surely the title is clear. This is not a bill to provide
funds to Canadian National Railways or to Air Canada; it
is to provide the f inancing of deficiencies, because both of
these corporations, as I explained briefly last night, are
f inanced primarily through their own generated revenues,
and if those revenues are deficient, or if they are not
sufficient to meet the expenditures, then these corporations have to go either to the public to borrow money, or
have the Minister of Finance make loans and advances
and to guarantee the issue of debentures to provide the
funds that are.needed to make both ends meet. That is the
authority which is being sought in this bill. It is simply to
authorize the Minister of Finance to make loans and to
guarantee debentures of both corporations. That is the sole
purpose of this bill.
As I also said last night, I assume that the capital
budgets of both corporations-that is, the CNR and Air
Canada-have been approved by the Governor in Council
on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, the
President of the Treasury Board, and the Minister of
Transport. They have, then, the authority to go ahead and
spend the money provided in their capital budgets. They
need not come to Parliament to get further authorization
to proceed with the expenditures outlined in their capital
budgets. I feel that this will dispose of the first remark
made last night by Senator Grosart.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Would the honourable senator permit
a question? Would he not agree that from the wording,
which is clear in English anyway, this bill is to authorize
the provision of moneys? That can mean only one thing in
English, and that is to authorize or to provide money.
Would he not agree that this bill asks us to authorize the
provision of moneys which have already been provided
under the guarantee, and would he not also agree that Air
Canada went ahead and issued debentures, and raised
money through a French financial firm, under a guarantee, to purchase the Rolls Royce engines; that that was
done a long time ago now, and that it is now seeking under
this bill a guarantee from the government which was part
of the original understanding?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I am happy that my honourable
friend gave this example of Air Canada's financing the
purchase of Rolls Royce engines and components, because
this financing was done without any authority from either
the Minister of Finance or the government. Her Majesty's
government had nothing to do with it. That is one of the
reasons why if there is no urgency, there is at least the
necessity of passing this legislation as soon as possible. In

2'7601-18

saying that it is not my intention to put pressure on
honourable senators, but I am informed that the time is
long overdue for this guarantee by the Government of
Canada to be given.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: But the deal is already made.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: The deal is already made, but we are
in the situation where the deal has been postponed for a
long time because of the f inancial and other problems that
Rolls Royce was experiencing. The result was that the
signing of this contract between Rolls Royce and Air
Canada was delayed for more than a year. But I think the
time has now come-in fact it is long overdue-for the
guarantee from the Government of Canada to be given if
we want the deal to be effective.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Would not the honourable senator
agree that the phrase "long overdue" means, and, in fact,
makes it quite clear, that this is retroactive legislation?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I never said it was not retroactive.
What I said was that we are not providing money; we are
merely guaranteeing obligations entered into by the CNR
and Air Canada.
Hon. Mr. Asselin: That is the same thing.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: We are not providing dollars and
cents. We are giving a guarantee, and that is all.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Not today, but tomorrow!
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I think my explanation is quite
clear, and I am sorry if some of my honourable friends do
not agree with me. However, even though I am now closing the debate, they will have the opportunity, if this bill
is referred, as I hope it will be, to the Transport and
Communications Committee of this house, to raise these
questions, and officials of these corporations will be available to inform them further.
Senator Grosart also touched briefly on the reply that I
gave to his question as to how the CNR and Air Canada
were able to proceed without any financing and guarantee
bill for almost two years. My answer, as honourable senators will remember, was that they were able to survive and
meet their expenditures through their generated revenues
and through advances and loans from the Minister of
Finance. After I gave this reply to my honourable friend,
he referred the Senate to an answer which was given by
the Minister of Finance before the Transport and Communications Committee of the other place. He referred to
page 9 of Issue No. 18, dated November 8, 1973, of the
proceedings of that committee, where the answer given by
the minister was as follows:
I might interject here to say that a good many of the
temporary advances that I have had to make, because
this bill has not been passed for a couple of years,
have been made under the CNR Refunding Act, and
we will deal with that, I am sure, on questions.
This is not contrary to the answer I gave the honourable
senator. For further clarification I have obtained copies of
the documents tabled before the committee of the other
place, to which I have referred, by the Minister of Finance
giving a statement of sources and application of funds for
the CNR for the calendar year 1971-72. I have had copies
made, and since it is a very lengthy document I would
suggest that these copies be distributed now to honourable

April 9, 1974

SENATE DEBATES
senators for perusal to enable them to follow my
explanation.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Might I ask the honourable senator if
that is the annex I referred to?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: That is quite right. You referred to
it this afternoon. As I say, I thought that for convenience I
would have copies made for the use of honourable senators
in this debate. These are statements of sources and
applications of funds for the calendar years 1971 and 1972
for both Canadian National Railways and Air Canada. If it
is the wish of honourable senators, I would suggest that
these statements be printed in the Debatesof today. I am in
the hands of the Senate in this matter.

SENATE DEBATES

[Translation]
Hon. Mr. Martin: You see, we want to give all the
information possible.
Hon. Mr. Asselin: It is about time.

[English]
Hon. Mr. Langlois: When the Minister of Finance distributed these statements to the members of the Transportation and Communications Committee of the other place,
he made a statement which I would like to read in order
to provide a fuller explanation of the contents of the
tables. I referred a few moments ago to large amounts of
cash generated internally by the CNR by its operation,
and I think it is important for honourable senators to
understand this. The minister said:
Honourable members will also be interested to see
how the company was able to operate in the absence
of a financing and guarantee act since the 1970 act,
which covered the period up to June 30, 1971 ... For
this purpose I have provided a statement of the CNR's
sources and applications of funds for the years 1971
and 1972 which you will find in the table at the back.
As can be seen, the CNR was able in 1971 to make its
$180.6 million of capital expenditures from the $118.2 million it generated from its operation, working capital and
property disposal, plus the $24.2 million voted by Parliament for its deficit and the greater part of the proceeds
from the government's purchase of preferred stock.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Would the honourable senator give
the citation for that which he read?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I was reading from the report of the
Transport and Communications Committee of the same
day-a statement by the Minister of Finance when he
tabled before the committee the very statements that I
have tabled this afternoon.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I have the document before me. I am
asking for the page number. It is Issue No. 18 of the
proceedings of that House of Commons committee.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I think it is on page 44.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: No, page 44 is the annex. I am asking
the honourable senator if he would tell me from which
page he was reading.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: It started at page 9.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: It is just that I wish to follow his
statement. Is he perhaps referring to the paragraph commencing at the bottom of page 10?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Yes, in the lower left-hand corner of
page 10. It reads as follows:
For this purpose I have provided a statement of the
CNR's sources and applications of funds for the years
1971 and 1972 which you will find in the table at the
back. I said I would like to distribute it, but there it is.
The minister continues on page 11:
Let us look at that table, sources and applications of
funds for the calendar years 1971 and 1972 for the
Canadian National Railways. The CNR was able-

27601-181

That is the point at which I was interrupted.
-in 1971 to make its $180.6 million capital expenditures-you will find that under the application of
funds, the first item-capital expenditures, $180.6 million, from a number of sources or you go over to the
funds generated by the CNR itself at the top of the
table and you get the total amount of funds generated
by the CNR of $118.2 million. That it gets from its
operations, from the cash flow of depreciation and
amortization which are book figures and, of course,
for cash-flow purpose are brought back into liquidity.
You get the net funds from operations; you add that to
the proceeds from properties that are retired or sold;
you have a working capital situation, and then you get
$118.2 million.
The minister continues explaining how this table is
made up, and then goes on to explain some of the sections
of Bill C-164. The third paragraph on page 11 reads as
follows:
Take a look at 1972. You go through the same exercise. The CN had capital expenditures of $173.1 million, shown in the first item under Application of
Funds. It had generated on its own-see Sources of
Funds-$157.8 million. Add the working capital and
disposition of property, and then the $17.8 million
voted by Parliament to cover the deficit in 1972, and
you have enough lef t to reduce its debt in the hands of
the public by $2.5 million.
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: Would the honourable senator
permit a question?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: I am sure that Senator Langlois
will agree that that information was probably available at
that time because 1971 and 1972 were completed calendar
years. However, 1973 was not a completed calendar year at
that time. Would the honourable senator undertake to
obtain, before the committee sits, comparable figures for
the calendar year 1973?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Yes, I will make that commitment
provided the information is available. I believe it should
be available at this time, and I will do my best to obtain it.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: May I make a suggestion to the
honourable senator? I agree with this explanation, and the
reference he gave is excellent. It would be worthwhile
including it in our proceedings today. I suggest it be lef t to
the honourable senator to select the appropriate paragraphs. For example, he omitted, for obvious reasons, the
second paragraph, which deals with the previous year. I
think it would be useful to have this explanation by the
minister included in our proceedings, with some of the
interjections omitted. In fact, I would not object if he left
out the reference to the Rolls Royce engines.
* (1530)

It would be helpful if selected portions of the minister's
explanation year by year, for both CN and Air Canada,
were appended to our proceedings. I would be happy to
leave the editing to Senator Langlois.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I have no objection to that suggestion, but I am at a loss to understand how I should proceed
in complying with your request.

SENATE DEBATES

April 9, 1974

Hon. Mr. Grosart: Perhaps I could make my suggestion
quite specific. I suggest that that portion of the proceedings commencing with the bottom paragraph on page 10,
through the whole of page 11, and down to the first
interjection on page 12. That is an excellent explanation. I
assure Senator Langlois that I have no political reason for
my suggestion. I make it only because I think that when
the committee deals with the matter it will be helpful to
have this in Hansard.

Hon. Mr. Martin: I certainly do not object to it, but I do
not think we should regard it as a precedent.

Hon. Mr. Langlois: I am endeavouring to understand
what Senator Grosart has in mind. Does he wish this
reproduced in today's Hansard?

Hon. Mr. Martin: A tradition more observed in the
breach.

Hon. Mr. Grosart: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Without my reading it?
Hon. Mr. Grosart: That is right. The honourable senator
was paraphrasing, understandably, to save time. It would
take a long time to read it all.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I have no objection to that.
Hon. Mr. Martin: May I address myself to Senator
Grosart, as well as to other honourable senators. What you
are asking, in effect, is that we include in Hansard the text
of a speech made in the House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: No, sir.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I wanted to make sure that we are not
doing that, otherwise Senator O'Leary would have a fit.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I think Senator Martin knows that I
am sufficiently well aware of the rules to know that that
would not be permitted. I am asking that a portion of the
proceedings of a committee of the other place be printed in
Hansard, which on any interpretation of our rules that I
have seen is quite proper.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: It is suggested that there be reproduced in today's Hansard an excerpt from the proceedings
of the Transport and Communications Committee of the
House of Commons of Thursday, November 8, 1973, that
excerpt being from the last paragraph in the left-hand
column on page 10 through to the fifth paragraph inclusive
on page 12.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, this seems
to me to be an unusual request. I have not looked at the
rules covering this, but I would not like to ask for agreement unless Senator Grosart can quote the rule under
which this is permissible.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: I think we are all agreed.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: It could be done, I presume, with
leave, Your Honour. As Your Honour has directed a question to me, might I say that there is nothing in our rules
that permits it, but also there is nothing in our rules that
prohibits it. We do many things here that are not provided
for in the rules.
The Hon. the Speaker: Does the honourable senator
wish this printed as an appendix to today's Hansard, or
included as part of Senator Langlois' speech?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: It will be as if I had read it. It is to
save time.
The Hon. the Speaker: This is what I question.
[Hon. Mr. Langlois.]

Hon. Mr. Grosart: Perhaps I might speak to that, if it is
intended as a point of order. Our rules prohibit taxing
comments or uncharitable references to debates in the
other place. There is nothing in our rules, as we have
discussed before, that prohibits a reference to what goes
on in the other place. However, there is a long tradition
that one house does not criticize the other.

Hon. Mr. Grosart: That is so, but still that is the tradition, and I suggest we are bound by it. Certainly I know of
no rule or tradition that would prohibit us in this house
from referring to what goes on in the other house, because
that would reduce our whole operation to a complete
absurdity. If we were to say, for example, that we could
not refer to the explanation of a bill given by a minister in
the other place, we might just as well go home.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Perhaps I might add one word. I was
in the process of reading part of this record in reply to a
question put to me last night, during the course of which
another part of the same record was read into Hansard. In
order to save time, Senator Grosart suggested that this be
printed without my reading it. It is as simple as that. I do
not see any objection to this being done.
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: For purposes of clarification
may I ask if Senator Langlois is proposing to include the
portion commencing with the first paragraph on page 12,
"Let us do the same exercise for Air Canada .. " and
concluding at the end of the fifth paragraph, "Under this
bill they get it at government rates, and considerably
cheaper"?
Hon. Mr. Grosart: That is it exactly.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: That will be included, yes.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, is it agreed
that Senator Grosart's suggestion be adopted?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Martin: On division.
(The extract follows)
Honourable members will also be interested to see
how the company was able to operate in the absence
of a financing and guarantee act since the 1970 act,
which covered the period up to June 30, 1971. Those
were legitimate questions on second reading; the bill
has not been passed for a couple of years. How has the
CNR and for that matter how has Air Canada been
operating without any authorization or so-called
authorization? For this purpose I have provided a
statement of the CNR's sources and applications of
funds for the years 1971 and 1972 which you will find
in the table at the back. I said I would like to distribute it but there it is.
Let us look at that table, sources and applications of
funds for the calendar years 1971 and 1972 for the
Canadian National Railways. The CNR was able in
1971 to make its $180.6 million capital expendituresyou will find that under the application of funds, the
first item-capital expenditures, $180.6 million, from a

April 9, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

number of sources or you go over to the funds generated by the CNR itself at the top of the table and you
get the total amount of funds generated by the CNR of
$118.2 million. That it gets from its operations, from
the cash flow of depreciation and amortization which
are book figures and, of course, for cash-flow purpose
are brought back into liquidity. You get the net funds
from operations; you add that to the proceeds from
properties that are retired or sold; you have a working
capital situation, and then you get $118.2 million.
You add to that the funds obtained from the government, the Parliamentary vote to cover the deficit,
which in 1971 was $24.2 million. Of course, I am
dealing only with the 1971 figures. The 1972 figures
are parallel and they operate the same way. So we had
a Parliamentary authorization in that year of $24.2
million to cover the deficit, and the greater part of the
proceeds from the government purchase of preferred
stock, which is your $39.1 million. Now with the rest
of the preferred stock, of course, the railway was able
to reduce its debt by about $900,000.
Take a look at 1972. You go through the same exercise. The CN had capital expenditures of $173.1 million, shown in the first item under Application of
Funds. It had generated on its own-see Sources of
Funds-$157.8 million. Add the working capital and
disposition of property, and then the $17.8 million
voted by Parliament to cover the deficit in 1972, and
you have enough left to reduce its debt in the hands of
the public by $2.5 million.
In its 1973 budget, which was tabled in the House by
the Minister of Transport, the CNR was authorized by
the Governor in Council to undertake the $225.5 million of projects referred to in Section 3(1) of your bill,
of which it anticipates some $20 million would not be
completed during the year. The sources of funds projected for these $205.5 million expenditures for 1973
were: generated from operations, working capital and
property disposal-$149.5 million, which would correspond with the figures you find on your table of funds
generated by the CNR; borrowing on account of
branch lines-$13 million-we are talking about 1973
because the $8 million is for the first half of 1974, as
you recall; issues of preferred stock-$43 million; for a
total of $205.5 million.
It is these last two-the branch line borrowings of
$13 million for 1973 and then the $8 million for the
first half of 1974, and the issues of preferred stock for
$43 million-that Bill C-164 would authorize the Minister of Finance to provide. The other funds are provided by the CNR itself from its own operations,
generated in a similar fashion as indicated for 1971
and 1972 in the table.
All right. Now let us do the same exercise for Air
Canada. Bill C-164 provides in Section 7 for loans to
Air Canada in the 18-month period ending June 30,
1974, not to exceed $140 million. It also provides in
Section 12 for advances to pay operating and income
charges as and when due where the available revenues
of Air Canada are insufficient. Section 12 is really a
safety precaution in case Air Canada runs into dif-

ficulties, and the $140 million provided by Section 7 is
the only real cash provision for this company.
The bill also provides for the guarantee of Air Canada's borrowings of up to £13 million from a consortium of British lenders to finance the purchase of Rolls
Royce engines for the Lockheed 1011 aircraft it is in
the process of purchasing.
I have a similar statement for Air Canada. We have
already distributed it. Let us look at how Air Canada
was able to operate without a CN Financing and
Guarantee Act since July 1, 1971.
Let us look at 1971. The statements are drawn in a
similar fashion to those for the CNR. In 1971 the
company generated $60.4 million, and $80.9 million in
1972, just looking over to the 1972 figures. In addition
it was able, under its own act, to borrow moneys from
the consortium of British lenders for Rolls Royce
engine purchases though no government guarantee
could be given at the time. Further, due to the bankruptcy of Rolls Royce and difficulties in the Lockheed
Aircraft Corporation, deliveries of Lockheed 1011 aircraft were delayed considerably, thereby reducing the
amounts Air Canada had to pay for aircraf t during the
period.
Since the end of 1972, both Air Canada and CN have
had to obtain temporary financing from commercial
sources. You might ask since we have been able to
generate funds and get temporary accommodation,
why we need this bill at all. Well the CNR and Air
Canada have to get temporary accommodations and
have to do it at current bank rates. Under this bill
they get it at government rates, and considerably
cheaper.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: This disposes of the reference to my
answer to Senator Grosart's question as to the refund of
CNR debt using the method described in the legislation
passed in 1952.
I now come to Senator Desruisseaux' speech of last
night. I am sorry that he is not in his seat. As what I will
say partly answers Senator Grosart's similar remarks
made earlier, I will use the English language in replying.
Senator Desruisseaux began by indicating that he was
under some pressure to pass this bill in a speedy fashion. I
think I disposed of that last night. I assured him that there
was no pressure on anybody, and that this house was
expected to take all the time it wished to consider the bill.
However, Senator Desruisseaux went much further than
that, and made what I consider to be a violent attack on
the board of directors of the CNR, reproaching them for
not having had their financial statements audited, as
would responsible administrators, not only of public corporations but of private corporations as well. In replying, I
do not want to appear to be coming to the defence of the
board of directors of the CNR. I do not think they need my
help in this respect. They are responsible Canadian citizens; I am sure they are doing their best to administer the
CNR in an orderly fashion, and according to the longestablished practice for such public operations.
* (1540)

Honourable senators, I am informed there is a long
standing practice established, that the Canadian National

SENATE DEBATESApl9,17
Railways have what is called a continuous audit. I arn
informed that in 1972, when the bill was passed appointing
new auditors, the CNR board of directors hired as
independent auditors the same auditors as those now
narned in the bill before us today. Therefore, the auditing
of their books was carried out, and there was flot, as was
suggested hast night, a long period of time during which
there was no audit of the financial statements of the CNR.
The onhy thing this bill does in that respect is enable the
same firm of auditors, who have already audited the books
of the CNR, to make a report to Parliament as auditors of
the company. They cannot report yet as auditors of the
CNR because they were flot appointed by Parliament as
such in 1972.
I mnust add that I arn at a loss to explain why this bill
was delayed in the other place in 1972 up to the trne of
dissolution of Parliament, with the effect that it died on
the Order Paper aI the second reading stage. I cannot
explain why that could flot have beei foreseen, or why
there could flot have been passed a special bilh-as was
done in one instance in the past-appointing auditors. I do
flot recaîl the year in wbicb that procedure was followed,
but it was followed once before when the financing and
guarantee bihh was dehayed in the bouse. A special bill was
passed that appointed the auditors for that year, and that
was done so that the appointed auditors could report 10
Parliament in the following session. 1 do flot know why
ihat was not done in this case.
This afternoon my honourable friend Senator Grosart
cahled that "rnîsmanagemenî by the other place." I do flot
know bow he can attribute this to "mismanagement." 1
tbink it is jusi due to the slow procedure of Parliament.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Parîicularly the rninority government.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Our parliarnentary syslem bas its
fauhts and it is a process wbich is much too slow to cope
wilh modern limes. I think ibat sorne day we will have to
realize this. As my leader wouhd say, the situation is more
acute wben the goverfiment is in the minoriîy in the other
place. But wbo is to blame for ibat? Is it the people of
Canada? If my honourable friend wants to say that, I wani
noîhing to do with it.
Is it due to the elected represeniatives in the other place,
or the electors of Canada wbo elected a bouse composed in
that fashion? I do flot know but I tbink thai is the only
place where the blame can be laid in this respect.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I do not want to interrupt tbe honourable senator's argument, but I would point oui to him,
in regard to what he said about one of the problerns bere,
that the appoinimeni of auditors has nothing to do wiîh
the bilh now before us. If the bill was delayed, auditors
couhd have been appointed under anoiber aci.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Thai is wbat I said. I do flot knovw
why it was flot done by a special act. It was done only once
during the 43 years of the Canadian National Railways'
existence. There mnust be a reason why there was no
recourse to thai unusual way of doing tbings, but it could
have been done.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: There are many explanations, but
only one right one.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Thai is the one we have not got.
[Mon. Mr. Langlois.]

April 9, 1974

Hon. Mr. Langlois: That could be righî.
In this respect, I should add that the Air Canada Act
stipulates that its auditors are the auditors to be appoinied
by the Canadian National Railways. I understand the iwo
companies have retained the firms named in Bilh C-5 as
accounting consultants or independeni auditors, whaiever
you like to caîl them, and that these firms have performed
the work for both Air Canada and the CNR in the way it
was normally done in the past. One of the purposes of the
bill is to appoint these auditors as officiaI auditors of both
corporations.
Honourable senators, I corne back to Senator Grosari's
remark ibis afternoon. He called this bihl "a farce." I
cannot accept that qualification of the bihh, because it is
far from being a farce. I grant you thai il is laie in coming
before us, and that it seeks authority 10 finance pasi
deficits of the CNR and Air Canada and to guaranteeing
obligations entered into quite sorne months ago, but ibis
bill is not a farce. It is extremehy irnportant ihal ibis bill
receive due consideration, and tbat il pass tbe three readings in tbis place and becorne law, in order 10 enable our
transport corporations, the CNR and Air Canada, to proceed in a normal fashion in discharging their obligations
10 the Canadian people.
Senator Grosart ibis afternoon apparenîly was critîcal
of tbe faci ibai ibis bihh runs for six montbs int the new
fiscal year, to July 1974.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I was nol critical of thal. I was
merely explaining wby il was done.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: This is a necessary thing, as I arn
sure tbe honourable senator understands, in order 10
enable tbese companies to engage in some advanced
negotiations in the discharge of their functions.
Senator Grosari also briefly toucbed on the speech made
in the other place by the present Minisier of Transport,
dealing with Canadian transportation policy. I have read
boîh of Mr. Marchand's speeches, the one he made in the
debate on the motion for an Address in reply 10 the
Speech from the Tbrone and the sbort remark he made a
few days thereafier wben replying 10 a statement made by
the Leader of the New Democratic Party.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: That was on March 21.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I do flot recaîl the date, but il must
bave been approxirnaîely that. 1 agree wilb wbat Mr.
Marchand said, and again I think that Mr. Marchand was
quite frank in bis rernarks. It is a good thing ai urnes-it
sbould bappen more often-ibat minisiers of the Crown
sbould openly criticize, if need be, tbe policy under which
tbey are requested to operate, in order 10 bring before
Parhiarneni some aspects of our hegishation which are not
quite to the advanîage of tbe nation.
There is one tbing 10 be borne in mind in relation to
those remarks made by Mr. Marchand, and ihai is thal be
had no easy solution 10 offer. He underlined the difficulty
of drafiing for Canada a unîform national polîcy, because
one bas 10 take mbt accouni the fact thai thîs is a very
large country, wiib dîsparities whicb cannot fil a unîform
model of legisiation. It is almosi impossible 10 satisfy
equalhy ahh paris of the country. Any Mînister of Transport-and Parliament for that malter-for a long lime whll
bave 10 lîve wilh such a situation.

April 9, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

Canada is a difficult country to serve. One only has to
watch on television every Sunday evening "The National
Dream," that has been interesting so many people for the
last six or seven weeks, to understand that when we built
our first railroad we discovered then and there that it was
not an easy task to try to serve Canada from one coast to
the other by such a system of transportation.
The same situation obtains today, and we have to live
with it. This does not mean that we shall not be able to
find a way out, or a solution, but we cannot entertain the
hope now that we shall find a solution which will be
acceptable to everyone, and to each and every region of
Canada.
* (1550)

When I sat in the other place for some four years I was
parliamentary secretary to two Ministers of Transport,
during which time there were four Deputy Ministers of
Transport. Having worked with four deputy ministers and
two ministers it is only natural that I have a certain
amount of inside information on the operations of the
Department of Transport. Let me tell you it is not an easy
department to run. You could almost consider the Department of Transport a catchall. We apparently put in there
everything that would not fit in any other place. It all
went into the one room and it was left there for the
minister to try to live with.
The Department of Transport is quite varied in its
operations; in fact, the main complaint made by Mr. Marchand was that the Minister of Transport is responsible
for a host of things with respect to which he has insufficient authority or none at all. But where is the blame to be
laid for this? It should be placed on the parliamentarians.
Mr. Marchand, like all of his predecessors, has had to
live with the legislation passed by Parliament. Naturally,
we could simply place the blame on the governments
which brought the legislation forward, but it would be
pretty hard to find anyone on either side of this bouse who
would be willing to throw the first stone in that respect.
Whatever party we belong to, I believe we all share in the
responsibility for the mess we are in today so far as
national transportation policy is concerned. I need hardly
expand any further on that.
Honourable senators, Senator Grosart, if I understood
him correctly, suggested that there should be a consolidation of all acts dealing with the CNR. If anyone wants to
delay the passage of future bills of this kind, I can think of
no better way than to put it with all the other legislation
pertaining to that railroad system, because there would be
absolutely no end to the debate in either this place or the
other. I am afraid that we would merely extend the situation we are in today; in other words, we would continue to
go without a financing and guarantee act, we would still
not have auditors appointed, and we would still not give to
the Minister of Finance the authority to guarantee
advances and loans for securities given by the CNR.
Senator Grosart also added that the bill before us provides for $21 million as loans and advances for financing
the building or construction of branch lines, and an additional $40 million as representing securities on debentures. But according to my information the amount is
roughly $100 million all told, including the branch lines.

Hon. Mr. Grosart: I believe that is what I said.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I am sorry if I misunderstood you,
senator. I thought you left it at $21 million plus $40
million, which is $61 million. Do I understand you to agree
with me that the amount is roughly $100 million?
Hon. Mr. Grosart: What I intended to say, and I believe
I said it, was that there were three figures: one of $21
million and two of $40 million, the first $40 million applying to 1973 and the second $40 million applying to 1974.
That was my understanding.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Quite right.
I should like to make one last observation about Senator
Grosart's remarks touching on the budgets of the CNR and
Air Canada. I do not believe anyone touched this point
either yesterday or today, but we should not forget that
these budgets were laid before Parliament in the other
place. After they had received the approval of the Governor in Council they were tabled in Parliament. That is a
fact worth mentioning. After all, we are not asked, as was
suggested today, to approve blindly expenditures of which
we know nothing. These budgets were tabled before Parliament in due course for the years in question covered by
this bill.
I should like now to pass on to the remarks made by
Senator Benidickson today. With most of what he said this
afternoon I am in agreement, but I am not at all in accord
with him on the question of how urgent it is to pass this
legislation. I believe I covered this point a while ago when
I said that to my mind it was urgent to give to Air Canada
the ability to guarantee the undertakings it had given to
British financiers in connection with the purchase of Rolls
Royce engines and certain components. The obligations
were assumed a long time ago, but no guarantee was
extended by the Government of Canada, and to my mind
it is urgent that that guarantee now be given-as it will as
soon as this bill is passed.
Now I come to the remarks made by my honourable
friend, Senator Asselin.

[Translation]
I can understand Senator Asselin being particularly
interested, and rightly so, in the CNR's operations in the
area of the province he represents.
I am aware of the situation he pointed out, although he
did not indicate the place; I think he was referring to
Pointe-au-Pic where there is a rather important transshipment port from land to ocean liners. I think Senator
Asselin is justified in complaining about the service provided in that part of the constituency he used to represent
in the other place. I support those claims and I hope he
will succeed in obtaining what he is asking for his former
constituents.
With that I shall conclude my remarks. I thank honourable senators for the attention they have given me during
this debate.

[English]
Honourable senators, I move thatHon. Mr. Benidickson: Honourable senators, is Senator
Langlois going to move that the bill be referred to the
Standing Senate Committee on Transport and Communications? If so, in view of what he said a moment or two

SENATE DEBATES

ago, would he propose as well to move, notwithstanding
rule 45(1)(h), that the committee be empowered to sit
during the recess of the Senate?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I had not thought of that. I will give
it some consideration and perhaps make a motion to that
effect tomorrow. However, in view of the number of committees which it is proposed will sit during the recess, if
we were to add another committee we might as well follow
Senator Flynn's suggestion and call back the Senate as a
whole. We may have to come to that yet. In any event, I
will let you know tomorrow what I propose.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

THE SENATE
PRECINCTS AND CLERESTORY OF CHAMBER-DEBATE
CONCLUDED

The
debate
calling
within
ticular

Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned
on the inquiry of Senator Connolly (Ottawa West),
the attention of the Senate to certain elements
the precincts of the Senate Chamber and in parto its clerestory.

Hon. M. Grattan O'Leary: Honourable senators, I rise
mainly to say that I think the whole bouse is indebted to
Senator Connolly who, with his sense of history, bas
brought our attention to the matters dealt with in his
inquiry. I had intended to say perhaps too much about this
matter, but remembering the state of the session and the
fact that I have to attend another meeting at 5 o'clockHon. Mr. Martin: Well, then, speak until 5 o'clock.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: -I shall content myself with saying
amen to everything that bas been said on this matter by
Senator Connolly, Senator Martin and Senator Forsey.
I am always a bit disturbed by proposals that come
before us, or rumours that reach us, concerning changes to
be made in this chamber or to Parliament Hill. Senator
Martin said yesterday that he had been connected with
these buildings for 35 years or more. Well, honourable
senators, I have been connected with them for a long time
too. Although I have not played as important a role as that
of Senator Martin, these buildings have been part of my
life for 63 years. I was a member of the parliamentary
press gallery for seven years in the old buildings-the
buildings that were destroyed by fire. So, I always feel
something of regret at proposals or propositions that we
should move more of Parliament, or things concerned with
Parliament, from Parliament Hill. I would like to see
Parliament stay on this hill, and I do not like the idea of
members of the House of Commons or the Senate being
moved to some other building, simply because the Department of Public Works tells us that they have a room for us
in the Victoria Building on Wellington Street, or elsewhere. That, for me-having regard to what Parliament
[Hon. Mr. Benidickson.

April 9, 1974

has been to me all my life-is not Parliament as I understand it.
I remember, as I am sure all senators will remember,
when after World War II certain proposals were made to
alter the character of the British House of Commons,
which the great Churchill opposed immediately. He said:
"We must be careful to remember the history of this place
and to remember the urgency of this place. We must not
make it bigger. We must restore it as much as possible to
what it was before it was destroyed."
I heard some talk yesterday, and Senator Connolly
referred to it, about changing the pictures on these walls
or removing them, and I would be sorry to have that
happen. Where would we put the pictures? Not in the
National Gallery, because there is no place for them there,
and if we were to put them in the new National Defence
building, how many people would see them? Every year
tens of thousands of Canadians and Americans come here,
enter this chamber and ask about the significance of these
pictures. They are part of the history of Canada.
I remember the Honourable George White speaking in
this chamber a few years ago on the meaning and significance of those pictures, because he had personal knowledge of them, and I remember the very moving speech he
made about them. He gave many reasons why we as
senators should not want them removed from this chamber. They are part of history. Actually they are part of the
story of our development from colony to nation. They
represent the deeds of Canadians who made it possible for
this country to emerge from colonialism into full nationhood. If anybody denies that, let him read the history of
Sir Robert Borden's fight at Versailles, and how he was
enabled to win recognition for Canada at Versailles
because of what those pictures show of the participation of
Canadians in World War I.
There are people who always want to change things,
who think that if a thing is new then it must be better
than something old. Honourable senators, as I grow older,
and as I near Jordan, I reflect more and more upon the
past. I think I mentioned this particular instance to Senator Connolly before. I sometimes now think of the great
Renan. He had quarrelled with his Church, and she had
appealed to history against him. He became one of her
most formidable antagonists. Yet, as an old man, when he
was writing his book Souvenirs of My Youth, he described
how in the eventide he could still hear the church bells of
Brittany summoning him to his prayers. "I could not help
but hear," he wrote, and in a passage of haunting and
mournful beauty he appealed to men not to forget the past,
to respect even if they could not agree, and to bow where
they could not pray.
I would like to think that more of our young people in
Canada, and more of our older people and perhaps more
people in this bouse, would try to remember the past.
There were things in it, perhaps, which we would wish to
deny or to forget, but what we see in this chamber is as
much part of our history as are the men who years and
centuries ago went into the wilderness with sword and
crucifix in hand, and sometimes left their names and
bones in a land of savage wilderness.
Yes, honourable senators, I am a Conservative mainly
because I remember the past. Reverence for the past and

April 9, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

high hopes for the future-that is the true creed of a
Conservative. And now I want merely to say that I subscribe to everything said by Senator Connolly, to everything said by Senator Forsey and everything said by
Senator Martin, and to wish you all a Happy Easter.
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, if this
debate is not to be adjourned, perhaps I could be permitted
a word or two to conclude it. Let me say at the outset that
if there is any merit in my having put this inquiry on the
Order Paper, I think I have been amply justified in the
fact that Senator O'Leary has spoken in such a moving
way this afternoon. As a rule, the topic of windows normally does not suggest the idea of great, moving oratory,
but we have had it in this instance, not so much because of
the windows as because of the themes that have been
introduced into the decor of this chamber. I am grateful
not only to Senator O'Leary, but to Senator Martin, Senator Cameron, Senator Choquette and Senator Forsey for
taking part in this debate.
Frankly, honourable senators, I want to say that I
brought this matter to the attention of the Senate primarily because I think all of us would be very much upset if
major structural or other changes were to be made in this
chamber without our knowledge. We should continue to
have the control over this chamber as, in law, we are
supposed to have. I remember when these windows which
we now see were installed. I was government leader at the
time, and I can say-and here I do not think my memory is
at fault-that I did not know that they were going to be
put there until I saw them in place. If there is to be stained
glass, then it behooves honourable senators to ensure that
something is placed in those windows which will last as
long as the Senate and Parliament-and I hope that the
periods of their existence are co-terminate.

e

yesterday that he had been elevated to a high position of

responsibility. If I had been aware I would have risen
yesterday.
I well remember, when Senator Molgat was selected
from the multitude to occupy an ordained post, the Leader
of the Opposition rose and made some appropriate and
facetious remarks to an adversary from the goodness of
his heart.
No one has had a more pleasant adversary than I during
the past six years, and I am happy to be able to rise today,
look directly at the Leader of the Opposition, and compliment him on the high designation that has come his way.
I know he will not misunderstand me when I say that I
hope that his obligations, even though they are, in a
vicarious way, in the interest of the state, will not prevent
the Leader of the Opposition from calling in to see us from
time to time.
Hon. Mr. Deschatelets: For the benefit of honourable
senators, may I ask the Leader of the Government to tell
us the nature of the appointment to which he has referred?
I make that request in order to put the record straight.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I would prefer to let my remarks
stand. I have expressed good will towards the Leader of
the Opposition. There may be an occasion between 6 p.m.
and 8 p.m. when the Leader of the Opposition and the
former Speaker-and perhaps our present Speaker-can
get together, and we can offer in a more intimate way our
sincere congratulations, if not our best wishes, to the
Leader of the Opposition.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I think I deserve more good wishes
than congratulations.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: You mean you need more.

(1610)

Three projects were referred to in the course of the
debate. Very little was said about the windows, a little
more was said about the Throne area, and a good deal was
said about the paintings. Those areas of interest could be
examined and placed in perspective if a committee were
appointed. It seems to be the consensus of those in the
chamber, and of those with whom I have spoken, that
there should be such a committee.
Some time after the Easter recess I propose to move that
such a committee be established. In that connection I
would consult with the Leader of the Government and the
Leader of the Opposition. The committee should be small,
but I would appreciate it if honourable senators who have
a particular interest in the project would contact me in
writing in order that I might know the names of volunteers for this work.
The Hon. the Speaker: As no other honourable senator
wishes to participate in the debate, this inquiry is considered debated.

THE HONOURABLE JACQUES FLYNN, P. C.
FELICITATIONS
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, before I speak
to the matter which brings me to my feet, I should like to
say to the Leader of the Opposition that I was not aware

NATIONAL PARKS ACT
BILL TO AMEND-REQUEST TO BRING ORDER FORWARD
DENIED
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, having established a good basis of friendship with the Leader of the
Opposition, and bearing in mind our discussion yesterday,
I ask that the Order for the second reading of Bill C-6, to
amend the National Parks Act, set down on the Orders of
the Day for tomorrow, Wednesday, April 10, 1974, be
brought forward and placed on the Orders of the Day of
this date.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, I discussed the
situation yesterday with some of my colleagues. I am not
prepared at this time to proceed with Bill C-6. If it is the
desire of the Leader of the Government to proceed with
Bills C-2 and C-9, there is no objection.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I certainly cannot be thrown out for
trying.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It would not be like you not to try.
Hon. Mr. Martin: My colleague, Senator Laing, who
knows more about national parks than I do, bas pointed
out that the amendments made in the other place, to which
the Leader of the Opposition directed our attention yesterday, are amendments made in the House of Commons to
take account of amendments proposed by the Senate.

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I know.
Hon. Mr. Martin: That being the case, does not the
goodness in the heart of the Leader of the Opposition
suggest that he might accede to my request? If he says no,
I hope he will do so in a kindly way.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: You know that I always say no in a
kindly way. Senator Laing, who is sponsoring the bill,
may proceed with his speech tomorrow. It is my intention
to see to it that the debate is adjourned until we return
from the Easter recess.
I am of the opinion that there is no urgency about this
bill. I would like more time to look into the amendments
which have been made in order to understand them fully.
We have two other bills that we can deal with today.
Hon. Mr. Laing: Honourable senators, if I might add an
additional plea to that made by the Leader of the Government, I would suggest that the National Parks bill is of
great importance to the government. We have been discussing this for three years.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: That is why.
Hon. Mr. Laing: I want to emphasize the point made by
Senator Martin that the amendments made yesterday
were largely to take care of concerns which honourable
senators, such as Senator Norrie, have with respect to the
rights of people whose properties are expropriated or purchased for the purpose of establishing a national park.
I agree with Senator Norrie and other honourable senators who raised that point, because we should always pay
attention to minority opinion, even if it is a minority of
only one. That has now been taken care of by the suggestion that there will be no promulgation of any new national parks without the approval of the House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: That is the point that I wish to look
into.
Hon. Mr. Laing: In respect of the new parks set out in
the schedule, some agreement has already been reached to
undertake surveys. Last year there were 12 million visitors to established national parks in Canada. Our national
parks represent the number one attraction for tourists.
* (1620)

Hon. Mr. Grosart: Honourable senators, on a point of
order, surely the honourable senator is making a speech to
the bill and all that is before us is merely a request.
Hon. Mr. Laing: Probably I have made my plea too long.
This is a bill of considerable importance to the Canadian
economy and, particularly, to the government at this time,
which has to make expenditures forthwith.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: We can deal with it when we return.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Both Senator Laing and I have fought
valiantly for reforestation and good parks. We can do no
more than that.
FISHERIES DEVELOPMENT ACT
BILL TO AMEND-ORDER BROUGHT FORWARD

Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, I make a second
endeavour, in another field. I ask that the Order for the
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

April 9, 1974

second reading of Bill C-2, to amend the Fisheries Development Act, which is now set down on the Order Paper
for tomorrow, Wednesday, April 10, 1974, be brought forward and placed on the Orders of the Day of this date.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, is it
agreed?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Chesley W. Carter moved the second reading of
Bill C-2, to amend the Fisheries Development Act.
He said: I should like to thank honourable senators and
particularly the Leader of the Opposition for their indulgence in permitting the explanation of this bill this afternoon, rather than tomorrow as the Orders of the Day
would require.
Bill C-2 is relatively simple. It contains a very simple
amendment. It merely adds two words to section 5(c) of
the Fisheries Development Act. Nevertheless, these two
words have, perhaps, fairly wide implications. To assist
honourable senators in assessing those implications, I
should begin by giving a brief summary of the history of
fisheries development.
Prior to 1964 there was no co-ordinated program of
fishery development. The expenditures allocated for fishery development prior to 1964 were included as separate
items in the estimates. Then, honourable senators will
recall, in 1964 a federal-provincial conference on fisheries
was held, as a result of which in 1966 the Fisheries Development Act was passed to initiate a co-ordinated program of fisheries development in Canada which would
include, among other provisions, four principal programs:
(1) A program of exploration and development of known
fisheries resources and the seeking of new resources; (2)
the introduction and administration of new and improved
fishing vessels, new equipment, new methods and new
fishing techniques; (3) the development of new technology, new equipment and new fisheries products; and (4) a
program of improvement in fish-handling methods,
including fish processing and marketing of fish products.
Honourable senators will also recall that last July the
Senate passed Bill C-4, which was a short amendment to
the Fisheries Development Act and to the same section
which is now to be amended by Bill C-2. Last year we
added an extra paragraph to section 5, which authorized
the minister to provide expenditures for the construction
and equipment of commercial ice-making machines, icestorage facilities and fish-chilling units.
The present bill is a simple amendment to section 5(c),
which at present reads as follows:
(c) for the construction and equipment of fishing
vessels;
Bill C-2 amends that by adding the words "modification,
conversion" after "construction,". If this bill becomes law
the paragraph (c) of section 5 will read:
(c) for the construction, modification, conversion and
equipment of fishing vessels; and
Before I go further I should point out that the word
"equipment" does not mean fishing gear, but equipment
on the ship itself, such as radar equipment, fish-finding

April 9,1974

equipment, and haul-ups and winches for hauling in gear
and devices generally required for mechanizing the fishery. Section 5(c) applies to small boats of between 35 feet
and 75 feet in length. Subsidies for vessels of over 75 feet
in length are provided, not by the Fisheries Development
Act, but by the act administered by the Department of
Industry, Trade and Commerce.
I endeavoured to obtain figures to indicate the nature of
the expenditures being made under the Fisheries Development Act, and I was informed that in the fiscal year
1972-73 expenditures were as follows: Newfoundland,
$659,486; Nova Scotia, $225,751; Prince Edward Island,
$85,599; and New Brunswick, $134,891. The total expenditures for the Atlantic provinces therefore amount to
$1,105,727. To that figure must be added $446,500, which is
the share spent in the Maritimes in respect of programs
which are national in scope. The actual total expenditures
in the fiscal year 1972-73 in the Atlantic provinces amount
to $1,552,227.
Expenditures in other provinces for the same period
were as follows: Quebec, $52,270; Ontario, $18,399; British
Columbia, $142,500; Manitoba, $75,000; and the Northwest
Territories, $40,000. These total $328,169, to which must be
added $105,000 for national programs, bringing the grand
total to $433,169.
Therefore, during the fiscal year 1972-73 the total of
expenditures for fisheries development under the Fisheries Development Act was of the order of $1,985,396. It will
be noted that the subsidies payable under section 5(c) are
determined by terms and conditions prescribed by the
Governor in Council.

SENATE DEBATES

(1630)

I endeavoured to get some information as to what the
rate of assistance would be under this clause. The explanatory note in the first printing of Bill C-2 when it was
introduced in the other place read as follows:
This amendment, which adds the underlined words,
would extend the authority of the Minister to make
paymentsAnd I want to draw the attention of honourable senators
to that.
accordance with regulations prescribed by the
-in
Governor in Council to include payments for the
modification and conversion of fishing vessels.
I enquired as to what the payments were under the
present regulations, and I was told that the present regulations apply only to new construction and new equipment,
with the rate of subsidy being 35 per cent. I understand
that rate is now in the process of being reviewed. It is
open-ended assistance, but the rate itself is being
reviewed and could be changed in the future. A ceiling for
assistance could also be established, whereas no ceiling
exists at this time.
Of course, 35 per cent is not a great deal of assistance in
view of the kind of costs that the fishing industry is f aced
with at the present time. But, as I pointed out earlier, it
applies only to very small boats, 35 to 75 feet in length.
In addition to assistance under the Fisheries Development Act, further assistance can be obtained under the
Fisheries Improvement Loans Act. Since both acts provide
financial assistance, it is very easy to get them confused.

We should keep them separate in our minds. They both
provide assistance to fisheries, but the Fisheries Improvement Loans Act is administered by the Department of
Finance, whereas the Fisheries Development Act is administered by the Department of the Environment.
I made some enquiries as to the kind of expenditures
being made under the Fisheries Improvement Loans Act.
Although I could not get the figures for the whole of the
calendar year 1973, I did get the figures from April 1973 to
December 1973, and they are as follows: British Columbia,
338 loans for a total of $4,713,506; Manitoba, one loan for a
total of $4,000; Ontario, nine loans for a total of $69,000;
New Brunswick, three loans for a total of $30,000; Nova
Scotia, 220 loans for a total of $1,333,420; Prince Edward
Island, 187 loans for a total of $405,207; and Newfoundland,
71 loans for $178,287. So the loans for the period from April
1973 to December 1973 amounted to $6,733,420. Incidentally, no loans were made in Quebec or Alberta during the
period quoted.
If you look at these figures you will see that of
approximately $6.7 million in loans, $4.7 million went to
British Columbia, which accounts for 70 per cent. The next
largest beneficiary was Nova Scotia with $1.3 million,
which accounts for 20 per cent of the total. So British
Columbia and Nova Scotia accounted for 90 per cent of the
total loans made under the Fisheries Improvement Loans
Act for the period under review, which is April to December 1973.
Honourable senators, I am very pleased to have had the
opportunity of sponsoring this bill in the Senate. The
fishing industry is very important to Canada, and particularly to the Maritime provinces. It has always been an
extremely important industry in my province, Newfoundland, where 14,000 people still depend upon it for their
livelihoods.
What pleases me most about Bill C-2 is that it is
designed to assist the small boat owners who engage
mainly in what we call inshore fisheries or near-shore
fisheries, which can extend 50 or 60 miles out to sea. There
has been some concern in my own province in recent
months on the fate of the inshore fisheries. The freeze on
shipbuilding, and certain other announcements, caused
quite a lot of concern. It was felt that the importance of
inshore fisheries might not be fully appreciated, and that
such announcements augured the beginning of the end of
inshore fisheries. However, the fact that this additional
assistance is now being proposed for inshore fisheries will,
I am sure, give those people new heart. It will be greatly
appreciated by them.
As I said earlier, this amendment concerns only two
words, those being "modification, conversion", to be added
to paragraph 5(c). For that reason, honourable senators, I
see no real reason why this bill should go to committee.
On motion of Senator Blois, debate adjourned.

YUKON ACT, NORTHWEST TERRITORIES ACT AND
CANADA ELECTIONS ACT
BILL TO AMEND-ORDER BROUGHT FORWARD

Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, I ask that the
Order for the second reading of Bill C-9, to amend the

SENATE DEBATES
Yukon Act, the Northwest Territories Act and the Canada
Elections Act, which is now set down on the Order Paper
for tomorrow, Wednesday, April 10, 1974, be brought forward and placed on the Orders of the Day of this date.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, is it
agreed?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
SECOND READING

Hon. Arthur Laing moved the second reading of Bill
C-9, to amend the Yukon Act, the Northwest Territories
Act and the Canada Elections Act.
He said: Honourable senators, in moving the second
reading of this bill, I should like to deal for a few moments
with the aspirations of the people in the northern regions
of our nation. I believe that north of 60° in the two
territories we are going to find, in our lifetime, probably
50 per cent of all the resources in Canada in money value.
It has been a habit of people living in the northern territo~
ries not to have a very fond regard for, or a very high
appreciation of, their governments which reside in the
south. In 1965 I found this feeling in the Soviet Union of
Khandyga, 3,700 miles east of Moscow and about 2,200
miles from the Pacifie Ocean. I was told by people there,
"Unless those people in Moscow wake up we won't ship
them anything at all."
There is a similar attitude in Canada, I guess because of
the remoteness of the people from the centre of administration. They have the impression that the central government does not care enough for them. There has long been a
feeling in the north that a greater degree of self-government should be given to those who reside there.

e

(1640)

This makes the task of the commissioners of these territories very difficult, because in the Northwest Territories
to the present date they have a partly elected and partly
appointed council, and in the Yukon there is a fully
appointed council, to which they have to give attention. At
the same time, the commissioners are directly responsible
to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development here in Ottawa. When I had the department I
experienced this difficulty, and I am quite sure that the
minister today is in the same situation.
Enormous things are going on in the Canadian North. In
the exploration for oil and gas alone last year, $250 million
was expended in the mainland of the territories and in the
Arctic, and a greater sum is expected to be expended this
year, because there have been major finds of late that have
given new heart to the explorers-one in oil and a number
in gas.
Hon. Mr. Deschatelets: Has most of this research been
done by foreign interests?
Hon. Mr. Laing: The majority of the work in exploration and drilling on the Arctic islands and the mainland at
the present time is done by Panarctic Oil, which is a
Canadian corporation in which, as Senator Deschatelets
knows, the Canadian public has a 45 per cent interest.
They started off with a participation by the Canadian
government of $9 million, and got $11 million from some
18 small Canadian companies. At that time it was thought
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

April 9, 1974

they could drill about 16 wells. Now, because we have
determined not to dilute our participation in Panarctie Oil
on behalf of the Canadian public, I think there is some $36
million of government money invested. The results are
very interesting.
Almost 50 per cent of the population of the Yukon
Territory live in Whitehorse, which is the terminal of the
railway from Skagway, and has a very good airport. There
are several other points in the Yukon where activity is
taking place. The largest single silver mine in Canada is at
Elsa. There is the Anvil Mine, about 180 miles as the crow
flies from Whitehorse. At Cantung, on the border of the
Yukon Territory and the Northwest Territories, a mine is
producing no less than 17 per cent of the tungsten requirements of the entire Western World. These are notable
facts. So much so, that last year the Yukon, with a population of only 19,000 people, had a production from mining
alone exceeding $6,000 per man, woman and child. These
are important figures.
A great change is taking place in the population. Whereas formerly a man would go in for a few months to make a
stake and come out, today families are being raised there.
The school system is excellent, the hospitals are good.
These people intend to make a permanent residence there.
That inevitably leads to demands that they have more
government at site.
It was only in 1967 that we moved the capital of the
Northwest Territories from Ottawa, where it had been for
so many years, to Yellowknife. It was only in recent years
that we were able to appoint residents of the territories as
commissioners. Formerly they came from other parts of
Canada.
I can understand the reaction of the people. If any of us
were living in either of these territories we would have
the same reaction. They do not want to be governed by
somebody who drops in by airplane three times a year and
lays down the law when he gets there. There is still some
of that, and I am quite certain that this bill, although
improving the degree to which they have self-government,
will still not satisfy those people. I agree with the minister
that it is a move in the right direction, and is as far as he
can go at present.
The great reservation made in Ottawa, with which I
totally agree, and which I have espoused all through the
years, is that at the present time we must retain control of
the resources in those two territories. We cannot develop
those resources, we cannot entice capital there, if their
control is in the hands of somebody who has not got an
adequate amount of money to finance their development.
For example, there must be improvements made to roads,
airstrips to be built, and accommodation of every kind will
be needed. When great things like this are going on the
central government has to be in charge. I agree with this
entirely at the present time.
Up there they are hopeful of becoming a new province
some day. About five years ago I was brash enough to say
I thought they would have provincial status in 15 years,
and this included the Yukon and the Mackenzie Valley.
Hon. Mr. Martin: In how many years?
Hon. Mr. Laing: I said in 15 years, five years ago. That
leaves 10 years. Up there they are more ambitious than

April 9,1974

SENATE DEBATES

that; they want to drive ahead and become a province
earlier than that. I do not know whether that will be
possible. I dislike the idea of cutting them off, as it were,
and leaving the rest of the Eastern Arctic totally dependent upon Ottawa. There are oil finds on the eastern side.
There is a major development on Little Cornwallis Island,
where there is lead, zinc and some silver.
Hon. Mr. Asselin: What is the population of the Yukon?
Hon. Mr. Laing: At present the population of the Yukon
is 19,000 and the population of the Northwest Territories is
39,000. I think the populations are increasing at the rate of
three or four per cent per year. There are a great many
people going back and f orth, and there are a great number
of interests there. One firm in the air transport business
has five Hercules planes operating there at the present
time. These are men from southern Canada who go back
and forth. In my view, the opportunity there is enormous,
and an increasing number of people experienced in business and otherwise are showing up. This is all to the good.
In the case of the Yukon, the amendment provides for
an increase in the size of the wholly elective council from
seven to twelve members. This takes care of the additional
areas of development in the Yukon. There will be a great
deal of development there when we start drilling in the
Beaufort Sea. Already contracts have been let in respect of
five islands. The Beaufort Sea is shallow, and they drill
through the islands.
I remember talking to the geologist of Richfield Oil
immediately after the Prudhoe Bay discovery, and he said
that was only one field in that general area. "There will be
six or seven oilfields found," he said, "and they will be
found on both sides of the border. If this is so, it will
provide an enormous development for the northern part of
the Yukon. This is the kind of thing that is going on there.
I was saying that the number of council members has
been increased from seven to twelve in the Yukon, to give
representation to these newly developing areas. Secondly,
there is power, as the population increases, to increase or
decrease the number of council members to be not fewer
than twelve and not more than twenty. This is a gradual
development toward the kind of self-government that
these people envisage for the future.
*

(1650)

Secondly, the bill clarifies the authority of the Commissioner in Council so that he can legislate for the operation
and management of prisons. They have a prison system up
there that I think might be copied in other parts of
Canada. They have mobile camps where the prisoners
work, and they have built roads, bridgesHon. Mr. Asselin: There is no danger of escape?
Hon. Mr. Laing: There are not too many places to go up
there.
Hon. Mr. Martin: That is the point of Senator Asselin's
observation.
Hon. Mr. Laing: They always come back to the camp at
night, anyway.
This bill will bring the wording of section 44 of the
French version of the Yukon Act into line with the wording of section 44 of the French version of the Northwest
Territories Act. This has to do with using the words

"police stations" instead of "lock-ups". They used to have
a term "lock-up". This has been abandoned, and now it is a
"police station". I do not know that the accommodation is
any different because of the difference in name.
Next, this bill will identify the commissioner as the
authority responsible for the administration of crown
lands under section 46. This is very important to them.
This concerns the development of townsites. They want
that authority there, and I think they should have it on
the spot rather than have to come down here for disposition of any lands. It must be administered up there.
In the case of the amendments to the Northwest Territories Act, the proposal is to establish a fully elected
council of 15. At present, we have a council of ten or so
elected members and Ottawa appoints five, four of those
being from southern Canada, and one is the deputy commissioner. But they are appointed from Ottawa, and the
people do not care for that.
I think this change is necessary, but I regret its happening, and I will tell you why. It is extremely important to
the northern territories that they have advocates living in
southern Canada to tell the people of Canada what is
going on up there. Some appointed members of that council have done a great deal for the North. Nevertheless, we
are under pressure at the present time, and I suppose the
Council has to be fully elected. This bill also provides for a
Council Speaker selected from among its members, to
preside over council proceedings.
Under the general housekeeping provisions, the bill
clarifies the authority of the deputy commissioner to act
for the commissioner during the latter's inability to act,
and deletes the requirement that he must be a councillor.
In other words, he is going off the council, which seems
preferable.
The bill also will increase the council quorum to a
majority of members including the Speaker. It clarifies
the authority of the Commissioner in Council to legislate
for the management and operation of prisons, as in the
case of the Yukon Territory, and to identify the commissioner as the authority responsible for the administration
of crown lands under section 46.
The amendments to the Canada Elections Act provide
that newly established electoral districts for the two territories are not applicable to a general election of the two
councils unless the new electoral districts have been in
force for six months before an election is called, or unless
the Chief Electoral Officer has been able to make the
necessary preparations for the election on the basis of the
new electoral districts in a shorter period of time. That is
pretty fuzzy, but they are looking toward elections in both
of the territories this fall, and that proviso is there so that
if the Commissioner can get busy and map out these new
areas, it will apply; otherwise, this will not apply.
Honourable senators, I have covered the matter as fully
as I can. There is a general wish among all the residents
up there to have the conduct of their affairs in their own
hands. I agree that these amendments have not gone far
enough to make them happy, but I do agree that at this
time, with the development of the territories and the
enormous things that are going on there, this is as far as
the government can go.

SENATE DEBATESApl9,17
Hon. Lionel Choquette: Honourable senators, I know
that this is an urgent matter, and this bill should be given
third reading and passed tomorrow. Because my good
friend, Senator Laing, was brief in his remarks I think I
have time to deal with this bill briefly as well, sa that it
may be read the third time tamorraw. As usual, Senator
Laing made an interesting and able presentation, for
which we are ail grateful.
This bill does flot speli the end of colonialism in the
Yukon and Northwest Territories. It should, but it does
not. It is a small, unimaginative step toward granting
greater control over their governments ta the people of the
territories. That is ail it is-a small, reluctant step, by a
federal gaverfiment totally out of touch with the temper of
the times.
This gavernment congratulates the people of the territories on their outstanding achievements, on their remarkable social and economic develapment. Yet, it is reluctant
ta grant these same outstanding achievers any significant
political and economie autonomy.
They are still ta be treated as colanials second class
citizens ta be protected fram themselves by an omniscient
central gavernment represented in the territories by the
commissioner. That cammissioner, honourable senatars,
is a symbol of an autharitarian paternalism characteristic
of other continents and centuries past. Such paternalism,
such manifest calanialism, should neyer have been permitted ta exist in this country and should certainly have been
laid ta rest once and for ahl in this piece of legislation.
Great things had been promised; littie was delivered.
The stigma of colonialism will stili be there even after we
have passed this bill. And pass it we will, because pass it
we must, and quickly. The gavernment has given us fia
choice.
In order, once again, ta impose its will an Parliament,
the goverfiment has used a subtie farm of blackmail. They
have waited so long ta introduce this bill that we have no
choice but ta praceed in haste. We have no chaice but ta
accept the puny haîf measures provided here, for, if we do
not, we risk lasing everything.
If the changes envisaged are ta be in effect for the
territorial caunicil elections scheduled for 1974-and I
think I can be borne out on this-then there is a great
urgency about this bill. The boundary changes and other
revisions called for will require at least six manths' wark
by the Chief Electoral Offcer betare an electian can be
held.
Is that flot correct, senator?
Hon. Mr. Laing: It may well be so, yes.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Sa, in the interests of making the
1974 electian mare meaningful, we are farced ta accept
less, I would say, than haîf a loaf.
Hon. Mr. Martin: The electian for what year?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: The year 1974.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Is there gaing ta be an election?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: In the Northwest Territaries.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Je comprends.

Hon. Mr. Choquette: Well, bath can be right, here
and up there. Sa, in the interests of making the 1974
[Hon. Mr. Laing.]

April 9, 1974

election mare meaningful, we are farced ta accept less
than haîf a loaf.
The bill is a despicable hoax, as phony as a three-dollar
bill. The federal gavernment makes laud self-cangratulatory noises ta the effect that it is showing respect for aur
f ellaw Canadians in the northern territaries, but it does
not deliver the goods. This bill constitutes nothing mare
than a typical exercise in Liberal windaw dressing. It
allows for a fully elected council in the Northwest Territories, and for the addition of five members ta the Yukan
Cauncil. But this is nat getting ta the core of the problem.
We were under the impression that it had been established long ago, and was generally accepted by the Liberals, that there can be fia such thing as real parliamentary
demacracy anywhere, including the Canadian territaries,
until such time as the people are given real cantral aver
their awn destinies. That means that the elected councils
of the territories must be given fiscal autharity. Until such
time as this is dane, it is hypacritical, it is a callous,
cynical mockery, ta suggest that we have done anything
really significant ta establish parliamentary demacracy in
the North. Where elected representatives cannat influence
decisians regarding the expenditure of public moneys, na
dermocracy exists. The peoplý of the North are stili dictatcd ta by Ottawa through civil servants.
* (1700)

It is stili flot lawful for the councils in the territaries ta
adapt, pass, or vote upon a resolutian, address, or bill for
the appropriatian of any part of the public revenues ta the
territories that has nat been first recommended ta the
council by the cammissianer, who represents the federal
gavernment. Further, the budgets of the territorial councils are determined by an interdepartmental cammittee in
Ottawa, flot by the people of the North through their
elected counicil representatives.
There is nathing in this bill ta change that sarry situatian. Yet, the gaverfiment feels it has good cause ta congratulate itself on granting the territorial councils mare
autonamy. That is pure unadulterated hypocrisy.
The people of the North are fed up with colonialism.
They find it demeaning and stultifying. They want ta
control their own lives. They want ta make their own
laws. They want the right ta decide how tax dallars will be
spent in the Yukon. In short, the people of the North want
an end ta rule by federal bureaucrats.
The people af the North have praven their capacity ta
handle responsibility and authority; they have demonstrated their willingness ta accept the challenge of ruling
themselves. We should be gaing mach further in this bill
towards granting them pawers analogaus ta thase of the
provinces.
I entirely agree with the intraductary remarks of the
sponsar of this bill. This bill shows a deplorable lack af
understanding on the part of the federal government. The
people of the North do nat need, nor do they want, federal
guardians. They came of age a long time ago. We have no
reasan ta treat them as thaugh they were irresponsible
and undeserving of trust. If they are gaad enough ta pay
taxes, they should be goad enaugh ta gavern themselves.
Hon. Eugene A. Forsey: Hanaurable senatars, may I
intervene very briefly in this debate? I regret I was absent

Aprîl , 1974SENATE
DEBATES27

for most of the speech of Senator Laing, arriving as he was
concluding. I rnay, therefore, be sornewhat repetitive,
though I hope flot. There are jusf a couple of things I want
to say about this legisiation. One of them is provoked by
the remarks we have just heard from Senator Choquette.
As f ar as I can make out, he suggests that unless the
people in the ferritories are granted f ull responsible government, cabinet responsible governrnent, they are in a
condition of colonialisrn. I must say I find it rather tiresorne to hear this word "colonialisrn" applied to the status
of the territories, especially as it is changed by this
legisiation.
Hon. Mr'. Martin: I do not think that Senator Choquette
really has fallen for his own extravagant language.
Hon. Mr'. Forsey: I arn really asking Senator Choquette
whether that is what he wants, because if that is what he
is proposing, and if he fhinks that any territory which
does not enjoy full cabinet responsible governrnent is in a
stafe of colonialisrn, then I think we should hear that
stafed clearly.
It seerns to me a gross exaggeration. I dislike the use of
the term "colonialism." It is used very loosely all over the
place to describe all sorts of things that people don't like,
and when it cornes f0 applying that term to the present
status of the territories, I think it is a most outrageous
exaggeration of the situation.
I rnight add that the reason I mentioned this about
responsible goverfiment is that the particular phrase
which Senator Choquette referred f0, about the necessity
of rnoney bis being introduced on the recommendation of
the commissioner, is of course taken straighf frorn the
British North America Act in relation to provincial legislatures, the difference being that in the provincial legislatures you have responsible cabinet governmenf and in the
territories you have not.
This seerns to rne to bring ouf the essential. point of
Senafor Choquette's contention, and I should be very
grateful if he could enlighten us as ta whether thaf is
really what he wants, responsible cabinet government.
Honourable senators, I think there is a minor irnprovement here, but a not insignif icant one, in what 1 might cal
the tidying up of at least thle Northwest Territories Act.
Some little fime ago I was consulfed by certain people for
what I call one of my illegal legal opinions on the powers
of the commissioner under the Northwest Territories Act.
I looked af the fhing rather carefully, and was struck by
the fact that the commissioner appeared to be a curious
sort of hybrid. He was nof only a sort of lieufenant-governor in miniature, but he was also a speaker in miniature.
It seemed fa me most anornalous that in any kind of
legisiative body, like the council of the Northwest Territories, the person who in effect represented the Crown,
represented the central government at all events, should
also be the Speaker.
Hon. Mr'. Flynn: In the Senate that is the case.
Hon. Mx'. Forsey: I amn sorry. Perhaps I mighf just finish,
and then I may be able to hear Senator Flynn better.
I arn delighted fa see thaf in clauses 3 and 12 this
anomaly is gof rid of. I think fhis is a distinct improvement. I see Senator Flynn shaking his head but I do not
know why he is shaking his head, because the terrns of

279

clauses 3 and 12 seern fa be perf ectly clear, that the council
shaîl elect a Speaker, and as far as I know there is no
Speaker elected by either council now.
I can speak wifh some positiveness about the Northwest
Territories, unless the legislation has been changed in the
last few rnonths. This is a fidying-up operation and I fhink
if is a useful tidying-up operafion, and will help to make
things work more smoofhly in the territorial council and
put the commissioner in a somewhat less anomalous and
embarrassing position. I fhink if is a sfep forward, a
reasonable step forward.
The Conservative Party seems, if Senator Choqueffe is
expressing ifs opinion, ta have become suddenly very
advanced and avant-garde indeed, and wants ta make
what in another and different jurisdiction might be called
a "great leap forward". I arn inclined ta think that possibly
it is better ta proceed in the tirne-honoured way of British
and Canadian governments, and move step by step as
conditions warrant towards the full provincial autonomy
which "in due course', as Sir Robert Borden used ta say,
will doubtless be granted ta the present territories.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: That was 60 years ago.
Hon. Arthur Laing: Honourable senaforsThe Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I wish fa
inform the Senate that if Senator Laing speaks now, his
speech will have the effecf of closing the debate on the
second reading of this bill.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: We will have third reading, of course.
Hon. Mr'. Lainig: Honourable senafors, I first want fa
fhank Senator Forsey for coming f0 my aid.
Hon. Mr'. Choquette: 1 arn sure you did not need it.
Hon. Mr'. Laing: Af fer lisfening f0 Senator Choquette, I
was nof sure that we were both falking about the same
area of Canada. I know that area and I arn nof sure that he
does. It is 42 per cent of the land mass of Canada. The
populafion on the eastern side of fhe Arctic is one person
per 178 square miles. Governance in an area like thaf is
prefty difficulf. There was a f ire up there when fhey
neyer got any Canadian news at all, and the only radio
fhey got was from Moscow. We have beftered thaf by
Telesat, and communications have improved enormously.
Things have changed a very great deal up there. But fa
exaggerafe the position is nof going fa help us very much.
The conditions described by Senator Choquette, I want
fo assure him-and I rather think he will be glad ta
know-are nof as he represenfed. Thaf is the situation.
However, the demand will increase for greafer gavernance. I f eel very strongly for the position of the commissioners. As Senator Forsey says, they are in a difficuit
position. They are in the meat grinders, because they have
elected representafives there on their councils fa whom
they have to give attention, and yef they are appointed by
the minister here.
I do not know thaf we can do any better than this in this
fransitional period. The dominant position of the federal
government has f0 exist because of fhe money we are
putfing info thaf area. Tremendous amounts of the money
of faxpayers in southern Canada, are going there for
development purposes. We built a $9 million road into the
magnificent mine at Faro at no charge fa them. We built

April 9, 1974

SENATE DEBATES
the power line, for which they are repaying us over 20
years.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: How much money does the mine bring
to the federal treasury?
* (1710)

Hon. Mr. Laing: When the party of my honourable
friend was in power, they did the same in respect to Pine
Point.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I agree.
Hon. Mr. Laing: I should like to pay a tribute to the
former Prime Minister of Canada for having had the
courage to build that railway to Pine Point, with Hay
River as a terminus. That was good thinking. They called
it vision. It was a good vision. When you get a mine like
Pine Point, where it cost $22 million to install the concentrator, and then you make $32 million net in 18 months,
you've got a mine!
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It is worth spending federal money for
that purpose.
Hon. Mr. Laing: Of course! And we are putting in a
tremendous amount up there. In the last year the Northern
Transportation Company, which is a federal crown corporation, spent $22 million on tugs and barges. They have
one of the most efficient tug-and-barge services anywhere
in the world, for that type of river. But such enormous
expenditures place the government in the position where
they cannot give away all of the authority to spend that
money.
With respect to development, we hope to put a pipeline
through that territory at a cost of $5.7 billion. Obviously,
consideration has to be given to the native people, but
consideration must also be given to the council there. The
financial strictures are such, however, that at the present
time control of those areas will have to remain here in
Ottawa. It will have to remain here regardless of what
party is in power.
Hon. Mr. Asselin: For how long, though?
Hon. Mr. Laing: It will depend on what happens from
now on. I think they will get an increase in population,
although not great. The extraction of those resources up
there will never require a large population. It is the service industries behind the resources which will require
the increase in population. It will not be an increase in the
number of men out in the field.
The fact is that those mines, although they will produce
millions of dollars, will employ only about 200 men,
because they are open-pit mines for the most part. An
exception is the silver mine which employs about 360
people. It has been suggested that about 7,500 people will
be occupied in building the pipeline I referred to, but I
would think that no more than 200 or 300 people will be
required after the pipeline is in operation.

It is a difficult situation to judge, but the important
aspect is that there is an increasing number of competent
young people who are willing to serve on these councils,
and while the progress made to date may not satisfy them,
nevertheless we are moving in the right direction.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: That is the only point we tried to make.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this bill be read the third time?
On motion of Senator Laing, bill placed on the Orders of
the Day for third reading at the next sitting.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, I point out that
there may be a meeting of the Standing Senate Committee
on Transport and Communications tomorrow morning.
Senator Langlois and Senator Bourget, who is acting
chairman of that committee in Senator Haig's absence, are
endeavouring to arrange for a meeting. If there is a meeting tomorrow morning, notices will be distributed.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: What is on the agenda?
Hon. Mr. Martin: They hope to have some of the officers of the railway present.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: The CNR off icers?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Why should they rush into that?
Hon. Mr. Martin: I do not think they are rushing,
because they hope to have that meeting anyhow. At any
rate, they are out doing that now and if there is to be a
meeting notice will be given.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I do not think that you could extract
all you want in two hours.
Hon. Mr. Martin: In any event, if we are here it is far
better to use our time to full advantage. I am sure Senator
Flynn, with his new responsibilities, will agree that that is
the case.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It could wait until after the next
election. After all, it would be only the third election
without such a bill.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, I think we have
made good progress, and I thank my honourable friend for
facilitating it up to this point. I continue to hope that he
will do so with respect to the National Parks bill, and I
serve notice that we are going to try our best.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: We have to have something to keep us
busy when we return after Easter-if we do return.
Hon. Mr. Martin: That is right.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.

CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS FINANCING AND
GUARANTEE BILL, 1973
QUESTION 0F PRIVILEGE RE DEBATE ON SECOND
READING
Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: Honourable senators, I rise on a
question of privilege. During the debate yesterday on the
second reading of the Canadian National Raiiways
Financing and Guarantee Bull, 1973, my good friend Senator Langlois made a statementHon. Mr. Martin: He is just arriving in the chamber
now.
Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: I arn glad, because I was not in
the chamber when he spoke iast night. In closing the
debate, Senator Langlois placed certain documents on the
record and he took the occasion to comment on the speech
I had made the previous day on this bill. It is my belief
that his comments as to what I had said were incorrect,
and I wish to speak about this now. At page 269 of
yesterday's Debates of the Senate, Senator Langlois is
reported to have said:
Senator Desruisseaux began by indicating that he
was under some pressure to pass this bill in a speedy
fashion. 1 think I disposed of that last night. I assured
him that there was no pressure on anybody, and that
this house was expected to take ail the time it wished
to consider the bill.
I have littie to say about that, except to note these remarks
made by the Leader of the Government as reported at page

264 of the Debates of the Senate:
I am merely raising a point, I am sorry. This bill
could even be discussed during the Easter recess. We
must take ail the time necessary to make that
examination.
The implication was clear, to me at least, that this was a
possibility, if we were to go ahead, that we would sit
during the normal recess. I referred in my speech to the
recess of Parliament as something which we should
respect.
Senator Langlois continued at page 269:
However, Senator Desruisseaux went much further
than that, and made what I consider to be a violent
attack on the board of directors of the CNR, reproaching them for not having had their financial statements
audited, as would responsible administrators, not only
of public corporations but of private corporations as
well. In replying, I do flot want to appear to be coming
to the defence of the board of directors of the CNR. I
do flot think they need my help in this respect. They
are responsible Canadian citizens; I arn sure they are

doing their best to administer the CNR in an orderly
fashion, and according to the long-established practice
for such public operations.
I made no reference whatsoever to the directors of the
Canadian National Railways or Air Canada. 1 did say,
however, that in connection with the administration of the
CNR, Parliament was at fault because it did not pay
attention to the auditing of reports. I mentioned that we
had some reports that were not audited. That is quite
different from what Senator Langlois accused me of
saying.
If the Deputy Leader of the Government will again read
what I said-it appears at page 255 of the Debates of the
Senate for Monday, April 8-he will form another opinion
of what I said. It was this:
The Canadian National Railways and Air Canada
are outgrowing Parliament. They have gone beyond
the priorities set in the National Transportation Act
when those companies were established.
That was flot an attack on the directors, and I def y Senator Langlois to say that it was. I continued:
I amn ot blaming the companies for what has
happened.
That is clear enough:

Parliament makes the rules and the companies abide
by them.
Possibly it was not intended that I should be accused of
making a violent attack on the directors of the Canadian
National Railways and Air Canada. I have some very good
friends with the company and I do not have to, nor did I,
make an attack on them. I blamed Parliament for not
doing what it should have done at the right time.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, since I was
unavoidably delayed and was flot in the house when the
honourable senator commenced his remarks, I assume that
he rose on a question of privilege.
Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: That being so, I apologize if I misinterpreted his remarks. However, that was the meaning
conveyed to me. In my remarks I said I considered it to be
such. I did not say that Senator Desruisseaux, in fact,
attacked the board of directors, but that I considered it as
being an attack on the directors of both the CNR and Air
Canada. It is true, he did not refer to them specifically.

However, in blaming a corporation, you blame its
directors.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: No.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: There is no getting away from it. A
corporation does not speak on its own behaîf; it speaks
through its board of directors.
Hon. Mr'. Flynn: Oh, no.

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. Mr. Langlois: If a corporation makes a mistake,
the blame should be laid on the board of directors.
Hon. Mr. Asselin: You are going too f ar.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: That was my interpretation. Perhaps
I was wrong. I can only interpret what I hear. I did not
charge or accuse Senator Desruisseaux of having said that.
He made what I considered to be a violent attack on the
board of directors. That is the impression he left with me.
Based on my discussions with some other senators, I was
not the only one left with that impression. As I say, if my
impression was not a correct one, I apologize. I cannot add
anything further.
Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: I am pleased to accept the
apology of the Honourable Senator Langlois. However, I
should say that most senators who heard my remarks did
not give them the same interpretation as did Senator
Langlois. As a matter of fact, I was told by many members
of Parliament, especially members of the Opposition, that
I was quite right in making the remarks I made.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: You have the wrong reference there.
Of course, you are sitting on that side of the chamber.
Hon. Mr. Martin: If Senator Desruisseaux will permit
me, only this morning Senator Langlois made the remark
that if there is one senator who really does his homework
seriously and assiduously, it is Senator Desruisseaux, and
I fully agree.
Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: I am pleased to hear that he
feels that way, but I am not prepared to let the type of
interpretation Senator Langlois made stand.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: The Leader of the Government should
not foist his opinions on others.
AGRICULTURE
STANDING SENATE COMMITTEE-LETTER TO MINISTER OF
AGRICULTURE TABLED

Hon. Mr. Argue: Honourable senators, at a meeting of
the Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture on April 4,
the Minister of Agriculture, the Honourable Eugene
Whelan, suggested that recommendations or comments
from the committee on farm credit policies would be
welcomed by him, and he indicated there was some urgency in this respect.
I wish to inform honourable senators that our committee
has considered its recommendations, and these are being
submitted today to the minister in a letter approved by the
committee and signed by me as chairman. I wish to table
this letter now for the information of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Honourable senators, I know that we
all have great respect for the important work Senator
Argue has done in setting up this committee and in conducting its proceedings. However, I have some doubt as to
whether a committee of the Senate should communicate
directly with the government in this manner. My impression is that a committee of the Senate should report first
of all to the Senate, because those are usually the terms of
reference.
*

(1410)

I am not being in any way critical of Senator Argue. I
raise the point in case the situation should arise again,
[Hon. Mr. Flynn.]

April 10, 1974

because I believe it would be the consensus of the Senate
that any committee reaching a decision should report to
the Senate under its terms of reference rather than communicate directly officially as a committee with anyone
outside the Senate. I trust that Senator Argue will not
take this as a criticism, but rather as a suggestion that
could be of some importance if this precedent were followed. I can think of situations where it might be embarrassing to the Senate, although not in this case, of course.
Hon. Mr. Argue: I might say that the committee, in its
wisdom or otherwise, considered this point, and it was the
unanimous wish of the committee, including a representative from the official Opposition, that we do it this way.
We hoped to avoid criticism when the letter was being
sent to the Minister of Agriculture, by informing the
Senate of what was being done. I discussed this procedure
with officials of the Senate and was advised that this was
the proper way to do it. I am in no way trying to bypass
the authority of the Senate. I am trying to conform with
its authority, but also trying to assist the agricultural
industry in any way we can by submitting our recommendations to the place where it counts when we are asked for
recommendations. I was highly flattered that a minister of
the Crown should come to the SenateHon. Mr. Flynn: Why?
Hon. Mr. Argue: Let me finish my sentence-and ask
the committee for advice. I was impressed by that, and we
as a committee are trying to follow through.

REGULATIONS AND OTHER STATUTORY
INSTRUMENTS
FIRST REPORT OF STANDING JOINT COMMITTEE PRESENTED
AND ADOPTED
Hon. Eugene A. Forsey, Joint Chairman of the Standing
Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Commons on
Regulations and other Statutory Instruments presented
the first report of the committee as follows:
Your committee recommends that its quorum be
fixed at seven (7) members, provided that both
Houses are represented, whenever a vote, resolution
or other decision is taken, and that the joint chairmen
be authorized to hold meetings and receive evidence
so long as five (5) members are present, provided that
both Houses are represented.
Your committee further recommends that the committee have power to sit during adjournments of the
Senate.
He said: Honourable senators, I should like at the appropriate moment to move the adoption of this report, but I
think it would be premature to do so now.
The Clerk Assistant (Reading):
The Standing Joint Committee of the Senate and
House of Commons on Regulations and Other Statutory Instruments presents its first reportHon. Senators: Dispense.
Hon. Mr. Martin: May I ask Senator Forsey, as one of
the co-chairmenHon. Mr. Flynn: A motion has not been made.
Hon. Mr. Martin: No motion has been made.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Of course, a motion could not be made
without leave, but if Senator Forsey does not proceed
today by asking for leave, does that prejudice in any way
the work of the committee? I know that no one has
worked as hard as Senator Forsey on this joint committee.
It is an important committee. There was very considerable
debate in this house. It arose out of a complaint registered
three sessions ago by Senator O'Leary and I would hope
that the fact that the senator is not asking for leave now
would not in any way prejudice the work of the
committee.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Honourable senators, I amHon. Mr. Flynn: I rise on a point of order. I can understand the attitude of the Leader of the Government-it is
the customary one-but he is speaking prematurely. A
motion will be made. Leave will be asked to proceed. If it
is refused, the Leader of the Government can speak then,
but why assume that leave will be refused?
Hon. Mr. Martin: I do not think that Senator Flynn
should, in this happy period of Easter, engage unnecessarily in controversy-because I am not in controversy.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: No, no, but you are about to provoke it.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I am not. I am simply asking the
question, and that question is thisHon. Mr. Flynn: It should be asked later.

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. Mr. Martin: -whether the work of the committee
will be prejudiced in any way by the fact that leave is not
now sought on this occasion.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: You are creating confusion.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this report be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Now.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Honourable senators, that is what I
wished to speak to, the matter just raised by the Leader of
the Government. I am sorry if I have transgressed in any
wayThe Hon. the Speaker: Are you moving that the report
be taken into consideration now?
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Honourable senators, with leave of the
Senate and notwithstanding rule 45(1) (f), I move that the
report be taken into consideration now.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: I have discussed this matter with the
Leader of the Opposition.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, with leave
of the Senate and notwithstanding rule 45(1)(f), it is
moved by the Honourable Senator Forsey, seconded by
Honourable Senator Lafond, that the report be now
adopted.
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt this
motion?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Senator Forsey, for the record you can
now reply to the question put by the Leader of the
Government.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh!
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I think it is essential for the record,
otherwiseThe Hon. the Speaker: Adoptée,Hon. Mr. Flynn: No, Your Honour, with great respect. A
motion has been made, but I thinkHon. Mr. Langlois: Is this a point of order? Is this a
point of order?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Would you remain sient when you are
sitting on yourHon. Mr. Langlois: Madam Speaker, the honourable
senator has no right to speak at this time unless he rises
on a point of order.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: No, the motion has not been adoptedor otherwise Your Honour has decided in advance.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: You have not the right to speak.
Some Hon. Senators: Sit down.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, the motion
has not yet been adopted, and I think the honourable
senator has the right to speak to the motion.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: The honourable mover of the motion
was to give us an explanation. Of course, he may, if he
wishes, reply to the question which was put premature[Hon. Mr. Flynn.]

April 10, 1974

ly by the Leader of the Government. But I do want this
answer on the record. If the honourable mover of the
motion does not want to do it, I can do it for him.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Honourable senators, if I may be
allowed, I should like to defer my statement until I have
presented the second report, so that I can do the two
together, if the house would allow, because I think il
would save time and difficulties of every kind.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Agreed.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it your pleasure, honourable
senators, to adopt the motion? Adoptée, carried.
Motion agreed to and report adopted.
SECOND REPORT OF STANDING JOINT COMMITTEE
PRESENTED

Hon. Mr. Forsey: Honourable senators, I beg leave to
present the second report of the Standing Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Commons on Regulations
and Other Statutory Instruments.
Perhaps I may simply allow the Clerk at the Table to
read it to save time, and I can dispense instead of his
dispensing, and then I shall speak to it in a moment or
two. I can speak in fact briefly to both, to explain something of what has been going on and why the committee is
presenting these particular proposals.
*

(1420)

Hon. Mr. Grosart: Honourable senators, I rise on a point
of order. I would direct your attention to rule 78:
78.(2) A report presented to the Senate shall be
received without debate.
(3) A report which by its own terms is for the
information only of the Senate shall be laid on the
table but may on motion be placed on the orders of the
day for future consideration.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Or it may be discussed, as it is now, if
the Senate so wishes.
Hon. Mr. McIlraith: Consent was given by the Leader
of the Opposition a f ew minutes ago.
The Clerk Assistant (Reading):
The Standing Joint Committee of the Senate and
House of Commons on Regulations and other Statutory Instruments presents its second report, as
follows:
In considering its permanent reference relating to
the review and scrutiny of statutory instruments,
your committee is aware that a comparable committee
exists in Great Britain and is of the opinion that a
visit to England to study the committee's activities
and to meet with its members and staff would be of
great benefit. Your committee, however, considers it
to be unnecessary for the entire committee to travel to
Westminster.
Your committee therefore recommends that the
joint chairmen, after the usual consultations, be
authorized to designate a member representing each
House and the staff to travel to London, England, to
study and report to your committee on the procedures

SENATE

and methods of work of the comparable Westminster
committee.
Respectfully submitted,
Eugene A. Forsey,

Joint Chairman.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this report be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Honourable senators, with leave of the
Senate and notwithstanding rule 45(1) (f), I move that the
report be considered now.
Hon. Mr. Cook: Could Senator Forsey give us the reasons why it is so urgent that this be adopted now?
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Honourable senators, if there is any
feeling that this is hurrying the matter, I am not disposed
to press the thing at all. It is not a matter that is extremely
controversial. I discussed the matter briefly with the
Leader of the Opposition and he seemed to feel there was
no difficulty about leave being given. I trust Senator
Grosart or other experts in the rules will not object if I
ask to be allowed to give a rather brief statement of what
the committee has been doing, and what it proposes to do;
and this might meet the point raised f irst by the Leader of
the Government and then by the Leader of the Opposition.
The committee had great difficulty in getting under way
because of the necessity of finding staff, and owing to the
new arrangements which had been adopted in regard to
the staff ing of committees of both houses, under which the
staff would be provided by the research branch of the
Parliamentary Library.
There were a number of discussions on this, lasting over
some time, which were somewhat impeded by the absences
of the Commons chairman of the committee and by preoccupations of mine with other matters of public affairs, but
eventually we succeeded in getting our staff. We have
Professor Eglington, formerly of the Department of Law
of Carleton University, an Australian, and also, I think, an
English, barrister, and Mlle. Lise Mayrand, who is a
member of the Quebec bar. Both of them are members of
the staff of the Parliamentary Library research branch
and they have already gone to work and have set to on the
enormous task which confronts them of dealing with these
orders which were referred to the committee, now dating
back to the beginning of January 1972.
Because they have such a great backlog of work, the
committee is proposing that they should during the
summer have the help of some summer students-students
in law-and the suggestion has been that there might be a
maximum of 12, although I think there is little hope of
getting as many as that, in order to help them catch up
with the enormous backlog of work confronting them.
The suggestion bas also been made that it would be
useful if the committee could be informed directly of the
work being done by the corresponding joint committee in
the United Kingdom. That committee, as a joint committee, is relatively new. I think it goes back only two or
three years-something of that sort-but there have been
predecessor committees running back for about 40 years,
or so, I think, from each of the two houses. So there is a
considerable volume of experience to draw upon and the
proposal, as stated in the report of the committee, is that

two members of the committee, a senator and a member of
the House of Commons, designated by the joint chairmen,
and after the usual consultations, should proceed to Westminster sometime in May or June,-the date bas not been
precisely settled yet-to look into the procedures of the
joint committee in the United Kingdom.
It is not intended to be a prolonged visit; something of
the order of three or four days is contemplated. Furthermore, if I may venture to say so, it is the hope of the
committee that it may be possible to reduce the expense of
this by asking to have the people concerned taken across
in one of the regular flights of the Department of National
Defence. So, honourable senators, we are not proposing
any prolonged or elaborate junket. I may add that as one
of the joint chairmen, if he happens to go, happens to be a
teetotaller, that particular item of expense will not be a
large one. A few ginger ales possibly will satisfy the
situation as far as be is concerned. I don't know if he will
go, but it is possible that he may be designated.
I don't know if that covers the ground adequately. If
there are any questions that any honourable senators
would like to ask, I shall be prepared to answer them to
the best of my ability. But I think that gives a bird's-eye
view of what the committee bas been trying to do, what it
has so far accomplished, and the methods by which it
proposes to proceed with its work henceforth. I might also
add that the committee staff has had excellent co-operation from both the Privy Council office and the Department of Justice. Everything seems to be going very
smoothly in that respect, although there have been certain
difficulties about physical accommodation and even about
telephone lines, the latter, I believe, having now been
suitably dealt with.
That is about all I need to say, except to say once again
that there is no special urgency about this. I suppose it
could be dealt with after the recess. But on the other hand,
it seems to me rather unnecessary to make two bites of a
cherry, and we can, if the Senate is willing, deal with the
thing now and get the housekeeping items settled before
the recess, so that we can write to England and find out
what would be the best date for the four people to go over.
Hon. Mr. Lafond: On a point of clarification, honourable
senators, I gather that as Senator Forsey in his report as
well as in his remarks refers to staff going over to England, his reference is confined to the two official members
of the research staff, Mr. Eglington and Miss Mayrand?
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Precisely.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I wonder if I could direct a question
to Senator Forsey. My understanding is that the report
suggests that there will be four people only who will be
going to make this inquiry at Westminster. It occurs to me
that it would be far more appropriate if all parties in both
bouses were represented on any such committee of inquiry. I don't know who the four might be. There probably
would be the two joint chairmen. But if only four members of the committee are going, it seems quite obvious
that some parties will not be represented, and it would
seem to me to be of the utmost importance in a situation
such as this that all parties be included in this, what will
be, I suppose, a subcommittee. This may have been discussed in the committee, but I would welcome Senator
Forsey's comments.

SENATE DEBATES

*

(1430)

Hon. Mr. Forsey: Honourable senators, I do not recall
that the matter was discussed in the committee, except
very briefly and I was obliged to leave before all the
proceedings were concluded. Perhaps other members of
the committee who were present may have a better recollection of that than I. I am confident, however, after
reading the proceedings, that I did not miss anything vital
with respect to this particular point. My recollection is
that the first suggestion was that the two research officers, the two barristers that I referred to, or one barrister
and one avocat, to be precise, should go; secondly, that two
members of the committee, one representing each house,
should go. I cannot recall anything being said by any
member of the committee about the representation of
parties.
Hon. Mr. Martin: No; two co-chairmen.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: What was that?
Hon. Mr. Martin: As I understood your remarks, it was
two co-chairmen, not two research people.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: No, two designated by the co-chairmen. The Commons co-chairman said it would be very
difficult for him to go and thought it was probably impossible. I said that as far as I was concerned it would be
inconvenient but if it was the desire of the committee to
designate me, I would be prepared to go. The proposal,
however, was that one senator and one member of the
House of Commons should go, these to be designated by
the co-chairmen.
Whether the one from the House of Commons, for example, might bo a member of the NDP or the Social Credit
Party, I do not know. Obviously we could not designate a
member of the NDP in the Senate, because there are none
here.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Oh, yes, there is.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: A former member of the NDP.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: I think that probably the feeling of the
committee was that we wished to have someone from each
house and it was largely a technical and non-party matter,
anyway, and the question of representation of parties was
never raised. My assumption would be that it would be
very unlikely that the two that were chosen would come
from the same party. This would surprise me very much.
On the other hand, if we find that all the members of the
committee from other parties than the Liberal Party and
all members of the committee except one Liberal from this
house are unable to go, I suppose it may be conceivable
that we would have a couple of Conservatives or a couple
of Liberals. I do not know, but I do not think that point
was raised, nor that anyone thought that party politics
were involved in this.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Of course not.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: But I am not a mind reader, so I may
be completely wrong.
Hon. Mr. McIlraith: This important matter, it seems to
me, poses some questions of a peripheral nature that are
rather important. I notice, however, that the honourable
senator speaking dealt with dates in fairly specific terms
and, of course, did not deal with the situation that might
[Hon. Mr. Grosart.]

April 10, 1974

arise if there were no members of the House of Commons
at that time. At any rate I wish to inquire of him for
information and clarification. He spoke in rather glowing
terms of the work of two research officers and I heartily
concur in that. It does raise, however, a question to which
the Senate must address itself, as I see it, on which he said
nothing whatsoever. That is the explanation as to why
that work was not being done by the Committees Branch
of the Senate with the assistance of these research officers, whose services are available to this place and the
other place at any time and which is competent assistance.
I wonder if he would care to enlighten us as to just what
efforts he made to obtain adequately qualified personnel
from the Committees Branch and if he was unable to
obtain them, whether he raised the matter with the Commissioners of Internal Economy in this placeHon. Mr. Flynn: We have none here.
Hon. Mr. McIlraith: -for their consideration, or what
steps had been taken. There is a part of our establishment
that, it seems to me, should be capable of providing the
information being sought, having obtained it in the
normal course of their work through the mails in the last
number of years and being experts on the subject. In my
opinion, that is a matter which it would be foolish of us to
overlook entirely. You will note that the treatment of that
subject does not necessarily go to the root of the motion
made by the honourable senator, but I do believe it should
be raised and considered at this time.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Honoureble senators, in reply to the
Honourable Senator McIlraith's first point, I should have
thought that if by the time the arrangements have been
made the Parliament has been dissolved there will be no
members of the House of Commons to be sent and the
whole matter will be adjourned sine die, indefinitely, until
some date unknown. Obviously, we cannot send a member
of the House of Commons if there is no member of the
House of Commons. However, I gather that Senator McIlraith raised that question rather in a Pickwickian spirit,
so I will not dwell upon that further.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Senator McIlraith knows what he is
talking about.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Of course ho knows what he is talking
about; there is no senator better qualified to speak on
these subjects than Senator McIlraith. I do not say there
are none as well qualified, but there are none better
qualified than Senator McIlraith, and if I seemed to cast a
reflection on his competence, it was entirely unintentional
and I stand corrected. There is no one for whose competence in these matters I have greater respect than Senator
Mcllraith.
As to the other matter, of the staff: First of all, after
discussion between the two joint chairmen and some other
members of the committee it was felt that the Committees
Branch did not have, to the best of our knowledge, specialized personnel available with the specialized experience
necessary for this type of work. If they had, we would
have obtained lawyers there who could do the job for us.
The second point is that, as I understand it, arrangements
had been made with the authorities of the two chambers
that committees requiring technical assistance shall
henceforth obtain it from the research branch of the Par-

April 10, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

liamentary Library, whose staff has been extended and
enlarged expressly for this precise purpose. A number of
new personnel have been engaged and here we have available in the research branch of the Parliamentary Library
two members of the staff who are excellently qualified. In
fact, we had originally, before these arrangements were
made by the authorities of the two houses with the Parliamentary Library, attempted to obtain on our own account
a certain person from the Parliamentary Library Research
Branch. The Parliamentary Library was extremely reluetant to allow that person to leave. Meanwhile, before we
went further, these arrangements were made with respect
to the staffing of all committees, as I understand it. So we
proceeded in what we thought was the appropriate way.
We got these two highly qualified people from the
research branch of the Parliamentary Library. We are, of
course, getting the services of the Committees Branch of
the House of Commons. We have, for some reason I do not
know, not been provided with a joint clerk, but I suppose
we can be if it is necessary. It did not seem necessary to
impose that task on the Committees Branch of the Senate.
Mr. Mackenzie from the other side did the job and no one
raised the question. Perhaps I should have shown more
collective amour-propre in this matter and insisted that we
have a joint clerk from the Senate. It did not occur to me,
however, and this was perhaps a serious oversight on my
part.
I do not know whether that answers Senator McIlraith's
inquiry? He seems to think that perhaps we can obtain all
this information adequately by writing letters. Well, possibly so and if we can, certainly I have no desire to make a
voyage to the United Kingdom, more especially as I am
scared stiff every time I get on an airplane, and have been
for years, after a couple of unpleasant experiences. I
shared this dislike with the late Honourable George
Nowlan. However, if we can obtain the information by
mail, all right, but the opinion of the members of the
committee seemed to be different, that it would be much
more useful to have people there who would ask questions
and look at the thing point by point, "What about this"?
and get the advice of the people concerned on that particular point.
S(1440)

Hon. Mr. McIlraith: I am sure the honourable senator
would not wish to misquote me. I did not say at any point
that the committee could get this information by mail. I
raised the point as to why there was no one in our Committees Branch who was competent to do this job, with the
assistance of research off icers of whom he spoke.
Hon. Mr. Argue: I wonder if I might make a comment. I
quite understand that our Committees Branch does not
have the kind of highly technical personnel that this joint
committee requires. I should bring it to the attention of
honourable senators that in my opinion the quality of our
own Committees Branch might well be improved in order
that research assistance can be provided for our committees. It is my experience that the Committees Branch does
not attempt to provide any research assistance whatsoever
for our committees. That has bothered me, quite frankly, a
great deal.
I wonder how many senators know that if the Committees Branch is asked by a senator for simple research

assistance, it refuses to try to give it. Not only does the
Committees Branch not give assistance but, I repeat, it
refuses to try. This is an important matter which should
be thoroughly examined by the Senate. I agree with the
line which I think Senator McIlraith was beginning to
follow, namely, that the quality and scope of our Committees Branch should be improved and upgraded. I see no
reason why it should not be prepared to try to provide
general research assistance. The personnel of the Committees Branch should try to provide that assistance.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Honourable senators, I do not wish to be a bull in a china shop, and I hope
that Senator Forsey will not consider my remarks as being
directed at him. It seems to me that we have got away
from the main point proposed concerning the second
report of the committee. The proposal is to send four
people-two members of Parliament and two officials,
specialists-to the United Kingdom for four days to see
what is done there with regard to statutory rules and
orders.
The United Kingdom Parliament has had a committee
doing this kind of work for many years, and its reports are
available here. In view of that, why is it necessary to send
four people to the United Kingdom for this purpose? In all
probability there will be little opportunity to do anything
more than talk briefly about their procedures. In four days
a busy official at Westminster will not be able to devote
much time to this matter.
Just as much experience could be gained if those
involved were to consult our records here and thoroughly
familiarize themselves with the procedures, methods and
purposes that characterize the work of the committee at
Westminster. It may be necessary for someone to visit
Westminster at some future date to see what is being done
there, but this does not seem to be the appropriate time. I
should think that after the committee and its experts
gained some experience they would be able to speak at
Westminster with a good deal more knowledge. In my
opinion, the committee should take another look at this
matter. The committee is a new one. The statute was
passed not very long ago. The committee has not been
going for too long.
An Hon. Senator: For three years.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Our own approach
to the problem is more important than an examination of
what is done elsewhere. I would have confidence in what
our committee would do rather than rely on what is done
elsewhere.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: May I speak to the points which
Senator Connolly has raised? I am sorry to be on my feet
so often-really, it is quite irregular-but perhaps I might
have permission to do so.
First, I have to say that one of the reasons for the
suggestion was that we might be able to see the United
Kingdom committee actually in operation as well as have
discussions with the Commons and Lords staff.
Originally I think there had been the suggestion that
one of their people should come out here. The feeling in
the committee was that it would be more satisfactory if we
sent people over there.

April 10, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

Why cannot we wait a while until we get things going
here? The answer to that is, what is happening here now is
the setting up of a system for dealing with these things,
and it was thought that perhaps we could benefit from
seeing the kind of system that has been working there for
a long period of years. This, I think, was in the minds of
the committee.
I do not know that I can elaborate on that in any useful
way. That was the reason why the committee wants to do
it now, as I understand it.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: May I address a question to the
mover of the motion? Would he consider, as co-chairman,
seeking the advice and consent of the leaders of any
parties in the Senate and the House of Commons who will
not be represented on this group going to Westminster, to
ensure that they are satisfied that the group can do its
work satisfactorily without representation from all parties
in both houses?
Hon. Mr. Forsey: I would be delighted to give that
undertaking myself, and I am confident that the co-chairman of the House of Commons would be equally pleased
to do so. It is an admirable suggestion, in which I heartily
concur.
I should make one other point. Reports substantially the
same as these have already been presented in the other
place. I do not know what they involve in the way of
further proceedings if this report is not adopted. I suppose
we shall go back to them and say, "Sorry, you chaps will
have to change your minds because the Senate is not going
to be pushed around by any decision you make."
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, if I could have
some clarification: I do not know whether we are discussing adoption of the first or second report, or the objection
Senator Cook raised when leave was asked. The last thing
I heard was Senator Cook objecting to leave being granted, until an explanation was given, for the adoption of
these reports now. I do not know whether there are one,
two or three questions before the Chair. Perhaps clarification could be given.
Hon. Mr. Cook: I asked what was the urgency for leave
being given. I think the mover said there was no urgency.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: I said there was no particular urgency.
I think we should get things under way as soon as we can
and not make two bites of a cherry. I thought the first
report had been adopted, about the quorum. I presume
there is no difficulty about that?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Agreed. I thought you asked that the
first report be discussed at the same time as the second. If
leave was not granted for the second, then I do not know
how it could be granted for the first. I think we should
have this clarified. If Senator Cook would withdraw his
objectionHon. Mr. Cook: No. I am not satisfied about the urgency. I do not think there is any urgency.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Does Senator Cook object to the adoption of the f irst report providing for the quorum?
Hon. Mr. Cook: Of course not. It is purely a matter of
form. I am not objecting to the first report. I am objecting
to the second report being considered now.
[Hon. Mr. Forsey.]

Hon. Mr. Martin: Then what about the second report?
Hon. Mr. Forsey: I suppose leave has been refused for
the second report and I must simply give notice.
The Hon. the Speaker: Shall notice be given?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, we have had a
useful discussion and it would appear that honourable
senators would like to read the second report. Senator
Forsey might find in the long run that his objective will be
better attained if consideration of the second report were
left until after the Easter recess.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It probably would have been adopted
had not the Leader of the Government tried to help Senator Forsey.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: That is a f alse assumption.
The Hon. the Speaker: May I ask Senator Forsey
whether he is continuing his motion or is making another?
*

(1450)

Hon. Mr. Forsey: I gather, honourable senators, that
leave has been refused. Therefore, I beg to give notice as
required ordinarily, under rule 45(1)(f).
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Next sitting.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: At the next sitting.
The Hon. the Speaker: I think you are moving that the
second report be placed on the Orders of the Day for
consideration at the next sitting. Is that what you wish to
move?
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Yes, please.
Motion agreed to.
ADJOURNMENT
Hon. Leopold Langlois: Honourable senators, with leave
of the Senate and notwithstanding rule 45(1)(g), I move
that when the Senate adjourns today it do stand
adjourned until Monday, April 22, at 8 o'clock in the
evening.
Honourable senators, in fixing the date for the return of
the Senate following the Easter recess we had to take into
consideration the fact that Bill C-5, the Canadian National
Railways Financing and Guarantee bill, is still in the
committee stage. As honourable senators are aware, yesterday Bill C-5 was referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Transport and Communications, which met this
morning. A number of witnesses were heard this morning,
but the committee was unable to conclude its examination
of the bill. As there is some urgency in connection with
Bill C-5-and I realize we do not all agree as to the degree
of that urgency-the committee will have to meet again
early in the week commencing Monday, April 22.
The Standing Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs has
meetings scheduled for April 24 and April 25, when it will
continue its examination of Canadian relations with the
United States. The Standing Senate Committee on
Agriculture will be holding a number of meetings during
that week. A large number of witnesses are now listed to
appear in respect of Bill S-2, to amend the Animal Contagious Diseases Act. During that week the Senate Standing

April 10, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce also will
proceed with its study of competition legislation in
Canada, the first meeting probably being held on April 24.
In addition to the two bills now referred to committees-Bill S-2 and Bill C-5-there are two bills on the
Order Paper still being debated on second reading, those
being Bill S-4, to amend the Criminal Code (control of
weapons and firearms) and Bill C-6, to amend the National Parks Act.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, I agree that the
Senate should reconvene on April 22. However, I cannot
find anything in what the Deputy Leader of the Government has said which would necessitate our coming back
on Monday evening rather than Tuesday evening. In
normal circumstances, we should be returning on Tuesday
evening, April 23. Surely we are not being asked to come
back on Monday evening, April 22, because Bill C-5 is still
under consideration by the committee.
Perhaps the Deputy Leader has other motives inspired
by the Leader of the Government. In my view, having
honourable senators return on Monday evening rather
than Tuesday evening will disturb the usual programs of
many honourable senators.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, I think the
Leader of the Opposition should be more careful in
making assumptions. The reason I am suggesting we come
back on Monday evening, April 22, is that, in my view, we
will need all of that week to proceed with Bill C-5 in
committee. Following the committee meeting this morning, I had occasion to discuss this matter with officials of
the CNR, Air Canada and a representative of the Department of Finance. During that discussion I was given some
information which leads me to believe that it is very
important that Bill C-5 be passed during the week of April
22. I think the additional day will be necessary if we want
to give due consideration to Bill C-5 and avoid delaying its
passage any more than is necessary.
The fact that we will return on Monday evening will
allow us to hold committee meetings on Tuesday morning
and Tuesday afternoon, if need be, and no one will be
under any pressure in those circumstances. Honourable
senators will have all the time they require to deal fully
with Bill C-5. The House of Commons also will be returning on April 22.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: The Deputy Leader of the Government
was much more convincing on his second try than on his
first.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I am glad I succeeded.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Honourable senators, I wonder if I
might ask the Deputy Leader of the Government to disclose this "very important information" which he received
as to why it is necessary that Bill C-5 be passed during the
week of April 22. This is the first intimation we have had
that there is a deadline or a matter of urgency relating to
this bill.
I say this for reasons the Deputy Leader of the Government will understand. Both the CNR and Air Canada have
been able to get along without this legislation for two
years.

27601-19

Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, I am afraid
that in my reply to the question put to me by Senator
Grosart I might be accused of putting pressure on honourable senators to deal with this bill quickly. I was much
impressed when I was told by the representatives of the
CNR, Air Canada and the Department of Finance that at
the present time Air Canada is operating on bank loans,
and that there is a margin of credit. This margin of credit
is to expire within two weeks, and the officials are worried about the renewal of it. They do not want to fail their
bank commitments. I was impressed by that. This is a
public corporation, and I do not think it should be put in
that position.
We must realize that they are not to blame for the
situation in which they find themselves. It is the fault of
Parliament, and Parliament alone. I think we should do
our best to remedy the situation as quickly as possible. As
I said in committee this morning, we are faced with an
unusual situation. We should not allow that situation to
continue any longer than is necessary. We should do our
best to remedy it, and the sooner the better.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I thank the Deputy Leader of the
Government for that information. The fact that Air
Canada is in danger of being denied its line of bank credit
is vitally important information for the Senate to have.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I have explained the situation, and I
need not comment on Senator Grosart's last remark. I
gather it was made in a light manner. I do not want my
reply to be interpreted as putting pressure on the committee. I am simply endeavouring to provide the time necessary for Bill C-5 to receive proper and adequate consideration. I will leave it at that. I repeat that I was very
impressed by what these officials told me this morning
following the committee meeting, and I think anyone in
my place would have been impressed.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I, too, am greatly impressed by the
information.
Hon. Mr. Sparrow: Honourable senators, may I ask the
Deputy Leader a question? Has Air Canada found it necessary to use its bank credit since January 1, 1973, or is he
suggesting that they will find it necessary to use it during
the week of April 22?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: According to the information I
received this morning, Air Canada started operating on
bank loans about a year ago, with a credit margin of $50
million. That credit margin was subsequently raised to
$100 million, and at present it is up to $140 million. That
credit margin, I am told, will be exhausted within 10 or 15
days from now.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: They are hard up.
Hon. Mr. Martin: They have been hard up ever since
they went into business.
Motion agreed to.

FORT-FALLS BRIDGE AUTHORITY
CONSTRUCTION OF NEW INTERNATIONAL BRIDGE-QUESTION
ANSWERED

Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, on March 21
Senator Everett asked me a question regarding an interna-

SENATE DEBATES

tional highway bridge between Fort Frances, Ontario, and
International Falls, Minnesota. Bis question was:
What action is being taken to build the new bridge
as an entry into Canada from the United States to
replace the present privately owned toll bridge entry?
The reply prepared by the Department of External
Affairs is as follows:
The Governor of Minnesota has recently written to
the Secretary of State for External Affairs proposing
the conclusion of an agreement between appropriate
government agencies in both countries for the construction of the Fort-Falls Bridge. There is some question as to whether all the necessary legislative
requirements in the United States have been met and
whether an inter-agency agreement is required in this
case. Our Embassy in Washington will be consulting
presently with the Department of State to determine
these points and to examine the compatibility of
American and Canadian legislation for the construction of this bridge. No work is to proceed until such
questions are resolved.

YUKON ACT, NORTHWEST TERRITORIES ACT AND
CANADA ELECTIONS ACT
BILL TO AMEND-THIRD READING

Hon. Arthur Laing moved the third reading of Bill C-9,
to amend the Yukon Act, the Northwest Territories Act
and the Canada Elections Act.
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.

FISHERIES DEVELOPMENT ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned
debate on the motion of Senator Carter, for the second
reading of Bill C-2, to amend the Fisheries Development
Act.
Hon. Fred M. Blois: Honourable senators, I wish to
make a few remarks on this bill. Before going further, I
should like to compliment Senator Carter on the very
thorough manner in which he explained this bill to us
yesterday. If we had to go on the explanations given in the
bill we would be just as ignorant in respect of it as before
it was even printed, but Senator Carter did a good job
yesterday and I thank him for it.
As I understand the bill, its purpose is to provide financial support for the conversion and bringing up to date of
small and medium-sized boats. At present subsidies are
available only for new vessel construction. I think the idea
behind this bill is basically sound, and the measure
deserves the support of all members of this house.
With certain modifications some existing vessels could
greatly increase their harvesting capabilities. In some
instances the present equipment is inadequate, and in
other cases it is inappropriate in every way. There are
some species of fish that even today remain unexploited or
under-exploited. What is lacking on many vessels is adequate equipment. This bill will provide subsidies to help
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

April 10, 1974

in the cost of converting those vessels and preparing them
for other types of f ishing.
This bill offers fishermen help to modernize their operations, help to make them more efficient, and even competitive with other vessels that are fishing off our coasts. This
is something that is definitely needed by many fishermen,
and this is particularly true of those in my own province,
Nova Scotia.
However, I feel I should draw attention to the fact that
the subsidy is for 35 per cent of the cost of conversion or
modification. In a day and age when the rate of inflation is
running at approximately 10 per cent per year, there is not
a very reassuring future for these people. I think the
subsidy might have been increased to 50 per cent. The
reason I suggest 50 per cent is that that is what we did in
another fisheries bill last year.
It will be recalled that last summer the Fisheries Development Act was amended to provide subsidies for the
construction and equipping of ice-making stations on the
shores, and also for equipping the boats with seawater
refrigeration. There was a serious situation, and from
information I have gathered in Nova Scotia I understand
that prior to the construction of those facilities many
thousands of pounds of fish were ruined, simply because
they were not properly taken care of. Some fish were
refused by the fish packers for various reasons, the main
one being that they had not been properly stored because
of lack of refrigerating equipment on the boats or the
docks. Since the passage of that amendment last year
there has been a considerable change, and it has been of
great help to our people.
Last year, if I recall correctly, the bill before Parliament
was amended to provide grants equal to 50 per cent of the
cost of such facilities up to a maximum of $25,000. If this
bill now before us were amended to make a similar provision it would be of even greater help to the fishermen, who
need all the help we can give them. It must be remembered
that in certain provinces of Canada the fishing industry
brings a great deal of money into the local economy, and
provides work for many people.
I wish we were able to provide the same amount in Bill
C-2 as was provided by the amending bill last year. However, as I understand it, an amendment coming from this
chamber right now would be out of place, so I shall not
pursue that matter further.
I am sure that all members of the Opposition, and,
indeed, all members of the Senate, will support the bill. I
hope that the regulations will not be so heavy as to sink
the vessels while the fishermen are waiting for the assistance. This is one of the problems. Legislation is passed by
Parliament, but it seems to take a long time for the
regulations to be promulgated.
*

(1t>10)

I spoke recently to some fishermen-not the presidents
of the big fishing companies, but people who fish in their
own boats-and found they are very critical of the regulations and the red tape that confronts them before they get
such help as is provided by this bill. One of the men I
spoke to said something like this, "We get hundreds of
regulations and dozens of forms; in my opinion there are
two many pin-striped, highly-educated, over-specialized,

April 10, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

desk clerks from Upper Canada." In Nova Scotia the
fishermen do not have much use for this kind of thing. I
have heard other uncomplimentary remarks, such as, "We
do not have much use for the bureaucrats who handle a lot
of these things. These bureaucrats know little about fishing, and they have not enough sense to realize their ignorance. Our fishermen in Nova Scotia do not mind help to
improve their efficiency, but they do not want their entire
lives re-organized."
There is some reason for that sort of feeling, not only in
fishing but in other fields of endeavour. A f ew weeks ago I
was speaking to some leading farmers-I know it does not
affect this bill-and they said there is too much information required. One man had made an application for an
increased loan. He had bought another farm, and had
asked for an increased loan on his greater acreage. An
investigator came around to look into his situation, and
then proceeded to tell the farmer how to operate his farm.
This investigator had no experience of farming. He had
not even been born on a farm. The farmer in question was
a graduate of an agricultural college, yet he had to listen
to this man telling him how to run his farm. I shall not tell
you the exact words the farmer used, but I gather he told
the investigator in unmistakable terms to get off his
property.
That tells us how things are. The fishermen have the
same feeling, when they are told that they are not working
properly by these people who try to educate them but who
know nothing about the job.

As to "conversion," some species of fish are becoming
over-exploited, and fishermen are faced with the need to
alter or convert their boats so that they can go after other
species of fish. That is the object of this particular
amendment.
With respect to the 35 per cent rate of subsidy to which
Senator Blois referred, this is determined by regulation
approved by the Governor in Council. Thirty-five per cent
is the general rate which applies under section 5(c), which
is being amended. At present it applies to new construction and equipment. I am informed that this particular
rate of 35 per cent is being reviewed, and possibly a new
regulation will be issued which may set a ceiling and a
different rate-much the same as was issued with respect
to section 5(d) which, as Senator Blois pointed out, is 50
per cent of the approved cost, up to a ceiling of $25,000 for
any one particular individual.
Honourable senators, this amendment does not imply
that any modification or any type of conversion would
automatically be eligible for subsidy under this legislation. It applies only to approved conversion and approved
modification. The criterion on which the grant or subsidy
will be based is that it will contribute substantially to an
improvement in either the economics or the efficiency of
the operation of the boat of the fisherman who is seeking
this assistance.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

Hon. Chesley W. Carter: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I wish to
inform the Senate that if the Honourable Senator Carter
speaks now his speech will have the effect of closing the
debate on second reading of this bill.
Hon. Mr. Carter: Honourable senators, if no other senator wishes to speak to this bill, I should like to close the
debate with a few words.
I wish to thank Senator Blois for the very kind remarks
he made regarding my efforts in presenting the bill, and I
compliment him on his contribution to the debate. He
brought us down to earth by giving us first hand the
experiences of fishermen in Nova Scotia with this type of
legislation, and the way in which those fishermen complain of things to which they are subjected.
Yesterday, due to the lateness of the hour, I did not wish
to prolong my remarks. The two words which this bill
adds to section 5(c) of the act are themselves explanatory.
We all know what "modification" is, and what "conversion" is. This conversion is not the kind that Saul
experienced; this is the "conversion" of a boat, but I do not
wish to delay you on that.
I should have pointed out that there are many fishermen
who found they could not take advantage of the provisions
of Section 5(c) of the Fisheries Development Act, which
provides assistance for the installation of chilling facilities in boats in order to upgrade the quality of the fish.
They could not take advantage of that assistance without
substantial modifications to their boats, because the
assistance under section 5(c) applies only to new construction, and that meant they would have to lay a new
keel and start from scratch. That is one of the reasons why
it is necessary to insert the word "modification" now.

Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.

NATIONAL PARKS ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Arthur Laing moved the second reading of Bill
C-6, to amend the National Parks Act.
He said: Honourable senators, I should like to put on
record a few facts concerning the national parks system of
Canada. Although I trod into this area somewhat yesterday, it was only an abortive attempt to bring the bill
before the Senate.
No federal institution in Canada is more broadly accepted by all Canadians than the national parks system. It has
even been said by other peoples that Canada has the best
national parks in the world. When I was in the department
we had 17 national parks. I said at that time that some day
we would have 50 national parks, and Mr. Chrétien has
said that in his view some day we shall have 60 national
parks in Canada.
Going back in history, it all started with the Father of
our country, Sir John A. Macdonald. If you remember the
history of those days, Pierre Berton had just finished
building the railway and Sir John A. wanted to move some
of the population out to Western Canada. When he sponsored the bill in the House of Commons by which Banff
Springs was established, he said that it was his desire and
wish to encourage wealthy people from Canada to build
elegant homes in the parks, and he accomplished that by
giving those wealthy people what I consider the most
ridiculous lease arrangement I have ever heard of. Generally speaking, the lease was for $7 a year and was to
continue for 21 years, at the expiry of which time the lease
would be renewed for a further 21 years, and so on forever.
I am not a lawyer, only a farmer's boy, but that
sounds to me as if the land is being held in fee simple and
not under a lease arrangement at all, and I think most
lawyers would agree with me. However, we tested that in
court and lost our case. Nevertheless, some day there has
to be an amendment, because everyone in Canada would
just love to live in a park on that basis and it is quite
unfair that certain people are living in a park without in
any way being required to conduct a business within the
park.
Well, that was Banff in 1887 and 1888. Since that time
significant progress has been made in the establishment of
national parks, and some of the most popular parks of
today are the five parks situated on the Atlantic coast.
I remember very distinctly that when I first came to
Ottawa in 1949 a young man from Saint John, New Brunswick, strongly and energetically urged the government of
the day to establish the national park now known as
[The Hon. the Speaker.]

April 10, 1974

Fundy Park. I am glad, in paying tribute to him, to be able
to associate myself with him as a senator. I refer to
Senator Riley. When he was in the House of Commons at
that time he created such a stir that Fundy Park was,
indeed, established.
Another beautiful park area is the Cabot Trail in Cape
Breton Highlands National Park. It is an area of surpassing beauty which I consider the second best national park
in Canada-the first one being not Banff, in my view, but
Jasper.
Honourable senators, we have built these parks up one
after the other across the years despite the fact that there
have been many difficulties owing to the nature of the
operation of a park. I said the other day in the presence of
Senator Hicks that 75 per cent of the people who visit
national parks do so within a three-month period. He
responded by suggesting that in the Atlantic area a more
accurate figure would be 90 per cent.
One can readily see the difficulty involved in providing
within that time frame the kinds of services visitors to the
parks expect. Last year there were over two million visitors to Banff National Park. Incidentally, a visitor is
considered to be a person who stays more than 48 hours
within a park. In Jasper the number is up to about a
million and a half visitors annually. For many years quite
a significant number of the visitors to our parks have been
Americans, and thus the economic impact of our parks
system upon Canada as a whole has also been significant.
I should like to point out, however, that Canadians,
generally speaking, have also become world travellers,
many of them going to Europe, to the Caribbean and, from
the West Coast, to Hawaii. Indeed, the travel bill for
Canadians going abroad now exceeds $1 billion per year.
In respect of travel, therefore, Canada has been in a deficit
position each year with the single exception of 1967, the
year of our Centennial and Expo.
Of the many and varied attractions Canada has for
visitors from abroad, the main attraction, particularly for
Americans, is our national parks. The greatest feeling of
freedom an American can experience is being able to go
some place where he can just fill the gas tank of his car
and get going. In 1965 we found that with respect to the
people who drove into the two mountain parks the average
distance driven was 1,200 miles. I would predict that this
year, owing to the action of the government of Alberta in
reducing its gas tax from 15 cents to 5 cents, there will be
standing room only in those two western parks. The
Americans will be flocking in. I believe the same will hold
true in our Atlantic parks, because today more than 60
million people are within two days' driving distance of the
parks on that coast.
Honourable senators, I think the commercial value of
the parks is obvious. But they are an important asset for
Canadians for other reasons than the money they bring in
from tourism. Today the visitors to those parks are, by and
large, young families with children. They are the ones who
are coming in vast numbers, and in many instances a high
proportion of their holiday budget is spent on gasoline and
the expenses involved in getting to the parks. Therefore,
when they arrive at a park they want the most economic
kind of accommodation possible. So far the amount of that
kind of accommodation, although it is forthcoming, is

April 10, 1974

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

inadequate. There must be a rapid and widespread
increase in the number of areas where people can park
their cars and put up tents. There are such areas in the
Western provinces, the best example of which, in my
opinion, is to be found in Kootenay National Park, where
there is also provision for the tying up of trailers entering
the park to a sewage disposal system, and to water and
power systems.
Honourable senators, Bill C-6 which is before us today is
an amended version of Bill S-4, which was first introduced
on March 27, 1973. On May 22, 1973, Bill S-4 was referred to
the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and
Commerce, where it was considered on four separate occasions. On July 4, 1973, Bill S-4 was passed as amended. The
amendments made by the Senate emphasized the publication in the Canada Gazette of due notice relating to the
establishment of new national parks. This amendment has
been retained and reinforced in Bill C-6 currently before
us.
I might say that this pressure from the Senate has been
felt, and is recognizable in the amendments made by the
House of Commons. Obviously, the Commons took note of
the representations made here by a number of senators,
including Senator Norrie, with respect to the effect that
expropriation proceedings were having on people remaining in an area which was to be designated a national park.
The amendment made by the House of Commons provides
that no promulgation of a park shall take place without
reference to the House of Commons again. So, I am quite
certain that the representations made by the Senate have
been listened to in the House of Commons. It is evident
that the content of this bill has been subject to intensive
scrutiny and lengthy debate.
*

(1530)

One of the highlights of Bill C-6 is in clause 2, and it is
that lands may be added to existing national parks after
publication of adequate notice and, in the case of significant additions, referral to the Standing Committee on
Indian Affairs and Northern Development of the House of
Commons for hearings. Subsection 6(3) of the National
Parks Act will be amended to delete a specific reference to
the expropriation of Indian lands.
Under clauses 3 and 4 the Governor in Council will be
given the authority to control traffic on highways and to
provide for the voluntary payments of traffic fines in lieu
of appearing before a magistrate. We have found before
that if somebody goes home, having been in breach of
some traffic regulation, he does not want to return simply
to pay a $10 fine.
Under clauses 7 and 9 Forillon and Kejimkujik will
come under the National Parks Act, and have their boundaries defined in the schedule. This will facilitate the
administration and management of these parks.
Clause 10 concerns lands to be set aside as national
parks. You know, there is some criticism of the name we
give the Pacific Rim Park on the west coast of Vancouver
Island where one of the greatest beaches in the world
presents itself to the Pacific waters. People were saying
that the term "Pacific Rim" sounds too commercial, but
they do not know the background of the name. It was
coined by the publisher of the Vancouver Sun in 1920, Bob
Cromie, who made a tour of the Pacific countries. When he

returned he wrote editorials and features in that paper for
a year, and he was the first man to use the term "Pacific
Rim." As I say, there is a historic attachment linking this
park to the Vancouver Sun and Bob Cromie, so I would
leave the name alone. However, Pacific Rim, Pukaskwa,
La Mauricie, Kouchibouguac-I wish somebody here from
New Brunswick would tell me how to pronounce that
properlyHon. Mr. Riley: Kouchibouguac.
Hon. Mr. Laing: Well, you said it a little faster than I
did.
Those parks and Gros Morne can be proclaimed as
national parks by the Governor in Council when legal
descriptions have been finalized. Provision is made for
public hearings to be held on the development plans for
these parks.
Then under clause 11, Kluane, Nahanni and Baffin
Island Parks will receiveHon. Mr. Martin: What was that first name again?
Hon. Mr. Laing: Kluane, in the Yukon Territory. A
beautiful place. You should see it some time.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I remember a lady named Kluane
Miller, perhaps you remember her. She was a famous
Yukon lady.
Hon. Mr. Laing: You are a man of knowledge.
Hon. Mr. Martin: That is well recognized!
Hon. Mr. Laing: These parks will receive the status of
national park reserves managed under the provisions of
the National Parks Act, pending the settlement of any
right, title'or interest of the people of native origin.
My last point is a very important one. I commend the
minister most highly for setting out these areas where, by
this action of intent, he has let it be known that they are
going to be national parks of Canada. I prophesy, so far as
our far North is concerned, that some day the Arctic is
going to be a very attractive place for people who want to
travel. Some people have been everywhere in the world
except the Arctic, and the only Arctic on this continent is
ours. The Americans do not have "an Arctic" in Alaska. I
have said that in those sultry days of July and August you
could sell the idea of going from New York to an icefloe. A
fellow might get pneumonia and die-but he would die
happy. Look at what Linblad is doing in Antarctica. You
find them selling 18-day cruises for $5,000. These are
important things for us to remember, and I commend the
minister for his prescience in respect of the North.
Following settlement of any such right, title or interest,
the Governor in Council may proclaim those areas as
national parks of Canada.
We have a great park in Wood Buffalo National Park,
17,000 square miles, where there are 10,000 or 12,000
bison-the biggest herd in the world. These are remote
areas, but, as time goes on, they will become better known
to Canadians because transportation will be facilitated by
the airplane.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I would like you to say something
about Point Pelee National Park.

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Mr. Laing: It is the most overcrowded national
park we have in Canada-there are 763,000 visitors annually to that little strip of land. It gives great comfort to
many people living close by, and it gives equal comfort to
a tremendous number of Americans out of Detroit who
come over and fish. I do not know the square mileage, but
it is a very small area.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Perhaps we should keep the Americans out of it.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Oh, not at all.
Hon. Mr. Laing: For the first time in our history we will
have national parks in all 10 provinces and both territories. This is worthy of note by all Canadians. I am
particularly pleased to have been involved in the early
negotiations for some of these parks, and that these have
been pursued with vigour by the Honourable Jean
Chrétien.
Honourable senators, Bill C-6 will assure all Canadians
an outstanding parks system and I ask your unanimous
support in its passage.
I want to make just one further remark. The American
parks are fantastically overcrowded. Last year at Yellowstone they had four million visitors. This year they are
preventing cars from operating in the park. Visitors have
to leave their cars at the entry points, and from there they
are shown the park by bus. This is the situation in the
United States, and while it should not be part of our policy
to build parks for Americans, nevertheless we are going to
get a tremendous increase in tourisrn because of our
national parks as time goes on.
Hon. Daniel Riley: Honourable senators, I shall not take
more than a few minutes of your time in discussing this
particular bill, but there are one or two points which I
should like to bring to the attention of those who administer the national parks.
I was discussing with Senator Laing, before he rose to
speak, the necessity of increasing facilities for campers,
trailers, camper-trailers and tents in these national parks.
It recalled to my mind that when I was chairman of the
New Brunswick Electric Power Commission we were
planning for the building of the Mactaquac dam on the
Saint John river, and the necessity of providing recreational facilities along the head pond and the tributaries
entering the head pond. At that time a division of the Ford
Foundation dealing with resources for tomorrow, or
resources for the future, brought in a team of young men
who called themselves recreational engineers. I had never
heard of a recreational engineer before, but I was very
much impressed by their report. They said that within a
very few years, as the work week shortened in the United
States-and it has begun to shorten now-people with
their families would be getting into their cars and station
wagons and, hauling their trailers and camper-trailers
behind them, would be rushing headlong for the Atlantic
to find proper
coast where they would expect
accommodation.
In these national parks, at least as far as New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island are concerned, I understand there is an urgent need for proper facilities to
accommodate the visitors now, and who will be coming in
legions in the next few years. As the work week shortens
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

April 10, 1974

in the United States they will come from the great eastern
cities. Pollution and high temperatures and humidity,
which are so injurious to the health of their families, will
drive them down to the coast of the Atlantic provinces.
* (1540)

In New Brunswick, of course, we would like to have
more facilities than in Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island
and Newfoundland because we would like to arrest those
people in their headlong flight to the sea at either Fundy
National Park or Kouchibouguac National Park, which is
presently being developed.
This one point should be borne in mind by the parks
officials. They should plan, and plan well ahead, for this
terrific influx of tourists looking for camping facilities
and rest areas in the national parks as well as in the
provincial parks.
I have a friend who used to own a motel. During the last
few years he used to sit outside in the late afternoon,
swear softly under his breath and say "There goes another
one of my potential guests down to the national park,"
when a car towing a tent-trailer or a trailer went by.
This is a most important point, and if they have not
already done so the officials responsible for the national
parks should avail themselves of the facilities offered by
this branch of the Ford Foundation. They should bring in
and put to work some of these recreational engineers, at
whom I first balked but for whom I have now a very deep
respect. They gave us enough information and advice to
enable us in New Brunswick at the time of the building of
Mactaquac to build all sorts of rest areas, a fine park at
Mactaquac and other facilities which increase every year,
for the accommodation of these tourists. They must be
accommodated, and it means a great deal to the economy,
at least of the Atlantic provinces.
Before I conclude, I should like to make passing reference to Senator Martin's mention of the name of one of the
national parks. Senator Laing suggested that Senator
Martin should go out and see it. I shall never forget-and
it was brought to my mind when he said this-that I was
at the Dalles Dam on the Columbia River in the fall of
1963. When members of the United States Corps of Engineers were showing us the physical facilities and so on,
and describing the features and how the locks operated,
they told us, "By the way, a man from your country was
down here yesterday swimming in the head pond right
behind the lock." I asked who it was, and they told me his
name was Paul Martin. So you never know where you will
run into him, and I am sure that he will find the occasion
to visit the particular park mentioned by Senator Laing.
Hon. Mr. Martin: What is the name of that park?
Hon. Mr. Riley: I was referring to the Dalles Dam on the
Columbia River.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I will go there on my next holiday.
Hon. Mr. Laing: The temperature of the water was 36
degrees that day.
Hon. Mr. Hicks: Honourable senators, I do not intend to
speak on this legislation. I am in favour of it, and certainly
feel that it is in the interest of the people of Canada that
we continue to develop, expand and improve our national
parks. I welcome the provisions that have been added to

April 10, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

this bill to ensure that we do not ride roughshod over the
interests of persons who own property in an area destined
to become a national park. At the same time, the Government of Canada must adopt fairly firm measures if parks
are to be developed. We ought not to allow one or two
selfish persons to frustrate the national enterprise. I
assume that these measures will work satisfactorily, and I
hope they will.
In rising it was really my intention to ask a question,
which may have been answered in Senator Laing's exposition, but unfortunately I was called out of the chamber
and I am not sure. Will Senator Laing please explain to me
and other honourable senators the significance of clauses 5
and 7 of the bill, which have the effect of deleting the
descriptions of Fort Beauséjour Historic Park and Fort
Anne Historic Park from the schedules to the act? Does
this mean that they are now taken out of this act and, if
so, are they now to be administered as historic parks
under some other legislation?
Hon. Mr. Laing: Honourable senators, I should have
explained that, and I can understand the question being
asked. They were known as national historic parks, and
will now be transferred to the group of national historic
sites. In other words, Fort Beauséjour and Fort Anne will
join Louisbourg and Fort Garry. They are being moved
into the category of historic sites, and will no longer come
under the nomenclature of national historic parks. However, they will still be operated fully by the department,
but in a different manner.
Hon. Mr. Hicks: They are operated by the same department, but under a different statute.
Hon. Mr. Laing: Yes.

second reading of Bill C-6, to amend the National Parks
Act.
Hon. Rhéal Bélisle: Honourable senators, I feel highly
honoured to participate in this debate, and especially to
follow Senator Laing and Senator Riley, who in their
respective distinguished careers have contributed so much
to the development of Canada's national parks, and who
are most qualified to address us on this legislation.
We have heard views from both the East and West
Coasts, and as a representative of northern Ontario I feel I
must present some observations from central Canada on
our national parks. I have no claim to fame on this subject.
We in Sudbury can boast of a topography that is second
only to the moon in character. Perhaps the federal government might consider creating in that region an international moon park for aspiring astronauts and persons
wishing to vacation on other planets.
Canada's national parks are areas of unusual beauty, set
aside to preserve the environment and its wild life in its
natural form. They reflect the rich diversity of Canada's
geography, seen in either the marine shorelines of the
Arctic, Atlantic and Pacific, or the inland waters of the St.
Lawrence, Georgian Bay, Lake Erie and Lake Superior; in
either the glacial parks of the Rockies or the open plains of
the Prairies. Our parks are, therefore, living national
museums of nature that belong to all Canadians.
It is right and proper that we should acknowledge on
behalf of all Canadians the significant progress that has
been made in the last five years. During that period the
number of national parks has increased from 18 to 28, and
the acreage bas doubled. Only four new national pa-ks
were created in the previous 40 years. I know that all
honourable senators would wish to extend congratulations
to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Develop-

27601-20

ment and his predecessors for carrying out this magnificent program of expansion.
National parks are to be found in every province and
territory of Canada. Provinces such as Quebec and
Ontario had not cooperated previously in establishing
national parks, but they are now doing so. Prior to 1970
there were no national parks in Quebec; now there are
two. In Ontario there were three small national parks, all
of which had been established on federally-owned land.
However, in 1971 the Pukaskwa National Park was established in the area west of Wawa on the northern shore of
Lake Superior. Covering an area of 725 square miles in the
wilderness of northern Ontario, this magnificent park bas
a rugged grandeur that should appeal to any eye.
I believe that we can only meet the rapid increase in
demand for national park facilities if the federal government and the provinces show a willingness to cooperate
and consult in a meaningful way with the people who are
involved in the area.
Let us not forget the purpose of the parks and the
objectives of their management as set out in the legislation. The National Parks Act dedicates the parks to the
people of Canada for their "benefit, education and enjoyment," and states that they are to be maintained and used
so as to leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of
future generations. In a recent statement by the minister
before the Indian Affairs and Northern Development
Committee of the House of Commons, I was pleased to
find him say:
-the decentralization of the administration and operations of Parks Canada's activities in the major
regions of the country, the sustained effort to offer all
our services to the visitors in the two official languages, and the participation of the public in the
various stages of the planning process have undoubtedly created an awareness among all Canadians and a
responsibility concerning the goals pursued by a program that responds directly to their aspirations for
the benefit of future generations.
This awareness among Canadians of our national parks
is further expressed in the marked increase in the number
of visits to our parks-10.9 million visitors in 1968, 14
million in 1972-73 and 16.8 million in 1973-74. Thus, visits
last year to the national parks increased by 21 per cent
over the previous year, and by 54.3 per cent over 1968. This
upward trend is significant. It points to the discovery by
the Canadian public of the various elements of their natural and cultural heritage. In a society where working
hours are reduced, mobility is increased and money is
more available, Canadians are now spending a higher
percentage of their annual net income on recreation, leisure and holidays. The national parks are an obvious
tourist attraction. They provide popular forms of recreation such as sightseeing, camping, fishing, hiking, photography and nature study. In 1973-74 approximately $1 million was spent by Canadians on outdoor recreation alone,
and that excludes the money spent on recreational
equipment.
Another significant factor in this upward trend is the
increase in American visitors to Canada. This may be even
more noticeable this year because, as a result of gasoline

SENATE DEBATES

restrictions in the United States, American families may
choose to come to Canada for their vacations.
Thus, the economic repercussions of tourism, the protection and conservation of park resources and facilities, and
the improvement of park services, will have a significant
impact on the future development of national parks in
Canada.
The amendments before us, honourable senators, only
help to regularize the operations of the national parks.
They add a number of new parks to the schedules, and
they include a number of procedural changes, such as
public hearings and public notification with respect to
lands added to, or set aside for, national parks. These
provisions are highly commendable and necessary for the
smooth administration of our national parks, and they
have my wholehearted support.
However, I would like to emphasize one important
matter, and it relates to the future development of national parks. There has been much discussion recently of the
need for greater cooperation between the various levels of
government, and for greater participation of local groups
and citizens in the planning and development of the areas
designated for national parks. Too often new policies are
stated and initiatives taken with little or no consultation
with the parties involved. It is heartening to see, therefore,
that the amendments before us include safeguards for
those parties who might be affected by expropriation, loss
of traditional rights, or other developments.
I would like to remind honourable senators that nearly
ten years ago the federal government issued a consolidated policy statement with regard to its objectives for the
planning and development of our national parks. After
several years of study, this remains the operational blueprint for the national park system. Those objectives, six in
number, are as follows:
*

(2020)

1. National parks are established to preserve for all
time the most outstanding and unique natural features of Canada for the benefit, education and enjoyment of Canadians as part of their natural heritage.
They are dedicated forever to one use-to serve as
sanctuaries of nature for rest, relaxation and enjoyment. No exploitation of resources for any other purpose is permitted. All development must contribute to
public enjoyment and conservation of the parks in a
natural condition.
2. Zoning will be used to guide development and to
preserve park values. Visitor services will be grouped
generally into visitor service centres, a definition that
applies to existing town sites.
3. National parks cannot meet every recreational
need; the most appropriate uses are those involving
enjoyment of nature and activities and experiences
related to the natural scene.
4. The federal government assumes the cost of
administration and protection in the parks and provides basic facilities for public use, such as roads,
trails, campgrounds, picnic areas, nature interpretation and utilities. Other facilities beyond basic
requirements, such as hotels, motels, restaurants, gas

[Hon.

Mr. Bélisle.]

April 22, 1974

stations, stores and other special services, are provided by private enterprise.
5. Park residents and businesses should be in the
same economie position as those operating outside the
national parks and this principle governs the
approach to charges, rentals and fees. The users of
special services such as swimming pools, marinas, golf
courses and fully serviced campgrounds should pay
the operation and maintenance costs of these publicly
operated facilities. In general, permanent and seasonal
residents should be limited to persons providing basic
services to the park community.
6. All decisions affecting public development and
the activities of private enterprise must be governed
by the national interest as expressed by the National
Parks Act.
In conclusion, honourable senators, it would appear that
those six objectives are true and still apply in 1974, and
that the amendments contained in the bill before us do not
alter the original intent of the National Parks Act, but
rather strengthen the establishment, operation and future
development of the national parks system in Canada.
On motion of Senator Flynn, debate adjourned.
CRIMINAL CODE (CONTROL OF WEAPONS AND
FIREARMS)
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING
On the Order:
Resuming the debate on the motion of the Honourable Senator Cameron, seconded by the Honourable
Senator Perrault, for the second reading of the Bill
S-4, intituled: "An Act to amend the Criminal Code
(control of weapons and firearms)". -(Honourable
Senator Davey).
Hon. Donald Carneron: Honourable senators, Senator
Davey is not here and he has sent word that he does not
wish to go on. If no other senators wish to take part, I
shall be glad to ask leave to close the debate.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, does the
Honourable Senator Cameron have leave to proceed in
place of the Honourable Senator Davey?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Carneron: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I wish to
inform the Senate that if the Honourable Senator Cameron speaks now his speech will have the effect of closing
the debate on the motion for second reading of this bill.
Hon. Mr. Carneron: Honourable senators, so far six
senators have participated in this debate, and they have
brought to the attention of the Senate a lot of useful
information.
Senator Molgat, who was the second speaker, said on
April 4 that we should not allow the gun situation in the
United States to determine Canadian attitudes. Although I
am sure that most of us would agree with this, we cannot
help but be influenced greatly in many facets of our lives
by what happens in the United States. There is no use in
closing our eyes to the fact that the attitudes, actions,

April 22, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

publicity and information that flows across the border
from the United States do play an important role in shaping the mores and the actions of the Canadian people,
although it is quite true that Canadians do not have the
same "gun mystique" that the Americans have. The
Americans pride themselves on the fact that it is their
divine right to bear arms, and they are very reluctant to
see anything happen that would curtail this right.
Senator Molgat suggested that the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee might hold hearings in various
parts of Canada to listen to the views of people who are
concerned about the introduction of any kind of gun
control. If the committee did feel it desirable to hold
hearings across the country I would think they would be
useful, and I am quite sure the committee would meet
with an enthusiastic response. I am sure the organization
known as FARO can be relied on to see that there is a good
turnout in every community. The letters "FARO" stand
for "Fire Arms and Responsible Ownership." This is a
vigorous and enthusiastic organization which has been
most active in presenting the viewpoint of its members at
public meetings in either one part of the country or the
other.
The point has been made that many citizens who may
hold strong views on the subject of gun control cannot
afford to come to Ottawa to appear before the Standing
Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I
agree, and I think it is a matter that the committee should
consider in deciding whether public hearings should be
held in places like Hamilton, for example. There was a
good deal of correspondence from Hamilton, and also some
from Montreal, Winnipeg, Edmonton and Vancouver. This
is a decision that would have to be made by the committee.
Senator Choquette, in his intervention the other day,
referred to the cowboys in Calgary going around with
revolvers on their hips. I suggest that he has been seeing
too many Hollywood movies. I have lived out there for 40
years and I have yet to see a cowboy with a gun on his hip.
However, I would like to assure Senator Choquette that if
he would come to Calgary and attend the Stampede we
would be quite prepared to dress him up in a pair of chaps,
spurs and a ten-gallon hat, and we would get him a
revolver to make him f eel good, and put him in the parade.
Hon. Mr. Asselin: Would you provide the gun?
Hon. Mr. Carneron: We would do that. We would see
that the bolt was pulled, however.
Senator Williams raised the question of how we would
handle the matter of the use of guns by native peoples.
This is a very good point, because native peoples and
people in pioneer areas depend on the gun as a means of
supplementing the food on the table. This bill makes no
special provision for people in circumstances of that kind.
The age limit under this bill is 16, and I think that in many
pioneer areas a youngster of 14 years, or even younger, is
able to handle a .22 rifle or a shotgun, and help to get
additional food for the table. Provision must be made for
circumstances of that kind, if not under the bill, then
under regulations. However, this is something that can be
discussed in committee.
Senator Rowe made a very good point when he said that
many of the popular so-called outdoors magazines on our

27601-201

newsstands are vehicles for the gun lobby in the United
States. There is no question that this is true. There are no
gun magazines, as I understand it, in Canada, but there
are certainly lots of them in the United States, of which
the most prominent is probably the National Rifle Association magazine, the American Rifleman. They come to
Canada in large numbers. In fact the slogan of the American Rifle Association has been seen on many a telephone
pole in Western Canada.
*

(2030)

It is hard to obtain proof of this, but the suggestion has
been made that sales of guns in Canada amount to approximately $25 million a year, and sales of ammunition to $27
million a year. This is no small amount of money, honourable senators, and it could well be that some of these
organizations which are concerned with the manufacture
of guns and ammunition are able to help what I call the
gun lobby. I have no wish whatever to reflect unkindly on
the people who are members of FARO, or similar organizations. As a matter of fact, last evening I spent two hours as
the target of a panel of some 150 members of this organization in the CBC studios here in Ottawa, and I can tell you
that it was a pretty lively discussion.
Many times in the course of that discussion the suggestion was made that the purpose of Bill S-4 was to legislate
the legitimate hunter, the legitimate rifle-shooter and the
legitimate gun collector out of existence. But I have
underlined before, and I want to underline again, that the
intent, the purpose and the effect of Bill S-4 in no way
interferes with the rights, the privileges or the recreational pleasure of the legitimate hunter, rifleman, sportsman,
target-shooter, or member of a handgun club. As a matter
of fact, I have gone on record before as saying that I would
encourage these organizations because they, at least, make
a point of training their members in how to handle guns
properly and safely, and this is all to the good. So that
rather than being opposed to the actions of the gun clubs, I
think they are organizations that should be encouraged.
Senator Rowe was quite right when he emphasized that
there is a definite correlation between the availability of
guns and the number of assaults and homicides. This has
been clearly demonstrated time and again. But it would be
naive to think that if there were no guns there would be
no homicides, because there would be. It is also quite clear
that the availability of a gun as a lethal weapon facilitates
murder in a number of instances where, if a gun had not
been present, death might not have resulted-that is to
say, if the individual had to use a knife, a club or an axe
which are, I am told, more messy instruments for the
dispatch of an opponent. The gun is certainly a favourite
in the United States. In that country the revolver, or
handgun, is the weapon most frequently used in murder.
The same results have, at times, been achieved with
machine guns. Fortunately, honourable senators, machine
guns have not been used in Canada, and I hope they never
will be. Under this bill the machine gun is a prohibited
weapon. Yet, I have had letters from people saying that
this provision is an interference with the democratic right
of the citizen to practise with a machine gun in his backyard. I suggest that if a citizen wants to practise with a
machine gun there is a perfectly legitimate way of doing

SENATE DEBATES
so, and that is to join the Canadian Armed Forces which
will provide the ammunition free and the gun too.
Senator Laing mentioned that he was brought up on a
farm. I was too, and I grew up with both rifles and
shotguns which I used for sport and hunting, and I
enjoyed both. I think that rifle associations and rifle clubs
are recreational organizations that should be encouraged.
They find favour with most Canadians because not only
do their activities involve good outdoor exercise, but the
organizations help to train people in the care and proper
use of lethal weapons. Senator Laing also raised the valid
point of the essential role of the gun among native peoples
particularly those in the North and homesteaders opening
up new land. The gun is an essential weapon to the
Indians, the Metis, the Eskimos and to many white settlers
in the new territories along the foothills of Western
Canada, in the North and in the northern parts of Ontario.
The gun has a rightful place in helping people to earn a
living. As Senator Carter rightfully pointed out, the idea
bas been spread abroad that the purpose of this bill is to
deprive the hunter, the sports shooter, the rifleman and
the gun collector of his right to pursue his recreation. I
wish to repeat again that nothing could be further from
the truth.
Now, apropos Senator Molgat's remarks that we should
not let what happens in the United States influence us in
Canada, may I recall the excellent contribution Senator
Davey made during the debate on this subject in the last
session. His remarks are worthwhile repeating. On March
15, 1973, as reported at page 353 of the Debates of the
Senate, he said this:
Whatever it is in the separate histories of Canada
and the United States that has created these distinctions, they are clear and unequivocal. I will mention
just two or three examples dealing only with violence
and robbery. Try to listen to these statistics, if you
will. In 1970 the number of people who died by gunf ire
in the United States was 6,200. In Canada, which has
almost exactly one-tenth the U.S. population and, as I
have noted, relatively far more recent immigrants, the
corresponding figure was 99.
Perhaps particularly interesting are comparisons
between the city of Detroit and the town we generally
consider the most Americanized in Canada ...
Senator Martin's home town of Windsor.
... just five minutes away across the river by bridge
or tunnel.
I am mindful as I read these figures, if I may
digress, that Senator Rowe in his excellent speech on
this debate made a comparison of crime statistics
between Toronto and Detroit, cities of approximately
the same size. As I recall, Senator Rowe, you suggested that Detroit had 20 times as many murders as
Toronto and had 20 times as many handguns.
Well, these are the comparisons, and they are equally interesting, between Detroit and Windsor.
The inhabitants of Detroit, who number rather
more than two million, owned between them in 1970
some 500,000 handguns. The people of Windsor,
whose population is just under 200,000, owned 322
[Hon. Mr. Cameron.]

April 22, 1974

handguns in 1970, a reduction of 86 from the figure
for 1969.
In Detroit's Tenth Precinct alone, which is home
to 250,000 people, 1970 brought 70 murders and 3,500
robberies. Among the 197,000 residents of Windsor
that year there were seven murders and 162
robberies.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Windsor where?
Hon. Mr. Cameron: Windsor, Ontario; Senator Martin's
home town, the benign influence of which makes this
comparison so favourable to Canada.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: He will be elected there some day.
Hon. Mr. Cameron: I have received quite a number of
letters and shall quote from two. The first letter is from
Mr. D. J. Morris of Senator Rowe's country, Conception
Bay in Newfoundland.

e

(2040)

This is what he said:
I would like to make some comments concerning Bill
S-2 which is now before the Senate and which passed
first reading on Feb. 5, 1973. While I do not doubt that
the honourable senator was sincere when he introduced this bill, I believe he was misguided.
He is not the first man to have said that.
My letter is meant to outline some reasons for that
belief. The RCMP estimates that there are 500,000
handguns registered in Canada. If the government
were to prohibit ownership of these guns and was
forced to purchase them from their owners at an
average worth of $50 it would cost $25 million plus
paperwork, etc.
He is very modest, because some people have written to
me and said it would cost $450 million to purchase those
handguns. I have yet to see any suggestion that the government is interested in acquiring all of those guns.
Licensing all firearms (including rifles and shotguns) would require a bureaucracy and an expenditure almost equal to that currently expended on
automobiles. There are 5 million rifles and shotguns in
Canada almost as many guns as cars.
The cost of testing for "competence" of gun owners
would be as economically out of reach as testing for
"competence," in a meaningful way, is for driver
licensing.
Canada's present handgun control laws are among
the most stringent in the world. Handgun owners
must have a permit, and another permit is required to
transport these guns. Despite these laws unregistered
handguns are used in crimes. Strict gun control laws
fail because those who want to use guns for illegal
purposes simply ignore the law. Those who obey the
law, collectors and competitive shooters do not wish to
use their guns for violent purposes, and these are the
only people whom stricter laws would affect.
While I agree that effective measures must be taken
to reduce crimes of violence involving f irearms, I feel
that the most effective measures would be as follows:
1. Tougher penalties for the use of firearms in perpetration of a crime.

April 22, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

2. Strict adherence to these penalties by Canada's
courts and the related legal systems.
3. More effective enforcement of Canada's gun control laws.
It is my sincere hope that you will weigh my arguments carefully, and realize that, we the shooters of
Canada, have a valid reason to be opposed to this bill.
Here is another from a thoughtful gentleman from Lindsay, Ontario, Mr. David Lawrence.
I have read Bill S-2 and would like to comment on
your proposed amendments. I have been a hunter for
approximately ten years and have been pistol shooting
for about six months. As chief range officer of my
pistol club, I am aware of the importance of safety
when handling firearms. In all honesty, I must admit
that until becoming range officer I didn't believe just
how dangerous a handgun or an untrained shooter
could be. Briefly, I believe that measures to train
people in the use of firearms would be much more
effective than legislation which would prohibit them
altogether.
First of all let me explain your bill from my own
point of view-that of a law-abiding hunter and
shooter.
These measures would be tremendously expensive
to institute. The estimates that I have come from a
report called "Preliminary Cost Analysis of Firearms
Control." To the best of my knowledge this is the only
study that has been done on this subject.
That study was done in the United States.
It estimates the cost of setting up a registration program at $25 million and would require at least six
months. My brother, Mr. R. Douglas Lawrence, a systems analyst with the provincial government, confirms this cost but estimates that it would take at
least one year. To administer the program would cost
from $1 to $70 per f irearmI would like to join that fellow who is going to collect $70.
-depending on the restrictions of the actual program.
Very roughly, we are talking about $450 million if we
institute measures similar to the Sullivan Laws of
New York.
One part of the bill that I strongly object to is Par.
82 sec. (c) which would prohibit handguns altogether.
As you may be aware in Canadian history, a registered handgun has never been used in the commission
of a crime by the registered owner.
He does not say anything about the unregistered operator.
This section would discriminate against honest citizens and have no effect on criminals who won't register their handguns no matter what the law says.
Bill S-2 would also prohibit the ownership of fully
automatic firearms. While I don't own any "machine
guns" myself, I do know a few collectors who have
several. From my own experience and from the fact
that "Murder Statistics" doesn't even mention their
use, I don't see the necessity of this measure. At
present, only recognized collectors can obtain a permit
to transport them, and there are no cases of registered
"machine guns" being used in crime.

This non-use of registered guns in crime is not
because of present registration procedures. It results
from the fact that people who register their guns are
decent law-abiding people who treat guns like others
treat stamps or coins. They cause neither harm nor
threat to society.
Now let us stop and see what benefit we would
receive from this expenditure of $450 million. We get a
list of honest law-abiding shooters-that's all. The
only other reference on this subject, "Firearms Control" by Colin Greenwood, confirms this.
Mr. Greenwood is a U.K. superintendent who is quoted by
the anti-gun control people. Mr. Lawrence quotes Superintendent Greenwood as saying:
...

to continue with the process of attempting to deal

with the criminal use of firearms by placing more
restrictions on legitimate users is not likely to achieve
anything . . ." Surely a cost-benefit analysis is in order
before this type of legislation can be considered.
I am sure that retired Superintendent Nicholson of the
RCMP would agree with him. Last night, while sitting
behind me, he said that the bill was a complete waste of
time. So we know where he stands.
Since there are two sides to every story, let me now
explain the situation from the point of view of a
citizen concerned with law and order.
I believe that the problem of rising crime is due to
people, not availability of firearms. If these measures
are passed, the gun abuser is supposedly penalized by
the withdrawal of his possession privileges for ten
years. This is of no value when, either by too light a
sentence or easy parole, he is free to roam the streets
and kill another policeman with a second unregistered
gun. What are required are stiffer minimum sentences, mandatory non-parolable prison terms and
enforcement of capital punishment.
There is one part of your bill with which I do agree.
Thank goodness.
As a range officer I strongly believe in requiring
someone to prove their competence before they obtain
a firearm. I would support measures that would make
membership in a shooting club a condition for obtaining a f irearm of any kind.
That is a very good suggestion.
This membership would include probationary periods
and records of attendance at range sessions. These
local clubs, through their elected executives, could be
responsible to local police departments. What would
result is a group of serious shooters looking after their
sport to ensure its good reputation. This could be donc
with minimal cost and red tape to the government,
and still provide the training and supervision that is
the key to responsible gun handling.
Again let me point out that the problem is people,
not guns. As Mr. Greenwood put it, "But the great
danger lies, not in the ineffectiveness of such measures but in a belief that they will solve the problem.
Whilst this mistaken belief persists, the real problem
will not receive the attention and the action which it
clearly and urgently requires."

SENATE DEBATES

That is a very good letter. It is a thoughtful one, and
typical of many I have received.
As I indicated, last evening I spent two hours as a target
of the organization called FARO, which is very active in
this country. As each person came through the door he was
given a brochure-which is a democratic right in this
country-which read:
WHAT IS FARO?
FARO is a non-profit corporation comprised of concerned Canadians who have united because of a growing conviction that unless all firearms enthusiasts in
Canada organize to counter demands for further restrictive firearms legislation, the shooting sports in all
their facets may soon be legislated out of existence.
This is the kind of irresponsible statement that is being
made. There is no intention of legislating shooting sports
out of existence. The FARO people should know better.
Reading further:
THE AIMS OF FARO
1. To unite all firearms enthusiasts in Canada into
an interested and informed group.
That is a good idea.
2. To advise the membership of legislation pending
at all levels of government which could adversely
affect the legitimate firearms users.
3. To assist all levels of government in designing
effective legislation that will combat crime without
further hindering the shooting sports.
I said to these men, "Look, we are going to hold a public
hearing of the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and
Constitutional Affairs. We would welcome your participation, but come prepared to suggest amendments and
improvements to the present bill." I think they will come.
Reading further:
4. To present the position of the law abiding firearms enthusiast to the government and the general
public.
5. To achieve responsible representation at all levels
of government and recognition of the validity of the
legitimate firearms enthusiasts contributions to and
position in our society.
e

(2050)

6. To achieve realism in legislation reflecting our
contributions to society which specifically outline
benefits for the legitimate firearms enthusiast.
FARO'S CONVICTIONS
We believe that many politicians to-day would
sooner blame the rising crime rate on the availability
of f irearms than face up to the real social and economic causes of crime, such as the failure of our penal
system, the weakening power of our police, the moral
and spiritual breakdown of the fiber of our society
and the general permissive attitudes prevailing
to-day.
It is time governments at all levels pay heed to the
3,000,000 and more active shooters across Canada who
do not wish to see their activities curtailed by many
well-meaning, but ill-informed members of our society
who can not, or will not, appreciate the shooting
[Hon. Mr. Cameron.]

April 22, 1974

sports as one of the most useful and satisfying sports
available to Canadians.
He did not say so, but he implied that a lot of these
"misguided people" are in Parliament. Again, I emphasized to them that there is no intention to legislate the
shooter out of existence.
We believe that any individual engaged in the
shooting sports has a duty to act in a lawful and
RESPONSIBLE manner while engaged in those
activities. The majority of firearms enthusiasts are
law abiding and willing to respect the normal
restraints of law which allow each citizen the
RESPONSIBLE use of firearms.
We know that the criminal does not pay heed to any
firearm restrictions. Criminals can be, and should be,
severely punished by existing laws. Further restricting firearms only succeeds in putting pressure on the
law-abiding f irearms owner.
We believe firearms enthusiasts, whatever their
particular interests, cannot afford to agree to the concept of banning a specific firearm as a practical
method of "crime control". To do so fosters the inevitable acceptance of similar actions being applied to
other f irearms.
I asked what their position was with respect to machine
guns and they said that it is a man's right to have a
machine gun if he wishes.
We urge the government to make distinctions in the
law which clearly recognize the differences between
the criminal and the noncriminal, and between
responsible and irresponsible acts.
My question is: Do we not do that now?
We believe that present day attempts to curtail
shooting activities have one aim in mind: the eventual
elimination of all firearms from the hands of law
abiding citizens.
My answer to that is: not so. The Honourable Bert Lawrence took part in the debate last night and his view was
that we should eliminate all guns because their only purpose is to kill. His opinion was that the sooner we get rid
of all guns, the better. That would be a very difficult task.
In fact, I disagree with Mr. Lawrence in principle, because
I believe there is a legitimate place for rifle shooting and
handgun shooting as a recreational activity. Under proper
circumstances, such sport would be a good thing in which
to participate.
There is an increasing concern across the country arising out of the horrendous statistics respecting murders,
suicides, accidental shootings, assaults and robberies
involving guns. An average of 222 people in Canada,
excluding police and custodial officers, were murdered in
each of the seven years 1961 through 1967. During that
seven-year period the death penalty was in effect in
Canada. The average for the four years 1968 through 1971
increased to 376 murders. In 1971 alone we had 422 murders. So, there has been a tremendous upsurge in the
number of murders since the death penalty was suspended. Whether these two factors are related, I do not know,
but those are the statistics. In the comparable 11-year
period, the number of police and custodial officers mur-

dered was 3.6 annually before the suspension and 4 every
year following the suspension.
In the United States, more people have been killed by
f irearms since 1900 than have died in all the wars from the
American Revolution in 1776 up to and including the war
in Vietnam. Between 1900 and 1966, firearms were used in
280,000 murders, 370,000 suicides and 145,000 accidental
deaths, making a total of 795,000 deaths by firearms. The
total number of deaths in all wars was 550,000.
The statistics in the United States covering 1971 alone
are as follows: murders, 11,300; gun accidents, 2,400; suicides, 10,000; accidental woundings, 20,000; aggravated
assaults, 92,000; robbery at gunpoint, 160,000-a total of
295,700.
In 1972 there were 292 murders in Canada. The murder
rate has been increasing in Canada and the United Kingdom at the rate of 17 to 24 per cent per annum.
No sensible person pretends that stricter gun laws will
eliminate the use of guns by criminals. The criminal element in our society will get guns regardless of the legislation we have to prevent it. However, such legislation will
restrict the availability of guns, thereby making it more
difficult for the criminal element to get them; it will
reduce crimes of passion involving guns; it will enable us
to have more complete records, making it easier to trace
guns used in crimes; it will prevent such people as known
criminals, the insane and the irresponsible from owning
guns legally.
There must be a stiffening of penalties for all criminals.
The mollycoddling of criminals will have to stop. For
example, there was an armed robbery over here at the
armouries within the last few months. Two men, one
armed with a rifle and one with a revolver, were caught by
the guards and charged in the courts. Those individuals
received a nine-month sentence in jail, which means that
they will probably be out in six months at the most. That
is the kind of thing that is weakening our respect for law
and order, and a great many people are getting thoroughly
fed up with it. A sentence of life imprisonment today can
mean as little as seven years. Some of us feel that life
imprisonment should mean lif e imprisonment, or certainly
at least 20 years. We have to provide stiffer penalties for
criminals.
Just to recap, clause 1 of the bill would place machine
guns and shortened guns (sawed-off shotguns), which are
now "restricted weapons", in the category of prohibited
weapons. It would also place rifles and shotguns which are
unrestricted in the category of restricted weapons. As a
result, all weapons will be either prohibited or restricted.
If this bill is passed, all guns will have to be registered,
and I do not think that imposes any great inconvenience
on anybody.
Clause 2 would make all transfers of weapons, whether
commercial or private, subject to authorization. In other
words, to make a transfer would require a permit.
Clause 3 of the bill would make all offences relating to
guns indictable, and consequently eliminate all summary
convictions. Section 92 of the act would become unnecessary due to the new section 87.

*

(2100)

The purpose of clause 4 is to require a permit for all
"restricted weapons," which in fact includes all firearms.
With respect to clause 5, under the present law a judge
may order that a person involved in a crime be prohibited
from possessing any firearm for a maximum period of five
years. This amendment would require the judge to make
such a prohibition order for at least ten years.
Clause 6 adds paragraph (e) to subsection 97(2), and the
purpose of this is to provide that a permit may be granted
to use a rifle or a shotgun for hunting subject to the
granting of a hunting licence. As those who have hunting
licences know, before you can get one you must have
demonstrated competence in the handling of a gun.
The new section 97(2A) (a) makes it mandatory that a
test be passed before any weapons permit is granted. The
test would concern knowledge and handling of weapons,
and the laws pertaining to them. Section 97(2A) (b) sets
out those persons who are prohibited from being granted a
weapons permit.
Honourable senators, that is the gist of the bill. If it
receives second reading, I should move that it be referred
to the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Senator Goldenberg, the chairman of the
committee, is not here tonight, but I think he can be
prepared for fairly lively sessions. There will be a substantial number of witnesses, and I would ask that he give
them enough time to get here, because they will be coming
from various parts of Canada. We must be careful to lean
over backwards in making sure that the people who are
afraid of this legislation have every opportunity to express
their reservations and fears, and to have them allayed as
far as possible.

REGULATIONS AND OTHER STATUTORY
INSTRUMENTS
CONSIDERATION OF SECOND REPORT OF STANDING JOINT
COMMITTEE-DEBATE ADJOURNED

The Senate proceeded to consideration of the second
report of the Standing Joint Committee of the Senate and
House of Commons on Regulations and other Statutory
Instruments which was presented on April 10, 1974.
Hon. Eugene A. Forsey: Honourable senators, the last
time I discussed this matter I came a cropper, I think
probably due to insufficient preparation and taking too
much for granted. I hope that this time I shall not fail in
that particular way, and shall not fall into the rather
different fault of believing, like the heathen, that I should
be heard for my much speaking.
The first thing I want to draw attention to in connection
with this is an unfortunate misprint in the text of the
report as it appears. If honourable senators will look at the
record, they will see that the report says in part:

SENATE DEBATES
Your committee therefore recommends that the
joint chairmen, after the usual consultations, be
authorized to designate a member requesting each
house and the staff to travel to London, England.
The word "requesting" should, of course, be "representing," so that it reads "representing each house." I trust
that misprint will be corrected in the report of today's
proceedings.
As I said, I do not want to go into a long dissertation on
this subject, though some colleagues have suggested to me
that it would be appropriate. However, the hour is getting
on, and I doubt very much whether a long speech by me is
necessary or desirable from any point of view. I merely
wish to emphasize the very great importance of this committee, and in doing so I am not trying to magnify my
office. I was very reluctant to take the co-chairmanship of
the committee, and subsequent events have increased my
reluctance, which came originally from my feeling, which
I still have, that the co-chairman should be a lawyer. I
may remark parenthetically that if the other members of
the committee have decided on reflection that they share
my opinion, I should be most happy at any moment to
make way for anybody else whom the committee may
wish to designate as Senate co-chairman. I do not regard
this as a position which is likely to be very greatly sought
after. I am inclined to think that the holder of it may get
more kicks than ha'pence.
However, I want to emphasize, regardless of who holds
the chairmanship, regardless in fact of who the members
of the committee may be, that this committee is a matter
of very great importance. That is indicated in the first
place by the fact that in 1969 the House of Commons
appointed a committee to go into this whole question. It
presented a monumental report. I have here the mimeographed version, which runs to something like 130 foolscap pages, and a most thorough and admirable report it is,
judging from the somewhat cursory examination I have
given to it. The committee was chaired by one of the most
eminent constitutional lawyers in the other place, Dr.
Mark MacGuigan, the former Dean of Law at the University of Windsor. We seem to be coming round every now
and again this evening to flattering references to the home
town of the honourable Leader of the Government.
Hon. Mr. Martin: That is to be expected.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: This is, of course, purely fortuitous,
and I hasten to assure honourable senators that I am not
engaged in apple polishing.
A second indication of the importance of this matter is
that in the early part of 1970, on the motion of the honourable Leader of the Government, the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs was instructed
to go into this matter, and a prolonged debate took place,
extending from February 12 to May 7 of that year, extending over something like a dozen or more sittings, and with
the participation of 16 members of this house, all of them I
think still members, some very distinguished lawyers and
some very distinguished lay members of this house. In the
first category I should mention the Leader of the Government, the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Hayden,
Senator Croll, Senator Connolly (Ottawa West) and Senator Prowse. Among the non-lawyers-at least to the best
of my belief they are non-lawyers-there were Senator
[Hon. Mr. Forsey.]

April 22, 1974

Grosart, Senator O'Leary, Senator Lamontagne, Senator
Carter and Senator Cameron. I have not given an exhaustive list, for the simple reason that in some instances I am
not quite sure whether the other senators whose names I
have not mentioned are learned in the law or otherwise.
What I wish to indicate is that there was a very elaborate debate and a very prolonged debate, I think an excellent debate, to which people of varying qualifications
contributed, and I think the sum and substance of it was
that this was an important matter, a very important
matter, and perhaps in some ways an almost crucial
matter.
A third indication of the importance of the subject is
that in 1970 Parliament passed an act dealing with it. That
act makes provision for either a standing committee of the
other place, a standing committee of this place or a joint
standing committee to which all regulations and other
statutory instruments shall be referred. It is because of
that provision in the act that the Joint Committee on
Regulations and Other Statutory Instruments has been
created and is now beginning to function with a certain
degree of effectiveness.
a (2110)

I do not think I need labour the intrinsic importance of
this subject matter. One of my early recollections of such
subjects is of the publication of a book by the then Lord
Chief Justice of England, Lord Hewart of Bury, which
bore the attractive and alarming title of The New Despotism. Lord Hewart pointed out, as many other people have
done since, the extraordinary importance of subordinate
legislation, the increasing importance and, of course, the
inevitability of such legislation.
In the complex society in which we live, it is perfectly
impossible for any parliament to pass or even consider all
the details of legislation required to deal with such complexities. More and more the habit has arisen, the practice
bas arisen, of drawing the broad lines of legislation in acts
of parliament and leaving the details to be filled in by
regulations, ministerial orders, orders in council and
statutory instruments of one kind or another. It is absolutely necessary, but it also involves certain dangers to the
liberties of the subject. These have been illustrated over
and over again here and elsewhere. My mind turns to
certain instances in which the courts have set aside regulations under the Immigration Act which in their view
were not authorized by the legislation, and infringed on
the liberty of the individual. My mind turns also to a
celebrated case a year or so ago where, under an order in
council or some other statutory instrument, a civil servant
was compulsorily retired early. He subsequently took the
case to the courts, and won, the courts deciding that the
government had not the authority under the act to pass
the regulation in question.
Well, in the absence of proper measures to prevent it,
there are bound to be cases of this sort and, of course, one
can say, "After all, everybody can get to the courts, don't
worry about it, justice is available to every citizen." This
is true enough, except that there is not absolute economic
equality among citizens, and the process of taking a case
to the courts can be expensive and also very
time-consuming.

SENATE DEBATES

Some of us saw recently that dramatic film on the
Roncarelli case, and to the best of my recollection,
although it was not a matter of subordinate legislation-it
was another matter, in that particular instance-the process of getting the thing through the courts took something like 13 years.
The process of dealing with the infringements of liberty
under the Padlock law of Quebec, of infamous memory,
also took a very long time. My recollection is that it took
well over a dozen years, and perhaps more than that. The
same thing happens about taking cases to the courts where
the citizen finds himself injured or aggrieved by subordinate legislation, orders in council, regulations of one kind
or another, statutory instruments of one kind or another.
There has grown up a widespread belief that it is desirable to prevent as much as possible, rather than to attempt
to cure by judicial proceedings, abuses of power under the
process of subordinate legislation.
Honourable senators, I want to say something now
about the committee itself. The first thing that should be
noticed about it is that it is obviously a non-partisan
committee. Its duties make it such, if it is to carry out
those duties at all adequately. There is the happy factor
also, that the two chairmanships are held by people of
different political parties. I shall not say anything about
your humble servant, honourable senators, but I can say
with truth that one of the happiest things about this
committee is that the chairman from the other place is one
of the most eminent, respected and judicious members of
the Progressive Conservative Party. Everybody who
knows Mr. Fairweather will concur in that description of
him. I think we were extraordinarily fortunate in having,
as the first chairman from the other place, a person of Mr.
Fairweather's temperament, distinction and knowledge.
The proceedings that have taken place in the committee so
far have amply illustrated and proved the fact that it is a
body which looks at this subject in a completely non-partisan way, and attempts to deal with it in that spirit.
I venture to think that the role of the Senate members
in such a committee can be of rather special importance.
When I was a member of the Joint Committee on the
Constitution, I was impressed by the fact that the contributions of senators were really very notable, and I think
this was true of the senators generally-with possibly
some exceptions, to which some of my friends will add a
hearty "Amen", as they think of one particular person!
Anyway, the bulk of the senators on that committee made
very important and valuable contributions to its work.
Their doing so was facilitated by the fact that, as with
most joint committees of the two houses, the Senate membership was rather more stable than the membership f rom
the other place. I do not mean by this any reflection on the
intellectual stability of any individual; I simply mean that
the membership on our side of the thing stayed more
nearly the same, more nearly continuous, than that from
the other place. This is almost inevitable.
I should think that that would also be the case with this
committee. I venture to think also that in spite of some
speeches which are made from time to time in this place
which are not notable for their non-partisanship-and I
have been guilty in this matter myself not too long agoon the whole we do tend to take a rather less partisan view

of affairs than people in the other place, for obvious
reasons. It is possible to exaggerate the degree to which
we are non-partisan, but especially in a committee of this
sort it is likely that we shall, if anything, approach the
matter in an even more objective spirit than our colleagues from the other place.
I want to say one or two things to clear up certain
misunderstandings which seem to exist about the committee and, notably, its staff. I think I was guilty of speaking
rather loosely about the staff, and people may have got the
impression that we were already building up a vast empire
or a vast bureaucracy. This is not the case nor, I may add,
have we any ambitions of that sort. Our staff consists, at
the moment, first, of a clerk of the committee. Obviously,
there must be one. He comes from the Committees Branch
of the other place. I asked him the other day if he would
find it convenient or helpful to have a clerk from our side
and he said he did not think the pressure of work was such
that he needed it, but, of course, if the Senate wished to
provide a clerk from the Senate Committees Branch he
would be very happy. He had no strong views about it one
way or another. I am inclined to think that unless the
clerk's duties become much more onerous than at present
they seem likely to be, it would be unnecessary for us to
trespass upon the time and resources of our own Committees Branch simply to provide a second clerk. But I am
perfectly prepared to consider any opinion to the contrary.
There is also at present an administrative officer of some
sort who, however, I believe will shortly no longer be
available.
So you can see, honourable senators, that we have not
got any vast staff. It consists mainly in fact of the two
highly qualified legal practitioners whom I mentioned
before when I was talking about this.
*

(2120)

There is a proposal embodied in this report to take on
some summer students, students-at-law. This was originally suggested by the principal research officer, Professor
Eglington. He suggested six people. Various members of
the committee, for reasons not altogether clear to me,
seemed to think that that might be too few, and, eventually, the motion provided for not more than twelve. I think
it extremely unlikely that we shall get anything like that
maximum number. I am inclined to think that we do not
need more than the half-dozen originally proposed by the
research officer. I think we should find it very difficult to
get accommodation for more than half a dozen, and at this
time of the year the chances of getting good summer
students available are, I should think, rather small. So
that I do not think there need be any qualms on the part of
any honourable senator about this maximum figure of
twelve which appears in the reportHon. Mr. Choquette: They'll be playing cards all the
time, anyway.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: I don't know. Not being a member of
the legal profession I don't think I am qualified to make
any remark on that. I suspect that Senator Choquette
might well be right, but I am not prepared to contest the
thing in any case.
I might remark in passing that there were some comments from certain senators last time to the effect that it
was probably rather superfluous for us to get these people.

SENATE DEBATES
There was a suggestion, or perhaps I should say, rather, a
question, from Senator McIlraith. He wanted to know:
-why that work was not being done by the Committees Branch of the Senate with the assistance of these
research officers, whose services are available to this
place and the other place at any time and which is
competent assistance.
I wonder if heThat is, I.
-would care to enlighten us as to just what efforts he
made to obtain adequately qualified personnel from
the Committees Branch and if he was unable to obtain
them, whether he raised the matter with the Commissioners of Internal Economy in this placeI think that should be "Committee."
-for
their consideration, or what steps had been
taken. There is a part of our establishment that, it
seems to me, should be capable of providing the information being sought, having obtained it in the normal
course of their work through the mails in the last
number of years and being experts on the subject.
Well, there are a number of things I want to say about
that. One is that I doubt very much whether in the Committees Branch we have any experts on this subject. I
shall explain in a moment why I did not find out about
this beforehand. But even if I had I should have drawn a
blank, because I have since found out by inquiry that
there is nobody in the Committees Branch who is a
lawyer, except the head of the Committees Branch, and I
think it would be presumption on our part, on the part of
any committee, to suppose that it could take on the head of
the Committees Branch for its own purposes on an almost
quasi-permanent basis. Otherwise, there is simply nobody
there with the expert legal knowledge which, in my
humble lay opinion, is necessary to do this kind of work.
In the second place, I doubt very much whether anybody
in the Committees Branch in the normal course of his or
her work has obtained over the years through the mails
any great amount of information on this subject, because
it is not something which the Committees Branch, to the
best of my knowledge, bas been concerned with.
It is possible that Senator McIlraith's surmises on this
point are better founded than mine, but that is what I
should have thought.
I might remark also that Senator Connolly (Ottawa
West) had something to say about this.
Hon. Mr. McIlraith: I wonder if Senator Forsey would
permit a question for the sake of clarification? I take it
that he is not suggesting that I put forward the view that
there were people in the Committees Branch capable of
doing this work. The point I raised, I think he will agree,
was as to why we did not have in the Committees Branch
people who are trained and knowledgeable in this field.
And I suggested that that was the point that should be
looked into.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: I shall be dealing with that in a
moment, if I may, Senator McIlraith.
The second point is that some little time ago the Library
of Parliament, having done a certain amount of work both
for individual members of both houses and for committees,
{Hon. Mr. Forsey.]

April 22, 1974

decided that it might be useful if it were to equip itself to
provide such technical assistance for committees on a
regular basis.
I have here a letter from the Parliamentary Librarian on
this subject, in which he says:
And on February 26, 1970, the Joint Committee on the
Library of Parliament recognized that "In order that
Parliament's research organization be kept intact ...
the Research Branch of the Library should have the
prime responsibility for satisfying parliamentary
research needs whether for a committee or an
individual parliamentarian. The Library should be
called on first. If special assistance is required by the
committees beyond what the Library can supply then
they have the authority to hire extra research assistance"The subject was then taken up with the Speakers of
both houses. The Librarian mentions that he was extremely anxious to see that senators were not treated as secondclass citizens, or the Senate as a second-class part of
Parliament in this matter, and so the matter was taken up
with the Speakers of both bouses and a decision was
arrived at that, in general, in future, the prime responisibility for satisfying parliamentary research needs for committees as well as for individual parliamentarians should
be the responsibility of the Parliamentary Library
Research Branch.
So by the time this committee was getting to work on
getting its assistance-which, I said the last time I discussed this matter, it first tried to do on its own-by the
time it got down to it, the question of where we would get
the assistance, in the first instance at least, had been
largely taken out of our hands. The arrangement had been
made that, normally, this should be sought through the
Research Branch of the Library of Parliament; and,
accordingly, we proceeded in what we thought was the
way that had been agreed to by the Speakers of the two
bouses and, I might add, by the chairmen of all committees
in both bouses. The whole matter had been taken up
thoroughly with them.
Now this decison may or may not have been a wise one.
I am not going to go into that. I think it is too early,
perhaps, to say. But as this was the considered judgment
of the Parliamentary Librarian and of the Research
Branch of the Library of Parliament and of the Speakers
of both houses and of the chairmen of all the committees, I
think it would be very rash on my part to suggest that we
ought to have tried to get round it or have tried some other
game of our own.
I hope that answers Senator McIlraith's point about why
we did not seek either to get help through the Committees
Branch of the Senate or to get the Committees Branch of
the Senate increased in staff; the Parliamentary Research
Branch had just been increased for this precise purpose.
He wondered why we did not try to get the staff of the
Committees Branch of the Senate increased to deal with
this matter, but it would have struck me as a very cumbrous arrangement when the whole thing appeared to
have been decided by higher authorities than the
committee.

April 22, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

Well, I gather that my explanation does not suit Senator
McIlraith. This is the disadvantage of having as a co-chairman of the committee somebody who is not a lawyer; and,
frankly, I wish to mercy somebody else would take the
chairmanship of this committee. I was very reluctant to
take it in the first place, and I should be very glad to get
rid of it in the second and place it in the hands of a
competent lawyer. Anyway, there is the explanation about
that.
0 (2130)

Now, as to this proposed trip to England of the two
research officers and one member from each house, there
was some misunderstanding there also, I think. In the first
place, some honourable senators seemed to get the idea
that it is going to be a very prolonged trip. Well, it isn't.
The proposal was that these people should be in England
for something like three days. With a day or two to get
back and forth, I suppose you might have them away for
f ive days.
In the second place, it was not proposed that the two
co-chairmen should go, it was proposed that two members,
one from each house, designated by the co-chairmen,
should go; and I might add that nearly everybody who
spoke on the subject in the committee took the line that he
couldn't go, or wouldn't go, or didn't want to go. There
seemed to be no desire at all on the part of any individual
to go along with the two research off icers.
The original suggestion of the research officers was
simply that they should go, and nobody else, simply to
deal with their opposite numbers and with the parliamentarians concerned on the other side. The committee
seemed to want to add somebody from each house. I
suppose it was a wise provision, but anyway that is what
it was. So there was no prolonged excursion proposed.
Some question was raised about whether there was any
real necessity for this, or any necessity for it at least at
this time: could it not all be done by studying the reports?
Well, the reports of these committees in the United Kingdom now go back for a great many years, and I don't know
that a prolonged study-and it would have to be a very
prolonged one-of all the reports, would yield as much as a
series of interviews and contacts with the people most
concerned, in the United Kingdom, which would make
available quickly to the research officers, and whatever
parliamentarians accompanied them, the crystallized
wisdom and the experience of the British Committees.
The original idea, as I think I mentioned, was to have
somebody come over from the United Kingdom and talk to
us about it, but after some discussion with the people
there, and discussion, I think, also, between some of the
officials of the other place and their opposite numbers in
Great Britain whom they knew well personally, the considered opinion seemed to be that it would be better for
the two research officers of our committee to go over
there; and then the suggestion was further made that they
should be accompanied by a member from each house.
That was the reason for that. The expense involved, I
understand, was to be provided out of funds available
from the other place. It would not involve the Senate in
any expense, to the best of my understanding. I still think
that this would be a useful exercise on the part of the
research off icers, at least.

It is to my mind, now, somewhat doubtful whether
anything of the sort will come off at all, for some considerable time, because rumours of elections are abroad. It is
quite possible that before anybody can get off on this
thing there won't be any committees to have members go,
and the whole thing will be postponed until a new Parliament has met.
Hon. Mr. Martin: You should not pay much attention to
rumours.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: I do not pay attention to rumours as a
rule, Senator Martin, but the din on this subject-the
noise on it-has begun to make some impression on even
my somewhat sceptical mind. So it is possible that this
trip to England will not come off. Well, I suppose the two
research officers, being employees of the Library of Parliament, might be able to go, even during a time when
there was no Parliament and no committee, and pick up
the information and come back, with much less expense.
The senator and member of the House of Commons who
might otherwise have gone might be saved the trip, and
everybody be saved expense, time and trouble.
I do not know if I have succeeded this time in making
clear why I think this report should now be adopted. I do
not think I have left out anything that seems to me to be
relevant, though I may well have failed to answer some
questions which were in the minds of honourable senators,
or which were put forward last time and which I failed to
take proper note of.
I am very anxious to see this committee succeed. I shall
be glad to do anything I can to help it succeed, but I again
assure all and sundry that I was reluctant to take the
chairmanship of this committee. I did not think I was the
person who should have it, and I should be more than
happy to surrender it to anyone else that the committee
sees fit to name, at any time. The late Charles Evans
Hughes once remarked that no man was fit for high office
who was not prepared to leave it at a moment's notice. I
have never been in a high office. This is not a high office,
it is only a modest office, though I think of some importance; but I am certainly prepared to leave it at any
moment if the committee decides it would prefer to have
somebody else. I think it would be highly desirable to have
somebody who is learned in the law, and not a mere
layman, a mere amateur like myself, dealing with this
matter, which is of great complexity, and perhaps even
beyond the knowledge-the ordinary knowledge-of some
members who are learned in the law but who have not
specialized in this particular branch of it.
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, the reason I
rise now is that I want Senator Forsey to know that there
is wide appreciation, I think, in Parliament and in its two
houses, for the work that this committee has done.
We must not forget the two extraordinary debates that
we had in this house, arising out of a motion that we
should give consideration to the report of the House of
Commons Committee on Statutory Instruments. Senator
Forsey has paid tribute to Dr. MacGuigan, the member of
Parliament for Windsor-Walkerville, for his work on that
committee. It is not necessary for me to repeat my view of
the contribution made by Dr. MacGuigan. It is well that
we should not hesitate to do so, and recall the circumstances of that report. It followed a speech made in this

SENATE DEBATES
house by Senator O'Leary when he complained of the
danger to the liberty of the subject because of the vast
number of regulations which came into being, oftentimes
never examined by Parliament and arising out of authority in the statutes for the promulgation of these many
regulations.
In addition, Senator O'Leary called our attention to the
numbers of orders in council, to the vast number of other
restrictions, as he called them, again on the liberty of the
subject, which exceeded in quantity, oftentimes, the statutes in any one Parliament.
The difference between regulations that are not carefully examined, or not examined at all, and statutes, was that
the latter are examined by the two Houses of Parliament,
and by committees, oftentimes, of these two houses.
It was shortly after Senator O'Leary spoke that the
report on statutory instruments was tabled in both Houses
of Parliament, and it was as a result of that that it was
proposed that action should be taken on this report to
provide for protection against any violation of the liberty
of the subject within the terms that had been envisaged
many years ago by Lord Hewart of Bury in his book, The
New Despotism. It was as a result of the campaign in the
United Kingdom at that time that there came into being
an operation in the United Kingdom somewhat similar, at
least in principle, to the proposals in the report to which
Senator Forsey now asks our consideration. I say to honourable senators that if we recall those two lengthy
debates, in which an extraordinary number of senators on
all sides took part, we will recall that we regarded this
matter as one of the greatest importance. Senator Forsey
need not apologize for seeking to convince us that this is
an important matter, because we all regard it as such. I
think we are all grateful to him for his work on the
preliminary body of the two houses which gave consideration to this matter.

Senator Forsey seemed to me to belittle his own competence. He kept repeating that if there was anyone who
wanted to take his job as Senate co-chairman there would
be nobody more willing that this should be done than
Senator Forsey himself. I want to say for my own part,
honourable senators, that I think Senator Forsey is eminently qualified in every wayHon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Martin: -to assume what is not an easy task,
and which may very well in time prove to be a thankless
task, but, nevertheless, an important one. Oftentimes in
our committees when we examine various statutes, we
complain about the authority given to the Governor in
Council or to a particular minister to make regulations
based upon the statute then being examined. Now we are
given an opportunity-and in fact, honourable senators,
not only are we given an opportunity but we are imposing
upon ourselves the obligation-of examining regulations
passed or promulgated as a result of statutory authority. If
we really want, as I know we do, to protect the liberty of
the Canadian subject, then it is most desirable that we
should have a body designed to examine regulations and
orders in council and the like that do not fall within the
parameters of security. This is the proposition, and Sena{Hon. Mr. Martin.]

April 22, 1974

tor Forsey should feel that there we are not taking exception to it.

He speaks of his competence. Well, honourable senators,
I have just finished reading this past weekend the essays
on Canadian constitutional and other problems which
appear in his book. It has just been published. Anyone
who examines the book will recognize that Senator Forsey
is an eminent student of the Constitution, and is, in my
judgment, eminently qualified to accept the responsibility
which I, for one, feel he can discharge with great ability
and with great results.
The only complaint I have-and it is not a complaint
against Senator Forsey-is that it has taken this length of
time for both bouses to reach a decision to provide the
machinery for joint action, machinery which we in this
Senate urged on Parliament three years ago. The fact that
two co-chairmen, one representing this bouse and supporting the Liberal Party, and the second from the other place,
representing the Progressive Conservative Party, have
been selected, shows the bipartisan quality of this committee. That is exactly what Parliament expects, and it is
what the nation expects. Let no one think that this is a
frivolous matter. It is no frivolous matter. If we examine
the records of this bouse we see that we have regarded this
matter as one of the most important potential functions
that we could and shoula assume.
I am not going to concern myself with the details of this
report in what I want to say this evening. I am rising to
support the general principle which Senator Forsey has
put before us, because I think there should be such an
examination. What we have in mind is well established in
the United Kingdom where in fact this was done many
years ago. As a result, it is always possible in the United
Kingdom for a parliamentary body to say that an examination bas been made of regulations and orders in council-that is to say, orders in council that, having in mind
the interests of the security of the state, may be tabled. It
is important for Parliament to be able to do this, and this
is what the committee has in mind.
Let no one say that this will be easy. Senator Forsey
himself said that he did not think the work would be as
extensive-and here I may have misunderstood him-as
had been suggested. My view is that it will be an onerous
task, a tedious task, a task that will require the care of the
kind of person that Senator Forsey is, a man who likes to
put a semicolon or a dash or a period in the right place and
does not hesitate to spend the time necessary to do so. I
should have thought that Senator O'Leary-and L do not
expect him to do so tonight because I know he has other
things to do-in view of the outstanding speech he made
three years ago in this house, would be among those to rise
and recognize the contribution made in the proposal
before us. I am sure he does, as I am sure he strongly
supports the suggestions that Senator Forsey bas made.
When we debated this matter we gave consideration
to the question of whether we should have a joint committee, or whether there should be a committee of one house
only. I expressed my personal view, and here I was thinking of the work done by Senator Roebuck over the years in
the Divorce Committee. We all know that that work was
done essentially by Senator Aseltine, and later by Senator
Roebuck. It was tedious work, a judicial function that took

April 22, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

hours and days, but work that was discharged by Senator
Roebuck, as it had been by Senator Aseltine before him, in
a way that enabied the Senate to say to both Houses of
Parliament that the judicial function in respect of divorce
was well performed.
However, it was decided by both houses that there
shouid be a joint committee. I should flot be surprised,
however, if in time it shouid be found so arduous, s0
tedious-and, some have said, even s0 boring-that, flot
denying the importance of the process and the effort
involved, it wouid have been better lef t to one house,
namely, the Senate. Why? Because, as Senator Forsey
himseif said, when elections take place-and I do flot
think one is imminent-there is only one part of Parlia-

ment that continues, and that is the Senate. However, the
resolution envisaged action by a joint committee.
This is an important task. Those who are concerned
about what they ailege to be the encroachment by the
Executive on the liberty of the subject are given an opportunity in this proposai to meet that admitted danger. I do
not say that such a situation exists at the present time, but
certainly there is a possibility of it. Therefore, this is the
kind of proposai that deserves examination, and it must be
examined. I, for one, as a senator, applaud what the committee has done. I applaud Senator Forsey for his leadership in the matter, and I hope that he wiii persist in it.
On motion of Senator Grosart, debate adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.

BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING

DOCUMENTS TABLED
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, I beg to table
certain documents required to be tabled by law.
Report of the Cape Breton Development Corporation, including its financial statements and Auditor's
Report, for the year ended December 31, 1973, pursuant to section 33 of the Cape Breton Development
Corporation Act, Chapter C-13, R.S.C., 1970.
Copy of a contract between the Government of
Canada and the Corporation of Labrador City, in the
Province of Newfoundland, for the use or employment
of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, pursuant to
section 20(3) of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
Act, Chapter R-9, R.S.C., 1970 (English text).
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, the Leader of
the Opposition usually has some happy remark to make
when I table documents. I suppose it is because he wants
to tease me. May I explain that the reason I do name
certain documents is that they are documents which do
not have to be tabled by law. The documents which I do
not take the time to name are required to be tabled
pursuant to various statutes.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: What is the use of tabling them if they
do not have to be tabled? If you do not name them no one
will be interested.
Hon. Mr. Martin: That is my point. I always name those
documents which are not required to be tabled pursuant to
a statute.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: But you are not going to arouse any
interest if you do not name them.
Hon. Mr. Croll: He names those that are harmless.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Let me add this, so that the record is
clear, because I do not want the Leader of the Opposition
to pursue this matter further. There is a requirement for
certain reports to be tabled pursuant to section so-and-so
of a statute.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I know that.
Hon. Mr. Martin: These are tabled without being
referred to. The ones that I mention by name are those
that are not required to be tabled. I say this not in answer
to what Senator Flynn has said. This last observation is to
give Senator Croll a correct understanding of the
situation.

The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned
debate on the motion of Senator Laing for the second
reading of Bill C-6, to amend the National Parks Act.
Hon. Jacques Flynn: Honourable senators, Bill C-6 is a
significant improvement over Bill S-4, which had been
introduced in the Senate and which we dealt with and
amended during the last session. It will be recalled that
Bill S-4, among other things, authorized the Cabinet by
proclamation, without recourse to Parliament and without
the benefit of public hearings, to extend the boundaries of
any existing national parks to include land in which the
federal government retained or held title, and to create
new national parks in certain counties of Canada.
I did not agree at all with that approach, and when I
participated in the second reading debate on Bill S-4 on
May 22 of last year, I said this:
Surely, if we are going to extend an existing national park or create a new one, everyone whom this
might concern or who would be affected should be
consulted.
If people are going to be displaced, they should have
a say. If people are going to lose their jobs, they
should have a say. If the economy of a region is to be
adversely affected-and this would be the case, for
instance, if the land which is to be acquired by the
government for creating a new park or enlarging an
existing one could be better used for economic development because of the promising ntatural resources
it holds-then the people affected should certainly be
consulted. The people of the area are in the best
position to decide whether the extension of an existing park or the creation of a new one would create
more hardship than it is worth, more hardship to the
people of the area than the pleasure it may bring to
some sectors of the population.
The leaders in business, labour and politics from the
area in question should be assured the possibility of
expressing their views in public. It is this lack of
assurance that worries me. I would like to see it
written into the bill.
Consultation with persons resident in areas about to
be appropriated to a national park should be a
requirement.
At the committee stage on Bill S-4 last year we were
successful in having the bill amended. With great reluctance the government agreed to provide some notice of its
intention to proclaim a new park or the extension of an
existing one. The notice it agreed to was one to appear in
the Canada Gazette for a period of 90 days preceding
proclamation. That was all we were able to squeeze out of

April 23, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

the government at that time but it was better than nothing
and so we accepted it.
But in fact, this was not enough and those of us who
agitated for more stand vindicated by the bill presently
before us. Bill S-4 as amended was still not enough
because it did not ensure that those whose lives were most
intimately affected by the government's plans would be
properly consulted.
The burden was upon them to spot the notice in the
Canada Gazette. As most senators are probably aware, the
Canada Gazette is not as widely and certainly not as avidly
read as Playboy magazine. The burden was upon them to
obtain detailed information from the proper civil servants.
I am sure honourable senators will agree that that is a
thankless, frustrating and time-consuming task. The
burden was upon them to organize public meetings to
discuss how they felt about the government's intentions
with regard to their own geographic area. The burden was
upon them to agree on a credible alternative if they objected to what the government had in its collective mind and
to prepare documents for presentation to the Minister of
Indian Affairs and Northern Development who at that
time was the minister in charge of national parks. Finally,
the burden was upon them to try to have the necessary
political pressure brought to bear in order that their case
might be heard by the minister, that they might be given
the opportunity to meet with him personally to air their
grievances.
I felt that all this was terribly unfair. It seemed to me
then, and it still seems to me now, that if the government
is thinking of doing something that can drastically affect
the lives of a group of people, it should consult that group
beforehand. By "consultation" I mean that the government should go out of its way to enter into communication
with those who might be affected to f ind out how they feel
about the proposal.
*

(1410)

In other words, I felt, and still do, that the government
should take the initiative; the government should arrange
public meetings, in the geographical area that would be
affected, to give these people a hearing; the government
should go to the people with its plans and not wait for, or
expect, the people to come to the government with grievances. That, in my opinion, would be real participatory
democracy.
Unfortunately, the amendment we have before us does
not ensure public hearings in the geographical area affected, although, I suppose, the House of Commons Standing
Committee on Indian Affairs and Northern Development
could decide to travel. But there is no guarantee of thatand that is the guarantee I should like to have seen
written into the amendment.
The amendment, as repeated in clauses 2, 10 and 11 of
Bill C-6, does several things. First, it ensures adequate
dissemination of information concerning the government's
intentions to proclaim. Not only will such intentions be
published in the Canada Gazette for 90 days, but, if the
area involved is significant, they will be published in a
newspaper or alternative medium serving the area in
which the lands are situated. Furthermore, the intention
to proclaim will be published in two major daily newspapers in each of the five regions of Canada at least once a

week for a period of four consecutive weeks in both
official languages, and in any other language that in the
opinion of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern
Development is appropriate.
Second, this amendment provides that, upon being published in the Canada Gazette, the notice of intention to
proclaim will be tabled in the House of Commons and be
referred automatically to the Standing Committee on
Indian Affairs and Northern Development. This will
ensure that the political representatives of the people are
made aware of what is going on.
Third, the amendment provides for the Commons committee to hear witnesses, to consider relevant evidence
and to report, either approving or disapproving the proposed proclamation. This ensures that the people of the
area concerned will be given a political forum, and that
the judgment of those who take a particular interest in
matters of this type will be brought to bear in the matter.
But the burden is still on the people from the geographical area concerned to arrange meetings in their area in
order to discuss among themselves the government's
intentions; and it remains their problem to choose their
representatives and to finance their trip to Ottawa so that
they can appear before the committee to explain their
grievances in the event they consider the government's
plan unacceptable.
Finally, the amendment provides that the Standing
Committee on Indian Affairs and Northern Development
will report to the Commons and that its report will be
voted on by the federal representatives of all the people of
Canada. And if the Commons concurs in a committee
report to "can" the proposed proclamation, then that proclamation will not be issued.
This gives the final decision to the House of Commons
rather than leaving it to Cabinet, which is certainly an
improvement as well as a protection against authoritarian
and arbitrary rule.
But giving the final decision to the House of Commons
does not show any great respect for Parliament as a whole.
Parliament is made up of two houses, and I, for one,
consider deficient an amendment which completely overlooks the possibility of the Senate's playing any role in
decisions of this type.
Consequently, I think we should give serious consideration to amending this bill when it is sent to committee. In
the interest of maintaining equivalent status between
both Houses of Parliament, some effort should be made to
ensure that we have the right of review over decisions
made by the other place as to whether or not the recommendations of their standing committee should be concurred in.
I would suggest that in the event the Commons should
support their committee's recommendation to refuse the
government leave to proceed with its proclamation, we in
this chamber need not go into the matter. Should, however, the Commons support their committee's recommendation to allow the government to go ahead with its
proclamation, then the matter should be turned over to
this chamber for further investigation and approval.
There has been a tendency in recent years for the other
place to arrogate to itself a certain superiority of status.

SENATE DEBATES
This is just another example of that reprehensible
behaviour.
I will grant you that our prime concern should be the
review of legislation, and I will grant you that what is
involved here is an attempt to govern by order in council
and not by legislation. But where a process is set up to
place certain parliamentary restrictions on the power of
the administration to govern by fiat, then the Senate
certainly should play a very definite role.
We also are here to protect the Canadian people from
unwarranted interference in their lives by government.
That is part of our responsibility, and I do not think we
would be doing what the Canadian people have a right to
expect of us if we allowed ourselves to be excluded from
the process of control over and protection against government-by-decree provided in this amendment.
The bill is an improvement over the last, but the amendment it makes is still very seriously deficient and will
have to be corrected by this chamber.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

REGULATIONS AND OTHER STATUTORY
INSTRUMENTS
SECOND REPORT OF STANDING JOINT COMMITTEE ADOPTED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned
debate on the motion of Senator Forsey for the adoption of
the second report of the Standing Joint Committee of the
Senate and House of Commons on Regulations and other
Statutory Instruments.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators, I rise to
speak at this time because I believe it may be the disposition of the Senate to approve the motion for adoption of
the report of this committee, as there are a number of
matters in the report which may require fairly immediate
action if they are to be effective.
I agree entirely with everything that has been said of
the importance of the work of this committee on statutory

instruments and other subordinate legislation. I agree also
with everything that Senator Forsey has said about the
great contribution that the senators on this joint committee can make. Senator Forsey seemed to be somewhat
concerned with the fact that as co-chairman he was not a
lawyer. Among the many reasons for which I would
approve the role of Senator Forsey as co-chairman is the
fact that he is not a lawyer! It so happens that most of
these regulations, and most of the subordinate legislation,
are written by lawyers for lawyers, and that is about half
the trouble that I find with most of these regulations. I am
delighted, therefore, that one of the co-chairmen is a
learned layman who will bring an approach to these problems that is somewhat different from that of those who are
trained and trappedAn Hon. Senator: Explain.
[Hon.Mr. Flynn.]

April 23, 1974

Hon. Mr. Grosart: I said, "trained and trapped", within
the confines of juridical thinking. However, I am somewhat disappointed that it has taken so long for the committee to get under way. Its appointment goes back to
1971, and we are all aware of the problems that have arisen
in the meantime, particularly the intervention of an election, and the other contingencies that have made it difficult for the committee to get its work done. However, I
would urge the committee to get on with the job because it
is of the utmost importance that we get something rather
more definitive than the two reports we have had which
are really nothing more than housekeeping reports.
* (1420)

I see this as a matter of the greatest importance because
these problems which are created by subordinate legislation are growing and getting bigger all the time because
those who write these regulations are getting braver and
bolder. The longer we let them get away with the things
they are getting away with the greater will be the problems they will create. To give an example, honourable
senators, I think one of the most essential things to be
recommended by this committee is that we dispense forever with that phrase in the bills that come before us now
that "the minister may make such regulations which in his
opinion are necessary to implement the bill."
Hon. Mr. Martin: Notwithstanding the foregoing!
Hon. Mr. Grosart: There is seldom any "notwithstanding". It is a clear case of saying that if the minister in his
opinion thinks that any kind of regulation is necessary,
then that is the end of it. If I read it correctly, this bars
anybody affected by the legislation from going to the
courts; it bars anybody from saying that the minister bas
gone completely outside his authority, because the wording is "any regulation that in the opinion of the minister."
Therefore, all the minister bas to plead in court is that "it
was my opinion-" it doesn't matter how f ar out it may be.
That is what the bills say now, and all that is necessary to
correct that situation is to simplify it by saying that "the
minister may make such regulations as are necessary to
implement the bill." That is all. Then it is open to any
aggrieved person to go to court and say that these regulations were not necessary to implement the bill and therefore they are not in accordance with the determination of
this matter made by the Parliament of Canada.
The second suggestion that would clear up many of the
problems is if we were to have the regulations appended to
the bills when we get them. I have heard it said that this
cannot be done, that the public servants are not ready
with the regulations. It has even been asked: How can
they make the regulations if they don't have the act before
them? This is nonsense. Obviously in drawing up the
provisions of their legislation and the regulations, the
public servants know what the regulations, certainly the
initial regulations, are going to be by the time they have
completed that process. If they don't, then surely there is
something wrong with their thinking, because the bill
itself may be only part of the legislation- that is intended
to deal with a particular situation. So I think that we
should insist-and I hope that the committee will recommend this-that these public servants go to work and
draft the original regulations and append them to the bill.
I am not suggesting that they should form part of the bill,

April 23, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

but they should be appended to the bill because more often
than not the regulations determine the parameters of the
effect and force of the bill particularly as it concerns the
liberty of the citizen. I would hope that the committee will
not take the attitude that all it is to be concerned with is
the ex post facto examination of regulations.
In the discussions which have taken place so far I
noticed a tendency to approach the subject in that way.
They suggest that it will be enough, if and when these
regulations are promulgated, that a joint committee, probably assisted by a commissioner, will examine the regulations and ask, "Should these regulations have been
promulgated?"
I would hope that the committee will consider looking at
the other end and laying down some rules, such as I have
indicated, governing the promulgation of regulations.
Let us not wait until the damage is done. We should say
to the government, "Here are some guidelines. These are
the kind of regulations that will fit in with the general
concept of parliamentary control, of what is called 'subordinate legislation.'
In my opinion, some of the trouble in the past has been
created by the use of such terms as "subordinate legislation" and "administrative law," et cetera. I know that "the
law" is a phrase that is very widely used, not only in a
jurisprudence sense but in other disciplines. On the other
hand, a distinction should be made, at least in the minds of
people concerned, between law and rules, because, in the
parliamentary sense at least, legislation is tied very closely to the concept of a legislature, and to describe some of
this co-called "subordinate legislation" as legislation only
confuses the issue.
We should make a clear distinction between law in the
sense of a direct emanation of a legislative body and rules
that are promulgated by non-legislators under the authority of the legislation, of course, but not as legislation in
that restricted sense.
It was mentioned that there is no Senate clerk attached
to this committee. It is my view that there should be, if for
no other reason than to have a record maintained in the
Senate. In my opinion, it is a bad principle to allow the
running of one of these joint committees to be in the
hands of a clerk of the other place. I have had some
experience and I know that the tendency is to run it in the
interests of the other place. One cannot object to that, but
I believe we should have a Senate clerk sitting there,
ready to report to us and taking responsibility through us
for the administrative arrangements in connection with
any joint committee.
Honourable senators, that is all I have to say on the
report itself, but I should like to draw attention to the fact
that at about the same time as this matter was referred to
the joint committee, the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs referred a very similar subject to the Canadian Consumer Council. The report of that council has just
been issued. It is entitled "Report on The Consumer Interest in Regulatory Boards and Agencies." I commend the
council for getting this excellent report in the hands of the
minister and Parliament. I would hope that the joint
committee would go beyond merely looking at these regulations and would look at the way they are administered,

as this group has done. It has had a number of very
thoroughgoing studies made, separate studies, of the operations of various regulatory boards. These are the boards
that are operating under this subordinate legislation.
Their report is frightening. In the work of these bodies
they are dealing, of course, only with the interests of the
consumer; but we are all consumers, so they are really
dealing with the interests of all of us. At page 32 of the
report, for example, they say:

e

(1430)

It is a mistake to believe that decisions concerning
the planning and allocation of resources made by
regulatory agencies are value-free and based solely on
objective evidence and technical expertise. The fact is
that regulatory agencies' decisions are heavily weighted with value judgments and decisions regarding
social priorities.
That is where these regulations end up. With that kind of
implementation, surely this committee has a big job in
front of it.
At page 34 of the report they say:
The first step in reform is the revision of the terms
of reference of all regulatory agenciesI commend that as a suggestion to the committee. The
council points out, for example, that even as affluent a
body as the Hotel Association of Canada-which was
presenting a brief in respect of Bell Telephone rates bef ore
the Canadian Transport Commission-had to withdraw its
presentation because it found it too expensive. So, if such
a body as the Hotel Association of Canada could not afford
to carry on with a presentation before the Canadian
Transport Commission, what chance does the individual
have?
Hon. Mr. Greene: They are selling their beer too
cheaply.
Hon. Mr. Grossart: I do not think they are. The price of
beer is getting a little out of hand, as far as I am concerned. Perhaps I am a little out of date with the inflationary trend in the price of beer, because it is only since I had
a certain operation removing an ulcer that I have been
allowed to drink beer. There was a long period of time
when I could not drink it, and I notice that the cost has
gone away up.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It seemed long.
Hon. Mr. Martin: You should try ale.
Hon. Mr. Molson: That was spoken like an expert.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I am waiting in case there is some
further comment from the Chairman of the Rules
Committee.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Why; to quote the rules? That is not the
chairmanship I would have chosen.
Hon. Mr. Molson: Order!
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Well, I am quite sure that the distinguished Chairman of the Rules Committee, Senator
Molson, has views on this, but I doubt if he wishes to
express them at this time.
Honourable senators, that is all I have to say. I hope the
Senate will expedite the adoption of the report, because I

SENATE DEBATES
think it is of the utmost importance that this committee
get on with its job.
Hon. Mr. Carneron: Honourable senators, I would just
intervene briefly to say that I thoroughly support Senator
Grosart's statement with respect to the administration of
acts by regulations. I have had a good deal of experience
with this, particularly with the National Parks Act. Very
often the regulations under that act have little relationship to the intent of the act itself.
I think more injustices are committed against the people
of Canada under regulations than in almost any other
way. I think Senator Grosart might have gone a little
further and suggested that somewhere in this program of
administering acts, provision be made for a national
ombudsman to examine all regulations under which acts
are carried out in Canada.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: May I thank Senator Cameron for
suggesting that I might have gone a little further. That is
the first time in the 11 years I have been a member of the
Senate that anyone has suggested that I make a longer
speech than I made.

April 23, 1974

Hon. Mr. Flynn: It goes both ways.

CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS FINANCING AND
GUARANTEE BILL, 1973
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Maurice Bourget: Honourable senators, I have the
honour to present a report from the Standing Senate
Committee on Transport and Communications.

The report was read by the Clerk Assistant, as follows:
The Standing Senate Committee on Transport and
Communications to which was referred Bill C-5,
intituled: "An Act to authorize the provision of
moneys to meet certain capital expenditures of the
Canadian National Railways System and Air Canada
for the period from the lst day of January, 1973, to the
30th day of June, 1974, and to authorize the guarantee
by Her Majesty of certain securities to be issued by
the Canadian National Railway Company and certain
debentures to be issued by Air Canada", has, in
obedience to the order of reference of April 9, 1974,
examined the said bill and now reports the same
without amendment.
The committee is convinced that the Canadian
National Railways Financing and Guarantee Acts
should be revised as indicated by the evidence before
the committee in order to correct certain inherent
anomalies and particularly to present the authorizations required in a form that will be more realistic and
that it should be up-dated to facilitate its consideration by Parliament early in the year for which the
authorizations are sought; and
That it should be authorized by the Senate to undertake a study for the purpose of devising ways and
means whereby such legislation may be introduced in
a more expeditious and satisfactory manner in the
future.
Respectfully submitted,
Maurice Bourget,
Deputy Chairman.
Hon. Mr. Bourget: Honourable senators, with leave I
should like to say a word or two of explanation about the
suggestion that has been added to our report.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, is that
agreed?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, I would like to
raise merely a question of order. If my understanding of
the rules is correct, when a committee reports a bill without any amendment, there is no motion to adopt.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Mais demain.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: With leave.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: If the motion is to adopt the report, I
think the motion should be put. I would like to hear
Senator Bourget on this report, after which I would like to
make a f ew comments.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Demain.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Right now. I have no objection to
proceeding with this matter right now.
Hon. Mr. Bourget: Honourable senators, the reasonHon. Mr. Flynn: Is the honourable senator moving the
adoption of the report now?
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, there are
no amendments in the report, and rule 78(4) reads:
When a committee reports a bill without amendment, such report shall stand adopted without any
motionAnd the senator in charge of the bill may move third
reading. I understand that Senator Bourget is just asking
the house for permission to make a f ew comments.
Sorne Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Bourget: That is exactly what I am asking.
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: Honourable senators, on a point
of order, I should like our procedure to be clarified by
Madam Speaker.
Late in the proceedings yesterday I raised what I considered to be an almost momentous issue. Due to the
difficulties with our mails at the present time, I received
only yesterday the last issue of the Financial Post, which
normally is delivered in Ottawa on Thursdays. That issue
referred to a possible purchase by Air Canada of an interest in an aircraft manufacturing concern. Is an opportunity going to be provided when one or more of us can
express some warning about the dangers of this
suggestion?
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, if there is
any further debate, I should think it would take place on
third reading of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: May I be allowed, Your Honour, to
point out that we are not trying to disrupt the proceedings
of the house. This is one case where our rules appear to be
deficient.
When we refer a bill to committee without intending to
amend it, but simply to consider problems relating to the
bill, then, when the report is made and the bill is reported
without amendment, we have no opportunity here to discuss the real problem that faced the committee or to
discuss the issues raised in committee. The Senate is not
made aware of what went on nor is it given much of an
idea as to why the committee reached the conclusions it
did. For those reasons, I feel it would be in order now to

SENATE DEBATES
allow Senator Bourget to comment extensively on what
took place in committee yesterday.
At the same time, the chairman of the rules committee
should look into this problem of providing for a debate on
a report which really deals with the substance of the work
of a committee rather than being simply the report of a
conclusion. When a bill is reported without amendment,
that, in most instances, is certainly not very enlightening.
Hon. Mr. Molson: If I might just comment on that,
honourable senators, I think the rules are quite adequate
the way they stand now. There is nothing to prevent any
senator from asking questions. It is laid down in our rules
that a senator can ask a question of the leader of the house
or of the chairman of a committee, and any information
required can be obtained in that way.
It is true that the rule does state that the report will be
received without debate, but it certainly does not preclude
either the chamber giving consent to the chairman to
make a few comments on the matter or any senator from
asking a question in that connection.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I think Senator Molson has just proved
my point: There is nothing in the rules which would allow
a senator to do that unless he had leave of the Senate, and
it takes only one member of this chamber to refuse leave.
Hon. Mr. Martin: That will not happen today, because
we are all in a good mood.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Aren't we always?
Hon. Mr. Bourget: That is why I did ask for leave to
give a few words of explanation.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: You have leave.

honourable

Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Bourget: Thank you very much. I just want to
say one or two words for the benefit of senators who were
not at the committee meeting yesterday. During our study
it was suggested that having experienced the presentation
of that kind of bill there should be some improvement, and
Senator Grosart was one of those who suggested that our
committee should be authorized by the Senate to make
further studies so as to improve the presentation of such a
bill.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Yes.
[Translation]
Hon. Mr. Asselin: Honourable senators, I think that on
that point it is urgent, as was suggested by the chairman
of the committee, that further studies be made by the
Senate committee[English]
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I believe
we only gave permission to Senator Bourget to speak at
this time.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I think, Your Honour, that, if we have
given permission to one, that permission should extend to
everyone.
[Hon. Mr. Flynn.]

April 24, 1974

Hon. Mr. Martin: Yes, Your Honour, I think that would
be the understanding and wish of all of the bouse.
Hon. Mr. Asselin: Do I have the permission of the
Senate?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
[Translation]
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. Asselin: Honourable senators, as Senator
Bourget said, the formula we now have before us with
respect to the presentation of this bill is entirely outdated.
I do not think that reasonable people such as senators
can any longer accept from the CNR or Air Canada that
formula of presentation of this bill. This was explained
quite clearly in committee yesterday, as Senator Bourget
pointed out. The presentation is so complicated that one is
led astray in certain studies of the financial reports of the
companies. Furthermore, Senator Haig pointed out to me
this morning that the financial report of the CNR shows
an operating deficit. But if the old debt-the dead debt-of
the CNR were written off by the government the CNR
would show an operating profit instead of a deficit. However, I think those are shortcomings we can see in this bill
which should be dealt with by our committee who will be
making recommendations to the other place to have a
more acceptable and understandable formula which could
I think better inform the public on the operation of those
two crown companies.
That is why as a member of the Opposition I say that we
agree with the recommendations of the chairman of the
committee that we must find another formula. Furthermore, I say on behalf of the Opposition that we will
strongly object from now on to such a bill being put
forward. We from the official Opposition reserve on that
point the right to discuss such bills in the very terms of
the presentation up to now.
I therefore think that it is the responsibility of members
of the government to convince the Minister of Finance and
his cabinet colleagues of the need to find another formula,
to undertake other studies which would give us a new
presentation for this bill.
In concluding, I would also like to say that the Opposition reserves the right to oppose the introduction of this
bill if it is similarly drafted in future sessions.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, I should like
to make a short comment on what Senator Asselin bas just
said.
I am not quite ready to go as far as he did in his
evaluation of the presentation of the bill as it now stands
and is being considered during this session. This has been
the formula for several years, and even though the bill is
not all bad, it should be improved since even the best of
things need to be improved and up-dated.
I therefore support the comments of Senator Asselin and
those made yesterday by Senator Grosart who also made
such suggestions which are somewhat different from those
made by the Canadian National Railways chairman himself, who suggested that the Canadian National Railways
bill be amended in such a way that it would not even be
necessary to introduce such bills in the future.

SENATE DEBATES

April 24, 1974

Moreover, we have had the opposition of Senator Benidickson who said that it might be difficult to have the
same parliamentary control if this system were adopted. I
have myself suggested that we keep the parliamentary
control by allowing the Minister of Finance to approve the
loans to the Canadian National Railways or Air Canada by
an item for this purpose in the main or supplementary
estimates, as is the case for the other government agencies
and for other authorizations to borrow or guarantee loans.
This is another formula. I believe that all these formulas
should be studied by the committee. I believe that
improvements are required, though I may not be quite as
pessimistic as Senator Asselin in my evaluation of the bill
in its present form.

that he is in
explanation.

*

Hon. Mr. Martin: May I be permitted to ask Senator
Argue if he is aware that this morning the head of the
National Farmers' Union praised the Senate Agriculture
Committee as being the only forum made available to it
for the consideration of the brief that it presented yesterday. In making that observation over the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation network from one end of Canada to
the other, the president said that not only was the Senate
a useful body, but that Senator Argue was a very useful
senator.

(1410)

[English]
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, I merely want to
add this: If a bill is reported without amendment, and if
that is really the only thing that the committee wants to
say, possibly we need not change the rules. But if, as in the
present case, there is something added to the report, then
there should be an appropriate debate on the report itself.
This debate would be something entirely different from
the debate that should take place on third reading of the
bill. The reason is that on third reading of the bill we are
coming back to the text of the bill itself, and we don't
necessarily consider it in the light of the recommendation
which was made in the committee's report, which in this
instance would be that we should look into some ways of
avoiding a repetition of the kind of approval that is
required of the Senate at this time.
Hon. Mr. Bourget: As a matter of fact, I just gave a few
words of explanation because it will be necessary eventually to introduce a motion so as to refer the subject matter
to the committee. At that time all honourable senators will
have an opportunity to discuss the merit of the question.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: As long as it is proposed.
Hon. Mr. Bourget: As long as it is proposed.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: And it will be.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this bill be read a third time?
On motion of Senator Martin, bill placed on the Orders
of the Day for third reading at the next sitting.
AGRICULTURE
COMMITTEE AUTHORIZED TO MEET DURING SITTING OF THE
SENATE
Hon. Leopold Langlois, with leave of the Senate and

notwithstanding rule 45(1) (a), moved:
That the Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture have power to sit while the Senate is sitting
today, and that rule 76(4) be suspended in relation
thereto.
Hon. Mr. Asselin: Explain.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Since this motion was presented at
the request of Senator Argue, the Chairman of the Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture, I would suggest

a better position

than I to offer an

Hon. Mr. Argue: Honourable senators, the Standing
Senate Committee on Agriculture has before it Bill S-2, to
amend the Animal Contagious Diseases Act. There is a
great deal of interest in this legislation, and we have had
requests from many organizations to attend and be heard.
We arranged for the committee to meet this afternoon, in
the hope that this motion would meet with the approval of
the Senate. In attendance will be representatives from the
Canadian Cattlemen's Association, the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, the CNR, the CPR, Brent Manufacturing Limited, and so on. We have a long list of witnesses
and we hope we will be able to proceed.

Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Shame, shame. I cannot let that go.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: It is too much for you, is it?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I don't doubt that the Senate Committee on Agriculture is doing good work, but this applies to
all Senate committees. I agree that the Canadian people
should be more appreciative of what is going on in this
legislative and investigatory body. But to say that Senator
Argue is the only one deserving of praise is entirely
wrong. I resent it when the Leader of the Government
pours praise on Senator Argue at this time while ignoring
others like Senator Hayden, Senator Bourget and various
other chairmen, including Senator Haig on this side of the
house, whose committees are busy doing highly praiseworthy work. They all deserve praise, but I don't think
that Senator Argue deserves more praise today than anybody else.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I just want to say to the Leader of the
Opposition, and in defence of what he objects to, that
Senator Hayden has informed me that he could not possibly have attended the Agriculture Committee meeting
yesterday.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: You were away also, despite the fact
that you were the official agriculture critic of the Liberal
Party in the other place for several years.
Motion agreed to.
THE CANADIAN ECONOMY
ILLEGAL STRIKES-QUESTION
Hon. Mr. Carneron: I should like to ask a question of
the Leader of the Government, of which notice was given.
In view of the fact that the Canadian economy is
being badly disrupted by a number of illegal strikes,

SENATE DEBATES
will the government take the accepted procedures in
dealing with lawbreakers and enforce the full penalty
of the law?
If we do not take this action, the credibility of the
government will gradually be destroyed.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, Senator Cameron gave me notice this morning of his intention to ask this
question.
In reply, I wish to say that following consultation with
the Honourable André Ouellet, the minister concerned-in
my view he bas done a very outstanding job in this
matter-the government is following accepted procedures.
This will be evident, I hope, later today or certainly not
later than by the end of this week, I believe.
May I add that the government has recognized that the
framework governing labour relations in the Public Service has some weaknesses. Approximately a year ago it
was arranged to relieve Dr. Finkleman, Chairman of the
Public Service Staff Relations Board, of his day-to-day
duties in order that he might formulate suggested
improvements to the act. Dr. Finkleman bas tabled his
analysis and a summary, and they will shortly be tabled,
together with his recommendations in statutory language.
This, of course, will be considered by Parliament.
Hon. Mr. Carneron: Thank you.
FARM IMPROVEMENT LOANS ACT
SMALL BUSINESSES LOANS ACT
FISHERIES IMPROVEMENT LOANS ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Gildas L. Molgat moved the second reading of Bill
C-14, to amend the Farm Improvement Loans Act, the
Small Businesses Loans Act and the Fisheries Improvement Loans Act.
He said: Honourable senators, in speaking on second
reading of Bill C-14, we are dealing with three acts that
are administered by the Minister of Finance, namely, the
Farm Improvement Loans Act, the Small Businesses
Loans Act and the Fisheries Improvement Loans Act. The
bill proposes some significant changes in and improvements to the provisions of those three acts, which have
been in operation for some years although they do not date
back to the same time of incorporation.
Prior to my discussing the proposed amendments, it
might be helpful if I discuss some of the main provisions
in the present acts. That might enable honourable senators
to understand better the proposed amendments.
[Translation]
First of all, I should like to point out to honourable
senators that we are dealing here with three acts that are
really intended for small businesses, whether it be farming, fishing or commercial. A look at the loans granted in
the last three years reveals for instance, that of the 137,000
loans granted, 109,000 were for amounts of less than $5,000.
We are therefore really helping the small farmer.
In the case of the Small Businesses Loans Act, out of
7,400 loans, 2,700 amounted to less than $7,500.
As for the fishing industry, out of a total of 2,346 loans,
1,238 amounted to less than $5,000.
[Hon. Mr. Cameron.]

April 24, 1974

We are therefore really dealing here with three acts
intended, until now, specially for small business. But it
must be noticed.
Hon. Mr. Asselin: Do you have the total amount of loans
granted?
Hon. Mr. Molgat: Yes. I am speaking of the period from
July lst, 1971 to December 31st, 1973. Now, the total in the
case of farm loans was 137,682; in that of small businesses,
7,464.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Farm loans amounting to $137,000?
Hon. Mr. Molgat: There were 137,000 loans.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Loans and not dollars?
Hon. Mr. Molgat: Are you referring to dollars?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Molgat: Fine, I can give you the amount of the
total number of loans. The total wasHon. Mr. Asselin: As for the third group, you did not
mention the number of loans.
Hon. Mr. Molgat: The total number of loans for fisheries was 2,346 and the figures given earlier referred to the
number of loans in each group. The total amount from 1945
to 1973Hon. Mr. Asselin: That is old. Do you have the figures
from 1967?
Hon. Mr. Molgat: From 1945 to 1973, the total for farm
loans was $2,988 million.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Billion?
Hon. Mr. Molgat: No, $2,988 millions; loans to small
businesses, $289 million and for fisheries, $32 million.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: For what total?
Hon. Mr. Molgat: In order to give a total for all three
categories, I would have to add them up, but let me say
approximately $3.3 billionHon. Mr. Flynn: I beg your pardon. Three billion?
Hon. Mr. Molgat: Three billion and a few million dollars; we are speaking of the total.
[English]
I want to make it clear that these are not loans by the
government; these are loans guaranteed by the government. The totals to which I referred are the totals that
have been loaned in the whole of that period, not necessarily the totals outstanding at this time. Many of those
loans have revolved and have been paid off.
As I say, these bills do not provide for any government
money to be involved, but rather for a guarantee by the
goverrment on loans that are made by chartered banks or
other designated financial institutions. They deal specifically with capital improvement projects and not with
working capital. The working capital requirements of the
various classifications are expected to come from the
owners themselves or from other loan arrangements. We
are dealing here purely with capital improvement
projects.
The oldest of these three acts is the Farm Improvement
Loans Act, which was passed in 1944. At that time it was

April 24, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

for a three-year period. However, it has been amended on
numerous occasions since then, at times by adding new
lending periods and at times by widening the scope of
operations to include loans for other purposes. As the act
now stands, the net amount which may be outstanding at
any time to any individual farmer is $25,000. Of that
amount, up to $15,000 may be for loans for the purpose of
financing the acquisition of farm implements, buildings,
equipment, or livestock and to make various kinds of
improvements to the f arm. The farmer may also borrow up
to $15,000 to purchase parcels of land to round out an
existing unit, providing that the total loan does not exceed
$25,000.
I might point out that our colleague from North Battleford, Senator Sparrow, introduced a bill in the Senate,
the purpose of which was to increase these limits. I believe
the Senate gave the subject approval at that time. The bill
did not reach the other place, but approval was certainly
granted here, and it was a recognition of Senator Sparrow's efforts in the agricultural area.
*

(1430)

The maximum repayment period under the Farm
Improvement Loans Act varies according to the purpose of
the loan. For example, it may be as low as three years if it
is for the purchase of a truck, or it may go as high as 15
years for the purchase of land. It is important to recognize
how the Farm Improvement Loans Act was greatly needed
in the agricultural areas. Following the depression years
and war years, as farmers were going back on the land,
particularly the returning service men, there was a real
problem in getting financing for farms. The normal lending institutions, the banks, as a result of very bad experiences during the depression, were most reluctant to
advance money on farms. It was found that the farmers
simply could not find sources of capital. That is why this
act was instituted at that time. I gave the figures earlier,
and it is interesting to note that the farmers have made
real use of this, because almost $3 billion has been loaned
during that period. During 1973 alone, loans of $230 million
were made. The majority of the loans were made for
agricultural implements. I might also point out that the
losses under the program have been very small. Through
the guarantee, the government makes good any losses, but
these have been very small, only about one-fifth of one per
cent of the face value of the loans made, so it has been a
successful program.
The Fisheries Improvement Loans Act is a newer act,
having been passed in 1955. It also has been amended from
time to time. The present provisions have the same limit
as in the case of farms, namely, $25,000 to any one
individual. The purposes of the loan include the purchase
or construction or repair of fishing vessels and equipment,
and the development or improvement of shore installations which are a necessary part of a fishing enterprise.
The maximum repayment period is 10 years. The lending
activity under this act was very low for a number of years,
but has recently increased sharply. For the last fiscal year
it is expected that the final return will show loans of
nearly $10 million in the course of the year, or almost 30
per cent above the level of the previous year. The vast
bulk of the loans have been made for the purpose of

repairing boats. Again the loss record has been excellent;
there have been very f ew losses.
The Small Businesses Loans Act is the most recent of
the three acts, having come into effect in 1961. Like the
other two, it has been amended and extended on several
occasions. The limit here is the same, $25,000. The loan
limit is the same as for fisheries, namely, 10 years. Loans
may be made to acquire fixed or moveable equipment, and
for the purpose of the construction, renovation or purchase of premises. To qualify for a loan, an enterprise
must have a gross annual revenue of $500,000 or less, and it
must be engaged in one of the following fields of business
activity: manufacturing, retail or wholesale trade, construction, transportation, communications, or the provision of services. Here, as I indicated earlier, from its
inception to the end of 1973, a total of $290 million has
been loaned under the act. Again the lending has increased
sharply in recent years, and in 1973 alone over $30 million
was loaned under the act.
There are a number of provisions that apply to loans
under each of these acts which it might be useful to
mention. For example, lenders must take security for each
loan. This means usually a charge on the assets being
acquired on the loan, as well as a promissory note. Additional security may be required by the lender in certain
circumstances. This is the decision of the lender, whether
it be a bank or any accredited financial institution; they
make the loan, they make the decision, the government
gives the guarantee. Potential borrowers must also be
prepared to have a minimum amount of equity in the
project for which a loan is requested.
The rate of interest under the acts is controlled. There is
a maximum rate that may be charged by the lenders.
These rates are determined semi-annually on April 1 and
October 1, and they are based on the yield of Government
of Canada bonds during the six-month period preceding
the rate change. To this is added a margin of one per cent.
Thus, if the average yield of government bonds in the six
months prior to April 1 has been 8 per cent, then the
lending rate is 9 per cent. For the current six-month
period, which started April 1, the maximum rate for all
these programs is 8 per cent except for land purchases
under the Farm Improvement Loans Act, where the rate is
8V/ per cent. The reason for a slightly higher rate in the
case of land purchases is that there the loans can be repaid
over a longer period; the loan term there can be as high as
15 years, whereas under the others it is 10 years, and, as is
normal under longer term loans, the rate is somewhat
higher. That is in any case a reflection of the government
bond market.
This is in broad outline the position respecting these
acts at the present time. I think it is important that we
should consider the changes we are proposing, that we
recognize the changes in conditions and the increasing
demands that have come for loans within the last year in
particular. I might add that in proposing these changes a
thorough review has been made, and a variety of suggestions and proposals have been received from many
individuals and groups who are interested in these acts.
First of all let me say a word about the general considerations that apply to these three acts. The first thing is an
extension of each of them for a further three years to June

SENATE DEBATES
30, 1977, so the three of them will be extended for the same
three years. At the same time, it is proposed to make major
changes in the individual lending limits, that it be double
in the case of each of the acts; the present $25,000 will go to
$50,000. In the case of the Farm Improvement Loans Act,
where there was a difference between what could be
borrowed for land and for other purposes, it is proposed
that that be removed and that there be no sub-limit.
The other general consideration is the increase in the
maximum aggregate amount that can be loaned by the
lending institutions, because we are now finding we are
reaching the limit to what the lending institutions can
provide under the present acts. That is being increased to
$1.1 billion for loans under the Farm Improvement Loans
Act, $250 million for loans under the Small Businesses
Loans Act, and $60 million for loans under the Fisheries
Improvement Loans Act. This will mean there will now be
enough flexibility to take care of the new and increased
demand for loans. These proposals are applicable to all
three programs.
The other amendments to which I will now refer deal
specifically with each of the individual acts, and I will
deal with each of them in turn. First of all, for the Farm
Improvement Loans Act we are proposing under the law
to extend the eligible purposes to include major repair and
overhaul of agricultural equipment and implements not
previously covered. Secondly, the amount to be charged
against the $50,000 individual loan limit would, in the case
of a joint loan, be limited to the borrower's share of the
loan. This means that where an individual may have a
joint loan with somebody else-and this is becoming a
more common practice as the price of farm implements in
particular has increased, so that there are cooperative
arrangements-that person with a loan under a joint program would still be able to obtain a loan individually.
That is, if there were two persons on a $50,000 loan, each
individual would be considered to have only $25,000 and
could still get $25,000 independently.
*

(1440)

Another provision is that the Alberta Treasury Branches
would be included as eligible members. This, by the way,
applies to the Small Businesses Loans Act as well. They
are now considered under the act as a registered lender.
Insofar as the Small Businesses Loans Act is concerned,
the specific changes there are, first of all, an increase in
the gross annual revenue limit by which a small eligible
business is defined. Up to now it bas been $500,000 annual
gross revenue. The act proposes that this be doubled to $1
million. Secondly, the scope of eligible businesses would
be enlarged to include new businesses. Someone who
wants to go into a new business can now borrow under
this act, whereas he could not do so previously. Thirdly,
the purposes for which loans would be made would be
broadened and would include land, if necessary, where
that land is essential to the business enterprise and, as I
mentioned before, the Alberta Treasury Branches would
be included as members.
In the case of the third act, the Fisheries Improvement
Loans Act, as I have already indicated, the aggregate loan
amount is increased from $25,000 to $50,000 and as well we
are increasing the total amount which will be available by
$25 million. We have found under this act that in recent
[Hon. Mr. Molgat.]

April 24, 1974

months in particular there bas been a large increase in
demand and we will be reaching the limit very shortly.
Honourable senators, it seems to me that the experience
with these acts has shown the need for them, as we can see
by the demand imposed upon them.
As I indicated at the outset, it has truly been a program
to assist small enterprises, and they have made great use
of the program. The increasing demand indicates that we
should proceed with these changes, to bring the act up to
the modern needs, to make sure that the money limits are
available and that we do not end up in a situation where
either the small businessman or farmer or fisherman
would appear before a bank and find that the limits have
been reached.
I point out again that there is a minimum cost to the
government in this area. It is only a guarantee. The losses
have been very small, and I would encourage honourable
senators to support the second reading of the bill.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: Honourable senators, I should like to
ask one question. Could the honourable senator tell the
bouse the number of loans to farmers in the past year, the
average size of loans and the areas of the country in which
the loans were granted? It would be interesting to know,
for example, how many of these loans went to farmers of
my native Gaspé. I am sure that my friend across the way
would be interested, too. Can the sponsor give the house
this information-the number of loans, the average size
and the areas in which they were granted?
Hon. Mr. Molgat: Honourable senators, I can give Senator O'Leary some of the information. At the committee
stage I am sure we can provide some more. I cannot give it
specifically for the Gaspé region but I can say, for example, that in the past year, from January 1973 to December
1973, in the Province of Quebec, 188 loans were granted
totalling a little over $1 million. There were 57,941 loans
for all of Canada in 1973, totalling a little over $230
million.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: Is there any indication of the average
size of the loans?
Hon. Mr. Molgat: Yes, I can give that figure but it will
require some calculation on my part. There were 65,000
loans of from $1 to $2,500 over a three-year period. Over
the same period there were 43,000 loans of from $2,501 to
$5,000, and then the number decreases rapidly in each
bracket. For instance, there were only 3,600 loans of from
$12,500 to $15,000.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: Thank you very much.
Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: Would the honourable senator
tell us the total amount of these loans that were written
off as bad debts in the last two years?
Hon. Mr. Molgat: I am sorry that I do not have that
specific figure; I can give you only a general figure. Over
the period of the life of the Farm Improvement Loans Act,
the loss bas been one-f if th of one per cent of the total of
loans granted of about $3 billion. The loss ratio on the
others is approximately the same. I shall be glad to get the
details, if the senator wishes.

Hon. Rhéal Bélisle: Honourable senators, let me first

SENATE DEBATES

face, president of the Canadian Liberal Party, for his
presentation of the contents of this bill.
[En glish]
As you have heard already, Bill C-14 amends three
acts-the Farm Improvemnent Loans Act, the Small Businesses Loans Act and the Fisheries Improvement Loans
Act. It allows the Minister of Finance to guarantee term
loans granted by chartered banks, and other designated
financial institutions, to farmers, small businessmen and
f ishermen, in order to finance a variety of improvements
in their business operations that require capital
expenditures.
Under the existing provisions of each act, these programns will expire, as Senator Molgat said, on June 30, 1974.
One of the purposes of Bill C-14 is to provide for the
continuation of these lending programns for a three-year
period ending June 30, 1977.
Honourahie senators, I would like to make some observations respecting a couple of these programs. The first is
under the Farmn Improvemient Loans Act. I believe it came
into effect in March 1945, and was to run for an initial
period of three years. The act was subsequently amended
from time to time to provide for additional lending periods
and a widening of its scope of operation.
Under the existing act, f armers may borrow up to
$15,000 to help finance the acquisition of farmn implements,
buildings, equipment and livestock, or to repair and
improve assets which are used in farming. In addition,
farmers may borrow up to $15,000 for the purchase of
small parcels of land to complete an existing farm unit.
The total amount of boans which may be outstanding 10
any f armer at any time is $25,000 for ahl purposes.
As 1 understand it, Bill C-14 proposes 10 raise this
maximum amount of $50,000, and to drop the sub-limits for
land and other farming assets. It also extends the eligible
purposes 10 include major repairs and overbaul of equipment and implements. I believe it will allow joint borrowers 10 have only their share of such borrowing count
against their entitiement under the plan. These provisions
are highly commendable, but are they adequate in a pe)riod
of high inflation and declining purchasing power?
The legislation ref lects the changing conditions of farming, fishing and business. When the boan ceiling was $7,900
we thought we were doing well by increasing that ceiling
10 $15,000. Bill C-14 would increase it to $50,000.
* (1450)

Is il true that farms, small businesses and fiEheries have
become more mechanized, and need more capital for electric power, internal combustion engines and other necessary equipment? I submit that much of this increase 15 10
offset the declining purchasing power of the dollar, or 10
provide money that is needed 10 pay higher interest
charges or for the maintenance and repair of existing
machinery. In other words, it hardly covers the price
increases in current farm operations caused by inflation.
It will be observed that farm improvement boans are 10
be made for machinery repairs. It appears that the farmer
cannot generate enough earning power to provide for the
repair and maintenance of his machines. He must borrow
10 keep his machines running. I arn concernied, honourable
.senators, that officiais in the Department of Finance fear

27601-21

that the f armn earnings will not provide sufficient funds
for the repair and maintenance of machinery, and that the
government must provide for guaranteed bank boans 10
cover these repairs. Do the f inancial institutions with
whom the f armer must deal not want to lend money for
the maintenance of machines? Do they want 10 avoid all
risk, and have the Government of Canada assume the
major burden?
I note that a major provision in Bill C-14 will raise the
maximum amount which may be advanced in the next
three years by lenders. The Minister of Finance will guarantee $1,100 million for boans made by the chartered
banks, and $300 million for boans made by other f inancial
intermediaries such as credit unions and caisse populaires
in rural communities.
Permit me, honourable senators, to make one observation. Cbartered banks are in the business of lending
money, and since we do not allow foreign banks 10 do
much business in Canada, il is my view that our chartered
banks under these protective conditions have a major
responsibility 10 lend money to farmers, small businessmen and fishermen for the ordinary operations of the
farms, busînesses or f isheries. I amn surprised, therefore,
that we need 10 guarantee bank boans to enable farmers to
continue in the ordinary business of f arming.
Let il be understood that I do not oppose this bill. I
strongly support the amendments. The Farm Improvement
Loans Act has obviously assisted Canadian agriculture
over the past 30 years of operation. This is evidenced by
the fact that under il almost $3 billion bas been lent 10
f armers. Lending activities in the 12 months to December
31, 1973, amounted to some $230 million. That was the
largest volume of boans ever made in one year under Ibis
plan.
The second programn I should like 10 draw your attention
t0, honourable senators, is that under the Small Businesses Loans Act. Since its inception in 1961 the act bas
been extended and amended many limes, as Senator
Molgat said. The existing legislation provides for boans up
10 $25,000 10 assist small businesses in financing improvements. Eligible borrowers are enterprises with an estimaIed gross annual revenue of less than $500,000 wbicb must
be engaged in any of the following fields of business
activities: manufacturing, wholesale or relail trade, small
business, construction, transportation or communication. I
believe boans may be used to assist in acquiring fixed or
moveable equipment, and for the purchase, construction or
renovation of business premises.
The amendments contained in Bill C-14 with respect 10
boans 10 small businesses appear to bave similar effects as
the amendments witb respect 10 f armers. Tbey raise the
maximum borrowed fromn $25,000 10 $50,000. They extend
the eligibility to include new businesses and businesses
where the estimated gross annual revenue for a fiscal year
does not exceed $1 million. They also permit boans for the
purchase of land necessary for the operation of the
enterprise.
As in the other acts, provision is made 10 raise the
maximum amount which may be advanced in the next
tbree years by benders. The ceiling on guaranteed boans
made by chartered banks will be $250 million, and $100
million by other lenders.

I am pleased to see these amendments, because I believe
they will help small businesses. The provisions are less
restrictive. Today small businesses play a very important
role in the Canadian economy. They create over 50 per
cent of Canada's gross national product; they pay close to
50 per cent of the taxes collected by the government; and
they employ more than 50 per cent of the work force.
I observed with interest the statement in the other place
by the Minister of Finance that from 1961 to the end of
1973, $291 million had been made available to small businesses under the provisions of this legislation. It appears
that lending reached a peak of $30 million in the year
ended December 31, 1973, and yet if you examine the
earlier annual reports of the ministry you will find that
the number of boans issued under this act has not grown in
any measurable sense with the business expansion of the
sixties. In fact, 2,977 boans were made in 1961, whereas il
years later 2,846 boans were recorded. I find it difficult to
comprehend in a credit-conscious society such as ours why
there are so few boans made to small businesses.

April 24, 1974
Aprîl 24, 1974

program. Faced with a lack of liquidity in recent years
they have naturally encouraged lending at higher interest
rates, and, as a resuit, the small businessman's financial
needs have been neglected. Is this the government's
answer to the small businessman in Canada?

e(1500)

There is another bill, honourable senators, Bill C-10, to
amend the Export Development Act. This bill is to
increase the capital of the Export Development Corporation by almost the total amount, $350 million, which it is
willing to guarantee in chartered bank boans to, small
businesses. Furthermore, the goverfiment is prepared
under the same bill to, extend the corporation's right to
lend flot $350 million as in Bill C-14, which is now before
us, but $850 million. The average of loans in this area is
from $20 million to $30 million, and they are granted to
foreign countries such as Iran, which has been in the news
recently because of the visit of the Minister of Industry,
Trade and Commerce, and others which are accumulatîng
great reserves of capital resulting from their exports of oul
to Canada and the other industrialized nations.
Hon. Mr. Martin: It may be bec ause there was less need.
These boans to foreign countries are made at a beneficial
rate of interest, not higher than 7 per cent, and if you caîl

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES

how you reached this conclusion, because it is clearly
stated that it will not go above 8 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Molgat: If I said that, honourable senators,
then I was in error. What I was in fact saying is that the
rate is set by taking the average yield on government
bonds over a six-month period-and the dates are April 1
and October 1-and if it should happen that the average
rate is, say, 7 per cent, then 1 per cent is added to make the
rate 8 per cent, and that 1 per cent becomes a sort of
carrying charge on the cost of the money. In a sense it is a
sort of overhead. So, as I said, it is based on the average
yield calculated every six months with 1 per cent added to
that average yield. The present cost is 8 or 8 l/ per cent.
While I am on my feet, honourable senators, I think I
can answer Senator Desruisseaux on the points he raised.
In the case of the farm improvement and fisheries loans,
losses have been less than one-fifth of 1 per cent, and in
the case of small businesses loans less than one-half of 1
per cent.
Hon. Mr. Carter: Honourable senators, I move the
adjournment of the debate.
Hon. Herbert O. Sparrow: Honourable senators, If senator Carter will allow me I should like to say a few words
on this legislation now.
First of all, I want to congratulate Senator Molgat on
the very fine manner in which he presented this bill, and
the clear and concise way in which he explained it to us. I
had the privilege in the past of presenting a bill such as
this to this chamber pertaining to changes in the Farm
Improvement Loans Act, as well as having the privilege of
sponsoring a bill, almost a year ago, to increase the
amounts to be made available in f arm improvement loans.
I am pleased to be able to support this bill. I commend it
to the members of the Senate, and ask them for their
co-operation in giving it speedy passage. As was
explained, it incorporates three different facets of business and industry in our country-farming, fishing and
small businesses. It is not my intention today to discuss in
any detail any portion of the bill except that which relates
to farm improvement loans.
The amounts as stated by Senator Molgat are considerably higher under the Farrm Improvement Loans Act than
the other two, but I am certain that even though the
number and amounts of loans are greater in total as they
relate to farm improvements, the benefits to the fishing
industry and to small businessmen are just as great.
I agree with the comments of Senator Bélisle that
throughout the years since the Small Businesses Loans
Act has been in force there has never been what I consider
to be a sufficient number of loans made under that legislation. This question has arisen previously in this chamber,
and I am sure in the other place, and I think it would be
important, if this bill should go to committee, that some
further explanation and consideration be given to that
important aspect which Senator Bélisle has raised.
I believe that the small businessman in this country has
been and continues to be somewhat behind the eight-ball
in being able to obtain financing capital. It seems to me
that the larger business enterprises have much less trouble
in obtaining their capital than the small business people

27601-21

have. It may be the fault of the banking system, or the
fault may lie in other places as well.
*

(1510)

I might refer primarily to the Farm Improvement Loans
Act, because it is a subject with which I am most familiar.
This legislation has been popular in the past. It has been
effective, and has certainly been used widely by the farming industry, particularly in Western Canada. This program has helped to make it possible for Canadians to have
a viable farming industry, and also to buy food at very
reasonable prices. The Minister of Agriculture, and other
people, have stated on many occasions that Canadians are
fortunate in being able to enjoy a cheap food policy,
compared to that of almost any other country. This indicates to me that our farming industry has been efficient
and progressive, even though during many periods over
many years those in it have had to work for a very low
return on their investment and their labour.
As was stated earlier, the Farm Improvement Loans Act
has not been changed since 1968. At that time the amount
was increased from $15,000 to $25,000. I feel the time has
now come to increase the amount to $50,000. Senator
Bélisle has said, and I agree-and a number of the farm
organizations, particularly the Canadian Federation of
Agriculture, have already said-that the amounts under
the Farm Improvement Loans Act are not high enough. In
the Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture in the last
couple of weeks it was suggested that the loan amount

should be increased to $100,000. Before the next three-year
period is up, we might very well want to consider an
increase in the amount beyond the present $50,000.
I say this for a number of reasons, supporting what
Senator Bélisle said. The cost of living has gone up, but if
farmers are to be more efficient and provide greater
amounts of grains and beef, they will need greater f inancing. They must get the capital with which to buy the
equipment for this greater production, to allow Canadians
to continue to enjoy low prices at the food counters.
I should like to add one further comment in this regard.
Senator Molgat pointed out that in 1973 alone the loans
under the Farm Improvement Loans Act totalled $230
million. Since the act has been in force, approximately $3
billion has been lent to Canadian farmers. The loss, as he
said, has been only one-fifth of one per cent of the face
value of the loans. This is a very creditable showing by our
agricultural industry, particularly when it is remembered
that it has had to go through many periods of low income.
Farmers have managed to see, and made a point of seeing,
that those loans have been paid back. Speaking on behalf
of the industry, I feel there is no danger of losses increasing in the future, because the honesty of our farmers is not
in question. I believe that our agricultural industry will
have to be much more viable and profitable than it has
been in the past. Even though these loans are doubling,
and even if the farmers take full advantage of them, the
extra income that will accrue from the additional investment will make it much easier for the f armers to repay the
loans than has been the case in the past.
On June 5 of last year, in the first session of this
Twenty-ninth Parliament, Bill S-5 was passed by this
house. It was a bill to increase the amount of loans under
the Farm Improvement Loans Act from $25,000 to $40,000.

April 24, 1974

SENATE DEBATES
That bill received careful consideration in this chamber. It
was sent to a committee of the Senate, passed by that
committee and then passed by this house. When it went to
the other place, the Speaker there did not allow that bill to
be dealt with. It was a disappointment to this chamber; it
was a disappointment to me; I am sure it was a disappointment to all those in the agricultural industry. For the past
year they have been unable to take advantage of the
increased amounts that would have been available to them
under that bill.
I should like to refer to some of the remarks made in
this chamber concerning the action taken by the Speaker
of the other place. I felt, as I am sure a number of
honourable senators did, that the Speaker of the other
place took undue licence in refusing that bill.
Hon. Mr. Asselin: On a point of order. Surely under our
rules it is not permissible for a senator to cast a reflection
upon the Speaker of the other place. I think that is what
Senator Sparrow is now doing in what he is saying, and I
believe he is completely out of order.
The Hon. the Speaker: I am inclined to agree with you,
Senator Asselin.
Hon. Mr. Sparrow: If you agree with Senator Asselin,
Madam Speaker, I shall not refer to that. Perhaps I might
read what Senator Choquette said in this chamber on June
14 last:
-if the Speaker of the House of Commons persists in
deciding what bills coming from this bouse shall be
accepted or rejected we should send this bill to the
Supreme Court of Canada, which is the only forum
that can decide whether we have a right to do this or
do that.
On the same day the Leader of the Government had this to
say:
I spoke to the chairman of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee and asked him to give consideration to this matter. That was the way I left it.
He said he would. I do not know whether he is in a
position to do so, and he might advise us on Tuesday.
That Tuesday bas not come since June 14 last. Some time
after that a question was asked in this bouse as to whether
the chairman of that committee had reached a decision or
had a recommendation for this bouse, and I believe it was
then said that a decision had not been made.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Wednesday.
Hon. Mr. Sparrow: I would think that this bouse
deserves an answer from the Leader of the Government
and the chairman of the Standing Senate Committee on
Legal and Constitutional Affairs on Wednesday, or at
least some Tuesday in the very near future.
Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: May I ask a question of the
honourable senator, to clarify a point or two? Has he any
statistics on the steady decrease in the number of farmers
over the last few years in all areas of Canada? I ask also
whether he is aware that the income of farmers has been
increasing, according to the last few reports that we have
had?
*

(1520)

Hon. Mr. Sparrow: I am not too sure that I understand
the question. The farming population and the number of
{Hon. Mr. Sparrow.]

farms over the last number of years bas been decreasing
yearly in all parts of Canada. I have not the figures at
hand of the percentage of decrease, or the number in any
given year, or even what the present number is. I do know
that the number of Wheat Board permit book holders has
been decreasing considerably, and this is what we look at
particularly in Western Canada. There were some changes
in the way the census takers look at agriculture and
designate farmers as such in the last census, so that would
have to be taken into consideration. To answer simply,
yes, there has been a definite decline in the farming
population and the number of f armers throughout Canada
in the last number of years.
Hon. Mr. Deschatelets: I think the production is
increasing, though the number of f armers is decreasing.
Hon. Mr. Sparrow: That is true, the production has been
increasing, due to the efficiency of the agricultural industry. Over the last few years farm income has increased,
and particularly last year and this year it increased considerably over previous years. This is due, of course, to the
excellent export markets that have been developed by
Canada for our food products. Does that answer the
question?
Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: Yes. My third question, if I may
ask it, is: Would that not explain the number of loans that
are being asked for presently? I understood from Senator
Bélisle that the number of loans sought was about the
same.
Hon. Mr. Bélisle: It is less in 1973 than in 1961.
Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: Would that explain it, do you
think?
Hon. Mr. Sparrow: I am sorry, I cannot answer that. I
wonder if I may ask Senator Molgat to give us the figures
that he bas on the number of loans. I know he gave us
figures today showing that the loan amount had increased,
but I do not know whether he indicated that the actual
number of loans had increased.
Hon. Mr. Molgat: I am speaking now strictly of the
Farm Improvement Loans Act. The loans have fluctuated
substantially over the years. From the inception of the act
up to 1964, there were 1,164,100 loans granted, for a total
value of $1,526,800,000. The average loan during that period
was $1,312. I can give the subsequent figures year by year.
Hon. Mr. Asselin: Why do you not table that?
Hon. Mr. Molgat: I would be happy to do so. Let me say
that in 1968 there was a tremendous drop in the number of
loans.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Do you want to have it printed in
Hansard?

LAND USE
INQUIRY-DEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. Margaret Norrie rose pursuant to notice:
That she will cali the attention of the Senate to the
question of land use in Canada.
She said: Honourable senators, in bringing the subject of
land use in Canada before the Senate, it is my hope that
we will assume the responsibility of studying and recommending some changes to ease the problems that are
presented by this vital issue.
As you probably know, about ten years ago an outstanding land use study was made by a Senate committee.
However, changes in the world are occurring with lightning speed, and we are suddenly aware that land use
priorities are shifting, and some investigations and alterations must be made. This is particularly the case in relation to agricultural. farm land throughout this country. It
is most definitely a national problem in scope.
Only one-twentieth of Canada's acreage can be called
agricultural farm land. It is disappearing so fast by the
encroachment of industries, urban sprawl, highways, and
aerodromes that the Ontario Federation of Agriculture
made the startling statement that in 50 years all the
province's top food-producing land would be under concrete. What is more, in that area of Ontario is Canada's
only number one grade of farm land.

It is stated that it takes 20 years to effect any permanent
change in social institutions, and we could lose our f oodproducing land while we are thinking and talking about
this, unbess we act now.
Our greatest problem, honourable senators, is to, convince Mr. Public that the country is in a serious state of
emergency with regard to the use of farm land. Clearly we
need immediate action. We must break down the barrier of
indifference which exists, and bring in legislation 10 protect our agricultural land for the purpose of food
production.
The recent oul crisis has shown us very vividly how
much for granted we take our basic resources, of which
agricultural land is now a top priority.
To give you some idea of the concern over land use in
the various provinces, I can at this time only mention
comments in the Journal of February 2, 1974, and the
FinancialPost of March 2, 1974. The emphasis of concern in
these comments seems to be on urban sprawl, bad planning and spiralling land prices, et cetera. In only three
provinces are the comments centered around the preservation of agricultural farm land, and those provinces are

SENATE DEBATES

Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island and Ontario. This in
itself is shocking, and it is the main reason why I want
this study made at once.
Honourable senators, I should point out that some of
these comments which I have listed here are fairly
lengthy, but I am only going to give you little snatches
here and there out of them, because I want to give you a
general idea of the concern that is felt and the grumbling
that is going on across Canada.
It was only a short while ago that I spoke on land use in
Nova Scotia. At that time Senator Connolly (Ottawa
West) suggested that what was true of Nova Scotia might
not be true of Canada as a whole. Well, I should like to
illustrate here today that it is the case throughout Canada,
and I will show how serious it is and that we should
indeed investigate the problem.
I shall now give the excerpts I referred to a few
moments ago, and I should point out that these are not
necessarily direct quotations. The first is:
Growing concern among Canada's farmers and their
organizations about the ever-increasing reduction in
the amount of land available to grow food was indicated Tuesday at the annual meeting of the Canadian
Federation of Agriculture. The land use concern
appeared more prominent than in previous years as
the two-day annual meeting of the federation opened
Tuesday.
At least two provinces-British Columbia and Saskatchewan-have taken steps to control land use and
both the Ontario and New Brunswick federations of
agriculture made special reference to the situation in
reports to the meeting.
The federation cited two huge projects that now jeopardize thousands of acres of Ontario farm land-the newly
announced Sarnia-Montreal oil pipe line extension that
will cut through prime farm land "from one end of our
province to the other," and a hydro corridor that will cut
through about 42,000 acres within the next few years.
In Saskatchewan the provincial land bank commission
bas purchased 168,481 acres of land from 381 farmers at a
value of almost $11 million.
The Canadian Federation of Agriculture now is assembling data provided by its member provincial federations
and intends to prepare a paper which could be considered
at "a possible national meeting."
In view of the importance of the subject and the
escalation in interest of at least some of the CFA
members in land use planning, the national office
proposes to make follow-up on this item a top priority
following this meeting.
British Columbia: Suitable machinery to impose controls is already in operation in the form of the British
Columbia Land Commission. The commission was set up
last year primarily to deal with the preservation of farm
land, but its scope could easily be expanded. I should point
out that that was sort of dropped. It was just shelved.
Alberta: There is no ownership restriction on private
land, however, and none is anticipated-at least not until
the end of 1975. That is when the Land Use Forum-a
three-man committee set up a year ago to study nine
[Hon. Mrs. Norrie.]

April 24, 1974

aspects of land use in Alberta-presents its final report,
including recommendations as to legislative action.
Although the committee is primarily concerned with seeking the best way to develop the province's land resources,
it is also considering the effects of foreign and absentee
ownership.
Saskatchewan: The province's main concern is to maintain the family farm and prevent depopulation of rural
areas. The Saskatchewan government is using the committee's report as a basis tor legislation, but so far bas not
indicated which proposals, if any, will be adopted.
Manitoba: Agriculture Minister Sam Uskiw has a committee studying the subject, and if its report is submitted
in time he hopes to propose legislation this session.
Ontario: I should point out that there is an item with
respect to Ontario which suggests that they have not done
much, but there is another reference which I will give
later which says quite the contrary.
So far the Ontario government has taken no action on
the recommendations and, although it prevents the sale of
crown land to foreigners, it has made no move to restrict
sales of private lands.
However, there is widespread concern over the amount
of prime vacation land in the province that is owned by
United States citizens. In some areas the committee found
as much as 90 per cent of recreational land is so owned.
Quebec: Under the Civil Code there is some doubt
whether a landowner can be prevented from selling his
land to whomever he chooses. That is another question.
New Brunswick: There have been rumblings of concern.
Last year, for example, 2,000 acres of ocean-front property
in Westmorland County were quietly purchased by a local
agent for the Land Auction Bureau of Boston. It will be
recalled that in my speech in the Throne Speech debate I
referred to the Land Auction Bureau of Boston, and this is
the same bureau. At any rate, the land was then put up for
sale in Boston and auctioned off to buyers in the United
States.
Prince Edward Island: This province has the tightest
land ownership controls in Canada. Severe restrictions are
placed on non-residents of the province, Canadians as well
as foreigners. The government may make a start on new
legislation based on the royal commission's report in the
current session, but major changes are unlikely at this
time.
Newfoundland: Land ownership by foreigners or nonresidents is not yet a major issue in the province, but it is
recognized as a subject of future concern.
I mentioned a moment ago that I had another item with
respect to Ontario, honourable senators, and I should like
to refer to that now. This particular item shows far more
concern than the previous one. The item I am referring to
is a newspaper article about a report which was prepared
after a year-long study by a group chaired by an Ontario
lawyer, Edward Kowal. The article is headed, "Speculators
threaten farm output, study says", and it is from the
Toronto Star of March 19, 1974:
Rampant speculation in Ontario farmland threatens
food production and land owners not producing

SENATE DEBATES

enough food should be excluded from farm aid programs, the head of a government study said yesterday.
"In terms of top quality land, we are getting to the
point where we will not be able to feed a continually
increasing population," said Edward Kowal, chairman
of the province's f arm classification advisory
committee.
He predicted that Ontario may face serious food
production shortages in 5 to 10 years.
*

(1540)

"I think we can all agree that the speculator is the
worst cat in the whole situation," Kowal told a
Queen's Park Press conference.
The report of the committee's year-long study calls
for a massive transfer of land use planning powers to
the ministry of agriculture and says all farm land
should be classified by the government.
Mr. Kowal is a Toronto lawyer, and while not a farmer
himself he owns 20 per cent of a farm near Bowmanville.
The report of the committee of which he is chairman says
that all decisions on the use of farm land should be made
by the ministry of agriculture.
The following statement, honourable senators, is an
important point and one that should be emphasized. The
newspaper article which I have in my hand goes on to say:
"We feel," Kowal said, "that farm land is becoming
so scarce-and particularly good farm land-that we
cannot have decisions made by ministers involved in
other land use planning."
Honourable senators, at this point I should like to make
some recommendations on a short-term basis to stem the
tide of loss of our agricultural farm land. These are simply
suggestions, rather in the nature of emergency measures,
that can be changed following study.
The first is that an immediate and complete moratorium
be placed on sales of land to non-residents until a comprehensive analysis and investigation has been done in each
province. Secondly, a commission should be set up-a
commission of seven to nine members-in each province to
inspect each sale of land. Thirdly, there should be stimulation and special attention to farms now in operation, in
order to make sure that we keep these operations in a
viable condition. Fourthly, close liaison between provinces

and federal jurisdiction re grants, et cetera, must be
co-ordinated.
I have some further long-term ideas and recommendations, honourable senators, covering a period of, say, 100 to
500 years. The first of these is that deserted or idle farms
should be bought by f arm banks and transferred as needed
to prospective farmers either on a full-time or part-time
basis. Secondly, no agricultural land should be sacrificed
to urban sprawl, industries, et cetera, if another solution
can be found. Farms thrive best away from thickly populated areas, and all too often urban sprawl deprives us of
good f arm land.
Non-resident land ownership sounds the de.ath knell of a
community. Churches become neglected, schools are built
in larger centres and the community dies. Therefore, nonresident land ownership should be discouraged. Foreignresident ownership of land in moderate acreage is acceptable, in my opinion, if the owner contributes in a constructive way to the community, to the province or to Canada.
Mr. J. D. Hilchey, Supervisor of Land Use Planning for
Nova Scotia, Department of Agriculture and Marketing,
has made the following point:
In the final analysis, it is the responsibility of representatives in government to use in a positive way, the
privileges allocated to them. This includes the right to
manage natural resources in the best interests of the
public.
Honourable senators, this is only a rough outline of the
study I should like to see made here, and I am sure that
there are many other points of view that could be added as
such a study proceeds. It is my intention, therefore, after
the conclusion of the debate on the inquiry, to move that
the question of land use in Canada be referred to the
Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture.
On motion of Senator Langlois, debate adjourned.

COMMITTEE AUTHORIZED TO MEET DURING ADJOURNMENTS
0F THE SENATE
Hon. Leopold Langlois, with leave of the Senate and
notwithstanding rule 45 (1) (h), moved:
That the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and
Constitutional Affairs have power to sit during
adjournments of the Senate.
Hon. Mr'. Flynn: Explain.
Hon. Mr'. Langlois: Honourable senators, the chairman
of this committee is in a better position than I to explain
this motion, since it is by his request that the motion has
been put. However, I can inform the house that it is in
view of a possible meeting scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, at which time the Senate might not be in session. I
should indicate that there is a second motion following
upon this, af 1er which an explanation by the chairman of
the committee might be appropriate.
Motion agreed to.
COMMITTEE AUTHORIZED TO MEET DURING SITTING 0F THE
SENATE
Hon. Leopold Langlois, with leave of the Senate and
notwithstanding rule 45(1) (a), moved:
That the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and
Constitutional Affairs have power to sit while the
Senate is sitting on Tuesday next, 3Oth April 1974, and
that rule 76(4) be suspended in relation thereto.
Hon. Mr'. Goldenberg: Honourable senators, if you will
allow me, I will attempt to explain what the situation is.

As you know, the matter of parole has been under study
for some two years, and it has now been approximately 30
days since the draft report on parole was submitted to the
committee for study. I have called a meeting of the committee for next Tuesday at 2 o'clock for consideration of
the report. If we do not complete the consideration before
dinner, it is my hope that, in order to expedite final
approval, we will be able to continue in the evening while
the Senate is sitting.
The matter has been hanging fire for a long Urne, as
honourable senators know, and I think it is urgent that the
report be approved or otherwise, and, if approved, that it
be sent forthwith to the transiators and to the printer.
That is the sole purpose of the motion.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: For clarification purposes, then, the
first motion is to allow the committee to sit in the afternoon of Tuesday, and the second motion is to allow the
committee to sit in the evening of Tuesday.
Hon. Mr'. Goldenberg: That is right.
Moticn agreed to.
CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS FINANCING AND
GUARANTEE BILL, 1973
THIRD READING
Hon. Leopold Langlois moved the third reading of Bill
C-5, to authorize the provision of moneys to meet certain
capital expenditures of the Canadian National Railways
System and Air Canada for the period from the lst day of
January, 1973, to the 3Oth day of June, 1974, and to authorize the guarantee by Her Majesty of certain securities to
be issued by the Canadian National Railway Company
and certain debentures to be issued by Air Canada.
The Hon. the Speak~er: Is it your pleasure, honourable
senators, to adopt the motion?
Hon, W. M. Benidiclison: Honourable senators, having
mentioned yesterday something about a prospect that Air
Canada might get involved in the manufacturing of aircraf t by purchase of the de Havilland Aircraf t Company of
Canada, I think I should say a f ew words on the subject
today, although I have not been able to obtain much more
information than I had yesterday.
I explained yesterday that my information simply came
from a delayed issue of the Financial Post of last week
which normally would have been delivered last week, but
which only reached me yesterday because of our mail
difficulties.
Hon. Mr'. Flynn: You were lucky to get il yesterday.
Hon. Mr'. Benidickson: It is a front-page article written
by a very respected journalist of that newspaper, Mr.
Clive Baxter. The headline reads: "Ottawa may pick up de
Havilland option." The article commences:

April 25,1974
April 25, 1974

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

The government seems on the verge of nationalizing
de Havilland Aircraf t of Canada Ltd.
And the article goes on to, say that not only might the
government-and they suggest Air Canada would be a
participant in prospective purchases-be involved in the
purchase of the de Havilland manufacturing operation,
but they would also perhaps take over the Canadair operation in Montreal that most of us are familiar with. It says:
Last year Ottawa had a firm of fer to buy from Air
Canada and Canadian International Comstock Co.,
which jointly prepared to buy and merge together de
Havilland in Toronto and Canadair Ltd. in Montreal.
Reference is made to an explanatory previous story in the
FinancialPost of November 3 last.
There was strong and immediate opposition in many
government circles about Air Canada's of fer. Those
planners want Air Canada to remain unconnected
with the manufacturing industry.
Although 1 have not been able to get much detailed
information as to what is involved here, I realize that it is
somethîng of consequence. Without additional facts, and
offhand, I want to indicate that my reaction would be
most unfavourable to Air Canada entering into the manuf acturing side of the aircraf t industry. I think it should be
free, certainly, to purchase its equipment competitively
without bias in a free market.
a (1410)
Since, however, we are dealing here with the budget and
financial proposals of the CNR and Air Canada, I simply
want to draw the attention of my colleagues to this possibility, and to suggest that very soon something of this
consequence might be investigated in a public way by an
appropriate committee of the Senate.
Furthermore, reference was made in committee to the
fact that there was an option to purchase-and I don't
know whether it is Air Canada that holds it or not-which
expires on June 30. Perhaps Senator Langlois will have
some further information on that. In any event, I want to
indicate my present and future interest in this possibility
and my present instinctive opposition to Air Canada's
becoming a manufacturer of aircraft.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, I would be
remiss in my duty if I did notHon. John M. Macdonald: Are you planning to close
the debate?
Hon Mr. Flynn: Not on third reading; you are not
closing the debate on tnird reading now.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: By all means go ahead, Senator
Macdonald.
Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable senators, thc
few remarks I wish to make at this time do not, perhaps,
bear directly on any of the provisions of the bull because I
do not intend speaking about the financial side of the
picture or the guarantee by the Government of Canada.
However, my remarks will probably be at least somewhat
in order in that they do concern the Canadian National
Railways. While they do not deal with their spendîng
program, they do deal with their non-spending program in
certain regions.

27601-22

We who live in eastern Nova Scotia are served exclusively by CNR because the CPR does flot operate in that
area. It is to the passenger service provided by CN that I
wish to address my remarks. I ar nfot referring to the
service that one receives on the trains because that is first
class and those who are in charge of the passengers are
courteous, considerate and anxious about their comfort.
But it is the passenger service rendered by CNR that I
wish to criticize and against which I wish to make a
protest and, I believe, with justice. Let me explain.
Two passenger trains a day operate out of Sydney, one is
called a railiner and goes directly to Halifax, making a
connection at Truro with the Ocean Limited coming out of
Halifax and going to Montreal. This railiner leaves Sydney
at 6.30 in the morning and after a fast run it reaches Truro,
230 miles away, just six hours later, arriving at Halifax at
2 o'clock in the afternoon. However, a person wishing to
travel from Sydney to Montreal would leave Sydney at
6.30 in the morning and arrive in Montreal 26 hours and 26
minutes later.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Walking?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: You know, you might make it
faster walking. Allowing for stops, I doubt if that gives
you an average speed of 45 miles per hour.
The second train leaves Sydney at 11.15 a.m. It is not a
railiner, but a section of the train known as the Scotian
running from Halifax to Montreal. This section joins the
Halifax section at Truro. As this is a longer and heavier
train, one would expect it to take longer to travel the 230
miles from Sydney to Truro, and it does. It takes seven
hours and 15 minutes to make the run. A person going
from Sydney to Montreal by this train wîll arrive at 20
minutes to three the following afternoon, after having
spent 28 hours and 25 minutes travelling 1,010 miles. And
this is 1974! By no stretch of the imagination can we say
that the passenger service given by the CNR to people in
eastern Nova Scotia is a fast one. It is not designed and
planned to attract passengers.
A person going to Halifax from Sydney by the second
train would leave Sydney at 11.15 in the morning and
arrive in Halifax, 295 miles away, at 10.30 that evening, Il
hours and 15 minutes after he lef t home. Because he must
change trains at Truro, hîs arrival in Halifax at 10.30 is
contingent on the Scotian from Montreal being on time. 1
should also tell you, without going into detail, that the
passenger service from Montreal to Sydney is worse. One
train arrives in Sydney at 3 in the morning.
Honourable senators, I have taken my facts; from the
Canadian National timetable now in effect. The timetable
will change this coming Saturday. Perhaps the service will
be better, but I am not optimistic enough to think so.
I mentioned the running time between Sydney and
Truro. At present it is not that fast. There is a "slow" order
out that passenger trains must not travel over 30 miles an
hour between Sydney and Truro. The trains were slow
before, but now the situation is worse.
On Sunday last a passenger train which lef t Sydney at
11.15 a.m. arrived in Truro, 230 miles away, at 7.50 in the
evening.
I understand that this "slow" order-or perhaps "slower
order" is the correct term-is necessary because of the

SENATE DEBATES
poor condition of the roadbed. It is said that it might
heave because of frost. Is it not strange that the same
danger does not appear to exist on other roadbeds? I
believe the roadbed is in poor condition because it has
been neglected, and I see nothing in the bill which definitely states that part of the millions voted for the CNR
will go toward improving this roadbed.
It so happens that I was on that 11.15 train last Sunday.
It departed from Truro one hour and 35 minutes late. Yet
some time during the night that lost time was made up
without difficulty or undue haste. This leads me to the
conclusion that the running time between Nova Scotia and
Montreal could be cut substantially without difficulty to
anyone.
The time has come for the CNR to be frank with us.
Their off icials should tell us just what is the situation, and
whether or not they are actively discouraging passenger
traffic. Recently it has become known, but not through
any official announcement, that there is to be further
deterioration in the service. Until now a sleeping car
formed part of that section of the Scotian leaving Sydney
at 11.15 in the morning. This meant that one could occupy
one's sleeping accommodation, whether it be a berth,
roomette or bedroom, when one boarded the train at
Sydney or at any point between Sydney and Truro. I now
understand that this procedure is to be changed and that
sleeping accommodation will be provided only from Truro,
which will result in further deterioration in an already
poor service.
We in Nova Scotia-at least, in the eastern part-are a
long-suffering people from the point of view of railway
passenger service. We have been resigned to a very inferior service, but now is the time to tell the Canadian National Railways that enough is enough. Now is the time to tell
them to reverse themselves, to reverse their thinking and
to begin to improve the service rather than to continue
their deliberate efforts to reduce it. Some people believe,
and I am one of them, that the Canadian National Railway
Company is operating on a deliberate policy to discourage
passenger travel.
*

(1420)

An Hon. Senator: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: They are doing so, of course, so
that they can apply to the Canadian Transport Commission for permission to reduce passenger service to one
train a day. Once they get it down to one a day, there will
be a further deterioration in the service so that they can
again apply to the Canadian Transport Commission to
have the service done away with completely and put in a
bus service, such as happened in Newfoundland.
Honourable senators, I see nothing in this bill which
would lead me to believe that the CNR intends to spend
any substantial sum of money to improve its roadbed
between Sydney and Truro, or to relocate it where it
should be relocated. Yet, the need is there. For years we
have been told that the roadbed is too rough and that the
speed has to be reduced because of the number of curves,
but nothing has been done about it. One would think that
the feeling is that if left alone long enough the roadbed
will repair itself. Well, it will not. I say the time bas come,
in fact it is long overdue, for a complete overhaul and
renovation of the Canadian National Railways System
[Hon. Mr. Macdonald.]

April 25, 1974

from Sydney to Truro, including the relocation of its main
line through Sydney.
Honourable senators will have noticed that I have not
mentioned freight or express service. Suffice it to say that
I understand it is just as bad as the passenger service. I
realize I have perhaps beenHon. Mr. Martin: Eloquent.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Well, I have perhaps been talking
outside the ambit of the bill. However, I feel very strongly
about this matter. I wanted to bring it to the attention of
the Senate and, through the Senate, to the attention of the
management of the Canadian National Railways, although
I hold no hope whatsoever that they will pay any attention
to my remarks.
Hon. Lionel Choquette: Honourable senators, I should
like to add a few comments to those of Senator Macdonald's. I, too, am convinced that the CNR is determined
to discourage passenger travel.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: The CPR, too.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Probably the CPR as well. I want
to relate a few examples of my personal experiences with
both railways.
A few years ago I had an important matter to deal with
in Toronto. I took an airplane from Ottawa, but when we
arrived at the Toronto airport we could not land because
of the fog, so we returned to Ottawa. I was somewhat
reluctant to telephone my clients in Toronto and tell them
to expect me the next day because of the delay due to the
weather conditions, so I took the train from Ottawa to
Toronto. On that train I met several friends. Some were
MPP's from Ottawa and the vicinity, whom I invited to be
my guests in the smoking compartment. At that, they
laughed at me. They said, "You must not travel very often
by train. There is no such thing as a smoking compartment. If you have a roomette, then stick to that; get
yourself well ensconced in there and drink all by yourself,
if that is what you have in mind."
Here we have a train travelling between Ottawa and
Toronto and you cannot even sit down with your friends
and smoke a cigar. In addition, all night long you have
shunting at every village and town en route.
On one other occasion I had to address a meeting in
CochraneHon. Mr. Martin: Was it a political meeting?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: It was.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Senator
about that.

Martin knows

something

Hon. Mr. Langlois: You should too.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: I tried to get a berth and they just
laughed at me. They said, "You obviously don't travel
often by rail. There is no berth." I had to go on the train at
quarter to twelve.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: At night?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Yes. There was no berth available.
When I arrived in North Bay somebody told me there was
a Chinese restaurant there, that I could take a taxi and
rest there while waiting for the next train to take me to

April 25, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

Cochrane. I took a taxi and went there. The next train that
picked me up got me to Cochrane at 6 o'clock the next day.
Hon. Mr. Bourget: Af ter the election?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: No. What kind of service is that?
When you try to go to Montreal by train, you get a train
here at 8 o'clock in the morning; they don't care what you
look like or where you are going. There is no place to have
breakfast; some chap may come along and offer you a
sandwich, or you can go to the car where he is and you buy
a wrapped sandwich. I am convinced that the CNR and
CPR want to discourage passenger travel. When I heard
my good friend and deskmate Senator Macdonald talk
about this, I wanted to add these remarks. I am convinced
that these two railways want to discourage passengers.
Hon. Margaret Norrie: Honourable senators, I should
like to add a few remarks on the CNR and CPR service.
This phenomenon has been going on for 20 years; it is not
just a sudden change. I was surprised the other day when I
came up by train. I had not been on one recently. I checked
in a couple of bags, but when I got to Ottawa they were
not on the train. I was told I should have checked the bags
two days before, then I would have had them in Ottawa
that day. I registered a complaint and asked why somebody had not told me. I was told, "Oh well, you are
supposed to know that." People who cannot check their
bags have to carry them and have them in the compartment, although there is not enough room there for anything but a wee little bag. It is terrible if we cannot have a
baggage car on all passenger trains to carry the luggage
along with us.
In addition to that, for years and years and years passenger trains have been phasing out. The railways will call
a meeting in the countryside where passenger trains are
probably losing money. At the first meeting there will be a
large turnout of people complaining that the passenger
train is to be discontinued. Then the service will be
retained for a while longer. In another year or two another
meeting will be called, when fewer people will attend, but
the service continues. In another short space of time there
will be another meeting, when nobody but the officials
will turn up. Then the railways say, "Nobody wants a
passenger train. We are going to discontinue it." That is
the way they handle it.
Hon. Edgar Fournier: Honourable senatorsHon. Mr. Choquette: The expert on the subject.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The CNR's friend.
Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche): I want
to endorse everything that has been said. I want honourable senators to know that I am a frequent user of CNR,
because I have no choice. Let me give an example. My
plans are to go home this weekend. I would be leaving this
afternoon at 5 o'clock by CNR. I would stay in Montreal
tonight and board the train tomorrow morning at 8 o'clock.
I would take the train as f ar as Quebec City, change trains
there, board the dayliner, and if everything works properly I might be home by 8 o'clock tomorrow night.

I imagine that the sandwiches they serve on Friday
were made the previous Friday, but you are lucky if you
get one. The railway car is the only one and is long past its

27601-221

durability, being about 12 years old and out of service
most of the time. That train has no priority; it is on the
sidings most of the time to allow freight trains to go
through. Sometimes, when it starts, it has to be picked up
by another engine, to be hauled to Edmundston and back.
It is almost a waste of time to talk about this. We have
complained to the right places, but without success. The
CNR has two trains between Halifax and Montreal and
they are used on the main line, leaving the central part of
Nova Scotia without any train facilities. Some senators
may ask why I do not travel by Air Canada. This is
possible in the summertime, but when I fly from Ottawa
to Fredericton I am still 185 miles from my home, and that
final journey takes another f ive or six hours.
I have a major complaint about the taxi service from the
station here into Ottawa. I have made many strong complaints about this. When a train comes in there are not
more than five or six taxis, to deal with 100 people. They
will take only one person per taxi, and they disappear
quickly. They produce a bus which is in fair condition, but
the passengers are crowded in like sardines, one over the
other, and there are no luggage facilities. The bus driver
waits about 15 minutes, waiting for taxis to come in, and
then he departs. There is no excuse for this. The company
which has the franchise does not live up to its obligations.
It is supposed to provide a taxi service.
Hon. Mr. Deschatelets: Would the honourable senator
permit an intervention at this point? May I remind the
house that when it was decided to move the railway
station from centre town to where it is now, an undertaking was given by the railway companies to provide adequate taxi service.
Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche): I was
coming to that. I remember when the agreement was
signed. I was in the committee. We met with the people
who wanted to demolish the old station, and a commitment was made to provide taxi facilities. It was not too
bad for the first year, but the service has been deteriorating ever since and now there is almost no taxi service.
This is the reason why hundreds of school children from
Montreal, coming to visit the Parliament in Ottawa, come
by bus. They used to come by train. The provincial bus
company gives good hourly service between Ottawa and
Montreal, and must be moving a thousand people every
day, while the CNR is not doing anything.
I might add that between Montreal and Edmundston the
transport company has three buses running daily, carrying
at least a hundred passengers per day. Travelling by bus
becomes tiresome if the distance is over 200 miles, so if the
Canadian National had a good service people would use it.
Hon. Josie D. Quart: Honourable senators, I had a
rather strange experience, although a funny one. It was
taken as a joke, but since everyone has a gripe this is a
funny one. On July 12 last year I had to go to TorontoHon. Mr. Martin: What day?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Orange Day.
Hon. Mrs. Quart: As a matter of fact, I was going toHon. Mr. Benidcickson: Toronto.
Hon. Mrs. Quart: Of all places, Toronto.

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: On that day?
Hon. Mrs. Quart: That is right. It was the twelfth. I had
made a plane reservation and, as some senators know, I
had had an operation some months before. I was advised
that I had better make arrangements to have a wheelchair
at Toronto airport. I had checked here two weeks previous
and everything was fine. When I got to the Maple Leaf
lounge that day, July 12, I checked again about the chair.
It was a very warm day in Toronto-probably because it
was the 12th of JulyHon. Mr. Benidickson: Did they have a parade for you?
Hon. Mrs. Quart: They had not. There was a chair
which was being kept for a man. I did see a gentleman get
on the plane and he looked pretty decrepit and had crutches and I thought the chair was for him. I said to the air
hostess, "Look here, I am very sorry, but I have to have a
chair." She said: "Well, madam, we will get one for you.
There is one waiting for a man." I said: "That is very
strange, I checked two weeks ago and also this morning
about a chair." She said, "If you wait, we will get a chair
for you." I said good naturedly, "There is nothing else I
can do." I realized there was not much use in complaining.
Here I was, a captive, and they had said they would get me
a chair.
As the time was passing and the plane was to depart for
Chicago, I enquired again. She said: "We have very few
chairs, and that is one of the reasons why it is taking so
long." To make a long story short, at that the poor air
terminal employee put his head in and asked: "Would
Senator Quart be ready?" I looked at him and replied:
"Would I be ready? It is my middle name." With that there
was great confusion and the air hostess apologized. A
uniformed man in charge came and apologized too, saying
that he expected the senator to be a man. He did not know
there were women in the Senate. Two people made this
remark to me.

•

(1440)

Finally the kind gentleman helped me into the chair and
we started off about 15 minutes late. Unfortunately, in the
meantime my granddaughter had been given the wrong
instructions and was waiting in the wrong place for me. At
any rate, as we were going along the gentleman said, "My
gracious. I didn't know there were any women senators." I
explained that I was one and that there were six others
and then I asked him, "Are you a Canadian? Do you live in
Canada? Don't you know that there are women in the
Senate?" To which he replied, "No, I never did. I will have
to tell my wife that I drove a woman senator"-as if this
was something extraordinary.
When I finally got there my baggage was going round
and round on the conveyor, and after I had introduced this
man to my granddaughter he said to her, "Did you know
your grandmother was a senator?" Well, she started to
giggle like nobody's business and he said, "Well, you
know, nobody else on Air Canada knew she was a senator.
I am glad you did."
Another time-and I will try to make this short-after
World War II, I was doing some travelling with respect to
a rehabilitation committee. Another senator and I were
travelling on the same train, and the people responsible
for making reservations had assigned us the same draw[Hon. Mrs. Quart.]

April 25, 1974

ingroom. I suppose to them it was just a matter of doubling-up two male senators, members of the committee, in
order to save money, but the result was that I was supposed to share a double bedroom with the other senator.
However, being a gentleman, he left the room to me. I
don't know where he went or where he slept, but he didn't
sleep with me, anyway!
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, I would be
remiss in my duty if I did not at this stage underline the
excellence of the work done by the Standing Senate Committee on Transport and Communications in its consideration of this bill. I think the Senate did a marvellous job
and that we were fortunate in having before us excellent
witnesses, including the President of the CNR, Mr. MacMillan, and the Vice-President of Public Affairs for Air
Canada, Mr. Taylor. All witnesses were co-operative and
well informed on the operations of their respective
corporations.
There is no doubt that the bill received thorough examination owing to the pertinent and penetrating questions
put to the witnesses.
Despite the excellent turn-out of senators, many of our
colleagues in this house were unfortunately unable to
attend the two days of sittings of the committee owing to
the fact that there were other committee meetings. As a
matter of fact, I am sure that had certain of the senators
who made remarks today had the opportunity of putting
their concerns before the witnesses during the committee's
two days of hearings, the officials of both Air Canada and
the Canadian National Railways would have been only too
pleased to comment upon them. They would have been
well equipped to give explanations and supply the information that has been requested this afternoon.
I will now deal with a point which was raised in committee and in the house this afternoon by Senator Benidickson, when he referred to an article in the Financial
Post of April 20, 1974. One can hardly call this article a
"scoop," because it refers to information which was made
public first in 1972 and then again in 1973.
By way of further explanation may I point out that the
government entered into an option agreement with the
Hawker-Siddeley Group Limited of London, England, to
purchase the shares of de Havilland Aircraft of Canada
Limited. The agreement was made in October of 1972, and
the 1973-74 supplementary estimates included an amount
of $10 million to cover part of the purchase price. The 1974
main estimates, under the Trade Industrial Program vote
L20, included an amount of $28.8 million to cover the
balance of the estimated purchase price.
If one refers to the printed proceedings of the Senate
committee and to the evidence given before the Commons
Standing Committee on Finance, Trade and Economic
Affairs of March 26, 1974, one finds again a reference made
to this option.
The option expires on June 28, 1974, and to my knowledge no extension of the option has been made. I do not
know if the option is going to be exercised or not, but
regarding the Air Canada Comstock proposal to which
Senator Benidickson specifically referred, that proposal
was to purchase and merge de Havilland and Canadair,

April 25, 1974
April 25, 1974

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

and it was made public in a Financial Post article of
November 3, 1973.
That is all the information I have about these two
proposals, and I hope that that information which I have
just given the Senate will satisfy Senator Benidickson
with respect to this question.
Hon. Mr. Benidickson: Perhaps you can find the answer
to this. Is there a likelihood that anything to do with an
option to buy de Havilland Aircraft and Canadair will get
into the balance sheet of Air Canada, with the result that,
if they are operated at a loss, it will spoil the fine record of
Air Canada as an air transport company?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I am afraid I am unable to answer
that, because I consider it to be a question of government
policy. I am certainly quite prepared to agree with the
senator that there might be some risk of jeopardizing the
present good record of Air Canada if such a purchase were
made. But that remains to be proven, and the decision will
be based on a judgment of value by the Government of
Canada and not left to Air Canada alone to decide.
Hon. Mr. Martin: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Coming back now to the pertinent
questions asked this afternoon and the criticisms voiced
by my honourable friend Senator Macdonald, I should like
to tell him that yesterday in committee Mr. MacMillan, the
President of the CNR, gave many explanations as to why
trains were not travelling as fast as one would like. For
example, he mentioned the turbo train which did not
prove so good on its trial trips between Montreal and
Toronto because it failed to achieve the speed records it
was supposed to set. According to Mr. MacMillan, one of
the main reasons the train did not live up to expectations
was that there were too many curves and too many railway crossings, which meant that the train was constantly
having to slow down to negotiate the curves or to go
through crossings at reasonable speeds.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: And did nobody laugh at that?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: No, nobody laughed at all. Mr. MacMillan was most serious about it.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Well, they should have laughed.
He is a joker!
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I am not prepared to agree with that.
I must disagree with the honourable senator. Mr. MacMillan was quite serious about the matter. Indeed, these are
genuine engineering problems not easily to be remedied.
Moreover, he indicated the amount of money that the
Japanese have spent to facilitate their rapid transit by
trains. It is almost unbelievable; and when one bears in
mind that the Japanese do not have the severe climatic
conditions we have in this country, then one can see that
it will be even more costly in Canada. This is not said in
any way to destroy or minimize the pertinent remarks
made by my honourable friend, and I am sure that these
remarks will be brought to the attention of the authorities
of the Canadian National Railways and that they will
receive due consideration.
*

(1450)

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is all they will receive.

Hon. Mr. Langlois: Well, that would be an achievement
anyway.
Coming back to Senator Choquette's remarks about the
CN-and he added CP-seemingly discouraging the passenger service, one has to bear in mind that these railway
companies have to meet the very stiff competition of both
bus and air services. Reference was made this afternoon, I
think by Senator Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche), to
competing bus services. One has to admit that it is more
expensive to operate a railroad service than a bus service,
and it will never have the flexibility of the bus service,
which can take its passengers anywhere and drop them off
where they want. The railways could never achieve that
kind of service without spending money to an extent
never known before. One has to bear all this in mind.
Air services are more rapid, even though I myself have
had some experiences which would seem to disprove this
statement. Air service is faster and bus service is more
flexible. This is the stiff kind of competition the railroads
are not ready to meet, and I don't think they will ever be
able to meet it.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Before my honourable friend
leaves that point, I hope he has in mind the general
complaint that passenger travel is being discouraged. I
should like to ask him if that is true. Does he not think
that these two companies want to discourage passengers,
having regard to the attitude that they have taken in
recent years, and the atrocious service that they have been
giving?
I am asking you, senator, whether you think they want
to discourage passenger service. Do you not think that we,
travelling from Ottawa to Montreal, should get a better
service than we are getting now? Do you not think we
could have breakfast on the train, and have a social drink
served to us? Do you not think there could be somebody to
walk along the train and ask, "Are you pleased? Is there
something I can do to render your short trip from Ottawa
to Montreal more pleasant?" That is something that is not
done.
I am going to ask you the other question. When one
cannot get a berth from Ottawa to Cochrane, or from
Cochrane to Ottawa, do you think they intend to improve
that service, or are they convinced that passenger service
should be discontinued?
You see the way I ask the question? You know, it isHon. Mr. Martin: We can see you are concerned.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: I like to pin them down.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: To say the least, your question was a
long ona.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: No, it was simply: Do they want to
discourage passenger travel?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I cannot speak for the CNR, but I
have no indication that they are trying to discourage the
use of their passenger trains. Senator Choquette referred
to a poor train service apparently existing between
Ottawa and Montreal, but I can tell him that between
Montreal and Quebec the CNR has improved its passenger
service with the Rapido which takes one from Montreal to
Quebec in three hours. There is a meal service, and drinks
are served, too, on board that train, but that does not

SENATE DEBATES
prevent the majority of people travelling between these
two cities from using either the bus service or Air Canada.
Even though Air Canada is now using DC-9 aircraft
instead of the smaller Viscounts on that route, it is still
not able to cope with the flow of traffic. The quality of the
service is not in question because, as I said a while ago, it
is impossible for the railroads to compete with any chance
of success with these more rapid and flexible passenger
services. That is the only reason. If my honourable friend
deduces from that that the railroads do not want passenger traffic, all I can say is that it is something I am not
ready to accept.
I sympathize with Senator Fournier in his travel difficulties between Ottawa and his home town. I have had
occasion to use that service-not as often as he does, but
on quite a few occasions-and I will grant him that it is
far from being a first-rate service. But, speaking for
myself, I have had bad experiences between Ottawa and
Montreal.
I remember one day about two years ago being in Montreal on some professional business, and having to be in
Ottawa for an eight o'clock sitting of the Senate. I had a
seat on a flight leaving Montreal at about six o'clock,
which should have arrived here in plenty of time for the
sitting. In mid-afternoon I was told by Air Canada that,
due to a snow storm, there was a serious possibility that
the aircraft would be delayed, and they suggested using
the CNR. I went to the Central Station in Montreal, at
around 4.00 or 4.30 p.m. and boarded the train which
should have left an hour earlier but which was late on
account of that same storm. I always travel in the economy section on aircraft, and on the train I had a seat in the
coach section. At about 9.30 in the evening the train
became stuck in a snowbank at Alexandria, and we had to
wait for a snowplow to come from either Ottawa or Montreal, and we were rescued at something like 2 o'clock in
the morning. I arrived in Ottawa at 5.15 a.m. to learn, to
my great surprise, that the flight had left Montreal on
schedule. I could have been here at 7.15 the previous
evening, but I chose the train and arrived at 5 o'clock in
the morning.
Hon. Mr. Martin: It is too bad that Senator Choquette
was not on the train. You would have had a lot of fun.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I had an experience on that occasion
similar to that which Senator Choquette related this afternoon. I had some of the stale sandwiches of the CNR, and
that is all I had for supper that night. But these are
situations and circumstances which prevent trains from
competing as they should with the air services and bus
services.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Do you not think that if the CNR
is going to be in the red every year it could ask for a few
hundred thousand dollars more to give better service?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I am glad the honourable senator
brought up this question of being in the red, because we
were told yesterday by the president of the CNR that the
company would have finished the 1973 fiscal year with a
surplus of about $10 million if it had not been for the
strike. During that strike the CNR lost some $61 million in
revenue, and had to incur something like $30 million in
extraordinary expenses. The company would have been in
[Hon. Mr. Langlois.]

April 25, 1974

the black by $10 million if it had not been for the strike,
and it is expected that there will be a surplus this year.
I should like to be able to satisfy honourable senators
with regard to the questions they put to me this afternoon,
but unfortunately I am not speaking for the CNR; I am
just trying to pass on to the Senate information that I
obtained in the course of my study of this bill, and the two
days I spent on the Standing Senate Committee on Transport and Communications when it was considered.
*

(1500)

Honourable senators, I should like to close my remarks
by again inviting you all, the next time there is a committee meeting of this kind, and if you are free from other
duties, to come and take part in the proceedings. That is
where questions can be put directly to those responsible
for the operation of these two crown corporations.
Hon. Daniel Riley: Honourable senators, I had not
intended to speak this afternoon but having heard the
eloquent speeches made by others I feel I should add a few
words of my own to what has already been said.
As far as the CNR is concerned, I can agree with Senator
Macdonald, Senator Choquette and Senator Fournier
(Madawaska-Restigouche) in respect to what appears to
be a concerted effort on the part of both railroad companies to eliminate passenger services as much as possible. I
can understand that where they make a profit they will
give better service, perhaps, but it seems they are determined to downgrade those services which do not produce
much revenue, and to discourage the traveller from using
them.
Somebody mentioned yesterday that he hoped that some
of the money being made available to the CNR under this
bill would be used to upgrade the service. I am going to
suggest that some of the money be used to improve the
roadbeds in the province of New Brunswick. I say that
because we have had too many derailments there in the
last year or two, and I feel that we are going to experience
a major disaster unless the roadbeds are upgraded and
maintained in such a way that the danger to persons and
to property will be eliminated to the greatest possible
extent. I understand that earlier this year the Canadian
Transport Commission upbraided the CNR for the number
of derailments that have occurred, and told that corporation to get busy repairing those rails.
There is really no difficulty in keeping the roadbed as it
should be, because they have all the necessary equipment,
including special cars that travel behind the regular trains
at times. They also have smaller vehicles that travel over
the lines to assist them in keeping those rails and roadbeds inspected and in good condition at all times. If they
are doing this now, then why are we having all these
derailments?
I do not want to be too critical of Air Canada, honourable senators, because in the main this corporation is
doing a marvellous job. There is the old story that floats
around-and somebody mentioned in committee that it is
said about all airlines-to the effect that Air Canada is the
best in the world in the air and the worst on the ground. I
do not particularly subscribe to that story, but in one or
two areas Air Canada certainly needs a great deal of

Anril 25. 1974

SENATE DEBATES
EAE
SNT

upgrading, and one of these is in the area of handling, or
perhaps I should say mishandling, baggage.
I have some figures which were given to me by Air
Canada, and which indicate that in 1971 that company
handled 11. 1 million pieces of baggage; in 1972, 12.5 million
pieces; and in 1973, 15.1 million pieces. That is a lot of
baggage, and I give them credit for handling it pretty well,
in general. Then Air Canada says that the number of bags
mishandled-and that is the word, "mishandled"; that is to
say, baggage that did flot arrive with the passenger to
whom it belonged-in 1971 amounted to 37,000 pieces.
Now, that may flot be a large proportion, relatively speaking, but it is disturbing in that it means that 37,000 passengers of Air Canada were inconvenienced, many of them
seriously, by the mishandling of their baggage. In 1972, out
of 12.5 million pieces of baggage, 65,000 pieces were
mishandled. Again, this may not be a large proportion, but
it represented a serious inconvenience to a large number
of passengers. In 1973, of the total of 15.5 million pieces of
baggage, 135,000 were mishandled. The number is becoming alarming.
Excuses were off ered, and we were told it was due to the
rail strike, and that sort of thing. Well, the rail strike be
darned, as f ar as I am concerned. There must be better
methods of handling this baggage than are presently being
used. I suggested in committee that they should revert to
the tag system-that is, where a tag is tied to the handle of
the bag. I do not have the relevant figures, but I am sure
that when they were using that system the number of
pieces of baggage being mishandled was much smaller
than it is now.
Honourable senators, let me tell you of an experience of
my own. On February 10 last, approximately, I lef t Ottawa
by air for Saint John. At the airport they tagged my bag
and checked it through to Saint John. It was tagged by
means of a slip of paper. I said to the man who was
tagging it, "That is not a very strong tag," and he replied,
"Oh yes, that will withstand 40 pounds of pressure." At
Montreal I noticed another person carrying a bag on which
the tag was haîf torn. I realized that it would need just a
little tug to tear it off altogether, and if such were to
happen it would become another piece of mishandled
baggage.
1 changed planes in Montreal-a process which I think
they describe as "interlining," although it is flot really
interlining in the sense of transferring to, another carrier.
They say they use tags with string when the baggage is
"interlined." When 1 got to Saint John, one of the ticket
agents met me at the gate and said, "We have to apologize
to you; your bag was lef t in Montreal, but we have had a
phone caîl saying it will be delivered here tomorrow morning at Il o'clock." I was not away from home s0 I was not
greatly inconvenienced by the fact that the bag did not
arrive with me, but it did not arrive at il o'clock the
following morning either. In fact, it has not arrived yet. I
made inquiries and was told, "A caîl was made to Montreal
and the man in charge said he put the bag on the plane
that morning." I can only conclude that it disintegrated in
mid-air, because it certainly did flot reach me in Saint
John.
I made further inquiries as to what happens to these
bags that are mishandled, and was told that they are

processed through a central tracing agency. Apparently,
when you get down to the nitty-gritty, this central tracing
agency is a storage place in a hangar in Montreal. I was
told at one time that I could not go and look for my bag in
that hangar, because of security precautions. I admit that I
have been told since that 1 can go, and I have been invited
to go.
e(1510)
Getting back to the mishandling and loss of bags, they
say:
0f the bags received in Central Tracing, approximately 60% are eventually returned to their owners.
What has happened to the other 40 per cent? Have they
disintegrated in mid-air like mine? Were they eaten on
board when they ran out of f ood? That is an alarming
figure.
Although Air Canada is encouraging passenger travel, it
is discouraging passengers fromn checking their baggage.
Something should be done about it. I seldom f ly without
hearing someone, either on the plane or at the airport,
complaining about lost baggage.
Air Canada says that 85 per cent of mishandled baggage
is returned within 24 hours. If you have to stay in a hotel,
in a strange town, for 24 hours without a change of
clothing, or even a change of underwear, you could probably buy disposable diapers or something like that, but
you will more likely have to buy a whole new outfit. It is
ridiculous, and it is serious. Air Canada should be admonished for its baggage handling.
I intend to pursue the odyssey of my bag further. They
have a dlaims section. They send you a dlaim form and ask
you the value of certain items, some of which may have
been gifts. I was asked to make a solemn declaration as to
the value of articles I had received as gifts. Should I go to
the donors of those gifts and ask, "How much did you pay
for these, and where did you buy them?" I shall not
mention the donors of those gifts and I do not intend to set
down on the dlaim f orm any value, or make a solemn
declaration as to the values. I intend to visit this central
clearance agency, or whatever it is, in Montreal.
I asked Air Canada how many bags were in that hangar
at any one time, and was told that at the 1973 peak period
the highest number of bags on hand at Central Tracing
was 4,000. Imagine anyone going into a hangar in Montreal
and trying to, find his bag from among 4,000. Again, it is
ridiculous.
I shaîl conclude by saying that if Air Canada is to
maintain its reputation for a high degree of efficiency in
handling passengers, it had better provide an improved
method of handling baggage.
[Translation]
Han. Azellus Denis: Honourable senators, since now
seems to be the time to complain about various railway
and airline companies, I want to add my own remarks, flot
to object to the passing of this bill but because it would be
a good thing, nevertheless, that a copy of Hansard be sent
to those responsible for the complaints voiced by some
senators. For example, when one calîs Central station in
Montreal to inquire about train schedules, the answer is in
the f orm of a recording which. goes: "The line is busy.
Please hold the line and you will eventually get an

SENATE DEBATES
answer." Three times I held it for as long as forty-five
minutes and it was still busy. This was on a Sunday
afternoon.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Did you have a nice conversation?
Hon. Mr. Denis: No, I could not speak to anybody; I
heard a woman's voice, but it was on a recording.
Hon. Mr. Martin: What did she say?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: A man your age cannot expect anything else.
Hon. Mr. Denis: I am not surprised that honourable
senators suggest that these companies are discouraging
passengers from using their services. If you arrive in
Montreal at about eleven o'clock at night, try and get a
taxi-which should be part of the services. They like us so
much that they keep us at the station, and there is no way
out of it.
So it would be a great thing if at some time someone
took it upon himself to send them copies of Hansard, not to
object to such an important bill-we do not want to cancel
the railways and the airlines in Canada-but it is good
that from time to time those in charge be made aware that
there are actually major complaints. Those complaints
come mainly from those out of central areas. Those are
uneconomical services. After all, if the CNR is owned by
the government and if the government made an independent company out of it to help the public, it is precisely to
give greater access to those living in remote and
uneconomical areas. Private companies would not look
after them. That is why the CNR must extend services to
those areas in this country that do not return enough
money. That is why we have deficits every year. It is even
interesting and encouraging to hear Senator Langlois
report Mr. MacMillan, the President of the CNR, as
saying that had it not been for bad luck this year there
would have been a profit, but he expects one for next year.

Hon. Donald Cameron: Honourable senators, the discussion this afternoon has confirmed the feeling I have
had for some time that one of the must useful things the
Senate could do is to constitute the Standing Senate Committee on Transport and Communications a special committee to examine all aspects of transportation in Canada,
but excluding the structure of rates, because that is an
indeterminable problem. We have had many studies on
freight rates, and so on.
Canada is lagging f ar behind other countries in adapting
to the modern technology of transportation, particularly
with regard to passenger trains.
For example, one is able to travel from Derby to London
in England on an ordinary train at 115 miles an hour.
There is a train going into service this coming fall which
will travel at 155 miles an hour on the existing track and
under the present signalling system. In West Germany the
train from Frankfurt to Lahr, where the Canadian forces
are located, travels in excess of 100 miles an hour. That is
the norm. Here in Canada we have the turbo train, which
so far has been a disaster. That is the best we can do.
I am sure there are advantages in adapting to modern
technology, particularly with regard to our railway passenger service. It would apply also to other forms of
[Hon. Mr. Denis.]

April 25, 1974

transportation. I am thinking in terms of new kinds of
freight cars for moving grain, sulphur, coal, wheat, and so
on. There is also the question of overlapping in services,
which involves a matter of policy. The whole organization
of transportation in Canada represents about 20 per cent
of our GNP, and is certainly large enough to warrant our
going into the matter in some depth.
I shall not make a motion today, but I would be prepared
to move at a later date that we ask the Standing Senate
Committee on Transport and Communications to undertake a special series of hearings at which could be heard
representatives from the railways-the CPR and CNRthe trucking companies and the airlines. It would be a
useful exercise. I should like to explore the matter further,
and then give notice of a motion of that type.

FARM IMPROVEMENT LOANS ACT
SMALL BUSINESSES LOANS ACT
FISHERIES IMPROVEMENT LOANS ACT
BILL TO AMEND-SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned
debate on the motion of Senator Molgat, for second reading of Bill C-14, to amend the Farm Improvement Loans
Act, the Small Businesses Loans Act and the Fisheries
Improvement Loans Act.
Hon. Chesley W. Carter: Honourable senators, I should
like to begin by extending my compliments to Senator
Molgat for the very lucid and concise explanation he gave

April 25, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

of Bill C-14 to the Senate yesterday. As Senator Molgat
pointed out, Bill C-14 extends the life of three other pieces
of legislation for another three years, those being the
Farm Improvement Loans Act, the Small Businesses
Loans Act and the Fisheries Improvement Loans Act. In
addition, it increases the aggregate of the loans that can be
made during that period, as well as the limits of individual
loans from the present $25,000 to $50,000. This afternoon I
intend to confine my remarks on Bill C-14, for the most
part, as it relates to the Small Businesses Loans Act and
the Fisheries Improvement Loans Act.
On many occasions while I was a member of the House
of Commons I advocated that legislation be passed to
provide loans for small businesses similar to that which
provided loans for farmers and fishermen. I say "similar" because the needs are different and, consequently, the
legislation should not be identical.
The main reason for my interest in the small businesses
community is that it forms the backbone of our economy.
The small businesses are the greatest source of employment and the greatest source of new jobs in our economy.
The economies of many of our provinces depend almost
entirely on small enterprise. That is particularly true of
the Atlantic provinces and of my own province, Newfoundland. In fact, because of the distribution of their
resources and the transportation facilities, as well as other
factors, many provinces are not conducive to the development of large industry.
Another reason for my interest in small enterprise is
that it is conducive to labour stability. It is not good for
any province or country to have too many eggs in one
basket. In a province such as Newfoundland, for example,
ten small enterprises employing 100 people each are certainly far more beneficial to the economy than one enterprise employing a thousand people. By the same token, a
hundred small enterprises employing ten people each are
far more beneficial than one large enterprise employing
1,000 people. Also, small industry tends to be labour intensive, whereas large industries tend to be capital intensive.
A good example of that is to be found in the new refineries
that are being built. One refinery has just been completed
in Newfoundland, and another one is being negotiated. A
refinery that costs $200 million to build will only employ
between two and three hundred people.
So, small business enterprises are very important to the
Canadian economy, and it is important that we pass the
kind of legislation that will help small businesses to develop. They require this type of assistance because, by
their very nature, they lack the sources of credit which are
available to larger enterprises. Large industries can more
easily get bank credit, and in times of tight money they
have access to bonds and other forms of credit and financing which are not available to small businesses.
As Senator Molgat mentioned yesterday, the Small Businesses Loans Act dates back to 1961. I remember the
circumstances quite well. At that time I was a member of
the Opposition in the other place. It was a time of high
unemployment, and this legislation was brought in-

Hon. Mr. Carter: I remember the "Martin" statistics.
This legislation was brought in as part of a legislative
package to deal with the unemployment situation at that
time. I remember it so vividly because of my disappointment with it. It turned out to be more of a "make-work"
legislative program than a program of real assistance to
small businesses.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: Senator Martin was always talking
about that.

The Hon. the Speaker:
senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.

Hon. Mr. Greene: Tory times are hard times.

The essence of the legislation lies in the purposes for
which these loans are granted. If you look at the bill
carefully you will see that the loans are made available to
small businesses that want to undertake construction,
repairs, maintenance or enlargement of their premises, or
for moving their premises from one site to another. All of
these activities are designed to make work.
It is true that Bill C-14 enlarges the scope of the legislation somewhat by making loans available for the purchase
of land for new sites. It also increases, as I said earlier, the
limits on individual loans from $25,000 to $50,000, and it
redefines a small business as on'e with a gross annual
revenue of $1 million, as opposed to the $500,000 which is
the present definition.
0 (1530)

Nevertheless, it still remains largely make-work legislation, part of a make-work program. It is all right as far as
it goes. My disappointment stems from the fact that it does
not touch the greatest need of small businessmen, which is
working capital and inventory capital. I know the standard argument of the government against this is that loans
of this nature should be made by the chartered banks or
by the Industrial Development Bank, and the government
does not want to compete with those institutions. There is
something to this argument, but not a great deal. There is
really no competition, because if the people we are trying
to help do not get loans under this legislation they will not
get them from the banks; the banks would not make these
loans anyway. In time of tight money these people
would have no chance at all. In my experience I have
known dozens of small businesses that could expand or
branch out into other areas of enterprise, but they could
not get the capital they needed to utilize the unused space
they already had.
From its inception in 1961 until the end of February this
year the number of loans made under the Small Businesses Loans Act was 30,575, for a total value of $294,352,160. These figures vary slightly from those given by Senator Molgat last night because they are for a different
period. There are all types of statistics available-some for
the fiscal year ending March 31, 1973, some for the calendar year ending December 1973. The statistics I am giving
start from the inception of the legislation to the end of
February 1974. Of that total of $294,352,160, only $92,288,989 is still outstanding.
I have obtained some statistics respecting loans to small
businesses from the Department of Finance for the calendar year 1973 which, if honourable senators will permit, I
would like inserted in Hansard at this point for future
reference. They are in the form of a table.
Is that agreed, honourable

Hon. Mr. Carter: An analysis of these statistics shows
that for the calendar year 1973 the total number of boans
made was 2,999, for a total value of $30,821,483. From a
dloser examination of the figures it will be seen that by f ar
the greatest beneficiary was the province of Quebec,
where loans to a total value of $12,507,895 were made.
Quebec was followed by the two wealthy provinces of
British Columbia and Ontario. British Columbia had 523
boans amounting to $5,125,466; Ontario had 573 loans
aniounting to $6,009,470. These three provinces received
$23,642,831 of the $30.8 million for the last calendar year, or
almost 78 per cent of the total. In the Maritime provinces
of Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and
New Brunswick the boans totalled only $1,591,965, or about
17 per cent of the total. That is quite a large disparity in
the use being made of this legislation.
Hon. Mr. Bourget: What is the reason for it?
Hon. Mr. Carter: There must be a reason for it, and that
is what I arn leading up to. I think it is something we
should examine. Certainly it is not because we do not have
small businesses in the Maritimes, because we have nothing else. Lt certainly cannot be because the small businesses we have in the Maritimes do flot need the assistance. There must be another reason for it.
Hon. Mr. Bourget: Perhaps they do flot ask for it.
Hon. Mr. Carter: Lt could be that this legislation is flot
as well publicized as it should be, that il is flot as well
known. There may be other reasons as well.
I thought it would be useful, for myseif anyway, if I
could discover how many small businesses there are in
Canada. When I began to make inquiries I encountered al
kinds of difficulties. I first went to the Department of
Finance and asked if they could tell me how many smal
businesses there are in Canada that would qualify under
the definition they are now using of gross annual revenue
[The Hon. the Speaker.]

of $500,000. They were not able to give me any information
at ah. They apparently have not compiled any statistics of
that nature. I then made inquiries of Statistics Canada.
They were not very helpful either because they compute
statistics only on corporations with assets of under
$250,000.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Did you try Information Canada?
They are very useful.
Hon. Mr. Carter: No, I did not. Perhaps I should have. In
1971, Statistics Canada listed 177,671 corporations with
assets of under $250,000.
* (1540)

The most helpful information I gathered came from a
private concern called the Canadian Federation of
Independent Businessmen. Apparently they really looked
int this matter. They informed me that according to their
definition-I do not know exactly what their definition
is-they estimate there are about 500,000 small enterprises
in Canada, and if farmers are included the total is 675,000.
Honourable senators, this is important legislation. Lt is
intended to be very useful, but apparently some provinces
are making good use of il while others are not. Lt is
important that we try to find out the reasons for that, and
ask what can be done to make it more effective. If each of
these 500,000 small companies could increase its number of
employees by two, that would mean a million new jobs.
One of the best ways to deal with unemployment is to
encourage the expansion of small businesses.
On the Fisheries Improvement Loans Act, Senator
Molgat made it quite clear yesterday that none of the
money being spent under it is goverfiment money, but is
made up of boans by banks and other lending institutions
which are guaranteed by the government. This legisiation
enables the Minister of Finance to guarantee these boans.
If we look at the Fisheries Improvement Loans Act, and
the type and scope of the boans made, we see there is one
modifying factor. For fishermen there are loans available
under the Fisheries Development Act, and these are made
directly to fishermen by the government. Some weeks ago
royal assent was given to a further amendment of the
Fisheries Development Act, which enlarged its scope.
Loans made under the Fisheries Improvement Loans
Act are mainly for the purchase of gear, repairs to ships,
maintenance, and types of operation that would not be
eligible under the Fisheries Development Act.
When we analyze the boans under the Fisheries
Improvement Loans Act we see once again the samne pattern. Since ils inception in 1955, up to the end of February
1974, the number of boans made under the Fisheries
Improvement Loans Act totalled 600,151, for a total
amount of $34,017,336. The amount of boans outstanding at
the end of December 1973 was $19,569,436.
I have another table here, which I acquired from the
Department of Finance, with respect to boans made under
the Fisheries Improvement Loans Act, and if honourable
senators would agree I would like it inserted at this point
in Hansard, to make it easier for analysis by anyone who
reads it.

Hon. Mr. Carter: When we analyze the boans made
under the Fisheries Improvement Loans Act in the calendar year 1973, we find that the total number of loans was
1,095, for a total amount of $9,734,863. That averages out to
about $9,000 per boan.

If we break this down by provinces for the calendar year
we find that 499 boans, that is practically one-haîf of the
total, went to British Columbia, for a total value of $7,172,408. Another 285 boans went to Nova Scotia, for a total
value of $1,708,014. In other words, these two provinces
secured 78 per cent of the boans, and 91 per cent of the
total amount. 0f the remaining $854,441 over haîf of it,
or $470,265, went to Prince Edward Island in 208 boans, and
$133,450 went to Ontario in 12 boans, while New Brunswick
had 3 boans for a value of $30,000. That leaves only 8 per
cent for the provinces of Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince
Edward Island and Newfoundland.
This again raises the question of this wide disparity in
the use of the legislation. For my own province I can name
a number of reasons. One important reason is lack of
accessibility to banks. Most fishermen live in small isolated communities, and having to travel hundreds of miles to
a bank, do not take the trouble. There is also the reluctance of banks to make boans under this begislation
because of the low rate of interest. On the other hand, the
interest rates are too high and the security conditions are
too difficult for the would-be borrowers. It is difficuit,
however, to understand the great difference between Nova
Scotia and the other Maritime provinces.
Honourable senators, this is useful legislation, and I
fully support it. We should have a Senate committee look
into it to find the reasons for the disparities, and see what
can be done to make this legislation more ef fective.

There is one aspect of the matter which I think should
be brought to, the attention of the Senate, and which has
not been discussed. While listening to the debate, I was
struck and disturbed by the point that the economic situation of farmers, fishermen and smabb businessmen, after
all these years, is such that they are stili not considered
creditworthy by our lending institutions. For example, the
Farmn Improvement Loans Act was f irst introduced in
1944, yet thirty years later we find it is stibl necessary for
the government to guarantee the boans.
0 (1550)
The Fisheries Improvement Loans Act dates fromn 1955,

and the Small Businesses Loans Act came into effect in
1961. Without any doubt, ahl these acts have been helpful,
but from the fact that these amendments are before us we
should draw three conclusions: first, that the government
recognizes that the need is stilb there; secondly, Ihat these
farmers, fishermen and small businessmen and women are
not creditworthy so far as lending institutions are concerned so that the repayment of their boans must be
guaranteed by the government; and thirdly Ibis is perhaps the most important conclusion-that in a relative
way the economnic condition of these farmers, fishermen
and small business people has not changed. I expect that it
must have irnproved, yet it bas not improved enough lu
enable them to borrow on their own for their legitimate
needs.
These acts have been helpful, but they have not been,
and wilb not be, sufficient to solve the economic difficulties of those they are intended to help. I should bike 10 see
some new, bold and imaginative policies, the effect of
which woubd be 10 make our farmers, f ishermen and small
business people prosperous enough that the lending institutions would be glad to look after their credit needs
without a guarantee of repayment fromn the government or
anyone else.
Honourable senators, I know the new, bold and progressive policies which are needed cannot be formulated and
enacted in the immediate future. That is why the amendments proposed in this bill must be passed. Personally, I
should like to see some further amendments which are
helpful. I do not understand why there should be a ceiling
on guaranteed boans, or why the limait is $50,000. I suggest
there should be no limit, because apparently f ew persons
borrow to the limit, anyway. I say there is no need for, and
no point in, having a ceiling on the boans. If more than
$50,000 is considered necessary, well, lend it. Nor do I see
why the bending institutions shoubd come into the picture
at ail. These boans shoubd be made by a government
agency or a crown corporation-something simibar to the
Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation.
Rightby or wrongby, it has been said that banks are not
anxious to make these boans because they can get higher
rates of interest elsewhere. If this is so, then let the banks

SENATE DEBATES
lend money to those they consider creditworthy, and let a
government corporation make the loans to our farmers,
our fishermen and our small business people from whom
the banks would require a guarantee.
Honourable senators, one other thought occurred to me
when I heard the sponsor speak of the very low rate of loss
on these loans. It makes one wonder whether the purpose
of the act is being fulfilled. Was any risk taken, or were
the banks too cautious and too careful, and so rigid in
their lending policies that many who should have been
granted a loan were denied it?
I would be happier with the wording of these acts if the
sponsor could have said yes, there were losses; yes, risks
were taken to give hardworking, honest and qualified
farmers, fishermen and small businessmen a chance to
better their economic condition, but that in some cases it
did not work out and losses were incurred. If the purpose
of these acts is to be fulfilled, more risks will have to be
taken in the future than in the past. I hope that if these
acts ever come before us again to be amended, it will not
be put forward as an argument in favour of the legislation
that the losses were so small.
Honourable senators, I believe these are useful amendments. Therefore, I will support them. At the same time, I
hope that new policies will be developed soon so that this
type of legislation will no longer be necessary.
Hon. Gildas L. Molgat: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I wish to
inform the Senate that if the Honourable Senator Molgat
speaks now his speech will have the effect of closing the
debate on second reading of this bill.
Hon. Mr. Molgat: Honourable senators, I want to thank
all those who have participated in the debate, because we
are debating a bill which amends three important acts. I
shall not attempt to reply in detail to all of the comments
that have been made, but I think I should touch on some of
them.
Perhaps I may be permitted to work backwards, and
deal with the most recent comments first. I note that my
colleague Senator Macdonald has said that possibly the
low rate of loss is an indication that the restrictions have
been too great. I suppose the only answer I can give to that
is that "you are damned if you do and you are damned if
you don't." I suspect that if we came in at this time saying
that the rate of loss had been 10 per cent, my honourable
friend would be suggesting that we had been bad managersHon. Mr. Macdonald: No, I would not.
Hon. Mr. Molgat: -in the way that we were running
our business; that we had been lending money without
any kind of control whatever.
It seems to me that the only measure one can put on this
particular item is whether or not the farmers, small businessmen and the fishermen have, in fact, made use of
these acts. Certainly, in the case of the farmers there bas
been a great use of the loan provisions under the Farm
Improvement Loans Act. When you consider that over the
life of this law some $3 billion bas been extended in credit,
I think you can say that it has been successful.
[Hon. Mr. Macdonald.]

April 25, 1974

I would tend to agree with my honourable friend in the
case of small businessmen, and possibly fishermen. But
there are extenuating circumstances here as well. For
example, with respect to the small businessmen, they do
by and large have more access to other means, other
sources of credit.
In the case of the farmers, we were faced with a difficult
problem as a result of the depression, owing in particular
to the fact that lending institutions had dried up. They
were not prepared to lend money to farmers because they
f elt that farming was f ar too risky an enterprise. They felt,
I think, in a number of cases that they were dealing with
people who were not readily accessible, and who were
some miles away from a bank, and consequently it was
difficult for the banker to retain control of the situation or
to have knowledge of what was happening to his client.
In any case, whatever the reasons, farm credit had
completely dried up, and this act provided credit on its
own. I am not trying to defend the chartered banks-they
are well able to defend themselves without my assistance-but, in fairness, I should point out that if we look at
what has happened since the act was passed we see that
the experience the banks have had in this type of lending
under the guarantee has encouraged them to lend otherwise as well. For example, had we looked at a bank's
statement ai the end of the depression we would probably
have found very few outstanding loans to farmers. Since
then, however, the banks have been going to the farmers,
without any guarantee from the government, and have
been doing a direct loan business with the farmers
themselves.
The act has had a double effect. It has provided money
for those seeking to benefit from a lower rate of interest
than could be expected on the market. It has been of
benefit in that regard. Furthermore, because the experience of the chartered banks under the guarantee has
turned out to be very satisfactory, they have opened up on
their own, and today have a number of plans and programs of direct loans to farmers without the government
guarantee.
* <1600)

In the case of small businesses, they have more access to
other forms of credit, being close to the banks, and the
banks being more attuned to commercial lending than to
lending for farming, fishing or any of the resource enterprises. Banks are more adaptable to lending to commercial
enterprises. In any case, it is up to the small businessman
to come forward and make the demand. In committee we
might well inquire whether there bas been an adequate
information program, whether there bas been sufficient
advertising, to make sure that the small businessman
knows of these facilities.
With respect to the Fisheries Improvement Loans Act
we have to recognize that at least one provincial government, that of Newfoundland, bas a program of its own of
loans to fishermen at a very low rate of interest-I think it
is 3 per cent. Obviously, if one of our major fishing
provinces bas a program of loans at 3 per cent, we cannot
expect great demands in that province for loans at 8 per
cent, even on a guaranteed basis. So we have to offset that.
In any case, the overall use of the three programs is the
best proof that they have been beneficial.

April 25, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

My friend, Senator Macdonald, said that this seems to
him to indicate that farmers and small businessmen are
not considered trustworthyHon. Mr. Macdonald: Creditworthy.
Hon. Mr. Molgat: I am sorry-creditworthy. I do not
think that is the case. The decision to make the loan is up
to the bank. The government does not guarantee all of the
loan. The guarantee is on a sliding scale. The bank makes
the decision, but it is assured, whatever decision it makes,
that the guarantee will be there. The big thing is that the
borrower is getting the money at a substantially lower
rate than he could expect on the open market. He is
getting it, really, at just above government yield-1 per
cent above-which, by and large, is well below what he
could expect in the case of a regular commercial loan from
a bank. We have to recognize that there is that second
element, the advantage to the borrower of a lower rate of
interest.
My friend also said he felt that the government should
be lending the money directly, rather than offering a
guarantee. Let me point out that there are other plans. We
are dealing here with one specific aspect, namely, the
guaranteed loans but we should not forget that there is
also, in the case of farms, the Farm Credit Corporation.
The Farm Credit Corporation is a federal government
lending institution, and it lends directly to farmers. I am
sorry that I do not have the figures here as to what their
loans are, but I know they are very substantial.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: And for small businesses you have
the Industrial Development Bank.
Hon. Mr. Molgat: I am coming to that next. The Farm
Credit Corporation is there, it operates across Canada, and
it has been an effective instrument for direct loans by the
federal government to farmers. I might add that in a
number of provinces there are provincial loan plans available on a direct basis to farmers.
When you come to small businesses-and I believe this
would apply to fishermen as well-you have the Industrial
Development Bank. The Industrial Development Bank is
an arrn of the Bank of Canada. It is a government institution in the direct loan business, dealing mainly with small
businessmen. It does not impose the same limits on loans.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: May I ask a question at this
point?
Hon. Mr. Molgat: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Since those direct government
lending agencies are in existence, would it not be very
simple for them to make direct loans instead of guaranteeing those made by the banks? Could those agencies not
just expand their present activities?
Hon. Mr. Molgat: I suppose this is a possibility, but in
this instance, if the government simply guarantees the
loans-and I repeat, the experience has been very goodand if the commercial banks are prepared to make the
loans, why should we put government funds into that
particular field?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Why not?
Hon. Mr. Molgat: Because the present program has been
working well, and there is a second program. It is not as if

we were blocking someone off. This particular program,
under these three acts, is designed specifically for capital
items, define them as you will-buying a boat or a farm
implement, or repairing a building. It is not to provide
working capital; that part is left for someone else.
By means of the Farm Credit Corporation and the
Industrial Development Bank we attempt to serve other
needs, and in those cases there is, in addition to the loan, a
substantial degree of supervision, particularly by the
Industrial Development Bank. When you borrow from the
Industrial Development Bank you accept certain conditions as to the amount of money you can draw each year
from the business, as to how you are going to operate the
businessHon. Mr. Langlois: Investment, too.
Hon. Mr. Bourget: And how much you put in.
Hon. Mr. Molgat: Yes-and as to how much you put in.
It is a much more controlled system. What we are providing here is flexibility. Those individuals who want to
borrow under the three acts that we are discussing now
have all the flexibility in the world. They are dealing with
a banker; they are not dealing with the government. No
one is supervising what they are doing. If they want to go
to the Farm Credit Corporation or the Industrial Development Bank-particularly the Industrial Development
Bank-then they accept a different set of conditions for
different purposes. It seems to me that flexibility is to the
advantage of the borrower, and that if we were to bulk
everything into one program we would not be helping but
hindering.
The criterion must be the provision of sufficient sources
of capital. It seems to me, taking into account the combination of the regular, open sources of capital through
credit unions and commercial banks, that with these three
acts that we are discussing now, with government guarantees, and with direct government loans through the Farm
Credit Corporation and the Industrial Development Bank,
we are providing the maximum of flexibility for the small
borrower, and are doing something better for him than
tying him into a single system of government control.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

following bill:
An Act to authorize the provision of moneys to meet
certain capital expenditures of the Canadian National
Railways System and Air Canada for the period from
the lst day of January, 1973, to the 30th day of June,
1974, and to authorize the guarantee by Her Majesty of
certain securities to be issued by the Canadian

The House of Commons withdrew.
The Honourable the Deputy of His Excellency the Governor General was pleased to retire.

The sitting of the Senate was resumed.
ADJOURNMENT
Hon. Leopold Langlois: Honourable senators, with leave
of the Senate and notwithstanding rule 45(1) (g), I move
that when the Senate adjourns today it do stand
adjourned until Tuesday, April 30, 1974, at 8 o'clock in the
evening.
As usual, I should like to give an outline of the work we
have in store for us next week. On Tuesday evening,
Senator Everett will table the report on Information
Canada of the Standing Senate Committee on National
Finance. In addition, we have a heavy schedule of committee meetings.
The Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs will meet on Tuesday afternoon and
evening, if necessary, as was indicated earlier this afternoon, to consider its report on the parole system in
Canada.
The Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture will sit
on Tuesday afternoon to give further consideration to Bill
S-2, to amend the Animal Contagious Diseases Act, and it
is hoped that the bill will be reported some time during
the week.
The Standing Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs will
meet on Wednesday and Thursday to hear witnesses with

April 25, 1974

respect to its study of Canadian relations with the United
States.
The Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and
Commerce will continue its examination of the competition legislation on Wednesday of next week. Bill C-6, to
amend the National Parks Act, which was before that
committee this morning, will receive further consideration
next week. In addition, Bill C-14, to amend the Farm
Improvement Loans Act, the Small Businesses Loans Act
and the Fisheries Improvement Loans Act, has been
referred to that committee.
In accordance with the suggestion contained in the
report of the Standing Senate Committee on Transport
and Communications on Bill C-5, which was presented
yesterday by Senator Bourget, the deputy chairman of
that committee, a motion will be made next week to
authorize that committee to examine the question of the
revision of the form of the Canadian National Railways
Financing and Guarantee Acts. It is also expected that two
or three bills will be coming to us from the other place
next week.
I delayed making the motion for adjournment until now,
as I was waiting until I had all of the pertinent information in regard to what is likely to come to us next week in
the way of emergency legislation. Even though it is not yet
definite, there is a possibility of some emergency legislation coming to us early next week. There is a possibility,
therefore, that the Senate will be recalled before Tuesday
evening.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: We should know as soon as possible if
that is to be the case, because of the problem of
transportation.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Yes. I think transportation will be
provided, if this occurs.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Honourable senators, perhaps I should
add that the Joint Committee on Regulations and other
Statutory Instruments will be meeting, we expect, on
Tuesday morning. I think the notice has already gone out.
Motion agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, April 30, 1974, at 8

REGULATIONS AND OTHER STATUTORY
INSTRUMENTS
THIRD REPORT OF STANDING JOINT COMMITTEE PRESENTED
AND ADOPTED
Hon. Eugene A. Forsey, Joint Chairman of the Standing
Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Commons on
Regulations and other Statutory Instruments presented
the third report of the committee as follows:
Your committee, in considering its permanent reference relating to the review and scrutiny of statutory
instruments, has noted that a large number of statutory instruments requiring considerable research have
been issued since the coming into force of the Statutory Instruments Act.
Your committee therefore recommends that it be
authorized to retain the services of such additional
legal research and clerical personnel, including the
attachment and secondment of persons or services, as
the committee may require to carry out its terms of
reference and at such rates and under such conditions
as specified by the joint chairmen.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this report be taken into consideration?

Perhaps this would be an appropriate moment for me to
explain why I am asking for leave. Honourable senators, I
will be very brief, fortunately for everybody.
The question may be asked, why the urgency? The
answer is, because we must get immediately, if we are to
get them at all, the six students-at-law mentioned in our
second report.
Our research officers have been in touch with the dean
of law at the University of Ottawa and the Department of
Public Law at Carleton University, and I understand, also,
the dean of law at the University of Montreal, and they
have some excellent students lined up; but as I need
hardly tell honourable senators who are lawyers, these
students cannot wait much longer to know whether in fact
they will be taken on by this committee. Indeed, the
delays have already cost us two people we had hoped to
have.
Someone may say, "You gave us to understand that this
had already been arranged, and that it would be looked
after by the Speaker of the other place." I did. That was
what I had been given to understand. Unfortunately, the
understanding turned out to be misunderstanding. It took
some time to discover this. As soon as it became clear, I
took the responsibility, even in the absence of the
co-chairman, of calling a meeting of the committee for this
morning. The co-chairman, on his return yesterday, fully
concurred in what I had done. Once it had become clear
that it was impossible to make satisfactory arrangements
for these students on the House of Commons side, I took
steps to see whether it could be done by the Senate. The
officials and the chairman of the Standing Committee on
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration were kind
enough to assure me that they thought it was possible. The
result is the report which I have just presented. Its terms
may seem rather broad. What they will amount to in
practice is as follows:
First, regularization of the position of the two research
officers seconded to us by the research branch of the
Library of Parliament. Some of the officials had some
doubts about this, which it seemed desirable to remove.
Second, formal provision for the hiring of six studentsat-law for this summer. There is a huge backlog of orders
and regulations dating from the beginning of 1972 to be
gone through, and the help of these senior, highly qualified students-at-law is essential if the committee is to get
down to solid, effective work in the shortest possible time.
This will, of course, involve some expenditure, and we
are asking the Senate to provide the money-a total of
some $20,000.

SENATE DEBATES

The students would be hired on the same basis as those
of similar qualifications who are hired by the Department of Justice, namely, $4.70 an hour for a 37/2-hour
work week for the period of the summer. Our research
officers have worked out a budget which is ready for
submission to the Senate Committee on Internal Economy.
If any honourable senator feels that this is asking too
much financially from the Senate, I might add that the
House of Commons has undertaken to pay the cost of the
printing of the committee's proceedings and evidence
which, I am informed, at some $40 a page, will run to a
much larger sum than the committee is asking of the
Senate.
Third, the proposed budget provides a sum of at most
$5,456 for the proposed trip to Westminster for one senator
and one member of the House of Commons and the two
research off icers for a period of three days, which with the
time necessary to get back and forth will total probably
five days away from Ottawa. The bulk of this amount is,
of course, for air f ares, and I think that we may reasonably
hope that the four people could, in fact, travel in Department of National Defence airplanes which would reduce
the expenditure for the trip to something like $1,600 at the
outside. The grand total sum involved would be a maximum of about $25,700.
In view of the pressing, urgent need for getting the
students immediately, I very much hope, honourable senators, that you will be kind enough to give leave to deal
with this report immediately.
Motion agreed to and report adopted.

The Hon. the Speaker left the Chair.
Hon. Jean-PaulDeschatelets, P.C., in the Chair.
NATIONAL FINANCE
INFORMATION CANADA-REPORT OF COMMITTEE TABLED

Hon. Douglas D. Everett: Honourable senators, I have
the honour to table the report of the Standing Senate
Committee on National Finance on Information Canada. I
also ask leave to make a statement with respect to this
report at this time.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker (Hon. Mr. Deschatelets):
Is it agreed, honourable senators?

Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Everett: Honourable senators, in a moment or
two the report of the Standing Senate Committee on
National Finance on Information Canada will be before
you, and I suppose it could be asked why the committee at
the outset chose to examine Information Canada. To
understand that you would have to understand first of all
the method that has been decided upon by the Standing
Senate Committee on National Finance in its review of the
annual estimates. It is true that we do make a review of
the estimates and of the supplementary estimates, but we
are talking about expenditures that now are in excess of
$20 billion a year. So we found that while we could make a
review, it is extremely difficult to talk about reduction in
expenditures in meaningful terms when dealing with that
size of total expenditure. Therefore, we have come to the
conclusion that while we are required by our Constitution
to do just that, in fact we can make a greater contribution
[Hon. Mr. Forsey.]

April 30, 1974

to the examination of the estimates if we review individual departments, programs or agencies on a detailed basis.
When we came to this conclusion we decided that we
would start with Information Canada. We chose Information Canada because it is important to the citizens of
Canada that they get full and complete information on the
programs and policies of their government. People are
entitled to know what government is doing. We found also
that this business of information is big business. Our
estimates indicate that upwards of $200 million a year is
being spent by the various departments of government on
information, whether it is called public affairs or public
relations programs. These expenditures are being handled
by the individual departments of government and with
little supervision or control.
0 (2010)

The other reason for selecting Information Canada is
that it is the subject of incredible controversy and we
thought that possibly we could inject some sanity into the
discussion.
What are the origins of Information Canada? In 1969 the
Task Force on Information reported as follows:
A central resource and services organization, to be
known as Information Canada, be established in an
existing ministry. This organization would facilitate
and co-ordinate the technical and operational aspects
of information activities in Canada and abroad; and
would be responsible for certain activities that are
currently not being carried out, or are receiving inadequate attention within departments.
The Prime Minister followed this report with a statement on February 10, 1970, in which he accepted the bulk
of the recommendations of the Task Force on Information
and said:
Information Canada will promote co-operation among
federal information offices now operating in mutual
isolation. The object will be to increase effectiveness
as well as to save money by reducing duplication in
the use of staff and equipment and by better joint use
of the government's information resources.
As a result of these recommendations and the Prime
Minister's speech, Information Canada was formed on
April 1, 1970. Its main functions are outlined in our report.
Information Canada was to initiate information programs
on broad subjects, such as federalism, which affect the
nation as a whole and go beyond the responsibilities of
departmental information divisions; to promote co-operation among department and agency information offices
and major information programs and consequently
increase effectiveness and efficiency; to advise and service, on request, departments and agencies; and to help
Canadians get across their viewpoints to Parliament and
government.
The specific responsibilities outlined for Information
Canada were the design and provision of government
exhibits and displays, provision of publishing services for
departments, retail distribution of government publications, Queen's Printer bookstores and the supervision of
crown copyright.
In its present operations there are four branches and,
contrary to opinion, Information Canada really does much

April 30, 1974
April 30, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

SENATE DEBATES

more than is generally thought although, again contrary to
opinion, its budget last year was in the neighbourhood of
$10 million, of which $4 million was recovered from the
sale of books.
The first of the four branches is the Communications
Services Branch, which provides assistance on request to
other departments, co-ordinates information programs
involving two or more departments and initiates original
programs of a broad general nature, an example of which
is the handbook which senators recently received on the
organization of the Government of Canada.
The second branch of Information Canada is the Publishing Branch, which is responsible for marketing and
distributing government publications. It is not in the business of the make-up or printing of those publications,
which remains in the hands of the Queen's Printer, but it
does distribute government publications through six
Information Canada bookstores and 125 authorized agents
who are given a special discount on those books to display
them in their bookstores. Publications are also sold by
booksellers in the ordinary course of their business, and
through a mail order system.
The third branch is the Expositions Branch which in
1972 and 1973 created 153 exhibits for use by federal
government departments in Canada and abroad, a phototeque service which provides 300,000 still photographs of
Canadian history, and a fotomedia service which provides
those still photographs in story form to the various media.
Incidentally, I might say that we heartily endorsed the
activities of the Expositions Branch.
The final branch of Information Canada is the Regional
Operations Branch, which provides assistance to the various departmental information services in getting their
programs to the regions and advises those departments on
how they can improve the regional content of those programs. The Regional Operations Branch operates six
enquiry centres across Canada which are presently in the
Information Canada book stores.
These centres answer inquiries from citizens on federal
government programs and policies. At present they are
able only to answer those inquiries which come from
localities immediately adjacent to the location of the
enquiry centre itself.
The regional offices also operate a program known as
the mobile information officer program. This program,
which is a test program at this stage, operating only in the
provinces of Manitoba and Nova Scotia, places workers in
the field to extend the inquiry function of Information
Canada to the regions. These workers also advise the
regional offices in the area of information needs. They
bring information on government programs and policies
into those areas and create additional outlets by the use of
community resource institutions, such as libraries, for
government information.
That is a description of the present activities of Information Canada. In this study we really wanted to find out
what is wrong with our information services.
First, our information systen is largely operated by
individual departments, and is largely uncontrolled and
unco-ordinated. Some departments, such as Agriculture,
are doing a magnificent job; some departments are doing

too much; some are doing very little, and some are doing
nothing at all.
All these departments are spending as high as $200
million a year, and except for four departments the costs
are not clearly shown in the government's annual estimates which come before Parliament. Information Canada
was established to do something about this, but on examination we found that it had no clear powers or responsibilities. No act of Parliament defines the role of Information Canada; in fact, it suffers from almost a complete lack
of authority.
The operative words are that it services other departments on request. Because its powers and responsibilities
are not clearly defined, it has tried to justify its existence
and bas got itself into areas that are not really meaningful
in terms of either effectiveness or dollar cost.
The basic recommendations of our report are as follows:
that there should be no central information agency in
Canada. The departments and agencies of the government
should continue to operate their own information services,
but the Secretary of State should be given the responsibility of regulating and co-ordinating those departmental
information services. Information Canada should be the
agency through which the Secretary of State operates this
regulation and co-ordination, and the powers of Information Canada should be defined in detail by an Act of
Parliament.
*

(2020)

To give Information Canada an additional crunch, it
should act as the agent of the Treasury Board, and should
cause to be published an agreed upon definition of information services, which the various departments would use
so that they could state in their departmental estimates
clearly every year the total amount of money they are
spending on information. Information Canada would then
advise the Treasury Board on how those budgets are being
spent, and whether or not Information Canada believed
that Treasury Board should approve those budgets.
The overall objective of Information Canada should be
to produce a comprehensive information system on government programs and policies at the lowest possible cost.
In the report we set out certain guiding principles on
which we believe Information Canada should operate.
First of all we say that Information Canada should regulate and co-ordinate the expenditures of the information
services of the various departments, but Information
Canada itself should initiate as few information programs
as possible. It should ensure that the most effective information techniques are being used by the various departments, and that information services are cost effective. It
should see that information is made readily available by
the departments on government policies and programs;
however, it is not the responsibility of government information services to cram information down people's
throats. We also say that information should not be tailored to individual or special needs unless it makes eminent good sense-and in most cases we find that it does
not.
We go on in the report to certain specific recommendations. We deal first of all with the mobile information
officer program. This program, which sends people out

SENATE DEBATES

into the regions to carry the message of government policies to the more remote regions, is a classic case of one-onone dissemination of information-probably the most
expensive way to operate an information program. In fact,
what we found on examination was that it has developed
into a social welfare program, with officers actually helping the people to solve their social problems rather than
giving them information. We were told that the officers
going out into the region were evaluating the regional
effectiveness of government information programs. We
doubted very much that that was effective, considering
the small sample that each officer was getting, and considering the problems with personal bias. They told us that it
would be self-liquidating, that they would send officers
into a certain region, that they would do their job, then
they would leave certain agencies to carry on the work.
The committee doubted very much that that would
happen. As a matter of fact, the committee thought, after
examining the evidence, that such a program would grow
and grow.
We were told that the cost for the Prairie provinces and
the Maritimes would involve 51 people and an expenditure
of $750,000 a year. We think it is a lot higher than that, and
we think that if you add on Ontario, Quebec and British
Columbia, it is a pretty substantial amount of money for a
job that may be effective in welfare terms, but which we
judge to be very ineffective in terms of information, which
is what Information Canada is there for. We therefore
recommend strongly in our report that the mobile information off icer program be discontinued forthwith.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: You do not recommend that it be
abolished, as being unnecessary? You did not reach that
conclusion?
Hon. Mr. Everett: Yes, we did.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: You did?
Hon. Mr. Everett: Would you like me to read the
quotation?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: No. You would recommend the
abolition of this joke, would you not-or would you?
Hon. Mr. Everett: Perhaps I should read recommendation 6 of the committee:
The Mobile Information Officer program appears to
the committee to have developed into a social welfare
service. As an information service it is extremely
expensive on a per capita basis and as an information
evaluation service it leaves a great deal to be desired.
As it has a potential for excessive growth it should be
discontinued.
Hon. Mr. Martin: On what page is that?
Hon. Mr. Everett: That is in the recommendations section. It is number 6 on page x.
Honourable senators, we moved then to the consideration of the enquiry centres. We were quite taken with the
concept of the enquiry centres. We thought that this was
probably a good way of getting information on government programs and policies to the people, and so we
recommend that the enquiry service be extended so that
there will be one centre in each province, with an extra
one in Ottawa.
[Hon. Mr. Everett.]

April 30, 1974

In 1972 and 1973 the enquiry centres, of which there
were six, received and dealt with 196,000 inquiries. Of that
number, 153,000 were received by telephone. In the report
are statistics relating to the number of inquiries, and how
they were made in various cities. When we made tests of
the centres, we found that they were very effective in
giving information that the average citizen would want.
So we recommend that the inquiry system be extended,
and be backed up by nationwide Zenith and INWATS
telephone systems. By this means any citizen in Canada
could telephone the enquiry centre in his particular province, at no cost to him.
In the appendices to the report, we give our estimate of
the cost of this system, including personnel, as $634,000.
That is less than the $750,000 it is estimated it would cost
to run the mobile information officer program-and in not
all the provinces but just the Maritime and the Prairie
provinces.
It is our view that this would be an extremely effective
way to provide information, so long as the enquiry centres
are staffed by trained personnel backed up by proper
information sources.
We also recommend that the telephone number of the
appropriate enquiry centre be advertised in the front of
every telephone book and in all post offices, and we invite
the media to publicize the telephone number of the local
enquiry centre.
Honourable senators, we moved on then to a consideration of the regional offices. We said that in their case, if
we cut out this expensive mobile information officer program, then their job is to handle those enquiry centres and
make them efficient. Beyond that they have only one job,
and that is to evaluate the regional effectiveness of government information programming.
We then considered the private agencies. We came to the
conclusion that, wherever possible, Information Canada
should see that government departmental information services retain private agencies, especially where the alternative is a permanent staff establishment. We say, however,
that if private agencies are retained by any government
department they should be chosen strictly on a merit basis
by Information Canada.
After studying the publishing activities of Information
Canada, we concluded that the six bookstores presently
existing should continue, although the cost of leasing
those bookstores is high. We suggest that the value of the
bookstores should be looked at very carefully when the
leases expire.
*

(2030)

We endorse the idea of Information Canada distributing
government publications through authorized agents and
booksellers, but we suggest that they monitor these agents
to make sure they are doing a good job. We also suggest
that they ensure that the mail order system which they
operate is highly efficient.
We endorse the concept of a revolving fund so that the
sale of government publications is on a cost-recovery
basis. We believe that if it is on a cost-recovery basis that
Information Canada ought to publicize government publications-and by that we do not mean the promotion of
individual government publications.

April 30, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

The committee was also concerned about the number of
government publications that are sent to senators, members of the House of Commons, members of the press and
people all over Canada, many of which, so far as we can
tell, nobody wants. We suggest that Information Canada
take steps to regulate the flow of this free information.
In the radio and television field, which the experts
describe as "audio-visual," we found that in government
departments there was a tendency to communicate by the
printed word and that audio-visual techniques are quite
often more effective than the printed word. So we suggest
that Information Canada become a repository of information on radio and television and also a repository of equipment, and that they lease this equipment to the various
government departments for use in their information
activities. We think that this probably would be less
expensive than the present system, under which departments go out themselves and purchase audio-visual equipment for their own requirements but do not share it with
other departments.
Honourable senators, that is a brief summary of the
report. In concluding, I should like to thank the deputy
chairman, Senator Sparrow, the members of the steering
committee, Senators Grosart, Manning, Carter and Yuzyk,
the members of the committee, who worked so hard on
this report, and the staff headed by Mr. J. H. M. Cocks,
who was director of research and administration, and the
Library of Parliament for providing the services of Dr.
George Kerr.
The question which is always directed towards you in
these reports is: "Will the government act on the report?" I
think the answer is that if a report is sound and logical,
yes, the government will act upon it.
The last report of the Standing Senate Committee on
National Finance was entitled Growth, Employment and
Price Stability. I was checking the other day to see what
had happened as a result of that report. Not all of the
recommendations have been accepted, but the bulk of the
major recommendations have been accepted by the Government of Canada and by the central bank. I believe they
were accepted because that report was a sound report
based on logic.
I suggest that when you read this report on Information
Canada you will come to the conclusion that it fills these
criteria, and if it does fill these criteria I think we will
find that in time it will be implemented by the
government.
Honourable senators, I move, seconded by Honourable
Senator Sparrow, that this report be placed on the Orders
of the Day for consideration at the next sitting of the
Senate.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker (Hon. Mr. Deschatelets):
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the
motion?
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Acting Speaker (Hon. Mr. Deschatelets):
I understand Honourable Senator Grosart would like to
say a few words. It is customary when leave has been
granted that an honourable senator wishing to say a few
words may do so. Is it agreed, honourable senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.

347

Hon. Mr. Grosart: Honourable senators, I took it that
the request for leave referred to our rule 78 (2), which
states that a report presented to the Senate shall be
accepted without debate. Debate now having been initiated, I am at a loss to know how to proceed, because the
debate has been initiated and yet full debate did not take
place. Now we have a motion which is difficult to justify
under our rules, that the report be taken into consideration at the next sitting. I think perhaps I should defer to
the second motion and withhold my remarks until the
next sitting.
Motion agreed to.

BANKING, TRADE AND COMMERCE
COMMITTEE AUTHORIZED TO MEET DURING SITTING OF THE
SENATE
Hon. Leopold Langlois, with leave of the Senate and
notwithstanding rule 45(1) (a), moved:
That the Standing Senate Committee on Banking,
Trade and Commerce have power to sit while the
Senate is sitting tomorrow, Wednesday, lst May, 1974,
and that rule 76(4) be suspended in relation thereto.
He said: Honourable senators, a word of explanation
might be in order at this stage. The chairman of the
committee could explain the situation better than I, but I
am informed that the minister is available to appear
before the committee between 3 and 3:30 tomorrow afternoon. Actually, it is expected that tomorrow's sitting in
the chamber will be short and by that time we will have
adjourned, but no arrangement for the committee can be
made until this motion is adopted.
Motion agreed to.

THE SENATE
REMARKS ATTRIBUTED TO CLERK OF THE PRIVY COUNCILQUESTION
Hon. Mr. Riley: Honourable senators, I should like to
ask a question of the Leader of the Government. Is it the
intention of the government to censure, and, if necessary,
discipline, for certain remarks he is alleged to have made
in a foreign country, a senior civil servant, one of the top
civil servants in this country? If the report in the Vancouver Sun of April 27 is accurate, and the Clerk of the Privy
Council did make the remarks attributed to him, then it
was a most serious attack on the Senate. And if he is right,
I do not want to remain a member of the Senate.
*

(2040)

This senior civil servant, speaking in a foreign country,
is reported as having said that the Senate is a cracked
mirror. He is Mr. R. G. Robertson, the Clerk of the Privy
Council.
The newspaper item reads:
Explaining the Canadian federal system, Robertson
listed the "weakness" of the Senate as a characteristic.
"It has been said that the Senate was to be the
mirror of the federal bargain. If that's the case, then
the mirror is cracked-and has been for a long time."

SENATE DEBATES

April 30, 1974

If this federal civil servant in fact made a statement like
that in a foreign country about one of our Houses of
Parliament, then I would ask the federal government,
through the Leader of the Government in the Senate, if it
is its intention to censure and discipline him.

Hon. Mr. McElnan: Honourable senators, on a question
of privilegeThe Hon. the Acting Speaker (Hon. Mr. Deschatelets):
The Honourable Senator McElman has risen on a question
of privilege.

Hon. Mr. Flynn: You can count on the Leader of the
Government to do that.

Hon. Mr. McElrnan: I would raise it as a matter of
privilege that it is reported in the Vancouver Sun of April
27 last that Mr. R. G. Robertson, Clerk of the Privy
Council, made a statement as follows:
It has been said that the Senate was to be the mirror
of the federal bargain. If that's the case, then the
mirror is cracked-and bas been for a long time.
On the question of privilege, I would say to the Leader of
the Government, or any other member of this house, that
if he has information that would clear up this question, I
would like to hear it.

Hon. Mr. Riley: Who is he to speak against one of the
Houses of Parliament in that way?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: You may be sure the Leader of the
Government will do that right away. I am quite sure of
that. Is there any answer?
The Hon. the Acting Speaker (Hon. Mr. Deschatelets):
Is there any reply?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Are you going to reply to the question
put by Senator Riley?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Senator Laing was good enough to
raise this with me today. He called my attention to a
report that had appeared in the Vancouver Sun of last
Saturday, April 27. The report also mentions the deputy
attorney general of the province of Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. Riley: We are used to that kind of talk from
the deputy attorney general of Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Senator McElman, at the opening of
tonight's session, also directed my attention to this matter,
as did Senator Forsey.
I have asked for a text of the statement. I want to see
the text of the statement before I make any comment.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Very diplomatic.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: Perhaps I might be permitted to say
something at this point. When I heard of this report this
afternoon I called Mr. Robertson on the telephone. He is
not only a very senior and, of course, a very respected
public servant, but he also happens to be an old friend of
mine. I was anxious to see what he actually had said,
because I have had a certain amount of experience, as we
all have, with newspaper reports, which, shall I say, are
sometimes not accurate, or are taken out of context.
Mr. Robertson was kind enough to send me a copy of his
text, which I think places the thing in a somewhat different lightHon. Mr. Choquette: I thought so. I thought so. You
always come to the rescue of the Liberal Party. You have
paid your debt, you know. You have no business saying
that.
Some Hon. Senators: Order, order.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Do not talk while I am speaking
please.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker (Hon. Mr. Deschatelets):
The question is directed to the Leader of the Government,
who indicated that he is going to look into this matter.
When the Honourable Senator Forsey rose, I thought his
purpose was to ask a question. I am in the hands of
honourable senators at this point. If you wish to let the
Honourable Senator Forsey pursue his remarks, well and
good, but up to now he is out of order.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: He is out of order.
[Hon. Mr. Riley.]

Hon. Mr. Martin: Certainly. Let him go ahead.
Hon. Mr. Forsey: I have some information that might
help to clear it up, but if there is any objection, I shall not
speak.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I think Senator Forsey should realize
that he bas no authority to give that kind of reply, even if
he was fortunate enough to talk to Mr. Robertson. The
reply has to come from the government, otherwise it
would be hearsay.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Of course.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, Senator McElman bas raised a question of privilege, and Senator Forsey
has risen to speak on that question of privilege. There
certainly can be no doubt, if he has information at this
time that will enlighten us on this matter, that he is
entitled to speak on this question of privilege.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I certainly will not agree that Senator
Forsey may tell us that Mr. Robertson told him that he
said something. That is not the way to deal with a question like this.
Hon. Mr. Riley: If I may ask a supplementary question,
I will direct it to Senator ForseyThe Hon. the Acting Speaker (Hon. Mr. Deschatelets):
No, I am sorry.
Hon. Mr. Riley: Then, I will direct it to the Leader of
the Government.
Senator Martin said that he has asked for a copy of the
speech. I am going to ask him, and any other honourable
senator, how many times he has departed from a prepared
speech, and made remarks outside it. I am not referring to
remarks such as this, but remarks which were not contained in a prepared, typewritten speech. If the Vancouver
Sun reported this correctly, then I would like to know if
the Leader of the Government in the Senate intends to ask
this senior civil servant-this mandarin-if he departed in
fact from the text of his speech when he made these
remarks.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: On this question of privilege, perhaps
the Leader of the Government would consider calling Mr.
Robertson before the committee of privileges of the SenateHon. Mr. Croll: Oh, no.

April 30, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Mr. Flynn: -and having him state whether he
said this or not. I think that would be much better than
hearing from Senator Forsey what Mr. Robertson told him.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I know that Senator Flynn bas only
one objective in making that suggestion, and that is to
help resolve the matter in the most satisfactory way.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Quite obviously.
Hon. Mr. Martin: But we are now talking aboutHon. Mr. Flynn: That would not be your case.
Hon. Mr. Martin: We are now talking about the Clerk of
the Privy Council, whom I regard as one of our most
eminent ard responsible public servants. When I saw this
statement I was certainly greatly surprised, and that is
why I asked to see the text. When I have seen the text I
will express my judgment. In the meantime, I think it
would be well for us to examine not only the text of what
Mr. Robertson said, but of what Mr. Ken Lysyk said.
Senator Riley asked me if I have ever steered away from
my text. He knows, of course, that I never would do that.
Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.

to hear what he has to say in defence or otherwise of that
senior civil servant who made a statement in Washington.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: It is gossip.
Hon. Mr. Robichaud: Can we not hear Senator Forsey?
Hon. Mr. Choquette: It is just gossip and we are objecting to hearing it.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker (Hon. Mr. Deschatelets):
Honourable senators, we are on the Question Period, and
under our rules a question may be directed to the Leader
of the Government, who is not obliged to answer. However, an answer was given to the effect that the matter
would be looked into. As I understand the situation, had
Senator Forsey wanted additional information he would
have been quite in order in asking a supplementary question of the leader. But I would remind Senator Robichaud
that this was not the case. Senator Forsey wanted to place
on record certain information he had been given.
I would ask honourable senators to cooperate and let
this matter stand until the Leader of the Government
answers the questions that have been asked.
Hon. Mr. Riley: For the time being.

Hon. Mr. Riley: On another supplementary question,
Mr. Speaker. I would askHon. Mr. Grosart: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. We
do have rules in the Senate, and our rules are very clear
that there can be no debate on a mere "question".
Secondly, we also have a rule that a matter that has
been before the Senate cannot be brought before the
Senate again under another section of our rules. Therefore, I suggest, the question having been asked properly of
the Leader of the Government under rule 20, that this
disposes of the matter at this time. It cannot become then
a question of privilege, because the matter is already
before the Senate under one of our rules.
Honourable senators, I suggest, therefore, that the
proper course to take now is to leave the matter exactly
where it is, and to observe our rules. At this point there
can be no debate. This means no supplementary speeches;
no debate of any kind on a "question". Those are our rules,
and it is up to us to decide whether we are going to keep
them or not.
a

(2050)

Hon. Mr. Riley: I asked the question, so surely I am
entitled to a supplementary question, which is this: Is it
the intention of the Leader of the Government to obtain
not only the text of the speech or the statements made by
the Clerk of the Privy Council at this meeting in a f oreign
country, but also a verbatim transcript of what he said?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Robichaud: Honourable senators, on this
point, and since this is the first that I have risen to speak
on any matter other than to move the Address in reply to
the Speech from the Throne, I hope I will be given a
certain licence to say what I think at the moment.
A question was asked by Senator Riley of the Leader of
the Government, and Senator Forsey was kind enough to
come to the rescue or defence of a very senior civil servant
who happens to be Mr. Gordon Robertson. Senator Forsey
was not given a chance to say anything, and I should like

The Hon. the Acting Speaker left the Chair.
Hon. Maurice Bourget, P.C., in the Chair.
FRANCOPHONE AFRICA
CANADIAN AID-FRANCOPHONE QUESTION-DEBATE
ADJOURNED
Hon. Jean-Paul Deschatelets rose pursuant to notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate to
Canadian aid to francophone countries in Africa and
to "francophonie".
*

(2100)

[Translation]
He said: Honourable senators, I had the honour last
December of representing the Canadian government at the
official opening of the Ecole Polytechnique of Thiès, in
Senegal, and at the openings of two other graduate schools
in Cameroon, the result of a Canadian contribution
through the Canadian International Development Agency.
I also represented the Canadian government in Kenya on
the occasion of the tenth anniversary of that country's
independance.
Therefore, I think this is a good occasion for us to
consider together this new chapter, this new perspective
of Canadian external assistance to French-speaking African nations, as well as the now important role played by
Canada in this new community of nations called the
"francophonie".
I believe President Senghor of Senegal was the first to
promote the concept, in the years 1966-67, of a community
of French-speaking countries, which would include not
only nations in Africa, Europe, America, the Orient, but
also those in the West Indies, such as Haiti, for instance.
Oddly enough, the organization of such a community met
with some hesitation on the part of the French government, but it was eventually created, and last December the
fifth biennial of this organization was held at Dakar. On
that occasion, I met the Canadian delegation. By the way,

SENATE DEBATES
I must say that the Canadian delegation was noteworthy
not only for the quality of its representatives but also for
their number, because it was the largest of all delegations,
including the French one. There were not only delegates
from the Canadian government, but also representatives
from Quebec and several other Canadian provinces.
At the beginning, when speaking about "francophonie,"
we were referring to a small French-speaking commonwealth-quite wrongly-because the union of Frenchspeaking countries is based on the French language and
culture, while the Commonwealth is a community including English-speaking countries implying an allegiance to
political structures based on British traditions and some
links or economic preference among the various member
countries. The "francophonie" goes beyond continental
barriers, differences of religion, race and political system.
Canada has eagerly agreed to extend its international
influence in French-speaking countries-and friendship
ties binding today the French-speaking countries of Africa
and Canada have never been more lively, as you will note
if you have the opportunity to visit some of those countries; but this does not prevent Canada from continuing to
assume its international responsibilities towards other
English-speaking African countries.
One word only can begin to express the impression of a
Canadian in Africa-fascination, for rather strange analogies explain the warmth of the brotherly co-operation
between Canada and Africa. Some African countries spent
over 200 years under a French regime and others, more
than 150 years under a British regime of guardianship. It
therefore seems quite normal for a country like Canada,
bilingual and bicultural, which grew in the crucible to two
of the greatest cultures, English and French, to be an ideal
partner in the launching of the African continent's economic and cultural development. That Canadian mosaic of
which we love to speak is found again in African countries
for, in countries such as Senegal, Cameroon and Kenya,
the linguistic and cultural differences are as great
between African brothers as they are between the citizens
of Quebec and those of the other provinces of Canada,
which adds, in their lands as in ours, to the wealth from
which we all benefit.
If, on the one hand, the Commonwealth allowed fruitful
exchanges between English-speaking African countries-I
am thinking here of Kenya and Nigeria-in the last few
years Canada has extended to the fullest both its assistance and its co-operation to the francophone countries of
Africa. Those efforts have been so efficient, so spectacular
that an African magazine Jeune Afrique published in June
1971 an article entitled: "Canada, New African Power."
It is in Ghana, I think, that was opened in 1957 the first
resident diplomatic mission on the African continent.
After the independence of many African countries since
1960, we can say that Canada is now very well represented
or accredited in most of the black continent.
It was in 1968, with the Lionel Chevrier mission, that
major co-operation projects were put into operation in
francophone Africa. They dealt with education, economic
development and health. May I point out here, at the risk
of offending his well-known humility, that the former
[Hon. Mr. Deschatelets.]

April 30, 1974

Secretary of State for External Affairs in Canada in those
years, now the government leader in the Senate, the Honourable Paul Martin, is one of those who have really
created the determining Canadian influence in the francophone countries of Africa. Canada has unquestionably
proved as very few countries can do that it was capable of
contemplating, of conceiving for francophone Africa an
original policy without any hidden motive and free from
political pressure. Such unselfishness in mutual help was
sensed as such by the francophone African countries with
which I came into contact. Furthermore, this is why the
African continent gives a place of choice to Canada.
a (2110)

I had the pleasure of talking with President Senghor of
Senegal and President Adhijo of Cameroon. They never
ceased telling me how happy they were about our unselfish external aid to developing countries.
That is why I have been rather apprehensie since I
heard about my honourable colleague and friend Senator
Argue's resolution concerning the Turks and Caicos
Islands. The Secretary of State for External Affairs,
according to newspapers reports I read recently, informed
the British government that for the time being, at least,
there was no question of following up this matter.
I am so convinced of the importance of the image that
Canada bas succeeded in projecting in developing countries, the image of a disinterested Canada, free of any
colonialist spirit, that I would apprehend problems that
would certainly arise for us if we were to embark in this
new venture put forward in Senator Argue's resolution.
I make this comment is passing. I do not want to take
position, to prejudge my attitude, especially before hearing Senator Argue, but I hope that in his remarks he will
touch on this point which seems to me extremely
important.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Would the honourable senator
explain? Is he referring to Senator Argue's resolution?
Hon. Mr. Deschatelets: Senator Argue's resolution is on
the agenda and this is why I would like him to give his
opinion on the matter. We have not heard him yet, but
when he speaks on the resolution he should comment on
this problem which, in my opinion, is of prime importance,
namely, the image we have succeeded in establishing in
the developing countries, which is an image without
colonialism. My fears would be that if we passed this
resolution we could lose this image which says that
Canadian aid has always been considered as absolutely
disinterested. This is what I wanted to point out.
For about ten years, the amount of bilateral aid granted
by Canada to francophone countries in Africa has risen
from $4 million during the 1964-65 fiscal year to approximately $80 million during the 1973-74 fiscal year. The
budget for CIDA-the Canadian International Development Agency-for the current year amounts to roughly
$565 million, an increase of 15 per cent over the previous
year. Furthermore, the Canadian input in francophone
countries represents about one fifth of the bilateral aid,
about $80 million. It should also be added that, along with
the help from CIDA, many international organizations
such as UNESCO, FAO and many others participate in
this international mutual aid to francophone countries.

April 30, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

I should like to say a few words about the Polytechnical
School of Thiès in Senegal which I had the pleasure to
inaugurate on behalf of the Canadian government. It is a
major Canadian project that cost $8.5 million and where
courses are now given by teachers from Montreal's Polytechnical School who are living there. We hope that within
five or six years their Senegalese counterparts who are
now studying in Canada under scholarships will be able to
take over this engineering institution, one of the most
important in Africa.
I also wish to mention something rather special in that
Canadian engineers and architects drew the plans for this
major project, but the works were done by Senegalese
under the supervision of our architects and engineers,
mostly with materials from Canada.
Diplomas awarded by Thiès University will be recognized by Canadian universities. Within a few years, hundreds of Senegalese engineers will have be-en trained and
then they will be able to indentify development priorities
in their own country. I f eel it is in the long term one of the
most efficient contributions of Canada in Africa.
It is easy to understand how important the contribution
of Senegalese engineers can be, for instance, in the north
of Senegal which is part of the Sahel area now at grips
with a terrible drought. And so, within a few years, these
engineers will be able to find a solution to that country's
drought problem.
In Cameroon, I took part in the opening of two educational institutions. The first one was the College of
Bonabéri, a Canadian contribution which required an
investment of almost $8 million. This is another major
contribution. This educational institution will receive
almost 2,000 Cameroon students who will get not a classical but a technical education which within a few years
will allow thousands of young people to get in the labour
force and meet the need for qualified technicians.
I also took part in the official opening in Douala of an
important extension to a technical school operated by
Canadian missionaries, our Brothers of the Christian
Schools. I think that our investment in this project has
come to nearly $800,000.
However, one must understand that the money invested
in Africa by the Canadian government is not the only
aspect of our Canadian contribution which is appreciated.
The human contacts-which can sometimes be quite effective, while remaining discreet-which our missionaries
have established, especially in the areas of education and
health care, had brought a Canadian presence to Africa
long before these countries became independent states.
It was in Yaoundé, in Cameroon, that the first Canadian
embassy was opened in 1962 in French-speaking Africa.
Honourable senators are aware that an outstanding
Canadian has become an equally outstanding citizen of
Cameroon: I am referring to Paul Emile Cardinal Léger,
whose work in Yaoundé has earned him international
recognition ever since his arrival there.
A drive is being held in Montreal at the present time to
collect money to support Cardinal Léger's work; it goes
without saying that his devotion bas had on Africans a
considerable impact which is indeed beneficial to Canada

as a whole. His presence there certainly bears witness to
the interest of Canadians for Africa.
I also had the pleasure to represent the Canadian government at the celebrations of the 10th anniversary of
Kenya's independence, one of the most picturesque and
prosperous countries of Africa. I had the opportunity to
converse with several young Kenyans. They are so proud
of their country's economic progress and so confident over
its future that our embassy gets very few applications to
emigrate to Canada. I believe it is a very good sign. On the
occasion of these celebrations, there was among others two
invited heads of state, the Emperor of Ethiopia and the
head of Uganda, the unpredictable General Amin. I had
the opportunity to converse with both, but let us not linger
over that.
I wish to thank, without naming them, our Canadian
representatives in Senegal, Kenya and the Cameroons, the
staff of those various embassies, our devoted officials in
the Department of External Affairs who have made my
task so easy and pleasant and all the Canadian volunteers
and missionaries working in Africa whom I had the pleasure to meet. All Canadians who have the opportunity to
visit those countries are amazed by the devotion and
initiative shown by these missionaries and volunteers. We
can rightly be very proud of them.

•

(2120)

Before concluding, I should like to deal briefly with two
points that seem important to me, namely, the political
administration of African countries as a whole and the
impact of the oil price rise on developing countries.
During some commonwealth parliamentary conferences
I had the opportunity of attending in the last few years, a
few British and Canadian delegates touched lightly on the
problem of the political system in force in most African
countries which became independent and which we usually call the "other party system," namely, governments
without parliamentary opposition, where people are not
given an alternative of government As parliamentarians,
we always tackled that subject with much reticence
because it has always been our opinion that we should not
get involved in domestic questions concerning sovereign
countries. I believe that even during our parliamentary
conferences, we should not emphasize that problem,
whether it concerns French-speaking African countries or
commonwealth countries. Most of the countries that
became independent since 1960 and whose yearly per
capita income is scarcely above $200 have to face such
acute and urgent economic problems that they must first
provide their citizens with the political stability that is
essential for them if they want to expect a reasonable
increase in their standard of living. It must be noted also
that in most of those countries-Senegal, Kenya and
Cameroon are good examples-the government leaders are
not only strong men enjoying the confidence of their
people but men who have done more than anybody to
make their country independent. For example, Kenya's
President Kenyatta spent nine years in prison following
political clashes in which he took part before independence. Today, he is the image that represents, like the flag
of his country, Kenya's independence and sovereignty.
As far as I am concerned, I do not agree with those who
blame various underdeveloped countries-

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. Mr. Martin: I do not understand the interjection
of the Acting Speaker (Hon. Mr. Bourget); he said something. I do not know whether he wants to object. I think
he might give us an explanation.
Hon. Mr. Dechatelets: I did not understand.
Hon. Mr. Martin: I did not understand; the Acting
Speaker said something.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: I did not say anything. I
just smiled.
Hon. Mr. Lefrançois: That is because Senator Deschatelets was not reading from his text.
Hon. Mr. Deschatelets: I continue by saying that as far
as I am concerned I do not agree with those who blame
various underdeveloped countries for their present political system which does not offer any government
alternative.
I am convinced that when those countries reach an
adequate level of schooling and manage to rise from economic stagnation, I am convinced that at that time they
will be living under democratic political forces.
I fully agree with the principle proclaimed by the President of CIDA in his annual report when he says that the
aid extended by Canada to developing countries should
not be based on any political judgment on governments
involved. I think it is, by and large, the policy of this
government, which I indeed share.
As to the second point dealing with the recent energy
crisis and the spiralling increase in oil prices which followed worldwide inflation, it must be understood that
those phenomena require on the part of developing countries additional outlays in foreign currencies equivalent to
all the international, public aid for development purposes.
That oi crisis which shook the economies of well-off
industrialized countries could, in other words, further
widen the gap between the countries of the Third World.
Certain underdeveloped countries have natural resources
which have development potential whereas other countries of the Third World are entirely empty-handed in that
respect. In that context, because of that phenomenon we
have been witnessing for the past six to eight months, it
should be noted that those two groups of countries of the
Third World will no longer be part of the Third World as
such, hence the possibility of further imbalance.
The oil problem and that of food shortage might even
cause us some day to question some traditional partnerships and confront us quite suddenly with the urgency of
establishing a new international order, based on a more
equitable distribution of goods, in order to narrow the
international gap between the rich and the poor.
The United Nations are presently holding an extraordinary session on raw materials and development. I think
that is the most suitable place for such problems to be
discussed with a view to finding a worldwide practical
solution. Honourable senators had the opportunity to read
these past few days in most Canadian newspapers the full
text of the speech delivered to this extraordinary U.N.
session by Mr. Boumediene, President of the Republic of
Algeria. I think he is one of those, if not the one, who
brought about this extraordinary U.N. session.
Hon. Mr. Martin: He is the one who proposed it.
[Hon. Mr. Deschatelets.]

April 30, 1974

Hon. Mr. Deschatelets: Yes, I think so. I certainly do
not share many of the views emphasized by Mr. Boumediene in his speech, but I must admit that he stated the
problem in a way that calls for reflection. The energy
crisis and the subsequent spectacular rise in prices have
made the rich and industrialized countries realize their
dependence on certain raw materials which are vital to
their economy. And I am not referring to oil only. I think
the United States and Canada have learned something
from this crisis. Mr. Boumediene's text suggests that if
immediate action is not taken to help more substantially
those countries that suffer from food shortages, especially
near the desert where the life of a staggering number of
human beings is at stake, some countries producing raw
materials might group together, which would seriously
affect industrialized countries.
It seems that this threat has been well understood by
the American Secretary of State, Mr. Kissinger, who has
warned the Third World countries of the danger that such
a bloc of raw material producing countries could mean. In
his statement, he set up a six-point program allowing for
an international mutual aid policy on a more realistic
basis than those that we have had until now.
I also want to note a suggestion, which I find very
interesting, made by the Shah of Iran who said that his
country is willing to consider that the oil-producing countries place in an international common fund amounts
equivalent to 1 per cent of their oil exports, so as to enable
them to offer long-term low-interest loans to developing
countries who need them most.
Honourable senators, this extraordinary session of the
United Nations was centered on developing countries. One
can imagine that it will lead to an evolution or a reappraisal of the raw material and development problems which
cause poor countries hardships which we could hardly
suspect eight months ago. Moreover, inflation is another
cause of these problems. The obvious intention of Algeria
seems to have been to make the world aware of this new
phenomenon which could, on the short term, pit developing countries against rich industrialized countries.
* (2130)

During this United Nations session, the Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs, the Honourable Mr.
Sharp, has thought fit to stress again some principles that
are shared, according to me, by the great majority of
Canadian parliamentarians, especially the sovereign right
of the producing countries to develop their resources
according to a recognized right, the owner's right. But he
also said, if I remember correctly, that this owner's right
has to be compatible, for the developing countries, with
access rights to these resources and also with some stability so that there would not be any political interference. I
believe this was a direct reference to the behaviour of the
Arab oil-producing countries which based their supply of
oil on some strictly political considerations. This is a
situation which countries like Canada and the United
States cannot accept. It is said that, generally, the chasm
grows wider between the economic development of industrialized countries and that of developing countries.
I should like to rectify this commonly heard assertion
because it is not altogether true. I feel that we must not
consider the situation of developing countries globally.

SENATE DEBATES

Let me explain myseif. The truth is that many industrialized countries such as Japan, Western Germany, Canada
and the U.S.A., have witnessed an extremely swift economic acceleration exceeding ail expectations. But on the
other hand, several developing countries also experienced
very substantial economic progress these last few years
and for some of them the progress was spectacular because
of their potential for the development of some raw mateniais. I think that, when considering ail this, the fairest
conclusion would be that in the circumstances a yearly
review of the economy of developing countries shouid be
made so that more substantial support be directed towards
the countries with the most urgent needs, because, again,
there are now among the countries of the Third World
very big differences so that some do flot need our immediate help whereas others do.
Once again the United Nations seems to be just the
organization to, co-ordinate international help to developing countries by giving priority to the poorest ones.

27601-23

Honourable senators, 1 feit I could not talk about the
trip I made on the occasion of the inaugaration of educational establishments in francophone African countries,
without at least alluding to those aspects. As for me, after
having presided at the inauguration of those two higher
learning establishments in Senagal and Cameroon, thanks
to Canadian contributions of almost $17 million in a field
as vital as education for underdeveloped countries, I
came back convinced that Canada is not only aware of the
obligations that we have towards Third World countries,
but that we are now assuming a large part of our international responsibilities.

On motion of Senator Langlois, debate adjourned.

FORT-FALLS BRIDGE
OWNERSHIP-SCHEDULE OF TOLLS-GROSS REVENUESNOTICE OF INQUIRY

Hon. Douglas D. Everett: Honourable senators, I give
notice that I have a series of questions to ask of the Leader
of the Government. They are as follows:
1. Is the present bridge between Fort Frances, Ontario,
and International Falls, Minnesota, owned by the
International Bridge and Terminal Company?
2. Is the International Bridge and Terminal Company
a subsidiary or affiliate of the Boise Cascade Corporation of the U.S.A.?
3. Is the bridge a Customs and Immigration entry
point between Canada and the U.S.A.?
4. What is the schedule of tolls charged to users of the
bridge?

5. What are the nearest Customs and Immigration
entry points between Canada and the U.S.A. to the
east and west of the bridge?
6. What gross revenues did the International Bridge
and Terminal Company derive from the operation of
the bridge in the calendar years 1972 and 1973?
7. What other Customs and Immigration entry points
between Canada and the U.S.A. impose tolls for their
use and which of them are privately owned?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, I am sure that
Senator Everett will understand why I should wish to take
this series of questions as notice, which I do.
THE SENATE
REMARKS ATTRIBUTED TO CLERK OF THE PRIVY COUNCILQUESTION ANSWERED

Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, there was some
discussion last evening of press reports of remarks said to
have been made concerning the Senate by the Clerk of the
Privy Council, Mr. Gordon Robertson. At that time I said
that I would endeavour to secure the text and to determine what had been involved. I have since done so.
I think the simplest course to follow would be to table
the text and ask that it be printed as an appendix to
today's Honsard so that any senator who is interested can
see exactly what was said.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: But you will be commenting on it.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: And it will be printed?
Hon. Mr. Martin: I have asked that it shall be printed.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it agreed, honourable
senators?

Hon. Senators: Agreed.
[For text of speech see appendix, pp. 362-364]
Hon. Mr. Martin: It will be found that what is involved
is one single paragraph in a text of some 13 pages. It will
also be found that the paragraph was part of an address to
describe to an American audience certain differences
between our federal system and theirs. The paragraph in
question is at page 3, as follows:
If, as has been said, the upper bouse in a federation
is "to mirror the federal bargain", our mirror in
Canada was cracked from the beginning. Our Senate
was indeed designed to represent regions rather than
population-24 Senators from each of four regions: the
Maritime provinces, Quebec, Ontario and the west.
There are another six for Newfoundland since it
joined Canada in 1949. But our Senate is appointed by
the federal government of the day: it is not elected. It
is acutely conscious that it cannot claim to represent
or to have received the confidence of any constituen-

May 1, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

cy, so its powers, virtually equal in law to those of the
House of Commons, have in fact been attenuated to
something like a suspensive veto. It is in no position
to champion regional rights with any degree of conviction or force.

(1410)

Mr. Robertson's paper was one of three presented to an
international panel discussing "Decentralizing Decisionmaking" in federal systems. The other papers were on the
relevant situations in the United States and Mexico. I have
read Mr. Robertson's paper in entirety and he presents a
reasonable and responsible discussion of a subject of
apparent interest to political scientists and constitutional
lawyers, especially in the United States. In the course of it,
he found the appointive basis of our Senate relevant to the
discussion and presents a thesis as to certain consequences
resulting from it. One may agree or disagree with the
thesis. Personally, I do not agree with it. However, it is a
thesis that has been presented by others and has been
presented by him, as I think the context shows, in a
responsible manner. Mr. Robertson has assured me that in
no sense was any attack or criticism of the Senate intended. He much regrets that his remarks should have been so
interpreted.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Honourable senators, I understood the
leader to table the speech, but was it the intention that it
should appear as part of Hansard?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: There was a motion to that effect.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I thought it should have been simply
left with the Clerk.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: There was a motion that it be included
in Hansardso that we know the whole story.
Hon. Mr. Molson: May I ask the Leader of the Government the name of the body to which this address was
given? I am afraid I did not catch it.
Hon. Mr. Martin: It was made before the American
Society of International Law.
Hon. Mr. Molson: Thank you.

CANADIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION
TELEVISION PROGRAM "LES BEAUX DIMANCHES"-QUESTION
OF PRIVILEGE

Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, I rise on a
question of privilege which has nothing to do with the one
we have just discussed. Mine deals with the program
televised last Sunday, April 28, on the French network of
the CBC and entitled "Les Beaux Dimanches".
I do not know whether other senators saw it but, to my
mind, not only was that program in very bad taste, but it
also ridiculed not only the Canadian parliamentary
system but Her Majesty the Queen and the Governor
General of Canada as well.
I feel that such programs should not recur. I insist on
this as I intend to suggest to the chairman of our Standing
Committee on Transport and Communications that he
consider the possibility of requesting the chairman of the
CBC and the chairman of CRTC to appear before our
committee, as witnesses, bringing with them the video

tapes of that program so that other senators might also see
it and form an opinion on the advisability of having
Canadian taxpayers pay the tab for such programs. This
one lasted one hour and a half. In addition, I would like to
know how much it cost, just as I would like an explanation of what seems to me to be much too frequent an
occurrence.
Indeed, every time the CBC broadcasts similar programs, it seems that the artists who play the roles are
always those who are well known as active separatists in
Quebec. Whether this is a coincidence or whether it
reflects a preconcerted will to emphasize the message
which obviously must be conveyed to the people, I do not
know. I should also like to hear from the chairman of the
CRTC whether this is the type of program he has in mind
when he speaks of Canadian content. For my part, if that
is what is called Canadian content, I would rather see
American westerns because they, at least, are not
anti-Canadian.
Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche): Honourable senators, I wish to add a few words to Senator
Langlois' remarks. I had a chance to watch this program
on Sunday night, and it made me furious. I found it
disgusting and immoral, particularly when they made fun
of democracy and the Queen and so forth. This program
was very expensive, because it is the people who pay for it.
Besides, such programs cannot be of any good to the public
at large.
Some people might accept this kind of thing as a trifle or
comedy, but I think it was going far beyond a joke, and I
certainly endorse Senator Langlois' recommendations. I
hope it will be possible very soon to show this program to
all senators as it was aired on the French network so that
they may all realize how contemptible it was.
Hon. Mr. Desruisseaux: Honourable senators, I did not
watch this program, but this is not the first time we have
had reason to complain about this series. Having been in
that business for 12 years, I wish to note that it would be
useful to determine once and for all who has to check
these programs so that we may know what is the procedure when censorship is necessary, when people do not
follow their text or when Canadian authorities are ridiculed. I think this is a very good chance to do so.
Hon. Miss Lapointe: Honourable senators, I fully agree
with the comments of my colleague Senator Langlois. I
will surely second a motion if he moves one.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, I surely do not
wish to force the hand of the chairman of the Senate
Committee on Transport and Communications, but I must
tell him that I intend to put a motion to this effect, if my
suggestion is not accepted.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, I think that in
practical terms it is not necessarily the responsibility of
the chairman of the committee to convene it to study this
problem. I rather think that it should be done on the
recommendation of the Senate. Therefore, I invite Senator
Langlois to present his motion at the first opportunity.
Hon. Mr. Martin: It happens too frequently.

Hon. Mr. Welch: Madam Speaker, I cannot hear what is
being said.

NATIONAL FINANCE
INFORMATION CANADA-CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF
COMMITTEE-DEBATE ADJOURNED

On the Order:
Consideration of the Report of the Standing Senate
Committee on National Finance on Information
Canada, tabled in the Senate on Tuesday, 30th April

1974.-(Honourable Senator Everett).
Hon. Mr. Everett: Honourable senators, I was given
leave to make a statement on the report on Information
Canada, which was tabled last evening. With leave, I
would ask that Senator Grosart be allowed to speak at this
time in consideration of the report.
The Hon. the Speaker: Has the Honourable Senator
Grosart leave to proceed at this time?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators will recall
that we apparently had some difficulty last evening as to
just where we were in the presentation of this report, if I
may use the word "presentation." I think it is of the
utmost importance that reports of this kind be put before
the Senate, not merely for consideration but for adoption.
I know that in the past we have had some different
procedures, largely because the activities of Senate committees have changed considerably in the last few years.
There have been occasions when reports of Senate committees have been put before the Senate for adoption, and
I suggest that this is a case in which it would be of the
utmost importance that this report, which deals with
Information Canada, be discussed in that context.
I therefore would suggest that the opportunity be given
at this time to Senator Everett, if he so desires-and I
have discussed this with him-to move the adoption of the
report. I believe this would be quite in order under our
rules. As I understand it, we finally decided yesterday that
we are now dealing with a motion to take into consideration the report of the committee. I would suggest, therefore, that a motion arising from that discussion to adopt
the report might be in order.
Hon. Mr. Sparrow: Perhaps I might ask a question at
this stage. Has there been any precedent established for
adoption of such reports?
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I had hoped to avoid a discussion of
that, as it would take me into a broad discussion of the
rules. The fact is that our rules are considerably out of
date, I think, in respect of this. Rule 78 deals generally
with the reports of a select committee, and this is a select
committee. Rule 78(1) states that the report shall be presented by the chairman of the committee; rule 78(2) states
that such a report shall be received without debate. Rule
78(3) states:
A report which by its own terms is for the information only of the Senate shall be laid on the table but
[Hon. Mr. Welch.]

may on motion be placed on the orders of the day for
future consideration.
That is what has happened in this case; it has been placed
on the Orders of the Day for future consideration. What I
am suggesting is that the Senate, in considering the report,
could quite properly decide to adopt it.
The other sections of rule 78 refer specifically to bills,
and they are not germane to this discussion. What I am
suggesting is that if we are entitled to consider the report,
we are entitled to move that it be adopted.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Honourable senators, I think Senator
Grosart himself has indicated that there is nothing in our
rules about adopting a report. Certainly, under rule 78(3)
there is a provision that a report, which by its own terms
is for the information only of the Senate, be laid on the
table and may on motion be placed on the Orders of the
Day for future consideration. We certainly can consider it,
and that was done earlier. I am sure there are senators
who wish to speak on this report. It is a very important
report, and we ought to have an opportunity of studying
and debating it.
But the motion before us is for consideration of this
report. Once we have done that, the Senate can then
decide what it should do. The Senate, of course, is always
master of its own wishes. To do that at this moment would
not, I think, be in accordance with our rules, nor would it
be the right thing to do.
Hon. Mr. Deschatelets: May I put a question to Senator
Everett? It seems to me that this report has aroused much
interest. I should like to know if there is a reason why he
does not move consideration of his report, which would
then be open for debate. Is there any special reason not to
do so?
Hon. Mr.
discussing.

Martin: That

is the very thing

we are

Hon. Mr. Everett: Honourable senators, I would prefer
to move the adoption of the report, even though it goes
against some of the precedents of the Senate. These
reports are prepared by committees of the Senate; they are
put before the public, and I think they ought to have the
force of acceptance by the total Senate. I believe that
makes good sense, and I think Senator Grosart's suggestion is a sound one. If there is a ruling against it, I would
of course accept the ruling. However, if it is possible to
move the adoption of the report so that after debate it is
either rejected or accepted by the Senate, I would like to
do so. If it has the backing of the entire Senate, I would be
more than pleased to make such a motion.
Hon. Mr. Molson: Honourable senators, perhaps we are
reading into our rules meanings that are not there. Rule
78(2) says:
A report presented to the Senate shall be received
without debate.
That is all right; the report can be received by the Senate
and it does not need to be debated. If on the other hand
there is any reason why the report should be debated, I sce
no reason why rule 78(3) should not apply and the chairman of the committee or his designated member of the
committee move that it be considered on a future day. This

May 1, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

gives us an option. The rules give an option to deal with
the report in any way desirable.
If a committee reports a bill without any amendment, it
is simply accepted and there is no debate. If there are
amendments, there is provision for that. On the other
hand, if the report is on the activity of a committee on a
special subject, it is obvious, as Senator Everett has said,
that the committee would like to know whether the Senate
concurs and puts the weight of the Senate behind that
committee report. That is perfectly simple. The chairman
would then move that it be considered or that it be adopted. As Senator Martin just said, we are masters of our own
house; there is no limitation; there is nothing in the rules
that precludes that. I would suggest that under the existing rules we can deal with these reports in the way that
seems best to the house, and accept, approve or debate
them as we see fit.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I think what we have done so f ar is
quite in order, because we have only been asked to consider the report, which we are presently doing. Rule 78(5)
surely allows this chamber to entertain a motion to debate
the report. It says:
When the report recommends amendments to a
billThen these are the important words.
-or
makes proposals which requires legislative
implementation by the Senate, a motion to adopt the
report shall be in order: Provided that where the
recommended amendments or proposals which require
legislative implementation are substantial, consideration of the report shall be postponed to a future day.
The report presented to this bouse contains a recommendation, which is a major one, that an act of Parliament be
passed to regulate Information Canada in the future. This
would require substantial legislative implementation, and
I think its adoption should be the subject matter of a
motion in due course. However, we can carry on and give
consideration to the report subject to such a motion being
made later on. It bas not been made as yet, but I understand it could be made under our rules at any stage during
our consideration of the report.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I think we should express gratitude to
Senator Grosart for having raised this point. Undoubtedly
some clarification is needed. It is quite clear from the
reading of rule 78, along with certain others pertaining to
reports of committees, that presentation of a report is one
thing, consideration of a report is another, and adoption of
a report is yet another.
*

(1430)

Presentation needs no debate, of course. Ail you do is
present a report, leave it at that, and then there is no
debate. You have then the choice of having the report
considered, or adopted. If the report provides for amendments to a bill, it must be adopted before third reading of
the bill, as amended, can be considered. If you have a
report like the one with which we are now dealing, you
can either ask for consideration or for adoption.
I agree with Senator Langlois that we could adopt the
report. But it has to be noted that the practice about these
reports from committees has not been to move the adoption of the report but merely consideration of the report.

This was so in the case of the report-and I see Senator
Lamontagne nodding-of Senator Lamontagne's Committee on Science Policy. I mean, it would be quite in order
now to move for the adoption of a report like that.
Hon. Mr. Molson: No.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Well, maybe not. It would break
ground in the sense that we are not adopting a piece of
legislation or adopting a report which has several recommendations. We are going to be faced, each of us, with
whether we agree with the whole of the report or disagree
with some of the conclusions, and thenHon. Mr. Lamontagne: You have to read it.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: We have to read it, as Senator Lamontagne has suggested, and well he might, for his Science
Policy report has not been read by everybody, although it
has received wide publication. This is the difference, of
course, between consideration and adoption: the Senate
would have to say that it agrees with every recommendation of this committee or of this report if adopted.
I have no objection to a motion to adopt the report, but
to me it does not mean the same as consideration of the
report. The three stages have to be considered and I think
the rules might be clarified. There is nothing in the rules
which is in contradiction with the idea of either considering the report or adopting it.
Hon. Mr. Molson: Honourable senators, I wonder if I
might say a word, following Senator Flynn's comments. If
we think back, there are some reports that we have adopted-such as those of the Committee on Internal Economy,
on the Rules of the Senate and others which would be
thought internal-and by their nature they require the
concurrence of this chamber, otherwise they are ineffective and mean nothing.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Molson: Generally speaking, I fully agree with
Senator Flynn and I just want to point out that the nature
of a report sometimes calls for it to be dealt with a little
bit differently.
Hon. Mr. Everett: I quite agree that this is breaking new
ground, nevertheless I am inclined to think-and I think
honourable senators will, too, on reflection,-that it is
better for these reports to come before the Senate, to be
examined by the Senate, and adopted if possible. Then the
full force of the Senate is behind the report.
I appeal to Her Honour the Speaker on the mattereither allow me to bring forth a motion now to adopt the
report, or allow the motion for consideration of the report
to proceed at this time and, at the end of the debate, allow
me to bring forth a motion for adoption of the report.
Hon. Mr. Martin: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Everett: I would ask Her Honour the Speaker
to give a ruling on this point.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, I think the
second suggestion is the right one, that we should proceed
with consideration of the report. Then, after we have had
an opportunity to know what is in the report, we can be
prepared to deal with a motion for adoption.

SENATE DEBATES
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Allister Grosart: Honourable senators, I concur, of
course, in the ruling that has been made. I suggested that
the motion for adoption be made now because I thought
this would make for a better debate and provide an opportunity for amendments. I do not know how, under a
motion just for mere consideration, amendments can be
proposed. However, I will leave that point as it is not so
important.
The main point has been made-and I think it is to the
credit of the Senate that it has been decided-that a report
such as this can be put before the Senate for adoption,
regardless of what precedents there may be.
I congratulate Senator Everett and the vice-chairman of
the committee, Senator Sparrow, and others on the production of this report. I regard it as an important report
which can be of tremendous benefit in offsetting inefficiencies and mismanagement in an area which has been of
considerable controversy.
The committee worked long hours. I was a member of
the committee, but I am sorry to say I did not attend all
the meetings because I was unavoidably away. At any
rate, I can congratulate the whole committee for producing what I consider to be an excellent report.
One question which I have been asked in the last 12
hours by senators who have not read the report is whether
the report is a "whitewash" of Information Canada. I can
assure honourable senators that this report is not a whitewash of Information Canada. Indeed, it makes some major
suggestions for change, not only in the structure of Information Canada but in its approach to the important problem of the outflow of government information to the
Canadian public.
To support that statement, honourable senators, I would
draw your attention to the summary of conclusions and
recommendations which takes up only three pages at the
beginning of the report. In this summary you will find
such statements as "Information Canada's main function
is to regulate and co-ordinate departmental information
activities", "to achieve an effective overall information
service to the Canadian public at the lowest possible cost",
again, "should regulate and co-ordinate"; again the phrase
"continually evaluate", the phrase "evaluate the cost
effectiveness"; and referring to the blue book of estimates,
and this is with respect to the whole government structure, "the cost of information services should be fully and
clearly shown." Another phrase is "screening the information budgets of all departments", and so on.
I will come to these in a little more detail later, but
throughout this whole report there is an emphasis on a
new role for Information Canada, namely, to take charge
in a real way of the outflow of information from departments and possibly from other applicable agencies,
although the report does not go too fully into the question
of the outflow from certain crown corporations.
The first and major recommendation is that there
should be an act of Parliament setting up Information
Canada. As things stand at the moment, Information
Canada is the result of a dreadful and inexcusable bureaucratic shortcut. This vitally important agency was set up
under an appropriation act dealing with supplementary
[The Hon. the Speaker.]

May 1, 1974

estimates. As a result, Information Canada has never had
any terms of reference. To those who have been critical of
Information Canada-and I am one of them-it should be
pointed out that Information Canada was placed in an
impossible position right from its inception. The Prime
Minister did make a speech following a report by a task
force, but in that speech he certainly did not lay any clear
responsibility on Information Canada for the regulation
and coordination of the total outflow of government
information.
The second concern of the committee was that Information Canada should not become a government tool for
propaganda. That accusation has been made, particularly
in the press, largely because of the fact that Information
Canada was, in rather vague terms, made responsible to
various ministers, and because a change of the minister
responsible was made without any basis in common sense
except that perhaps the minister who had been interested
was moved to another department and thought, therefore,
that Information Canada should move with him.
This actually happened, and this is the kind of inefficiency which has hampered greatly the operations of Information Canada.
*

(1440)

The question, of course, is often asked: Is there a place
for Information Canada? Should we have it at all? This
bas perhaps been the major question that has been asked
since it undertook these important duties. I for one think
there is a place for Information Canada. The committee
makes it very clear that it is not a major function of
Information Canada to turn out more information, that
the real function of Information Canada is to get control
of the outflow of information. It makes specific
suggestions.
I am sure that every honourable senator is aware, from
looking at his desk after he has been away for two or three
days, of the endless duplication, the waste, the nonsensical
repetition of material that he finds. It is the correction of
this kind of thing that is clearly indicated in this report as
a function of Information Canada.
The question, of course, is this. How does an agency
such as Information Canada, not itself a ministry, take
control, regulate and coordinate-these are the terms used
throughout the report-the information flow from departments? The report makes it clear that it does not contemplate Information Canada moving in and creating al' the
necessary material in each department. The report makes
it clear that it does not see Information Canada as the
central propaganda output-using "propaganda" in the
best sense, because that word does have a good sense, of
course. On the other hand, it does see the necessity of
regulation, and it goes quite far.
One of the things that interested me, particularlybecause, as honourable senators know, I had at one time
some connection with the advertising agency business-is
that this report sees Information Canada getting control
of the allocation of advertising between advertising agencies. It quotes the task force, which made it very clear that
at the time the task force reported, the whole business of
government advertising was just a matter of political
patronage. The report strongly suggests that there should
be an imrmediate end to this, and that it should be one of

May 1, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

the functions of Information Canada to see to it that the
appointment of advertising agencies is on the basis of
their efficiency, not their past services to any government.
This matter has been raised recently in the press, and
one would hope that one of the committee recommendations that will be acted upon with some speed by the
government is this one dealing with the allocation of
government business to advertising agencies. The fact is
that the federal government is by far the largest client of
the advertising agency business in Canada. In fact, it
dominates it to an extent that may be creating some
danger-I say, "may be creating some danger"-to the
freedom of the press in Canada.
A very interesting suggestion by the committee, one
which puts some teeth into its future operations, is that
Information Canada should have a special relationship
with the Treasury Board.
Recommendation 5 reads:
Information Canada should act as the agent of the
Treasury Board in screening the information budgets
of all departnents and agencies and advise Treasury
Board regarding expenditures on information programs proposed by departments.
I should think that most of us are aware I am not referring
to any particular government at the moment, although, if
there is an optimal position, I think it has been reached
fairly recently.
We are aware that there is excessive expenditure by
departments, not all political although to some extent
political, but also to promote perhaps the ego of a minister.
We find those around him more concerned with winning
the approbation of the minister than the approbation of
the public. A good example of this is that on my desk this
morning, for example, I f ind mimeographed copies of three
speeches by ministers, all of which appear in Hansard. By
comparing them I could make a good guess as to which
publicity man in which department is the white-haired
boy of the minister. Some are only putting it out in one
colour, but the boys who are really working for their
ministers are putting out speech press releases in two,
three, and in one case, four colours.
Hon. Mr. Martin: What colour would be best one for a
minister to use?
An Hon. Senator: Blue.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Senator Denis doesn't know anything
about that.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: I myself would be in favour of considerably more "blueing" of the whole outflow of information, but at the present time it has occasionally a strong
red tinge and, I am sorry to say, I suspect at times a rather
pink one. I would rather not be misunderstood in that
remarkHon. Mr. Martin: You won't.
Hon. Mr. Grosart: One reason I suggested we might be
debating this on a motion for adoption is that I am not in
full agreement with some of the recommendations. I
hasten to say that my disagreement is in fairly minor
things, and in that kind of discussion I should like to see
one or two points raised. For example, the regional offices
of Information Canada are useful when associated with

bookstores and enquiry centres, and so on. The number of
regional offices should be limited to Halifax, Montreal,
Toronto, Winnipeg and Vancouver. I think there should be
a regional office in each province. I am quite sure the
chairman would reply that under recommendation 8 there
will be an enquiry centre in each province which might
operate, in effect, as a regional centre, but I see some
discrepancy between the two recommendations.
Also there is the question of government bookstores.
The committee looked at this problem seriously, because it
is very, very expensive to set up a government bookstore
in a location of high public exposure. The committee
recommends a limitation of the number of bookstores, and
of the places and provinces in which they would be located. One recognizes that every Canadian is entitled to
access to government publications, and the report therefore suggests that there be a more efficient method of
distribution to private booksellers than there is at the
present time. It is important to me that as far as possible
the public have complete exposure to all publications of
the Government of Canada. When it is left to private
bookstores, which must pay for the books as they receive
them, naturally they are not going to display all the books.
In fact, I do not think there is a single private bookseller
in Canada who displays more than one-twentieth of the
total. That is just a guess, but I have spent some time in
these bookstores. On the other hand, anyone who goes
through large bookstores in a metropolitan centre will be
amazed at the wealth of publications and subjects of
interest, perhaps being unaware that there is a government publication on that subject. I might say that some of
the provinces through their government bookstores are
doing a much better job than we are. Here I refer particularly to British Columbia where I myself on a casual visit
wound up buying 12 books that I did not even know were
published.

The committee endorses the activities of the expositions
branch. This is the branch which has the responsibility for
Canadian participation in expositions around the world. I
find myself in full agreement with that. Unfortunately,
the expositions branch ran into a deficit last year, and I
would hope that we might have a little closer look at this
to find out why. Members of the committee will recall that
the subject was raised when we were discussing the last
supplementary estimates, but we did not get any complete
answer as to why they ran a deficit.
The committee also suggests that Information Canada
should have some responsibility for the monitoring of
information personnel in the departments. With this I find
myself in the fullest agreement, because to my knowledge,
and I am sure to the knowledge of many senators, there
are people calling themselves public relations officers or
information off icers in the government service who would
not qualify in a business public relations kindergarten.
The teri "public relations officer" or "information officer" is sometimes, not too often, used to cover a multitude
of sinners if not of sins.
One final comment, I hope that honourable senators will
have an opportunity to examine this report very carefully
because it goes into more detail of the current operations
of Information Canada and of the whole total outflow of

SENATE DEBATES

government information than bas ever been done previously. I think it does a better job than the task force which
tended to be a little abstract, a little idealistic, whereas in
my view the recommendations which we have here will
produce a great improvement. In time it will represent a
definite step forward, although I am not suggesting for
one moment that even the full adoption of this report will
completely solve all problems that surround the great
question of the outflow of government information to the
public.
Hon. Herbert O. Sparrow: Honourable senators, in the
few moments that I should like to take to discuss this
report I want to commend the chairman of the Standing
Senate Committee on National Finance for his foresight in
directing and advising that committee in taking on this
very important study which is now summarized in the
report before you today. He bas given in this chamber a
very clear and concise explanation of that report, and I am
sure that al] senators who listened last evening have a
good understanding of what the report contains and now
have sufficient information either to agree or to disagree
with the contents of that report.
I want to tell Senator Grosart also that I listened
closely to what he said today, and appreciate greatly the
explanation that he has given of the report. As we are all
aware, Senator Grosart bas played a very important role
in the work of the Senate Committee on National Finance
and in its work on this particular study.
So far as all members of that committee who worked so
diligently are concerned, I want to concur in what has
been said by the chairman and by Senator Grosart in that
regard and to agree that they did an excellent job on that
committee.
The members of the staff of Information Canada were
helpful to us. We received a great deal of help from the
President of the Treasury Board. The Minister of Labour,
who appeared before our committee as being responsible
for Information Canada, was very forthright with us and
was of great assistance to the committee. I mention those
few, although there were many other witnesses who were
extremely helpful and to whom I wish to express our
commendations and thanks.
The Standing Senate Committee on National Finance
felt, with some justification, that its review of the estimates in total, although a worthwhile exercise, left insufficient time to do much more than take a cursory look at
each department and agency of government. Your committee felt that there was from time to time a need to take an
in-depth look into certain departments and agencies of
government, unfettered by the pressures of time and deadlines. It was the consensus of the committee that these
in-depth studies of specific departments would be of value
to Parliament, to the government and to the citizenry,
when it appeared that a department or agency might not
be fulfilling its designated function on behalf of the
people of Canada. To serve Canadians as they should be
served, a government department or agency must spend
its budget as detailed in the estimates. It must spend its
funds in a prudent and benefit-conscious manner and
must utilize its manpower efficiently. Following upon the
committee's impressions and guidelines, the most obvious
[Hon. Mr. Grosart,]

May 1, 1974

and logical study to be undertaken at the time appeared to
the committee to be that of Information Canada.
This agency of government was given birth through an
appropriations act in June 1970, following a statement in
the House of Commons in February of that same year by
the Prime Minister to the effect that such an agency
would be established. He outlined at that time certain
guidelines that the new agency would follow. Information
Canada, born without the security of an Act of Parliament
spelling out its authority and responsibility, has lived a
frustrated, maligned and largely undefended existence.
The critics of Information Canada have had a fear, real or
imagined, that this agency was or would become a highly
sophisticated propaganda machine defending and promoting the government of the day. I believe that when our
committee began the study of Information Canada, most
of the members of that committee believed that Information Canada was not fulfilling a sufficiently useful function to justify its budget or even its very existence.
* (1500)

They believed that it was or could become a propaganda
machine for the government of the day and that after an
in-depth study a recommendation would be made to abolish the agency. I believe that Information Canada was and
is fulfilling a useful function and that its budget can be
justified, that it has not been and is not now a propaganda
machine designed to protect and promote the government
in power.
Having said that, I wish to quickly state that there are,
however, areas in which improvement can be made in its
functions and that a vigilant, perceptive and critical eye
must be levelled at this agency at all times to see that it is
not used as a propaganda machine. I believe that if the
government agrees with the conclusions arrived at by
your committee and follows its recommendations, Information Canada will be a most useful agency. It will work
effectively with other government departments on behalf
of Canadians in assisting to satisfy their hunger for factual information. In the process it will either save a considerable amount of dollars or give better service, or both.
Information Canada bas what appears to me to be a very
sincere and dedicated group of employees who have done a
good job, despite untold frustrations, of nurturing, guiding
and developing an organ of government that has as yet not
matured. It is now time for Information Canada to come of
age and begin to fulfil the important role it can play.
Information, proper, factual and relevant, is perhaps the
most important oil to lubricate the wheels of change,
whether that change takes place in business, industry or
the private lives of individuals. The amount of information that can be made available is so great that no person
could possibly put it all to use, understand all of it, or
physically or mentally handle it.
Information relating to areas of federal government
concern should be made available to all citizens. Information desired by citizens should be made easily available on
request, at no cost for certain items and at reasonable cost
for others.
Some government information may not be of interest or
value to all people, and therefore it should be distributed
on request. He who knows a lot about a few things serves
better than one who knows a little about a lot of things.

May 1, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

Information Canada, given the necessary opportunity and
power by an act of Parliament, can improve the quality
and efficiency of government information services. It can
regulate and coordinate departmental information activities to produce a comprehensive information system. It
can evaluate departmental information programs to
ensure that they are employing the most effective techniques to satisfy the information needs of the public. It
can evaluate the cost effectiveness of all information programs and act to prevent waste and duplication. It can
make easily available to the public factual and useful
information on federal policies, programs and services.
Information Canada is extant, should remain so and, if
the recommendations contained in this report are followed, will remain so. I commend this report to honourable senators, to the government and to all Canadians.
On motion of Senator Langlois, debate adjourned.

APPENDIX
(See p. 354.)

THE "NEW FEDERALISM": CANADIAN DEVELOPMENTS IN
DECENTRALIZING DECISION-MAKING
PAPER PRESENTED BY MR. R. GORDON ROBERTSON, CLERK OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL
AND SECRETARY TO THE CABINET, TO THE 68TH ANNUAL MEETING
OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
APRIL 25-27, 1974, WASHINGTON, D.C.

In the years leading up to 1867, the Fathers of the
Canadian federation-or "Confederation" as it was loosely
called-set out, among other things, to avoid what they
perceived to be some of the deficiencies of the American
federation. The United States had just survived the devastating war between the States: a war that our statesmen
thought was made possible by the existence of overly-powerful States and an unduly weak central government. We
would profit by that experience. Our constitution was
designed to include several features that would provide a
strong centre. Those who devised our constitution, however, under-estimated the capacity of the judges of the
Privy Council in London, then our final court of appeal, to
interpret up as down and round as square. The result of
this and other factors is that we ended up with a much
weaker central government than that of the United States
and provinces very much stronger than your States.
Indeed, I suspect that Canada has one of the most decentralized systems of government in the world. Notwithstanding this, today we still hear complaints by provincial
governments about "domination by Ottawa".
Canadians and Americans have so many things in
common, and their legal and constitutional roots are so
entwined in the long history of law and government in
England, that I think we tend to forget how fundamentally
different our federal systems are in their day-to-day reality. The differences are legal, structural and operational.
With all the respect that one trained in the law can accord
to a group of lawyers, I would say that of these the legal
differences relating to the federal concept as such are the
least important. What have turned out, I believe, to be
much more significant are what I call "structural" differences. A third category are "operational differences"differences in the way things work. On balance, these
differences have created a situation in which our provinces
play a role more important than the distribution of powers
or the results of judicial interpretation alone would have
produced. They are much greater sovereignties than your
States and their role in our federation goes well beyond
that of administering particular categories of governmental powers. These differences are significant in relation to
the question of decentralization.
Among the structural factors that have enhanced the
role of our provinces, a significant one is that the provinces
are ten in number and not f ifty. They are few enough that
most, led by a strong Premier as they usually are, can be
significant personalities on our national stage. Moreover,
two of those ten provinces together contain over sixty per
cent of our population. The Premiers of Ontario and
Quebec can speak-especially if they do so together-with
a degree of influence and authority that, in relative terms,

does not have any parallel in the United States. Moreover,
the Premier of Quebec has a special place as the head of a
province that is over 80 per cent French-speaking. Heading
the only government in the country that represents a
population that is in majority French-Canadian, he sometimes claims to speak with the voice, not just of Quebec,
but of French-Canada. These facts of structure would, by
themselves, have given the provincial governments a place
of strength. There are other aspects of our system, however, that have created for them a role as regional champions and spokesmen that your States do not enjoy to the
same extent.
If, as has been said, the upper house in a federation is "to
mirror the federal bargain", our mirror in Canada was
cracked from the beginning. Our Senate was indeed
designed to represent regions rather than population-24
Senators from each of four regions: the Maritime provinces, Quebec, Ontario and the west. There are another six
for Newfoundland since it joined Canada in 1949. But our
Senate is appointed by the federal government of the day:
it is not elected. It is acutely conscious that it cannot claim

to represent or to have received the confidence of any
constituency, so its powers, virtually equal in law to those
of the House of Commons, have in fact been attenuated to
something like a suspensive veto. It is in no position to
champion regional rights with any degree of conviction or
force.
In our House of Commons, the life of the government
depends on keeping a constant majority in approval of its
policies and actions. The Prime Minister is there to lead;
the Cabinet is there to debate and to explain; and the
Members on the government side provide approval and
applause in the face of the enemy across the Chamber-for
they are drawn up face to face like contending armies.
Party discipline has to be strong or the life of a government may be short. The result is to leave little room for the
voicing of regional complaints or for their compromise and
adjustment in our elective house. The regional arguments
occur and the compromises are made in the party caucuses,
which are secret. They also occur in the meetings of our
Cabinet which includes representatives from all regions,
but those meetings too are secret. In short, we do not have
in our central governmental structure the place for public
and vigorous voicing of regional differences that you have
in the United States Congress and especially in your powerful Senate. This fact, plus the other structural differences to which I have referred, combine to place in the
hands of our provincial governments a major role among
the public voices of regional interest. The open debate and
apparent reconciliation of regional differences-so important in any federation-tends to occur to a large degree

May 1, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

through direct contest and negotiation between the federal
and provincial governments. This fact in turn bas had an
important influence on the degree to which powers can be
centralized in Canada and the way in which "decentralization" has developed.
"Big Government" of the modern variety normally
brings with it an increase in the centralization of real
power. That seems clearly to have occurred in the United
States. In Canada I do not think it has-precisely because
of the basic strength of the provincial governments to
which I have referred. We have, indeed, explored many
techniques for decentralization and made considerable
progress in that direction.
The strongest pressure for decentralization came from
Quebec. French Canada felt it had not been given an equal
deal in Confederation. One solution proposed in recent
years by a minority of Quebeckers was separation: for
Quebec to become an independent country-possibly with
some form of association with "Canada". A more moderate
solution was to demand an increase in the powers of the
government of Quebec, either powers for Quebec alone"special status"-or an increase in the constitutional
powers of all provincial governments. In the period 196871, we carried out a review of our constitution through a
series of federal-provincial discussions. One of the central
questions we looked at was whether some responsibilities
could be shifted from the federal to the provincial governments, particularly responsibilities of a kind that would
meet Quebec's demand for more "control" over matters
vital to the preservation of the French "fact" or culture in
Canada. The review was as comprehensive as we could
make it. While disagreement in 1971 brought the review to
an end before every part had been completed, it was apparent that the federal and provincial governments were
unable to reach a consensus on any area of consequence
where constitutional decentralization of final decisionmaking authority could occur without undue damage to
the federal government's capacity to play its essential role.
In short, constitutional decentralization appeared to provide no solution.
To provide an effective response to the pressures of
Quebec, and also to the demands of other provincial governments for a more effective voice in decisions they
thought vital to the interests of their region, we have had
resort to what might be called "operational" or "administrative" decentralization. It is not exciting or dramatic, but
it has been effective. To a degree it is the old process,
familiar to our pragmatic tradition of liberal democracy, of
doing sensible things in a reasonable way. The kind of
decentralization we have worked out does not transfer
powers, nor does it try to cleave them into new and more
precise divisions. It operates rather on the basis of a recognition that modern government, with the inter-weaving of
programs and policies as they reach further and further
into the interconnected web of life, requires cooperation
rather than separation and negotiation rather than confrontation. To effect it, we have created a whole complex of
conferences and meetings between governments. Prime
Minister and Premiers, Ministers of every kind of portfolio, and officials of virtually every level and kind meet
and explain, argue and negotiate with a frequency to rival
7

2 601-24l

the United Nations and all its collected agencies. The most
recent sessions at the "top level" were in March and produced a consensus of Prime Minister and Premiers on the
difficult problem of oil and oil prices.
This new operational decentralization is not, however,
simply a matter of discussion and negotiation. A further
element in the arrangements has been to strengthen the
fiscal positions of the provincial governments in a way
that can make the exercise of their proper powers more
effective and real.
In the fifties and early sixties there had been important
transfers of fiscal resources from the federal government
to the provinces. This was done principally through allowing provincial income taxes levied on individuals to be
offset-up to a limit which was sucessively increasedagainst federal income tax. These were called abatements.
This period had also seen the introduction of what we
called opting-out: an arrangement which allowed a province to take, in place of federal payments under conditional grant programs, compensation in the form of increased
abatements against federal taxes. This was primarily
designed in response to demands from Quebec to be freed
from conditions that it thought impaired its freedom of
action and distorted priorities in provincial fields to accord
with federal preferences. The opting-out was made available to all provinces but only Quebec took advantage of it.
We had also begun to see, before our constitutional
review, a reduction in the conditions attached to federal
grants. This trend has continued. We have now gone further and are providing options for individual provincial
action within purely federal schemes. Under the new federal Family Allowances Plan, provinces may request that
payments to families be varied from the national norm of
$20 per child to harmonize with the province's own welfare
programs. Provided the federal payments average out to
$20 per child, and do not fall below $12 for any individual
child, the federal government will comply.
Federal cash transfers to the provinces are now roughly
a quarter of the federal budget; about 40 per cent are
unconditional or block grants. The most important unconditional grants are the so-called equalization payments,
which are paid to the governments of the seven poorer
provinces. Their purpose is to enable provincial governments across the country to provide services at a level that
is roughly in keeping with the national average without
having to resort to unduly burdensome levels of taxation.
The grants operate under a largely automatic formula
which is renewed every five years.
After transfers, the provincial and municipal governments as a group now spend quite a bit more than the
federal government.
I should mention one important difference in the
Canadian grant system as compared with the United
States. The Canadian federal government almost never
deals directly with municipal governments. Grants are
nearly always paid to the provinces. Administrative decentralization below the provincial level is therefore up to the
provincial governments.
The present result of the developments of the last ten
years in Canada is certainly a "new federalism" in the

SENATE DEBATES

sense that it is something quite unknown to our constitution. It is also quite different in degree from anything that
prevailed before the early 'sixties. Decentralization has
occurred in two ways: a more effective expression for the
provincial or regional view about federal action, and more
effective capacity for the provinces to act without condition in provincial fields.
If this sounds idyllic, let me disabuse you. We have our
full share of frustration with government and alienation
from it. We are all familiar with the modern schizophrenia.
On the one hand, people demand that government react
and "do something" about every problem that arises. In the
next breath, they resent the all-pervading activity of government. Similarly, there is a demand for speedy action to
meet rapidly changing problems, but at the same time an
equally great insistence on participation by all in the
decision-making process. Governments at all levels face
these ambivalent attitudes, which suggests that decentralization, while it may help, cannot alone solve the problem
of alienation.
I am not at all sure that decentralization in any conventional sense-the shift of the clear power of decision from
the centre to provincial or to municipal governments-is
likely to prove feasible to any large degree. As government
action becomes increasingly pervasive, and as it reaches
into steadily more complex programs and arrangements,
the need for coherence and consistency steadily grows. It
becomes progressively more difficult to establish lines of
demarcation in policy or in action. Policy becomes a seamless web: economic policy, social policy, cultural policy,
communications policy and a host of others become inextricably intertwined. Blurring of responsibility is likely to
become an increasing characteristic of modern federations.
In such circumstances, the decentralization of final decision-making authority becomes increasingly difficult. If
this conclusion based on Canadian experience can be generalized, it may be that the future path for federations does
not lie in that direction at all. It may rather lie in the
direction we have recently been exploring in Canada: on
the one hand the liberation of the provinces "to do their
own thing" and to do it effectively; on the other, the
increasing acceptance of provincial voices and participation in the decision-making of the central government.

May 1, 1974

It seems increasingly possible that the best means of
reducing friction is for our two levels of government to get
more mixed up together, not to draw apart. That "mixing"
creates real problems at both the executive and the legislative level. Both orders of government-federal and provincial-find themselves constrained to adopt courses of
policy and kinds of program that are not totally desired by
either. The achievement of the least common factor of
disagreement in federal-provincial conferences may look
rather more like a pretty high common factor of general
distaste when the results are debated in Parliament or
provincial legislature. Nor do the legislative bodies take
kindly to the idea that governments, responsible to them
and theoretically influenced by their debates, might mortgage their freedom of action to other governments beyond
their own control. Indeed, for that reason, and also to
ensure that the final and collective responsibility of Cabinets for their own decisions and actions is maintained, care
has to be taken to ensure that a distinction is maintained
between agreement and commitment on the one hand and
final Cabinet decision on the other. Even with this care,
there are occasional evidences of strain, especially upon
the conventional relationships of legislatures and executives in our Parliamentary system. The existence of those
strains is, however, a reflection of a reality that is a form
of decentralization. The control of Parliament or of a legislature over the policy of the government responsible to it is
a bit more elusive and perhaps more diffuse in some cases
precisely because the locus of executive commitment to
policy and program is not as easily identified or as specific
as once it was. The process normally applies to federal
policies and federal programs since it is usually they that
are the subject of negotiation and compromise. However,
the process bas not been one-sided. The federal government has become increasingly involved, through conference and policy discussion, in matters that once were
regarded as totally provincial, such as urban affairs and
social housing. Through these means, in matters of general
importance, policy development and, to a degree, decisionmaking have been considerably "decentralized" in recent
years in Canada from the constitutionally defined centres
of legislative and governing authority.

NATIONAL PARKS ACT
BILL TO AMEND-REPORT OF COMMITTEE PRESENTED

Hon. Salter A. Hayden: Honourable senators, I desire to
present a report of the Standing Senate Committee on
Banking, Trade and Commerce to which was referred Bill
C-6, to amend the National Parks Act.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant, as follows:
The Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade
and Commerce to which was referred Bill C-6,
intituled: "An Act to amend the National Parks Act",
has, in obedience to the order of reference of Tuesday,
April 23, 1974, examined the said bill and now reports
the same without amendment.
In addition, your committee desires to state that,
despite the urgency of this legislation in the present
circumstances, it should at once indicate its opposition
to the principle of clause 2 of Bill C-6, and that it
should serve notice that the clause will not be taken
as a precedent in so far as the Senate is concerned and
that such provisions, which fail to recognize sound
parliamentary principles, should not be included in
future. Moreover, the inconsistency between clause 2
and clause 10 of the bill should also be noted. Obviously the establishment of new parks and the significant
enlargement of existing parks should be dealt with on
the same basis.
However, the committee considers that the availability of the beneficial provisions of the bill should

not, at this time, be delayed because of the defects
noted above.
Respectfully submitted.
Salter A. Hayden,
Chairman.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: With leave of the Senate I should like
to add a word of explanation.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The rider which was read is simply
for the purpose of preserving the position of the Senate in
relation to the type of legislation found in clause 2 and,
possibly, clause 10 of the bill. In reporting this bill without
amendment, we did not wish to leave it stand in that f orm,
which might be cited as a precedent.
I should like to take a few moments to tell you the effect
of the form of legislation contained in clause 2 of the bill.
It provides for a proclamation by the Governor in Council
in respect of significant additions to existing park areas.
The clause sets out the procedure for advertising in the
Canada Gazette the intention to issue a proclamation, together with a description of the area to be added. Provision is made for advertising in major newspapers and in
the area in which the lands are situated.
Clause 2 further provides that this notice of intention to
issue a proclamation shall be tabled in the House of Commons and referred by that House to its Standing Committee on Indian Affairs and Northern Development. That
committee shall then hear witnesses and report to the
House of Commons. A motion must then be made by the
chairman of the standing committee to the House of Commons for concurrence in or disapproval of this intention to
issue a proclamation in respect of making additional lands
part of an existing park. This clause also provides that
there will be no debate on that motion. In the event the
House of Commons does not approve, or if they concur in
the disapproval contained in the report of the committee,
the proclamation procedure will not be available. If the
reading of the bill were confined solely to that clause, it
would appear that there is only one legislative body in the
Parliament of Canada. In this case we have the House of
Commons dealing with the matter entirely and exclusively, with no reference at all to the Senate. We felt that this
was not proper parliamentary practice, and our committee
was unanimous in the view that we should not approve
this f orm of procedure.

e

(1410)

Clause 10 provides by proclamation for the creation of
additional parks in areas described in the bill. The committee found procedures in that clause which fell short of
those outlined for the addition of lands to an existing
park. It felt that there should at least be consistency in the
procedures.

SENATE DEBATES

The committee felt that the merits of the bill were
beyond doubt and that the public would derive benefits
from bringing the bill into law. The committee was
influenced also by the manner in which the minister
explained his position in relation to the bill. He said
frankly that he had opposed clause 2 in committee of the
other place but was outvoted. He had pointed out that it
was not a good way to proceed, but he said that he wanted
the bill for the good that was in it. He stated that if he did
not get it this session he did not know when, if ever, it
would become law. He pointed out that there were
arrangements and negotiations in process for the creation
of additional parks and additions to existing parks.
One member of our committee said that he would speak
against clause 2 but would vote to have the bill reported
without amendment. To avoid any risk that the committee
might establish a precedent by permitting this sort of
thing to be incorporated in a bill, it was decided that the
report should contain a rider stating specifically that it
was not a precedent and pointing out what the committee
considered to be wrong with clauses 2 and 10. It was
agreed that the rider should state that the bill was being
reported without amendment because in general it was
beneficial to the public.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, I agree with what
bas been said by the chairman of the committee. I am
happy that the committee agreed with the objection that I
raised on second reading with regard to the procedure
outlined in clause 2, which completely ignores the Senate.
I agreed in committee that we should avoid useless
confrontation with the Commons at this time and that the
Canadian public should benefit from the good contained
in the bill. But I wouldn't want the position we are now
taking to be considered a precedent.
I assure honourable senators that on whatever side of
the bouse I may be sitting when we reconvene at a later
date, I will adhere to the same position.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Next sitting.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: If royal assent could be given this
evening, I have no objection to the bill's receiving third
reading now.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Next sitting.
Hon. Mr. Laing moved that the bill be placed on the
Orders of the Day for third reading at the next sitting.

the Honourable Senators Burchill, Sparrow and van
Roggen on the list of senators serving on the Standing

Motion agreed to.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, might I have
leave at this stage to say a word of explanation as to what
is in store for us before the end of the present week?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I wish to give this explanation now
so that honourable senators can make necessary arrangements. Although I am not prepared now to present a
motion for the adjournment of the Senate, it is intended
that the Senate will sit tomorrow and very likely on
Monday afternoon. I am delaying my motion until I see
what takes place in the other place over the balance of the
day in order to determine whether we should come back at
11 a.m. tomorrow or at 2 p.m. If we are to come back at 11
a.m., I shall have to present a special motion at the end of
the present day's sitting; otherwise, the motion will simply
be that we adjourn until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
I thought, in all fairness to honourable senators, I
should give that explanation at this time. I long ago
abdicated my role as a prophet of what might take place in
the other house. However, I cannot be deaf to the prophecies we heard on the radio and television last night from
certain people of importance in the other place. I think all
honourable senators know what is to be expected next
week. It was this uncertainty of the situation in the other
place that prompted me to suggest that we sit tomorrow,
and possibly on Monday. It is very likely that the other
place will be sending us legislation, which we would not
wish to see die on our Order Paper because of any failure
on our part to be available to consider it.
0 (1420)

I think all senators understand the situation and would
agree that we have no choice but to sit tomorrow, and
Monday if necessary, for this purpose.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, I think we all
understand the message of the Deputy Leader of the
Government. It seems to me, however, that under the
circumstances we could probably deal with these measures-which, though important, are not urgent-on
Monday afternoon. I understand, however, that something
may happen today in the other place which may indicate
that we will have to work tomorrow. I do not expect
dissolution to take place before Wednesday next. But we
have always been cooperative, and I can assure the Leader
of the Government that we will do our utmost to facilitate
dissolution.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I am happy to know that even if I
have abdicated my role as a prophet I now have a worthy
successor, although I have no more confidence in his
prophecies than I used to have in mine.
Hon. Mr. Martin: So that there will be no misunderstanding about the implications of the record when it
appearsHon. Mr. Flynn: There won't be any doubt.

Hon. Mr. Martin: -and so that it will not be thought
Senator Langlois spoke for all of us, let me add that the
conclusion about dissolution was not proffered by him,
and certainly not commented on at all by me, because I do
not share Senator Flynn's pessimism.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: You mean optimism.

FISHERIES
EXTENSION OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN CANADA AND THE
UNITED STATES-QUESTION
Hon. Mr. Grosart: Honourable senators, I should like to
direct a question to the Leader of the Government on a
matter of some urgency. It is my understanding that there
has been an extension of a certain agreement between
Canada and the United States affecting fishing rights in
Canadian territorial waters. I would ask him what is the
terminal date of that extension, and what will be the
situation if the problems arising over base lines between
the United States Government and Alaska are not
resolved by the terminal date.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Perhaps Senator Grosart would
permit me to reply to that tomorrow. I used to know
something about these things, but now I do not.

RAILWAY RELOCATION AND CROSSING BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. Donald Cameron moved the second reading of Bill
C-27, to facilitate the relocation of railway lines or rerouting of railway traffic in urban areas and to provide financial assistance for work done for the protection, safety and
convenience of the public at railway crossings.
He said: Honourable senators, first of all I must thank
my colleagues for giving me permission to proceed with
this bill today, because I have to leave for the West
tomorrow. I hope that the dire predictions I hear on every
side do not come true during my short absence.
On reading the debate on this bill in the other place, I
was impressed by the fact that it seemed to have the
support of all parties, certainly as far as the principle of
the bill was concerned, and that is a good augury for the
passage of the bill.
It is a privilege to have the opportunity to introduce this
bill, which I consider to be a very timely and significant
piece of legislation. It is a bill which I know will be
warmly welcomed by both provincial and, particularly,
municipal authorities right from one end of the country to
the other.
The bill is divided into four parts. Part I deals with joint
urban development and transportation plans for relocation
schemes. Part II provides for special grants for grade
separations. Part III provides for railway grade crossing
assistance. Part IV is a general clause relating to transitional provisions in respect of the Railway Act. This bill is
the concern of both the Ministries of Urban Affairs and
Transportation, but it is also of major concern to the
provinces and, as I indicated earlier, to every municipality
in the country.

368

SENATE DEBATES

When we talk about relocation of railways and the
building of grade separations, we are talking in terms of
big money. Just to give an example, there has been talk for
some years about the relocation of the railway tracks in
the city of Calgary, an area with which I am very familiar.
At the present time the CPR main line effectively bisects
Calgary from east to west, and the town has grown up
north and south of the tracks. There was some talk in 1962
about moving the tracks from their present location
immediately south on 9th Avenue to a new location several blocks north along the south side of the Bow River. That
is something I am delighted did not go ahead, because it
would have destroyed an area, the Bow River front, that
has a great deal of aesthetic potential. Nothing came of
this plan at the time, but if such a plan were contemplated
today, it is estimated that the work would cost $100 million. That is one indication of the cost of a project of this
kind. As a consequence, there is no question the railway
will remain where it is.
What applies to Calgary I am sure will apply to many
other cities. This raises the next obvious question of alternatives. While I am using Calgary as an illustration, what
applies to Calgary would apply with some modification to
Winnipeg, where they already have had a very intensive
study of transportation, and to the smaller city of Wetaskiwin and many others across Canada.
An alternative to moving the tracks is to design the
central core of the city around the railway tracks so that
high-rise office blocks, apartment blocks, and/or supermarkets, may be built in that area in a way that would
effectively screen the railway from the rest of the community. The railway could be covered over with a parking
area, something that is very necessary in a high density
area. This to me would be a desirable thing to have
happen.
Where there is high-rise development in office blocks,
apartment blocks or supermarkets, developing along a
railway line, proper attention will have to be paid to the
engineering so that the foundations will be deep enough
and substantial enough to withstand vibrations in the soil,
and proper attention will have to be paid to soundproofing
so that the railway will not be an irritant in that respect.
Another thought which occurs to me is this. In many
cities it would be possible to plant a row of trees along the
railway right of way, outside the high density area. These
trees would not only have the effect of obliterating an
eyesore but they would serve to deaden the sound for
people living in homes adjacent to the railway tracks. It
would be naïve to think that in any talk of moving railway
lines, lines which have been established for many years in
our cities and towns, we would not run into conflict with
certain established vested interests, and the vested interests of people who might be affected by the relocation. I do
not doubt for a moment there will be a good deal of
controversy in this respect. But we are safeguarded by the
fact that no plan of removal will be made until it has the
consent of the local planning authorities in respect to the
design of the relocation of the tracks, grade separations,
financing, or whatever it may be.
Honourable senators, that is by way of introduction. On
this matter of planting trees, it just happens that the City
of Calgary will be celebrating its centennial in 1975. I can
[Hon. Mr. Cameron.]

May 2, 1974

think of no better project for the Canadian Pacific Railway, if not on their own responsibility at least certainly
with the cooperation of the municipal authorities, than to
plant a tree screen and thereby set an example to many
other cities.

In Eastern Canada much of the railway network was
established over 100 years ago and much of the remainder
will pass the century mark in the next 25 years. In Western Canada the railway network is not quite so old, but in
both East and West our cities have grown up around a
railway network which has gone largely unchanged since
it was originally established. The changes that have
occurred in our cities since the railway lines were laid out
are enormous. The railways have been indispensable to
the creation and growth of Canada and the Canadian
economy, but in the 1960s and 1970s they have come to be
seen more and more by residents of our cities as part of
the urban problem; in many urban areas they are an
impediment to desirable urban development.
When railways under federal jurisdiction received their
charters they also acquired the right of expropriation to
construct their lines. There has never been in the statutes
a formal method by which municipalities and provinces
could reverse this process and arrange for the relocation of
railway lines in urban areas or control their use. In many
cities, for example, some railway lines might be used to
greater advantage as rapid transit lines to improve urban
transportation. The bill before us, the Railway Relocation
and Crossing Bill, does establish a procedure by which
municipalities and provinces can rearrange railway networks within urban areas and, if necessary, relocate some
railway lines altogether.
The Ministry of State for Urban Affairs and the Ministry of Transport have spent a good deal of effort on
determining how federal power could be brought to bear
on the urban problems created over the years by the
relationship between railways and cities, and by the presence of tracks, yards, and other rail facilities in urban
areas.
The legislation before us is the result of many months of
examination and assessment of suggestions from many
interested parties. It is a major federal initiative to help
achieve a better balance between the need for efficient rail
services and the adverse effects of railways on the quality
of the urban environment and urban development in
Canadian communities. As well, the measure will increase
public safety at level crossings by eliminating this hazard
in many places.
It is designed to apply particularly to cities where railway facilities-that is, tracks, yards and terminals-are
formidable obstacles to planned and orderly urban transportation and urban development, and to meet the demand
for new or improved grade separations where line crossings now exist or where new lines might be developed.
Honourable senators, the legislation being placed before
Parliament contains two complementary elements. The
first element, which is railway relocation and rerouting,
will permit the federal government, for the first time, to
fund and support in a major way the planning for, and
implementation of, railway relocation and rail traffic rerouting proposed by provinces and municipalities.

May 2, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

The provisions for railway relocation are intended to
enable the flow of traffic on lines in cities to be modified
or to permit lines to be relocated entirely, in accordance
with urban development and transportation plans prepared by the provinces and their municipalities.
Where a rail line is relocated, the property thus vacated
may be put to any number of uses, in accordance with the
priorities established by such plans. These priorities can
include the provision of improved and expanded rapid
transit facilities, land for housing, and recreational
facilities.
The second element involves the expansion of the railway grade crossing fund, which has helped improve rail
safety and security in urban and rural areas of Canada for
more than 60 years. Federal financial assistance provided
through the fund will be more than doubled and new
special assistance will be provided for large-scale projects
to meet increasing costs and new situations.
As I said earlier, the proposed legislation is divided into
four parts:
I. Joint Urban development and transportation
plans;
II. Special Grants for separations;
III. Railway grade crossing assistance;
IV. General.
Part I provides financial assistance for planning and
carrying out railway "relocation" projects, which may
take the form of projects calling for rerouting of railway
traffic over lines of other railways, limiting the use of
railway lines, for example, to passenger trains or the use
of railway lines for rapid transit, as well as actual physical
relocation of lines.
In such cases, the applicants-a province plus all the
municipalities in an urban area-must first have agreed
upon an urban development plan and a transportation
plan for the area. Federal assistance of up to 50 per cent of
the cost of the studies to produce these urban plans may
be provided by the Minister of Transport and the Minister
of State for Urban Affairs.
The applicants must also submit a financial plan showing, among other things, how the costs of the transportation plan are to be met. Other federal departments may
also meet part of the costs where their programs permit
such participation; that is, for acquisition of land for
buildings, housing projects, and so on. Provincial and
municipal authorities may also contribute, and I suspect
that DREE might come into this picture, too.
After the Canadian Transport Commission bas been
advised by the Minister of State for Urban Affairs that
federal programs contemplated for use in the plans are
available, and the Governor in Council has indicated he is
prepared to authorize the use of moneys for a relocation
grant, the commission may consider the application.
Now, I said earlier that this was a very costly business,
and I have some figures here to give some indication of
what the costs could be. The average annual expenditures
under all parts of the Railway Relocation and Crossing
Act are expected to be held by budgetary procedures to an
average of about $50 million per year in the next five

years, and the approximate distribution of expenditures is
expected to be as follows:
In the first year, the relocation under Part 1, and the
special grants under Part II, will be $10 million; in the
second year, $15 million; in the third year, $20 million, and
in the fourth and fifth years, $25 million.
In the railway grade crossing fund under Part III, it is
expected that the cost in the first year will be $25 million,
and $30 million in each succeeding year. In addition,
grants for studies amounting to $3 million per year will be
available from the Ministry of State for Urban Aff airs and
from the Ministry of Transport.
Another question which has come up, particularly in
Calgary, is that of air rights over railway tracks where it
is decided to cover them over. I have received information
from the Department of Justice that air rights over railway property are normally the property of the railway
company, subject to any reversionary rights which may be
stipulated in the various instruments of conveyance. Railways can build over their rights-of-way, or permit others
to do so. The value of air rights would be part of the
property value for which the railways would have to be
compensated under the Railway Relocation and Crossing
Act. All air rights are subject to provincial laws, municipal
bylaws, and limitation of structure heights near airports,
and so on.

On this matter of relocation, some senators may have
heard a broadcast last night by a representative of the
CBRT, the Canadian Brotherhood of Railway Transport
and General Workers. He was opposing the bill and said
that the contemplated removal of the stations from downtown areas would make things much more difficult for the
ordinary worker with a car, who would have to pay higher
parking fees in downtown areas after the station was
moved. I cannot see the logic of this, but that is what he
said. Secondly, a man without a car would have additional
difficulty and higher costs in getting to work. I suggest
that such statements are based on a misconception.

To me the GO train in Toronto is just one of the
adaptations of modern transportation technology in
moving large numbers of people efficiently and at low
cost. Nobody is going to move the Union Station in
Toronto, although there was talk about it some time ago. I
think that Senator Deschatelets mentioned this matter in
the chamber on one occasion when he decried the removal
of the Union Station in Ottawa from the very convenient
downtown location to where it is now, out in the sticks
beyond Alta Vista.
Hon. Mr. Deschatelets: Unfortunately, I am one of those
responsible for that.
Hon. Mr. Cameron: I thought I heard you say that you
regretted that move.
Hon. Mr. Deschatelets: I do.
Hon. Mr. Martin: What does Senator Deschatelets
regret? I never knew him to regret anything.
Hon. Mr. Cameron: The removal of the Union Station
away out into the sticks beyond Alta Vista.
In any event, we saw in last night's papers the plans for
the urban development of the east side of the Rideau

SENATE DEBATES
Canal-a natural and logical development for the city of
Ottawa, and one that I am glad to see. I do not expect the
railway tracks to be brought back to the Union Station,
although I would not rule it out altogether. If this plan is
carried out, then it is possible that within 25 years something like that might be done. Hotels, shopping centres
and apartment blocks could be built on both sides of the
canal in the near downtown area with the railroad underneath. The noise of the trains would be deadened, and
parking facilites could be provided to serve that area. To
me this makes a lot of sense.
Hon. Mr. Deschatelets: This is the case in Montreal.
Hon. Mr. Cameron: Yes, Montreal is a good example,
and in New York the Commodore Hotel is located on 42nd
Street right above Grand Central Station. There is nothing new or radical in this approach, and it becomes more
sensible all the time. It would benefit the high-density
core and near-downtown area of Ottawa. I can think of no
nicer place to plant a stand of trees than along the canal.
They would add to the beauty of the place as well as
serving to deaden the sound in the area beyond the core,
and would enhance it generally. It is a costly business, but
it is a step in the right direction.
It is a necessary condition that any railway involved
will neither gain nor lose as a result of carrying out the
plans. The commission, possibly after an optional public
hearing, may make orders requiring any railway involved
(a) to cease to operate over any railway lines in the urban
area; (b) to permit the trains of another railway to be
operated over its lines in the urban area; (c) to restrict
traffic over a railway line in the urban area to certain
classes of traffic; and (d) to build a railway line in a
specific location.
To me this makes a lot of sense. Why should we have a
CNR station at one end of town and a CPR station in
another, with railway tracks between? It is more sensible
to have the two railways operating over one set of tracks
into the corc of the city. As new technology is applied to
transportation we will find that the light fast trains will
not cost the billions of dollars now being spent on Ste.
Scholastique and Pickering airports. If we were to spend
some of that money on light rapid transit trains we would
be getting better value for our money as far as short-haul
traffic is concerned-that is, on runs up to 300 miles.
If a railway is required to cease to operate over a line,
the commission may recommend that the Minister of
Public Works acquire the land which the line occupies by
purchase or expropriation, and the Minister of Public
Works may subsequently dispose of the land in a manner
consistent with the accepted urban development and
transportation plans. In other words, it all goes back to the
local authority so that the autonomy of the people is
protected.
When orders have been made by the commission as
described above, the commission may recommend payment of a relocation grant not exceeding 50 per cent of the
net cost of railway relocation. The net cost is to be determined by the Canadian Transport Commission according
to a schedule which will take into account such factors as
changes in value of railway land and the adjusted costs of
new railway facilities-that is, the cost of new railway
facilities plus or minus any change in railway operating
{Hon. Mr. Cameron.]

May 2, 1974

and maintenance costs. Just think of the land that the
CPR acquired in Winnipeg, Calgary and Vancouver, and
compare its value in 1880 or 1890 with its value today.
Land is a tremendous asset, and one that the railways
would undoubtedly want to be well compensated for in the
event of any of it being expropriated.
When the commission recommends that the federal government acquire railway land for urban redevelopment
and transportation, that acquisition may be made by the
Department of Public Works, either by purchase or by
expropriation.
The provisions in respect of increased assistance for the
protection of railway grade crossings cover both grade
crossings and separations and follow many representations by interested groups as to the expansion and modernization of the Railway Grade Crossing Fund. Such
expansion is intended to bring grant provisions into line
with the increased costs being experienced in the construction and modernization of overpasses and subways
designed to eliminate hazardous crossings and severe traffic bottlenecks. This bill, in Part III, provides for
increased federal assistance through the Railway Grade
Crossing Fund--which continues to exist-and, in Part II,
for special grants for separations.
Part III of the act would replace section 202 of the
Railway Act which established the Railway Grade Crossing Fund, a special account established in 1909 to help
finance work done for the protection, safety and convenience of the public at railway crossings. Part III provides
for continuation of the fund with new ceilings on
assistance.
I can summarize the proposed new federal assistance by
saying that in respect of level crossing protection work 80
per cent of the costs may be paid from the Railway Grade
Crossing Fund, up to a limit of $1 million, the existing
limit being $500,000. For reconstruction of, or improvement to, existing grade separations 50 per cent of the cost
may be paid from the Railway Grade Crossing Fund up to
a ceiling of $625,000, the existing limit being $250,000.
Part Il, "Special Grants for Separations," introduces the
new provisions I have mentioned for federal grants to
meet part of the costs of grade separation projects at
railway crossings when construction or reconstruction
costs appear likely to exceed $1,250,000, or where a new
crossing is required by a highway traffic rerouting
scheme. The commission may conduct an inquiry into the
proposed project and recommend to the Ministry of Transport that a special grant be provided. It may also recommend special terms and conditions for the grant, and may
specify the share of costs to be borne by the railway
concerned and the applicant province or municipality.
In respect of the very expensive grade separations there
is an escalated scale of grants. For example, there may be a
grant of over $2 million for the construction of a new
separation costing $3 million, and a grant of about $1.3
million for the reconstruction of a grade separation costing $3 million. New grade separations required by highway traffic rerouting schemes will qualify for special
grants equal to 50 per cent of the construction costs.

May 2, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

(1450)

This bill maintains the existing provisions of the Railway Act, in that a railway crossing must have been in
existence for at least three years before an application can
be made for a grant from the Railway Grade Crossing
Fund towards the construction of a grade separation. This
provision prevents unnecessary new rail crossings. However, there are two exceptions to that "three-year rule."first, when the new grade separation is required by a
railway relocation-rerouting project; and, secondly, when
it is required by a new highway traffic rerouting scheme.
Grants provided for the reconstruction of, or improvement
to, an existing grade separation will be made available
where the grade separation has existed for at least 15
years. Formerly, such grants were limited to grade separations that existed prior to June 29, 1955.
Honourable senators, the Railway Relocation and Crossing Bill deserves the support of all members of the Senate.
It is being eagerly awaited by many Canadian cities and
towns. In this respect I called the mayors of some of our
urban centres, who said "Get it through as fast as possible." I assured them that all parties were in agreement
with that principle.
The bill is the result of much careful work extending
over many months. It makes possible the reshaping of the
transportation networks and urban development in many
of our communities. It greatly extends federal government
assistance in improving the way of life in many Canadian
cities and towns.
I respectfully commend this bill to your favourable and
sympathetic consideration.
Hon. Mr. Fournier (Madawaska-Restigouche): Honourable senators, I do not rise to speak, as I do not wish to
delay the referral of this bill to a committee. However, I
would like to reserve the right to say a few words on third
reading.
Hon. Sidney L. Buckwold: Honourable senators, I feel
that I should pass on the experience I had during my term
of office as mayor of a medium-sized city, during which
time a railroad relocation took place. The city is Saskatoon, a metropolis in northern Saskatchewan. I believe
my experience is worth recounting, if only to re-emphasize
the importance of this bill and to give further support to
the excellent presentation made by Senator Cameron in
introducing it.
Saskatoon, like most cities-and especially Western cities-grew up around the railway track. The railway came
through a small settlement. In 1901 Saskatoon had a population of 113, and at the present time it is about 135,000,
and that increase was caused by the strip of steel which
connected that little settlement with so-called civilization.
Cheap buildings sprang up around the railroad tracks,
and before long the area deteriorated. As the municipality
grew, business moved to the prime locations away from
the tracks. The city grew and spread, and the dividing
line, as Senator Cameron has pointed out, became the
railroad tracks. Some people lived on the right side of the
tracks, and others lived on the wrong side.
In Saskatoon, we found it was going to be a very expensive matter to get motor traffic across the fairly extensive
area owned by the Canadian National Railways. Over-

passes would have cost some millions of dollars. The
whole problem of moving traffic in an orderly manner was
something which had to be considered by the city, and
those who were involved in its planning. We took the bull
by the horns and said we would like to get the railroad out
of the downtown area. We met with the railway company
and negotiated for some time. As a community we
received absolutely no help from any senior government.
Naturally, I would like the provision of this bill made
retroactive, because it would save the city some millions
of dollars.
However, it became obvious after the period of negotiation that if the land owned by the railroads, with its low
assessment, could be developed into prime commercial
property it would be a pretty good business deal from the
point of view of the city itself. This was true, in spite of
the fact that tne capital costs were borne by the city,
because the higher assessed value of the redeveloped railway land became a very important source of revenue. The
city receives some hundreds of thousands of dollars a year
in extra revenue, so that the investment pays off.
The advantages have been unbelievable in so far as the
city of Saskatoon is concerned. The first advantage is that
the division between the west and east sides of the city
has been eliminated. It has saved some millions of dollars
in traffic facilitation, and has allowed a complete downtown urban redevelopment program to be undertaken at
no cost to the municipality other than the money paid to
the railway to move.
By the way, the railway still owns the land. We agreed
to pay them the cost of moving, which involved abandoning a bridge and moving their yards and station. They
retained control of the land, the air rights and all the other
matters that were under their jurisdiction. They then put
the development of the property up for tender, and several were received. In due course, they accepted a beautiful
development known as Midtown Plaza, right in the heart
of downtown Saskatoon. This has provided, in my opinion,
a second start for the city, a second chance to develop the
heart of the downtown area.
The initial fears of some of the commercial establishments in the immediate vicinity proved to be unfounded,
because the strengthening of the downtown area more
than compensated for the additional competition created
by new shops, buildings, office space and the kind of thing
that often disturbs people who cannot see the future and
the reaction that will take place when revolutionary development of this type is undertaken. As a matter of fact,
one of the Massey awards for Urban Excellence, which is
sponsored by the Massey Foundation and the Canada
Council, was given to Saskatoon for this midtown development and railroad relocation.
We have seen a tremendous change in Saskatoon. Any
honourable senator who has seen the beautiful development that has taken place in connection with the relocation of the railroad will understand my enthusiasm in
supporting this bill. I can visualize what it will mean to
almost every city in Canada. I think this measure is one of
the most important forward steps, and one of the most
encouraging pieces of legislation involving urban development, that has been presented by the Government of
Canada for a long time.

SENATE DEBATES
a (1500)

I agree that the movement of a station f rom the downtown area creates a problem. That problem has been magnified recently by the energy crisis, which may cause a
return to mass transit, and emphasized the importance of
railways in the movement of people into and out of urban
areas.
In Saskatoon the railway company was not really concerned about the relocation of the depot. Frankly, I believe
they had written off the movement of passengers by rail.
I asked the railway officials, "Are you not worried about
losing passenger traffic by moving the railroad depot four
or five miles from downtown Saskatoon?" Their answer
was that the airlines seemed to do all right by locating
their passenger terminals some distance away, and they
could see no reason why such a move would not be equally
acceptable to people travelling by train. Personally, I do
not accept that argument. I do not think it is right. I
believe we are now seeing a return to importance of the
railway passenger service.
One solution would be to move the railroad depots out of
the city centres, and provide rapid downtown connections.
There should be federal government assistance to the
municipalities for the movement of the public to and from
the downtown areas. That is an integral part of any relocation. We see it here in Ottawa. There was nothing wrong
in relocating the railroad station. It made good sense. I am
sure the people of Ottawa are delighted at having the
trains moved from downtown. It is a little inconvenient,
but that can be corrected by providing an improved service. That could involve substantial cost, but assistance
might be provided through this bill.
Saskatoon was the first city in Canada to make this very
important move which, although costly, bas been, in my
opinion, most beneficial.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Before Windsor?
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: Windsor has a long way to go yet.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Windsor made some changes, too.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: If you recall, Windsor had some
problems with regard to the riverfront.
Hon. Mr. Martin: But they are not as bad they were.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: I would guess that Windsor has a
long way to go in improving. I say that kindly, because it
is a wonderful city, and it returned Senator Martin to
Parliament for many years.
Hon. Mr. Laing: There is smoke.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: Yes, smoke, distillery fumes, and
all that kind of thing.
Hon. Mr. Martin: There is no reason why a constructive
question should bring insults.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: I was merely indicating that Windsor is a city very much on the incline, which is developing
into a great Canadian metropolis through good planning
and good leadership.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: I hope that satisfies the Leader of
the Government.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this report be taken into consideration?
Hon. Mr. Argue: With leave, now.
Honourable senators, I am not an authority on procedure, but we would like to have the bill considered on
third reading tomorrow. In my view, the amendments
should be explained on third reading. They are in the main
technical amendments that were recommended to the
committee by officials of the Department of Agriculture,
and the committee itself made some suggestions that

appealed to the departmental officials. These amendments
have the unanimous support of the members of the committee and the officials who were present.
Hon. Mr. Martin: That explanation is helpful. I did not
know that the amendments were f ully concurred in by the
Department of Agriculture. If Senator Langlois' pessimism prevails next week- I am not saying that I share
it-we do not know what might happen to the bill. However, if the amendments are concurred in by the minister,
the situation is altogether different. I take it, from what
Senator Argue bas said, that that is the situation.
Hon. Mr. Argue: That is correct. I would point out that
this bill originates in the Senate. Therefore, the amendments are, in a sense, the Senate's own amendments. We
are sending to the House of Commons a bill that is more
refined and, we hope, more acceptable than the bill that
was referred to the committee.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Is it necessary to have third reading
tomorrow? Could we not deal with the bill now, and send
it to the House of Commons?
Hon. Mr. Argue: Senator McGrand is the sponsor of the
bill in this house. I would have thought it a more orderly
procedure to have third reading tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Martin: It might be more orderly, but it could
result in no bill.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: The Leader of the Government is
now sharing my pessimism.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this report be taken into consideration?
Senator Argue moved that the report be taken into
consideration at the next sitting.
Motion agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.

OFFICIAL REPORT (HANSARD)
SENATORS' STYLE OF ADDRESS-SPEAKER'S DECISION
RESERVED
The Hon. the Speaker: On January 11, 1974, the Honourable Senator Godfrey put a question to the Leader of
the Government. It is reported at page 1445 of the Debates
oflthe Senaie as follows:
Honourable senators, 1 have a question to address t0
the Leader of the Government.
For years I have been puzzled as to why in Sonate
Hansard members of thîs house who spcak arc desîgnated as "Honourable Mr." I presumne, because of this,
that they had appropriated 10 themselves the tille of
"Senator" to which they were not lechnically entitled.
However, in the proceedings of standing committees I
note that the members of this house who speak are
designated as "Senator." Furthermore, in the Mioutes
of the Proceedîngs of the Sonate, a member of the
Sonate is designated as "the Honourable Senator." My
question îs: Why has this house not effected uniformity in the printed reports of the Sonate and dîscontinued a form in Sonate Hunsard which appears t0 ho
archaic?
In his reply the Honourable Senator Martin stated that
thîs malter had been raised a number of limes by the
Editor of Debates and had been brought to the attention of
previous Speakers, and he concluded by saying:
I would hope, Madam Speaker, that you would ho good
enough to carry on where Senator Deschatelets left off
and deal with this question.
Honourable senators, because the malter has been raised
many limes, it has slîrred up a greal deal of inlerest. and
many senators have given me the benefit of their thinking
on the question. 1 have 10 say that the views expressed
show divergent opinions and are ail based on arguments
which are difficuit to accept or rojoct without very serious
consideration. Because of thîs, I should lîke a lîttie more
time before reaching a decîsion. I shall endeavour 10 do 50
very shortly, within a few days.

RAILWAY RELOCATION AND CROSSING BILL
REPORT 0F COMMITTE
Hon. Maurice Bourget, Deputy Chairman of the Standing Sonate Committee on Transport and Communications,
reporlod that the commîttee had considered Bill C-27, 10
facilîtate the relocation of railway linos or rerouting of
railway traffic in urban areas and to provide financial
assistance for work donc for the protection, safetyj and
convonience of the public at -ailway crossîngs, and had
directed that the bill be reporîed wîthout amendment.
THIRD READING
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shahl
thîs bill ho read a third time?
Hon. Mr. Bourget: Honourable senators, wîth leave of
the Sonate and notwithstandîng rule 45(l)(b), I movo,
seconded by Senator Fournier (de Lanaudièro), that the
bill be now road a thîrd time.
Hon. Edgar Fournier: Honourable senators, yesterday I
said thal I would like to say a few words on the motion for
third readîng of this bill My remarks will bo brief.
because 1 had the opportunity this mornîng of atlendîng
the Standing Sonate Commîltee on Transport and Communications, which was the proper place for dîrecting my
questions.
I hope honourable senators will read the report of the
committee's proceedings, for 1 am sure they will fînd il
interesting. A number of questions were answered about
varîous problems relatîng 10 the railways.
I wanî 10 thank the sponsor, Senator Cameron, for the
mannor in which ho prosented thîs bill to the Senate
yesterday. Ho did a wonderful job, although bis speech
was rather longthy and at times I was înclined 10 regard il
as somewhat of a "national dream" in that we wîll ho
spending millions and millions of dollars rolocatîng railways, and everythîng that goos hand in hand wiîh soch
proj octs.
In reading Hansard of the other place il became obvious
that those who spoke on this bill were full of national
dreams involving enormous expansion programs and othor
ways of wasting the taxpayors' money. I did not come
across one member who had anything to say about farmn
crossîngs. We wore told in committoe Ihis morning that
thero are some 36,000 crossings throughout Canada, most

May 3, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

of which are farm crossings. In most areas these farm
crossings present certain problems.
The crossings are not classified as farm crossings, private crossings, level crossings, overpasses, underpasses, or
whatever; they are simply classified as "railway crossings". There are, however, these various types, some of
which are protected and some unprotected.
In my area most of the farms are small, but they have
been divided on several occasions by these crossings. They
were cut or divided by two railways, the first division
coming in the late 1890s when the CPR was built. The CPR
more or less zigzagged across the valleys, taking land
where building costs would be kept to a minimum.
Between 1908 to 1910 they built the Grand Trunk Railway,
which later became the Canadian National Railway. In
many areas the two railways run parallel within a couple
of hundred feet of each other.
In many farming communities the barn is on one side of
the railway tracks and the farmhouse on the other side.
These farm crossings are essential for farms, and other
crossing are badly needed. Until 1960 there were not too
many problems resulting from these farm crossings,
because the old-time section men knew all the farmers and
they maintained these crossings in a way that kept difficulties to a minimum. However, since 1960 the whole
system has changed. Most of the old-time section men
have been replaced by the younger generation. To get a
farm crossing now, one has to apply to the railway company concerned, and very often the company decides that
a farm crossing is not called for. The house is on one side
and the barn is on the other, but there is nothing you can
do about it. If you call the highway department they will
say it has nothing to do with them, that it is labelled as a
farm crossing and they cannot take their snowplough over
the crossing. It is a farm crossing and the planks are only
10 feet, so they cannot go there because in order to use the
heavy equipment the planks have to be 16 feet. There are
all sorts of problems. The foreman of the section will tell
you he has no authority, that there is nothing they can do.
That is just a brief example.
*

(1410)

I hope some of these problems will be thrashed out. This
bill does give an opportunity at least to complain and be
listened to. I believe the whole problem arose when farms
were divided and subdivided several times. The moment a
farm became too small to operate the farmer would move
away. Then the railway would quickly block the roadways
and put gates in and there were no more railway crossings.
In subsequent years the land would be sold, a family
would be re-established there, but the barn would be on
one side of the track and the house on the other. Then the
authorities would say there could not be a railway crossing there.
We had an interesting discussion in committee. Senator
Riley commented on the number of railway accidents,
especially in New Brunswick. The Ministry of Transport
representative gave us an explanation, but several of us
could not accept it. The explanation was very simple.
Thirty years ago there were three men to a section, which
would extend between six and eight miles. The men would
travel on what they called a hand-pumper, which had tow
levers operated by two men. They would travel along the

section, inspect the roadbed and by using a lot of shims
keep the roadbed level. In the early fifties the hand-pumpers had disappeared. They were replaced by motor car
speeders. Then the sections were extended to between ten
and twelve miles, but the section men were still there on
the job inspecting the track. In the early sixties the whole
system was changed. Then the section was extended to
between 35 and 45 miles, with two or three men driving on
the highway in cars going from crossing to crossing, with
the result that there was no inspection. True enough, there
is what they call a trainmaster travelling possibly 100 to
150 miles on a motor car at high speed, who is supposed to
find out if there are trouble spots. That has resulted in the
roadbed going to pieces. Anyone walking on the railway
roadbed can see the heaves. The answer we received this
morning was that in order to overcome these heaves they
reduce speed instead of using the old shims. That was not
a very good answer.
Honourable senators, that concludes the few remarks I
wanted to make, and I thank you for your patience.
Hon. Arthur Laing: Honourable senators, I should like
to add a few words to this debate for a variety of reasons.
One is that I come from the city of Vancouver, which by
all odds is the largest port in Canada today. But it would
not be of any consequence at all had the railway not been
built. It was the railway which created the port, and I
think we should in a discussion of a bill relating to
transportation give some considerable attention to that
fact.
First of all, however, I want to make reference to the
laudatory speech yesterday of Senator Buckwold, whom I
accuse personally today of being entirely too modest in
respect of the rerouting of the rail track in his beautiful
city of Saskatoon. I can fully understand why he would
like to see this legislation retroactive, because the initiative of himself as mayor of that city at that time, and of
his council, had the effect of inducing the railways to go
ahead with that rerouting. I would say that modesty is
Senator Buckwold's greatest asset, because the Senator
Buckwold of today happens to have a record of civic
leadership in this nation unexcelled by anyone.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear!
Hon. Mr. Laing: At the time of his leadership in Saskatoon, Senator Buckwold not only managed the problem
of the railway relocation but was largely responsible for
the establishment of the Mendel Art Gallery. Saskatoon
also has the best museum of farm implements on this
continent. These are attributes of a city which contribute
enormously to its character, and I think that much of the
effect of these in Saskatoon today is as a result of Senator
Buckwold's superb leadership at that time.
But on the question of relocating railway lines, the fact
that Saskatoon was able to relocate its rails with relative
ease does not mean that every city in Canada would be
able to do the same, and it certainly would not apply to
Vancouver.
I was in business in Vancouver for 27 years, and I lived
on the wrong side of the tracks as far as doing business
was concerned. At that time the railways had the right to
spot their cars at 9 o'clock in the morning and at 5 o'clock
in the afternoon, which meant that they had the right to

SENATE DEBATES

close off the street ends for five minutes so that their cars
could be spotted. The chaps running the trains never
seemed to use stop watches, because generally the traffic
would be held up for at least 25 minutes. In those days we
couldn't afford overpasses, but, even so, we were happy to
defer to the railways, because at that time we knew that
our jobs depended on the railways. That was more apparent in those days than it is today, but I believe if we
looked carefully at transportation in Canada today we
would realize that, just as much today as in those days, the
railways do ensure the jobs of most Canadians.
In the meantime, the railways have lost out to trucks,
which have taken over the handling of the higher-rated
freight. The airplane, of course, has taken from the railways the highest rate of all and has had the effect of
pushing the railways back to the handling of wheat, coal,
cement, sand and gravel, none of which carries a very high
rate.
Vancouver harbour is served by a railway which runs
alongside the water. If anything were to happen, you
would drop right into the water. The railway was originally intended to go to Port Moody only, at the head of the
inlet, but it was discovered later that it was possible to
take it the additional 16 miles into Burrard Inlet proper. If
you look out the train windows on the side away from the
saltchuck you see a 70- or 80-foot bank of clay. That
railroad cannot be rerouted because the investment in
Vancouver harbour today is over a billion dollars. The
elevators there handled over 9 million tons of grain last
year, and any concept of moving them, as we have heard,
from Vancouver to Roberts Bank-and Senator McIlraith
will remember Roberts Bank-is out of the question. Roberts Bank is a bulk loading area for coal, and for sulphur
and potash in the future. We are just about to add 150
acres at Roberts Bank by pumping out additional land,
and you cannot put goods of the type we are talking about
next to a bulk loading area because it is an area of dust.
Lumber operators were going to handle lumber there but
they quickly changed their minds, because when they
have sold lumber they don't want a claim back. And if we
send our wheat and other goods through there, we don't
want a claim back because of dust. We are precluded,
therefore, from going out to that particular harbour, and
we have to do the best we can at Burrard Inlet.

e

(1420)

This bill will relate only to that area of Vancouver from
Burrard Street west to Stanley Park. As we all know, this
is a naval reserve and probably the best known park in
Canada. It has been granted to the city on a 99-year lease.
That is the area we are talking about in Vancouver, and it
is going to be very difficult to get the kind of assembly
areas there that are envisioned in this bill.
I have talked to Senator McNamara, who knows a very
great deal about the grain business. I am not certain that
the kind of relief we want is going to be achieved at ports
such as Vancouver by the rerouting of rail yards alone.
There have been times when as much as 340,000 tons of
coal have been sitting at Roberts Bank, but when I was
there last week there was less than 50,000 tons because
ships had come in and taken it away. But the coal is being
continually replenished. We have got to look forward to
[Hon. Mr. Laing.]

May 3, 1974

storing at salt water ports the products of Canada, including grain, that move in this manner.
Why do we insist upon keeping grain on the Prairies
instead of getting it to salt water ports as rapidly as
possible and having it stored there? There is no point in
continuing to grow grain on the Prairies unless we are
certain that we have an export market. That is what we
are dependent upon. If we are confident of our ability to
command that export market in the future, then we should
handle our grain in such a way that it can be loaded on
ships as soon as they arrive. If world population experts
are correct, assurance of export markets was never so
firm. We have had as many as 20 ships lying in Vancouver
harbour, some up to 14 days, waiting to dock or waiting for
the arrival of their cargo of grain.
I am not speaking in Vancouver's favour when I say
this, but in my view the grain should be cleaned on the
Prairies, and the screenings should be used there as livestock feed. We want the screenings in Vancouver too
because they make pretty good feed for dairy cattle in the
Fraser Valley. As a matter of fact, after a little molasses
has been added they can be shipped to Japan and sold for
$60 or $80 a ton.
The present system is uneconomic. There should be
straight grades of clean grain lying in bulk at the salt
water ports, ready for delivery to ships. I think this is
more important than moving railroad tracks. I am told
that this is what is done in Australia. Expensive elevators
are not used there. The grain is graded and stored in flat
bins of steel and concrete, and when a ship comes into port
it loads the grade it wants, and away it goes. All that is
needed is a conveyor belt under the bin. It is my hope that
some study along these lines will be made in the future.
I wanted to speak on this bill, honourable senators,
because its joint sponsor in the other place was the Minister of State for Urban Affairs, who is also the member for
Vancouver-Centre. He has been interested in this matter
for a very long time. A considerable amount of work has
been done on it. I would have hoped that the railway
companies would not have required the initiative of the
national government to push them into this sort of thing. I
say this because I have looked at railway properties in
various cities, and I know that they are extremely
valuable.
From the offices of the CNR in Edmonton one can look
down on an expanse of land-160 to 170 acres of railway
tracks-right in the centre of the city. It is some of the
most valuable property in Edmonton. So, I would have
expected the initiative to be taken by the railway companies because the development of property such as that in
Edmonton will result in tremendous income to them.
However, to the extent that the civic governments
require this legislation, and if it is the case that the
railways will not be pushed into this without the initiative
of the federal government, then this is a very good bill
indeed, but care must be taken to ensure that huge sums of
the taxpayers' money are not spent to assist organizations
like the railway companies to make all of the profits that
will result. Here we have to be very careful indeed. I think
they should contribute as much as possible because, after
all, they are going to get the returns on the developed

May 3, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

properties, and, as I have said, some of them are exceedingly valuable.
There was a proposal that in Vancouver-Senator McIlraith is familiar with this because it was made when he
was Minister of Public Works-we should rent air rights
over railway tracks for federal government buildings.
Senator McIlraith stopped this in time. We owned the
corner of Granville and Hastings, which was worth $40 or
$50 a square foot, and they wanted the same price for air
rights over the tracks. It was really a case of one elephant
for one rabbit.

Hon. Mr. Laing: Yes, he was going to make as good a

is that the land where the tracks are is of great value in
many places, and the railways will be the recipients of
tremendous benefits. We should be careful not to give
them more money than is required to do the job, or to get
it under way. In other words, this should be done at the
initiative of the government, and there should not be a
wholesale expenditure of funds to increase the profit of
individuals and corporations.
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.

The Senate proceeded to consideration of the report of

FISHERIES
EXTENSION OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN CANADA AND THE
UNITED STATES-QUESTION ANSWERED
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, yesterday
Senator Grosart asked me a question regarding an extension of the reciprocal fishing privileges agreement
between Canada and the United States. Specifically, he
wanted to know whether there had been an extension of
this agreement and, if so, what was the terminal date.
In answer I reply as follows: The agreement has been
extended to May 8 to allow the United States to resolve
some of its legal difficulties arising from the March 19
court decision in favour of Alaska on the location of the
baseline in Cook Inlet.
The government is fully aware of the implications for
Canada-United States fisheries relations, and for the Law
of the Sea, if Canadian fishermen are excluded from the
area in question in Cook Inlet, without some satisfactory
quid pro quo, and, if the agreement lapses, if Canadian
fishermen are excluded as well from other United States
fishing zones and no effective Canadian response takes
place. The subject is being given serious study on an
emergency basis. The government will ensure that
Canadian interests are protected.

NATIONAL PARKS ACT
BILL TO AMEND-THIRD READING
Hon. Arthur Laing moved third reading of Bill C-6, to
amend the National Parks Act.
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.

27601-25

Hon. Hazen Argue, Chairman of the Standing Senate
Committee on Agriculture, moved that the report be
adopted.
He said: Honourable senators, this report contains some
amendments, and perhaps I can explain them in two or
three sentences.
One amendment is to add another disease to the list of
reportable diseases, namely, African swine fever. The
second amendment introduces a somewhat different definition of "veterinary biologics" in order to cover hormones, or substances that contain hormones, so that they
may be brought under this act. A further amendment
would give authority under the act to place tags and other
identification on animals being inspected. Apparently the
department has been using tags and other means of identification, perhaps without authority. This amendment
would give them precise authority.
The report includes a further definition to widen the
scope of the act, if not to widen the scope of the practice,
and so make it possible for officers acting under this
legislation to control the shipment of animals which,
although not diseased, may suffer from infirmity, injury,
fatigue and so forth. Finally, the committee felt that the
word "livestock" wherever it appears in the act, should be
changed to "animals." This will make it absolutely clear
that this act can apply to small animals, or pets, as well as
to livestock as we ordinarily understand that word.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: Will the honourable senator permit
a question? The report says "can apply." Should it not be
"must apply?"
Hon. Mr. Argue: It is "shall" and "may." I have been
through that over the years. I am not a lawyer, but certainly the department has the authority to cover all animals and, presumably, the officials will carry out the
terms of the act. Therefore, it "shall apply," but perhaps
"can" is the right word.
Hon. Mr. Martin: We must not have a quarrel between
two Saskatchewan senators.
Hon. Mr. Argue: And both learned in the law.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Agreed.
Motion agreed to and report adopted.

THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall
this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. McGrand: Honourable senators, with leave of

the bill be read the third time now.
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.
TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS
REQUEST OF STATE COUNCIL FOR CLOSER ASSOCIATION
WITH CANADA

Hon. Hazen Argue: Honourable senators, I should like
to say a few words about the inquiry standing in my name.
There is a good deal of interest in this matter. There are

May 3,1974

those who regard it favourably, and those who do not. A
Commonwealth Parliamentary Association delegation of
five, headed by Mr. Heath Macquarrie, M.P., visited the
Turks and Caicos Islands some months ago. I have
arranged for Mr. Macquarrie and other members of that
delegation to be invited to a dinner meeting next Tuesday
evening at 6 o'clock in room 601. I am hopeful that all f ive
members will be present.
I am extending a general invitation to all honourable
senators, but if more senators plan to attend than can be
accommodated in room 601, the number will have to be
limited.
The Senate adjourned until Monday, May 6, at 2 p.m.

BUDGET SPEECH
ACCOMMODATION FOR SENATORS IN SENATE GALLERY OF
HOUSE OF COMMONS

The Hon. the Speaker pro tem: Honourable senators, as
previously announced, the Minister of Finance will deliver
his budget speech in the other place at 8 o'clock this
evening.
May I be permitted to remind honourable senators that
none but senators will be admitted to the Senate Gallery
of the House of Commons on that occasion. This step is
being taken for the purpose of providing accommodation
in the gallery for as many senators as possible. In this
manner, senators will not be excluded from the gallery on
account of many of the places being occupied by relatives
and friends of senators.
May I add that such instructions were first issued in
1931 by the then Speaker of the Senate, the Honourable P.
E. Blondin, and that this practice has been followed ever
since by succeeding Speakers.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Flynn: May I ask the Leader of the Government why, in view of the program we have before us and
the great accomplishments made on Friday last, the
Senate was convened for today?
Hon. Mr. Martin: That is the usual type of question the
Leader of the Opposition puts to me at this juncture in a
session. If he will read Hansard of the other place for
Friday last, he will see the reason why we have not even
received the pensions legislation. That legislation was
held up because of the actions, I take it, of only one
member of a particular party-much to the annoyance of
the majority of the members of that party. However, I
know that the purpose of Senator Flynn's question at this
time was more tactical than it was information seeking,
and I will have to treat it as such.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I just wanted to see whether the
Leader of the Government is still suffering from
over-anxiety.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Oh, I am always cautious.
NATIONAL FINANCE
INFORMATION CANADA-CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF
COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONTINUED

On the Order:
27601-251

Resuming the debate on the consideration of the
Report of the Standing Senate Committee on National
Finance on Information Canada, tabled in the Senate
on Tuesday, 30th April, 1974.-(Honourable Senator
Langlois).
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, I am pleased to
yield at this time to Senator O'Leary.
The Hon. the Speaker pro tem: Has the Honourable
Senator O'Leary leave to proceed at this time?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. M. Grattan O'Leary: Honourable senators, f irst let
me thank Senator Langlois for his courtesy. I spoke to him
last week about my desire to say a few words on this
matter.
Hon. Mr. Croll: You made a speech last night.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: This is a subject about which I am
supposed to be an authority. Before I disabuse you of that
quaint idea, I should like to begin by congratulating Senator Everett. Senator Everett has added enormously to the
power of debate in this chamber. But there was one fault I
had to find with his speech the other day. Some historian
once said that the difference between the great orator
John Bright and Mr. Gladstone was that while Bright
sailed from headland to headland Gladstone explored
every inlet. The trouble with the speech the other day, the
splendid speech of Senator Everett, was that he failed to
explore every inlet.
*

(1410)

To my way of thinking there is one fundamental fault
with Information Canada. What Information Canada
really needs-what I would do with it myself had I the
power to do so, and what Mr. Stanfield should do with itis to get rid of the whole shebang, pass an act of Parliament or even an order in council defining the duties, the
obligations and the limitations of Information Canada,
and start all over again. Get rid of the whole shebang and
start anew with new people.
I remember when Information Canada was set up and a
long-time friend of mine, Mr. Jean-Louis Gagnon, was put
at the head of it. I have great admiration for Mr. Gagnon. I
remember when he was editor of Le Soleil and he had the
courage, in Quebec at that time, to oppose General Franco.
Later he came with me, with a party of Canadian journalists, who were invited by the British Council, to look at
Britain's war effort. This was not a very easy task. O'Connell once said of the Englishman that he had all the
qualities of the poker except its occasional warmth. They
did warm to Jean-Louis Gagnon and he became a hero, but
he was not the right man to put at the head of Information
Canada. Mr. Gagnon had too much of gay cynicism in him
to put him in a position of that kind. Besides that, I am
sure he f elt that public money grew on trees.

SENATE DEBATES

What Information Canada needs really is an act of
Parliament defining clearly its duties, its obligations and
its limitations. As we set it up, it was all sail and no
anchor, all chart and no compass. There was no clear
definition of what it was supposed to do. And what has it
been doing? It has been giving us a surfeit of information,
the sort of thing which the distinguished Governor General spoke about when he spoke to the Canadian press in
Toronto lask week. He said, "We are being choked with
paper, we have a surf eit of what is called information."
I am a reader, I even read the Bible, its poetry is among
my favourites, but I cannot and could not ever f ind time to
read all the matter that comes over my desk from Information Canada. Every two or three weeks I make an attempt
to find my desk-by throwing out all the matter that
comes from Information Canada. I do it with a sense of
guilt for the poor dear charwoman who has to clean up my
room the next morning.
This is nonsense. Information Canada was supposed to
coordinate and to control the matter put out by the
various departments. It has not been doing that. We are
getting more matter, more so-called information from the
various departments than ever before since I have been in
this chamber. The trouble is that the people who are called
information off icers for those various departments are not
information officers at all. Too often they are merely
publicity agents for their ministers, supposing their jobs
to be to show the Canadian public that this minister or
that is a superman-and, my God, could there be a greater
misinformation than that?
What is the proper need, if we are going to keep il? If
there is an election-I do not think there is going to be
one, but if there is one and the result is what I think il is
going to be-

Hon. Mr. Martin: What do you think the result is going
to be?
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: I said all that on Saturday. If the
result is what I think it is going to be, I am afraid that Mr.
Stanfield, being a responsible man, will have to get rid of
Information Canada and start all over again.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: What Information Canada needs, or
rather what such a department needs is, one, a responsible,
knowledgeable, intelligent head; it wants what we in the
press call a responsible managing editor; and, two, it
wants a financial comptroller. We are spending too much
money on this sort of thing. In the meantime, there should
be set up in both chambers of Parliament a committee on
information. If information is as vital as we say it is-and
I think it is pretty vital in what is called participatory
democracy-then surely each house should have a committee on information before which we could bring these
young men and women to ask them why they are sending
out this so-called information.
The other day my deskmate said, and quite truly, that
you will read a speech in Hansard,you have il, and then
three weeks later you get it all over again in a very
expensive format. Surely it is nonsense for that to happen.
You know, honourable senators, I am a bit suspicious of
this cry in the press now that the public has "a right to
know." I very much doubt that proposition without limita[Hon. Mr. O'Leary.}

May 6, 1974

tions. In my early days when I went to a meeting of the
press the great cry used to be "the freedom of the press."
Now that has changed and it is "the public's right to
know."
Who elected these people who are running the newspapers to see to it that the public has a right to know? Who
gave them a mandate to see that the public has a right to
know? This is nonsense. Do you think my friend Mr. Roy
Thompson has a mandate from the Canadian people with
respect to his 30 or 40 newspapers in Canada to see that
the public has a right to know? I doubt that, and I am sure
that if one of Mr. Roy Thompson's papers began to lose
money he would soon forget all about the public's right to
know. He would limit the mandate right there. He did it in
Vancouver when he stopped a daily newspaper. If he had a
mandate to see to it that the public had a right to know,
did he also have a mandate to end that mandate?
This question came before the Supreme Court a few
years ago, and I would advise honourable senators to read
what the Supreme Court said about the mandate of any
newspaper to see to it that the public has a right to know.
No newspaper publisher has been given that mandate. All
he can do is to see to it that his own newspaper gives
information as objectively and as fairly as possible. Nothing more. But if you heard some of those people talking
now you would think that the Cabinet should be holding
its meetings on the mall. You just cannot carry on government that way. There are always things in government
which must be kept confidential, not only for our own
sake but for the sake of our allies, the people with whom
we are negotiating.
I have always been suspicious of that cry. I have never
been a great advocate of press freedom. The printed word
is merely an extension of the spoken word, and the newspaper has no more freedom than I, as a humble individual,
have. That is all. It is an extension of free speech, of the
spoken word; and if you read the Fifth Amendment which
is always being quoted in the United States, you will see
that it speaks of the "freedom of speech and of the press."
It is "freedom of speech and of the press," and freedom of
speech came first. Freedom of the press was merely an
extension of that. This is what we are forgetting in all this
nonsense about information and the public's right to
know.
I would set up Information Canada in a different way
altogether. I would pass an act of Parliament saying exactly what its duties were, exactly what kind of information
it was supposed to give the public and that is all. I would
set up a strong financial control to see that they were not
running away with public money. They are running away
with public money now; I have no doubt in the world
about that. I can take you to my room now and show you
so-called information that I had four weeks ago, in other
forms of print. This is silly. Features appearing in the
press three weeks ago are all done up in the most magnif icent way and sent to me by Information Canada. I cannot
read that material. You cannot read it. I doubt if any
member of this chamber ever reads one half, one quarter,
of the so-called information sent to him by Information
Canada.

It was supposed to coordinate and control the information given out by the various departments. No such control
exists, and no such control is being exercised. The young
people in the various departments are now sending out
more than they ever sent out in years gone by, and Information Canada does not seem to know anything about it,
or to care anything about it.
I do not want to make an extended speech. I have
another appointment which is far more important later
this afternoon, but I do repeat that we must get rid of
what we have now in what we call Information Canada. It
is not doing its job. It is not informing the Canadian
people. It is trying to build up various ministers, as I said,
as supermen, and, my God, could you make a greater
mistake than that? Or give anybody more misinformation
than that? What is more, before we accept the recommendations made by Senator Everett's committee, this house
should go into Committee of the Whole. I should like to
ask many questions of Senator Everett, and I am sure he
would give me honest and intelligent answers.
No man in this house has a higher regard for Senator
Everett than I have, but he is a victim of circumstances.
He and his committee were asked to investigate Information Canada, and I do not think they were able to do the
job that should have been done. As I say, before we go any
further, this chamber should go into Committee of the
Whole, if we have time, and put Senator Everett under
cross-examination. His statements are too general. There
is statement after statement like that in this report. I am
sure they are meant well, but we have to know what they
mean. There are too many generalities. He did not explore
enough in depth. It was too general. He made a splendid
speech, but I defy any man to tell me what it all means, or
what a lot of it means.
That is all I have to say. I do hope that when the election
comes, if it does come-and I do not think it is coming, as I
said yesterday, and I say it again now-and if the result is
what I am sure it is going to be, then I think our inclination will be to get rid of Information Canada-not the
proposition itself, but as it is set up and as it has been
operating. Our inclination will be to get rid of it and start
afresh.
Hon. Mr. Croll: May I ask a question? Because you are
who you are and because of your background, particularly
with respect to matters as important as Information
Canada, would you take a minute and draw the distinction
between full disclosure and lack of disclosure, and the
right to know and the limitation of the right to know?
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: That is not an easy question to
answer, really. It is not an easy question at all. I certainly
think the public has a right to know in time, but it is a
question of timing. You do not have to know the next
minute. You do not have to have a press conference every
week, or every day of the week.
I remember, in the days of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, who
never gave a press conference, who never gave an interview-I went to interview him two or three times, and he
said, "O'Leary, I know what your job is, I know what you
are trying to do. I am an old newspaperman myself. But if

I have any answers to the questions you have asked me, I
have to give them properly, in the Parliament of Canada,
or in my caucus to my own party-the people to whom I
am responsible." I think that is fair. But you now seem to
have the situation that if anybody in the Cabinet gets a
sore toe, they hold a press conference about it. I never
went to a press conference. Borden, I think, held one in all
the years that he was Prime Minister. I didn't want to go
to these things; everybody got the information that was
given then. I got my scoops, if there were scoops, in a
different way. I didn't just sit there with everybody else
while we all got the same information. I remember Borden
coming in one day-the Cabinet had been sitting for
nearly an hour over conscription- and we all sat outside
waiting to hear what the great man would tell us. He came
and he started by saying, "The Cabinet met today." We
had waited there for two hours to see what was going to
happen, and this is what we were told, "The Cabinet met
today. We had under consideration the possibility of a
military conscription act. No decision was come to." That
was his press conference. And he was right. We had no
right to say to him, "Now, look here, you tell us everything
that went on in Cabinet today." I have never believed that
as a newspaperman, and I don't believe it now. Frankly,
and I often say this to the press, they are humoured too
much. I want the press to stress responsibility and to have
less stress on freedom.
Hon. Miss Lapointe: Honourable senators, may I make a
slight correction to a statement made by Senator O'Leary
in his speech? M. Jean-Louis Gagnon was editor of
L'Événement-Journaland not Le Soleil.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: My dear child, he was editor of Le
Soleil, not for a long time, but long enough to oppose
Franco in Quebec, which required a great deal of courage
at that time.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: It showed his communism.
Hon. Miss Lapointe: Could I ask a question of the
honourable senator? Is he in contradiction to his party
which clearly stated that it would abolish Information
Canada and never said that it would reorganize it
afterwards?
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: My dear child, I have lived all my lif e
in contradiction to my party. I don't just sit here and read
yesterday's House of Commons Hansard to see what I
ought to say today. I speak my mind; I have spoken it all
my life, maybe often I was wrong, but never, if I could
help it, on the side of wrong.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Thank you, Senator Lapointe.
Hon. Paul Martin: Honourable senators, I am sure we
all agree that if there is any man who could have greatly
contributed to the work of this committee, that man is
Senator O'Leary, with his long and distinguished career in
journalism. He continues to be a luminary in that profession, even though he has divorced himself from the paper
with which he was connected for such a long time. I
cannot understand why Senator O'Leary was not a
member of this committee; it is not the case that his party
was not adequately represented, because we had as members of that committee Senators Grosart, Phillips, Welch
and Yuzyk. And I take it that when Senator Everett spoke

SENATE DEBATES
the other day, he was speaking for the members of the
committee, because there was no objection registered.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Not necessarily.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Senator Flynn says not necessarily,
but I should think if that is the case then we ought to have
an expression of view during the course of this debate.
The Standing Senate Committee on National Finance
spent some time in an examination of Information
Canada. If these committees are to be taken seriously, and
I take it that they are, and if their work is to be commended for its thoroughness, then I don't think we should just
allow the report to be tabled by the chairman without
some comment. While I may not necessarily agree with the
forum for discussion which Senator O'Leary proposes,
nevertheless I do think that we should not hesitate to
comment on this report. Senator Everett took us through
the report in its important sections. There has been a very
wide discussion of the reporte (1430)

Hon. Mr. Flynn: Not yet.
Hon. Mr. Martin: In the major newspapers and on
television, most of it in my opinion complimentary. The
report itself is not by any means a complete endorsation of
all that Information Canada is doing, or has done. The
report, I believe, is sound and logical. It has met the
objective that members of the committee set out for themselves. I think it is a unique report and a valuable report.
Its style has managed to reduce the complexities and the
serious shortcomings, admittedly, of the government's
information operations to language that is understandable
and, perhaps for the first time, it has set out the essential
requirements for overcoming those shortcomings in practical and workable proposals.
Recommendations and conclusions 3(b), 3(c), 4, 5 and 13
of the report form the essential foundation for action, it
seems to me, toward the achievement of the effectiveness
not only in Information Canada itself but across all government programs of information, the very objective that
Senator O'Leary said this institution should have. The
important recommendation is No. 1, and I do not think it
quarrels with what Senator O'Leary said would be the
kind of situation a new administration under Conservative auspices would seek to establish, having clearly eliminated the present one. This recommendation No. 1 proposed that there should be an act of Parliament defining
Information Canada's authority and responsibilities. All
other recommendations in this group of the key recommendations are, of course, substantial to the whole proposal itself.
The report points out that Information Canada's responsibilities to evaluate departmental information programs,
to see that the maximum techniques, to use their word, are
being used to meet the public need, to continually watch
for and correct overlap and wastage in both the hardware
and software of information within the government and to
strive for the improvement of quality across the service as
a whole, become realistic only when coupled with the
means-that is, the clout-to make it happen as is recommended in the fifth recommendation of the committee,
which reads:
[Hon. Mr. Martin.]

May 6, 1974

Information Canada should act as the agent of the
Treasury Board in screening the information budgets
of all departments and agencies and advise Treasury
Board regarding expenditures on information programs proposed by departments.
That is the very important function that Senator O'Leary
said a real information board, to use his language, should
be engaged in doing.
The role of Information Canada in providing professional leadership in concert with other appropriate central
agencies, such as the Public Service Commission and the
Treasury Board Secretariat, for the upgrading of professional standards of information officers of government is a
logical and proper investment in improving the quality of
the service rendered.
Senator O'Leary said the committee should call these
young information officers before the committee to be
asked why they produce so much material. The committee
had that opportunity. There was nothing to preclude the
committee from calling officers. As a matter of fact, an
examination of the report shows that many of the personnel in Information Canada, including the minister, were
called before the committee. All that Senator O'Leary is
saying is that more should have been called. That is why I
regret that with his great knowledge and professional skill
he was not on the committee.
Finally, the clear and open display of the costs of information services for each department in the annual blue
book of estimates on Information Canada's role in defining information for this purpose is in itself a significant
and welcome new information instrument and one that is
long overdue. It does not do some things that Senator
O'Leary suggested. Admittedly, when Information Canada
was first conceived there was concern that we would be
using this instrument for the purpose of propagating the
work of individual members of the government. That has
not happened.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: Aren't you sure that is happening?
Hon. Mr. Martin: I certainly do not believe that is
happening and this report is my authority for saying so.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: I see what I see. I have speeches on
my desk right now that were made three or four weeks
ago. Why are they on my desk, and who paid for putting
them on my desk?
Hon. Mr. Martin: I cannot say why they are on Senator
O'Leary's desk. But that statement is not proof of what
Senator O'Leary said, that Information Canada, in its
present form, is for the purpose of propagating the work of
individual ministers. I say this report does not serve as the
authority for making that statement, and I do not believe
that to be the case.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: That is only one of the recommendations concerning Information Canada.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Most of the recommendations-and
they are major recommendations which are supported by
the government-when implemented will supply the
essential parameters. They will set out the limits of
responsibility which Senator O'Leary speaks of and they
will make it possible for Information Canada to do those
things for which it is best suited.

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

Are we to argue that there is to be no coordination of all
information services in the Government of Canada under
the jurisdiction of each department? Of course. In the
structure of government like the one we have in Canada,
and as big as ours, the time has long come when this
recommendation of the Finance Committee of the Senate
should be heeded, that one of the functions of Information
Canada should be to provide for the kind of coordination
which Senator O'Leary said he would like to see
established.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: I say that coordination does not exist.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Recommendation 3(a) proposes that
Information Canada should keep its own initiatives to a
minimum. This is one of the very few cases where the
committee's recommendations appeared to be vague. For
example, what minimum? Surely it is agreed that the
agency performs a valuable service in filling information
gaps where no specific portfolio is responsible for the
information in question, or where the program and service
packaging of information is of distinct convenience to the
public. For instance, Citizens' Services booklets-are they
not of value? The Organization of the Government of
Canada-will anyone deny that that is a valuable document? Federal Government Publications Selected for High
School Libraries-is that not a good document to have
been producedHon. Mr. O'Leary: No.
Hon. Mr. Martin: -by Information Canada? Senator
O'Leary says no. I would be interested in knowing how
many have actually read that document, because it has
won the approval of so many provincial departments of
education all over Canada.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: We had that before.
Hon. Mr. Martin: The word "minimum" will be interpreted to mean, and I quote from the report:
... that which is necessary to provide what is legitimately needed and where Information Canada is the
logical initiator.
Also, I believe that recommendation 3(e) is questionable.
It states that:
While it may be desirable to tailor information to
the individual, regional and special group needs, the
cost of doing this can be disproportionate to the
benefit.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Did you object to this recommendation
in committee?
Hon. Mr. Martin: I was not in the committee.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: But you are a member of that
committee.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Yes, of course, I am a member of the
committee.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I thought you were criticizing the fact
that Senator O'LearyHon. Mr. Martin: I was not criticizing Senator O'Leary
for not being a member of the committee. I was simply
complaining that I could not understand how a man of his
quality and experience could not have been put on that
committee by those responsible for the allocation of posi-

tions. I have not the responsibility for putting Senator
O'Leary on committees. Certainly, if I had, he would have
been on that committee.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Those who are members of the committee have less right to criticize.
Hon. Mr. Denis: Is it not true that the leader suggests
the names of members of the committee?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Certainly. You should not speak
truisms of that kind. You and your leader have been
around long enough to know that that is the usual
practice.
Hon. Mr. Martin: With the Leader of the Opposition's
great knowledge of the rules of Parliament, I do not know
of anyone who violates our rules of debate more frequently and sometimes, I think, with less effect.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: Would the Leader of the Government
permit me a question?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: Recommendation 6-the Leader of
the Government has not yet come to it, apparently-says:
The Mobile Information Officer program appears to
the committee to have developed into a social welfare
service.
What is meant by that?
Hon. Mr. Martin: I will come to that in a moment.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: You will follow your notes.
Hon. Mr. Martin: That is exactly what I am doing. At
least I have notes. If my friend had notes we would hear
him more often in constructive and productive debates of
the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: Who prepared them?
Hon. Mr. Martin: They are obviously prepared by the
department concerned in these matters. I am not the
minister in charge of information.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: You never have any notes of your own.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I thought Senator O'Leary told us that
there would not be an election. Why are you starting into
one so quickly?

Hon. Mr. Martin: A $2 million national advertising
program may be highly visible, but that does not mean it
is effective. That is in one of the provisions of the report.
There are many examples of this. How can one communicate with all members of the public with the different
occupations, education, language, culture and needs, if
only traditional means are used? Consideration must be
given to meeting information needs as they exist on a local
basis, especially in areas where people are rather isolated
from responsible information services or the mass media.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: Those are pure generalities.
Hon. Mr. Martin: Of course they are generalities. No
one is a greater master of that than the Leader of the
Opposition, but it does not mean that because they are
generalities they are not applicable. In the same category,
recommendation 6Hon. Mr. Flynn: He is coming to the attack.

SENATE DEBATES

The Hon. the Speaker pro tem: There have been too
many questions asked of the honourable senator. The
Leader of the Government should not be interrupted so
often so that we might have an orderly debate.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It will be much duller.
Hon. Mr. Martin: But it will be more orderly. It will
reflect that the Leader of the Opposition is capable of
making a speech as well as always trying to penetrate an
observation in order to try to destroy what is being said by
whoever happens to be speaking.
In the same category follows recommendation 6, which
bas to do with the mobile information program mentioned
a moment ago by Senator O'Leary.
* (1440)

The mobile information officer program has proven that
it does not require vast funding to communicate. This is
where Information Canada takes issue with the report
itself.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: May I ask the Leader of the Government a question? What does the committee mean when it
says:
The Mobile Information Officer program appears to
the committee to have developed into a social welfare
service.
What were they doing?
Hon. Mr. Martin: That is the argument I am dealing
with now. I am saying that this is another recommendation of the committee with which the government does not
agree. The information officers in charge of these mobile
information units in Nova Scotia and Manitoba have handled inquiries from individuals who were, for a long time,
without this type of federal service. But beyond the economics of the one-on-one contacts of these information
officers, which appears to be the primary concern of the
committee, these mobile officers have worked with more
than 300 groups and thus were in contact with many times
this number of individuals each time. Also, they have had
free access to local news media of all kinds, thus reaching
thousands of people. They have participated in fairs and
exhibits, representing many departments, and they have
given those departments access to, and feedback from,
regions of those provinces that were virtually beyond the
reach of traditional information techniques.
Information Canada does not only produce the information and pamphlets which we receive. This very program
that is criticized in the report of the committee, and
inferentially by Senator O'Leary, is, I think, one of the
positive achievements of Information Canada.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: What about the term "social welfare
service?" What is meant by that?
Hon. Mr. Martin: Well, I do not agree that it is a social
welfare service.
Hon. Mr. O'Leary: Does the government have no control
at all over these people?
Hon. Mr. Martin: The committee bas the right, in criticizing Information Canada, to use the language that it bas.
The mobile officer costs on an individual contact basis
over a six-month period were approximately $2.75 per
contact. I am now dealing with the alleged cost of this
[Hon. Mr. Flynn.]

May 6, 1974

program. The report states that the number of mobile
information officers would proliferate. Estimates are that
not more than 60 are required on a national scale, since
they are used on a priority basis and not on a provincewide basis. In fact, the number of mobile information
officers in Manitoba bas already been reduced. So that
there is not a disposition, as is suggested by Senator
O'Leary, to multiply the costs of these units, the value of
which he greatly questions.
The expenditure for this service is minimal when one
looks at its dividends. Its clients, for example, are more
than 90 per cent in favour of its continuance. Go to
Manitoba or Saskatchewan and ask the recipients of this
service whether they wish to have it abandoned. I do not
think any service of Information Canada bas been more
strongly approved than has this mobile information program. The clients of this service, of course, are the public
and the federal departments. It can be further suggested
that the mobile officers more than recover their costs
through savings to other federal departments for whom
the mobile service functions. This mobile information service, in my judgment, should continue.
Dealing with recommendation 7, the regional offices of
Information Canada perform a much larger role than the
committee thought useful. These regional offices provide,
for example, communications assistance and feedback to
federal departments on request. To eliminate this role
would clearly necessitate an increase in the regional staffs
of other federal departments and duplication of effort.
Since this larger role was undertaken with the support of
the departments themselves, realizing its worth and
economies, it seems to me that a strong case for its continuance has been made.
With regard to recommendation 8, the committee bas
kind words for the inquiry service. However, it recommends that it be limited to 11 centres. This recommendation, I would suggest, should not be inflexible. Strong
continuing demand for the service from one part or
another of the country should at least be a matter for
argument, should at least be open to consideration.
Then there is the question of increased telephone contacts through the use of special lines such as Zenith. This
is worthy of considerable attention. However, these phone
lines should not be regarded as constituting an entire
system, nor as a replacement for mobile officers but rather
as a supplementary tool.
There are many unresolved questions concerning such
lines, among them being the cost. The figures in the report
show a cost in excess of $8 per call, with extra staff
included, versus $2.75 per contact under the mobile service
previously mentioned.
It might be more reasonable to utilize community
resources such as community information centres. Information Canada is identifying these centres and supplying
them with federal information. One by one they are being
tied into community networks, and the tying has been
done, to a large part, by the mobile information officers.
Senator O'Leary says he does not like Information
Canada. That is his position. There are many people in
Canada who, because we have not been trained to have
such a branch of the public service, find it difficult to

it has corne forward witb the view that Information
Canada is a good institution.

proper description of the electoral district if it were called
Huron-Middlesex.
We have had bills similar to this before, and there has
been some objection to them from this side of the house.
However, all the previous bills have been passed, and I
trust that this one will receive favourable consideration.
It may be wondered why this change is needed at this
time. I can only say that originally it was felt there would
be a redistribution bill in this session of Parliament, and
they have been waiting for that. When it became obvious
that there was not to be a redistribution bill there did not
seem to be any urgency about having the change made. In
recent weeks, due to certain circumstances, there has been
a feeling of urgency that if the name is to be changed it
should be done now.
I may say that the bill was passed by the other place
without debate in the course of a very few minutes.
Hon. Mr. Lafond: Honourable senators, I have already
on several previous occasions recorded my opposition to
bills of this nature. Whether they be moved from this side
of the house or the other side of the house, my objection
stands. To my mind, they serve no positive or constructive
purpose whatsoever. They do, however, serve to complicate the operation of our electoral process through the
Chief Electoral Officer.
To introduce bills of this nature, particularly in a week
such as this, seems to me to betray an utter lack of f aith in
the effectiveness of any action the Opposition is contemplating in the other place within the next 48 hours. Given
that, it seems to me that the heads of many civil servants
which, according to this morning's Gazette, Senator O'Leary would like to see roll can probably rest easy on Wednesday night, the next night, the next night and the next
night.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, I shall deal with
the bill and not be irrelevant. My position on these bills is
well known. I do not expect the Senate to give this bill any
other treatment than it has given similar bills that have
come to us. In principle I am opposed to names such as
this. I think a single name is best. However, if it has to
pass, let it pass.

Hon. Mr. Denis: Honourable senators, using the logic of
the Leader of the Opposition, I wonder whether it would
not be more simple to have his party called "Conservative" instead of "Progressive Conservative".

LAND USE
INQUIRY-DEBATE CONTINUED

On the Order:
Resuming the debate on the inquiry of the Honourable Senator Norrie calling the attention of the Senate
to the question of land use in Canada.- (Honourable
Senator Langlois).
Hon. Mr. Martin: Senator Bonnell wishes to speak.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I am happy to yield to Senator
Bonnell.
The Hon. the Speaker pro tem: Is it agreed, honourable
senators?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Lorne Bonnell: Honourable senators, in my opinion, land use in Canada is basically one of the rights of the
provinces. Therefore there is very little that we members
of the Senate or the federal government can do concerning
this important and vital matter. I further believe that land
use presents one of the great crises facing us today, and is
probably equal in importance to the energy crisis.
Many people get uptight over land ownership. It does
not bother me so much who owns the land, but rather
what use they make of it. Under the old British law, a
man's home was his castle and his land was his own. For
governments, whether they be federal or provincial, to
interfere with the rights of the individual is a very serious
matter. We must never forget that the collective right of
us all is more important than the individual rights of each
or any one of us. Probably the best and most important
way to control land use is through zoning for specific use.

May 6, 1974
May 6,1974

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

In my view, that right belongs to the provinces and not to
the Senate, the House of Commons or the federal
government.
The part of this country most seriously interested in
land use is probably the province of Prince Edward Island.
The 1972 statistics showed that 6.5 per cent of Prince
Edward Island was owned by non-residents, and 11.5 per
cent of the shore front was owned by non-residents. The
provincial government, which was close to the people,
realized that a crisis could be at hand, and in 1972 the
legislature passed an act called the Real Property Act,
under which non-residents were restricted to the purchase
of not more than ten acres, or f ive chains, 330 f eet, of shore
frontage. This was one of the first major steps taken by
any government in Canada. If any individual or corporation wished to buy more than that, approval had to be
obtained from the Lieutenant Governor in Council. Some
large corporations incorporated in the province, feeling
that because they were incorporated in the province they
could buy more land than the ten acres, have proceeded to
do so. The government took the issue to the supreme court
of the province and won that decision, but these large
corporations are now appealing to the Supreme Court of
Canada.
In 1972, also in Prince Edward Island, the government of
the day saw fit to set up a royal commission on land use
and land ownership. It was the finding of that commission
that the people of the province felt that the most important issue was not land ownership but land use. They also
felt that the people in the local areas should have some say
in the decision as to how land should be used. It was felt
that prime agricultural land should remain as far as practicable in the agricultural sector of the economy.
In Prince Edward Island the most important physical
resource is our land. The only "mine" in the province is
the top six inches of soil, and we mine it year after year.
The Government of Prince Edward Island realized the
value of the physical resources, realized the value of the
top six inches of soil, realized the value of the ecology and
the environment, and decided that it could not allow much
of the prime agricultural land to be owned by non-residents if it was not put into agricultural use.
*

(1510)

The premier of the day, the Honourable Alexander B.
Campbell, recommended to his government some new
policies for the protection and the use of the land in Prince'
Edward Island. One of his recommendations was that a
commission be set up consisting of seven members from
the private sector, who would broadly represent the various concerned groups within the province as to land use.
That land use commission will have at its disposal the
technical and professional expertise within the provincial
government. It will have the responsibility of establishing
community and regional planning bodies when such are
advanced by the communities and regions of the province;
the responsibility of approving community and regional
land use; and the responsibility of proposing programs to
allow for the identification of lands for specific purposes.
In addition, the commission will have the responsibility of
making detailed recommendations to the provincial government in such areas as land use questions affecting
inland and coastal land; rural, urban and recreational

27601-26

subdivision policies; and highway access and strip development policies.
Probably the greatest thing done by the premier and his
government is to make all agricultural land in the province of Prince Edward Island free of tax. If the land is
used for agricultural purposes, no longer will there by any
land tax, school tax or any other type of tax on it. The only
land which will be taxed within the province will be land
for homeownership, industrial land, recreational land,
subdivisional land or other land not in agricultural use. In
this way much of the idle land in Prince Edward Island
will again be put to agricultural use, and that is a great
concern of our people.
I should point out that the Government of Prince
Edward Island has made available $5 million to family
farms for the expansion and development of rural lands in
the province. They have done this by giving grants to
farmers for the development of family farms. They have
also established an environmental control commission to
encourage the coordination of the various departments of
government for the protection of the land for its proper
use; for the protection of the environment; for the control
of soil erosion; to coordinate the highways and road construction programs of the Department of Public Works
with respect to soil erosion; and to control the procurement and purchase of land by non-residents.
With respect to one last part we might be able to play in
the use of land in Canada, I would like to make three
suggestions. First, there is a possibility that some of our
provinces might decide that aliens would have to buy land
under different terms from Canadians. If so, I believe that
becomes a matter of federal jurisdiction, because when we
start to talk about the purchase of land by aliens we
immediately get into the question of immigration, which
is definitely within federal jurisdiction. On that score I
believe the provinces probably have not the jurisdiction to
control the purchase of land by aliens unless they say it is
the purchase of land by non-residents, which would
include all people. If they want to exclude merely aliens,
then I believe it becomes a matter of federal jurisdiction.
Perhaps some federal legislation could be passed, therefore, to assist the provinces in their control of land use in
so far as the purchase of land by aliens is concerned.
Secondly, I believe the federal government should provide funds to the provinces to assist them in research as to
how they might better control and preserve their shore
lines, which are being eroded by the seas on both the
Atlantic and Pacific coasts. This is especially true in
respect of Prince Edward Island's beaches.
Thirdly, I believe the federal government can do something in respect of land use so far as our national parks
policy is concerned. In my view it is fine for the federal
government to set aside 20,000 or 40,000 acres of land in the
northern part of Canada to be preserved in its natural
state for future generations. But to set aside 20,000 acres in
a province like Prince Edward Island would be to take out
of production almost 20,000 acres of prime agricultural
land. I certainly do not believe that to be good federal
policy. I believe the National Parks Branch should allow
farmers within the boundaries of a national park to use
that land and cultivate it, and it should allow them to do
so from generation to generation. Land is too valuable to

SENATE DEBATES

let it grow up in yellow weeds and scrub brush just so that
it remains in its natural state. In my opinion there is
nothing more beautiful than a 400- or 500-acre field of
wheat, potatoes or hay, or even 100 acres of pasture with
beautiful cattle roaming about. I believe that most people
who visit a national park in a rural area such as in Prince
Edward Island would much prefer to see agricultural land
being used to its fullest potential than to see it growing up
in yellow weeds or scrub brush just so that a national park
can be preserved in its natural state.
0 (1520)

Therefore, I believe that if the subject of this inquiry is
referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture, some recommendation to the National Parks Branch
should be made for a change of policy in the smaller rural
areas of this country, such as Prince Edward Island.
Honourable senators, it is not my intention to discuss
this matter any further because, as I said before, it is
basically a provincial problem. The subject is within provincial jurisdiction. It is a problem which is certainly
growing in intensity and immensity, but it is something
which the governments of our provinces are well able to
handle without too much interference from the Government of Canada.
On motion of Senator Carter, debate adjourned.

EXPORT AND IMPORT PERMITS ACT
BILL TO AMEND-FIRST READING

The Hon. the Speaker pro tem informed the Senate that
a message had been received from the House of Commons
with Bill C-4, to amend the Export and Import Permits
Act.
Bill read first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker pro tem: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. Charles McElrnan, with leave of the Senate and
notwithstanding rule 44(l)(f), moved that the bill be read
a second time now.
He said: Honourable senators, under the Export and
Import Permits Act the Governor in Council may establish a list of goods, called an export control list, whereby
the export of any article can be made subject to control for
certain purposes as specified in section 3. The first objective of Bill C-4 is to add the following two purposes to
those already set out in section 3 for which exports can be
made subject to control:
(a.1) to ensure that any action taken to promote the
further processing in Canada of a natural resource
that is produced in Canada is not rendered ineffective
by reason of the unrestricted exportation of that natural resource;
(a.2) to limit or keep under surveillance the export of
any raw or processed material that is produced in
Canada in circumstances of surplus supply and
depressed prices and that is not a produce of
agriculture;
[Hon. Mr. Bonnell.]

May 6, 1974

Under the same act, the Governor in Council may also
establish a list of goods, called an import control list,
whereby the import of any article may be made subject to
control for certain purposes as now specified in section 5.
The second objective of the bill is to add the following
purpose to those already set out in subsection 5(1).
(a.1) to restrict, for the purpose of supporting any
action taken under the Farm Products Marketing
Agencies Act, the importation in any form of a like
article to one produced or marketed in Canada the
quantities of which are fixed or determined under
that Act.
The third objective of the bill is to repeal section 27 of
the Export and Import Permits Act, which sets out the
expiry date of the act.
The first point to note is that the amendments being
proposed to the Export and Import Permits Act, apart
from the deletion of its expiry date, are enabling
legislation.
The objective of the amendment which would enable the
Governor in Council to put items on the export control list
to promote the further processing of a natural resource
that is produced in Canada is self-evident. The amendment will provide one of the means which may or may
not be needed for promoting processing of resources in
Canada in those cases where such processing can be internationally competitive and consistent with a sound industrial structure.
This is not to imply that the most desirable or most
effective way to encourage processing of resources is by
introducing export controls. The government's general
approach is to focus on constructive cooperative tools,
such as multilateral trade negotiations, taxation policy,
existing programs of industrial support, consultation with
industry, and the foreign investment review process.
Nevertheless, it is conceivable that an occasion might arise
when, despite such positive efforts, or in conjunction with
them, it may be necessary to make the exportation of some
natural resources subject to control if further processing
in Canada is desirable and is to be achieved.
The objective of the proposed amendment to limit or
keep under surveillance the export of the raw or processed
material that is produced in Canada in circumstances of
surplus supply is to establish a provision which can be
used, if needed, for ensuring that proper economic advantage is derived from raw or processed materials produced
in Canada. Occasions may arise where Canada has a particular material in abundance, as well as an influential
place in the international market in respect to its price, so
that oversupply from Canadian sources could result in
reducing or holding prices at an inappropriate low level,
having regard to factors such as the capital invested in
production and the long-term need and future value of the
material involved. In the circumstances, various steps
might be possible to promote appropriate pricing, such as
international or national cooperative marketing arrangements. However, in certain situations, one advisable step
could be to make the material in question subject to
export control for a time. The proposed amendment in
respect of material in surplus supply would make it possible to initiate such action, and to do so with the promptness that would yield best results.

May 6, 1974
Mav 6. 1974

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

Agricultural products are excluded from the amendment
dealing with materials in surplus supply. The reason is
that there are not any situations for products, other than
those already under the control of the Canadian Wheat
Board, where Canada would have the necessary strength
in world markets to influence the price of a commodity by
control of exports.
It is important to note that the proposed amendments in
respect of export controls do not represent a departure
from our traditional policy of encouraging trade liberalization, or an effort to take unf air advantage of customers for
the products of our resources. The fundamental concern in
proposing these amendments is simply to see that the full
and proper economic advantage is derived from raw or
processed materials produced in Canada.
In general it is expected, and it is the government's
hope, that export restrictions will not be necessary to
encourage increased upgrading of resources in Canada.
The government will be looking first for positive means to
encourage upgrading of resources prior to export in those
cases where it makes commercial and economic sense. For
example, if Canada's trading partners would agree in the
forthcoming multilateral trade negotiations to reducing
trade barriers which presently bear more heavily on processed than on unprocessed products, it could be expected
that more value would be added to Canadian resources
through f urther processing prior to export.
During the years ahead, new facilities will have to be
established somewhere in the world to process Canadian
resources. If it makes commercial and economic sense, this
new capacity should be installed in Canada. This is a
legitimate objective, and one that can be understood by
countries with which we trade. If export controls were
required for this purpose, they would, of course, be applied
on a highly selective, product-by-product basis, and only
after all factors, including long-term trading relationships,
had been assessed.
e (1530)

Let me turn now to the proposed amendment aimed at
establishing an additional purpose for which imports can
be made subject to control, which is:
to restrict, for the purpose of supporting any action
taken under the Farm Products Marketing Agencies
Act, the importation in any form of a like article to
one produced or marketed in Canada the quantities of
which are fixed or determined under that Act.
The Farm Products Marketing Agencies Act allows for
the creation of national farm marketing agencies to promote strong, efficient and competitive agricultural sectors
having "due regard to the interests of producers and consumers." To date, such agencies have been established for
eggs and turkeys. Under the act, agencies have the
power-for eggs and poultry only-to determine quantities which can be marketed in interprovincial and export
trade by setting production or marketing quotas. It is now
possible that a supply management program of this kind
could be undermined, on occasion, by an influx, or the
threat of an influx, of low-priced products from other
countries. Therefore, it is proposed to permit the application of import controls, if required, to support the operation of national supply management programs for eggs
and poultry. This is not to imply that it would be the

intention of the government, if it did decide to apply
import controls on eggs or poultry for a particular period,
to attempt to insulate the Canadian market for these
products from long-term trends in international prices.
If this amendment is passed, it does not mean that an
agricultural product will be automatically added to the
import control list because a supply management program
is being implemented under the Farm Products Marketing
Agencies Act. If the authorities concerned under this act
believe that a particular product should be added to the
import control list to complement a particular supply
management program, they would have to make a recommendation to this effect. The government would examine
the case and decide whether or not to recommend to the
Governor in Council the desired addition to the import
control list, as well as to establish the duration and conditions under which import controls will be exercised for the
particular product in question.
Honourable senators, I would point out that the concept
of having enabling legislation to apply export and import
controls has been accepted in all western industrial countries and Japan. While the details of the laws involved
vary from country to country, it is reasonable to say there
is international recognition that there are certain circumstances in international commerce to which national governments can respond effectively only through import or
export control action.
Finally, the bill proposes the repeal of section 27, since
the inclusion of an expiry date in what is, in effect,
ongoing enabling legislation is, first, inconsistent with
the fact that the act is intended to implement various
international commitments, as well as complement other
acts of Parliament, which are not subject to expiry dates;
and, second, an expiry date leads to unnecessary administrative expense both for industry and government departments, as well as introducing an element of uncertainty in
private companies' export sales efforts on long lead-time
delivery items with certain potential purchasers.
Canada has various ongoing international commitments that are implemented under the Export and Import
Permits Act which are not subject to expiry dates corresponding to the limited duration of the act. These include
export control commitments in respect of military equipment and strategic supplies; controlling trade with
Rhodesia in keeping with the United Nations resolutions
on Rhodesia; implementing international commodity control agreements-for example, cocoa-and administering
cross-border arrangements with the United States to
facilitate Canadian trade.
The act is also used on an ongoing basis, as required, to
complement action initiated by the agencies acting under
the statutes named in section 5(b)-the Agricultural Stabilization Act, the Fisheries Prices Support Act, the
Agricultural Products Cooperative Marketing Act, the
Agricultural Products Board Act and the Canadian Dairy
Commission Act. None of these five acts contains an
expiry date. In addition, the Export and Import Permits
Act is used on a continuing basis for implementing import
controls which are deemed necessary as a result of recommendations to the government made under the Antidumping and Textile and Clothing Board acts.

SENATE DEBATES

May 6, 1974

In referring to various other acts for which the Export
and Import Permits Act may provide complementary support, perhaps I should mention that the act does not, of
course, include any provisions, nor are any provisions
being proposed, whereby items are automatically added to
the import control list or the export control list at any
time as a result of action initiated under other acts. When
items are added or deleted from the import or export
control list, the government makes a decision in each case,
having regard to its international commitments and the
recommendations which may be made to it by departments, agencies, or boards, as well as whatever other
significant circumstances prevail at the time. The Canadian Dairy Commission Act is the only act in the group of
five in section 5(b) for which the Export and Import
Permits Act is being used to provide complementary support at the present time.
The inclusion of an expiry date in the act leads to
unnecessary administrative expense for industry and government departments. For example, it is customary practice to issue export permits covering a six-month period to
reduce the work of applying and issuance to a minimum.
However, once the act approaches its expiry date, this
economizing of effort cannot be achieved so that additional applications must be filed and processed this year.
Another example is that it is customary to issue certain
export permits for periods of one year for aircraft replacement parts in cases where companies have specific ongoing commitments to export items on an "urgent rush"
basis in order that aircraft will be grounded for a minimum length of time but, during the calendar year in which
the act is due to expire, the business of arranging these
special permits must be done twice. The same situation
exists in respect of approximately 400 special calendar
year export permits which have been issued to logging and
pulpwood firms. Similar difficulty is being encountered on
the import control list side in respect of shirts where
approximately 65 importing companies are involved.

Hon. John M. Macdonald: Honourable senators, it is
not my intention to speak to this bill at this time. I am
sure we are all grateful to Senator McElman for his
detailed and penetrating explanation of this important
measure.
I understand there are honourable senators on this side
of the bouse who wish to speak to the bill. I further
understand that it is proposed to refer the bill to committee. In those circumstances, it might be better if the bill is
read the second time now, and referred to committee.
Those of us who wish to speak may do so on third reading.
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.

Hon. Leopold Langlois moved pursuant to notice:
That the Standing Senate Committee on Transport
and Communications be authorized to examine and
report upon the matter of the program entitled "Les
Beaux Dimanches," televised on 28th April, 1974, on
the French network of the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation.
He said: Honourable senators, I wish to make only a few
comments at this time, since I gave my reasons for presenting this motion when I spoke to the matter on May 1.
On Sunday, April 28, I saw on the CBC French network
a program entitled "Les Beaux Dimanches," to which I
took very serious objection. I do not wish to prejudge the
matter, but I feel strongly that this type of program should
be drawn to the attention of the Standing Senate Committee on Transport and Communications because, in my
opinion, Canadian taxpayers should not be asked to pay
for this kind of program on the national television
network.
The program in question concerned the opening of a
session of Parliament at which, presumably, Her Majesty
the Queen was in attendance. It concerned also the introduction to Rideau Hall of its new incumbents, the Gover-

(1540)

An expiry date in the act can also introduce an element
of uncertainty in private companies' export sales negotiations with potential purchasers, particularly in countries
that are on the area control list. State-trading countries
are accustomed to obtaining export permits-indeed, in
most cases, require that a permit be issued-to cover a
long lead-time delivery item before completion of a final
sales contract. Cases have arisen, however, where it has
been impossible to issue an export permit for long leadtime items since delivery was scheduled after the expiry
date of the act.
Therefore, industry and government have been required
to go to considerable lengths in such instances to provide
as much reassurance as possible to potential buyers, short
of a definitive commitment, that export permits will be
granted. Since it is hoped that Canadian exports of long
lead-time advanced technology products will expand to
state-trading nations, it would be useful to reduce to a
minimum, administrative impediments and irritations in
dealing with these potential customers.
Honourable senators, I commend this bill to your
favourable consideration.

nor General and Mrs. Léger. It was obvious to me, and to

others who saw the program-several have since spoken to
me about it-that its sole purpose was to cast ridicule not
only on our parliamentary system but also on the high
offices of head of state-Her Majesty the Queen and the
Governor General.
The best way of acquainting the house with this type of
program would be for a committee of the Senate to call as
witnesses the President of the CBC and the Chairman of
the CRT C, and to have an opportunity of hearing and
viewing the tape of the program in order that it might be
better able to pass judgment.
The program in question was entirely in French, and I
would suggest that the French sound track and its English
translation be available to the committee. Once the members of the committee have seen and heard this program, I
arn sure they will agree with me that this type of programn
should be banished f romn both the French and English

EXPORT AND IMPORT PERMITS ACT
BILL TO AMEND-REPORT 0F COMMITTEE
Hon. Salter A. Hayden, Chairman of the Standing
Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce,

reported that the committee had considered Bill C-4, to
amend the Export and Imports Permit Act, and had directed that the bill be reported without amendment.
THIRD READING
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shail
this bill be read a third time?
Senator McElmnan: Honourable senators, with leave of
the Senate and notwithstanding rule 45(1) (b), I move that
the bill be read a third time now.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Is there any need for third reading at
this time?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I think the best reason is that we are
to have royal assent some time this afternoon.
Hon. Mr. Argue: Why?
The Hon. the Speaker: It is moved by Honourable
Senator McElman, with leave of the Senate and notwithstanding rule 45(l) (b), that this bill be now read a third
time. Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the
motion?
Hon. L. P. Beaubien: Honourable senators, the purpose
of Bill C-4 is to amend an act which was put on the statute
books as a temporary measure and which was to die on the
3lst of July 1974. Bill C-4 is rot, therefore, simply an
amendment to an existing act. Admittedly, an act such as
the Export and Import Permits Act has been in effect in
one form or another since 1947. I can hardly pretend,
therefore, that this particular act is merely temporary in
nature. Nevertheless, it should be noted that it does trace
its origin to the old war regulations as a resuît of which it
gives to the Governor in Council a tremendous amount of
discretionary power. Now, the two suggested amendments
to the act which. are embodied in Bill C-4 would make
those discretionary powers even more wide ranging than
they are.
I arn far from convinced that such wide-ranging discretionary powers are either necessary or appropriate, and I
feel, therefore, that this bill is of the type which should be
considered long and hard and most carefully before being
passed by the Senate.
It is to the credit of the Chairman of the Standing
Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce that
he worked long hours on this bill last night, and, having
gone through it carefully, he is of the opinion that we
should pass the bill without amendment. I arn as a matter
of course impressed by his judgment and I do not want
partiwularly to oppose him. I must say again, however, that
it makes absolutely no sense to me to give such vast
discretionary powers to the Governor in Council so that,
for example, ail of a sudden the Governor in Council can
stop eggs from being imported. Two years ago grade A
large eggs were selling for 47 cents on the market in

May 7, 1974

May 7,1974

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

Ottawa. They are now selling at 87 cents. That is an
increase of 85 per cent in two years. If there is no restriction on eggs below the border and we can get them in at a
few cents cheaper, would it not be a good idea to do so,
when people are having so much trouble with inflation
that they find it difficult to make ends meet? That is just
one example, but there are many things like that which
the Governor in Council has the power to control-the
power to keep out of the country or to limit in quantity or
to prevent from leaving the country, and so on.
I am not pretending for one minute that there are not
many people just waiting to do the wrong thing, but I do
think that, after all, if we are going to have any kind of
free economy we should not give carte blanche to the
government to do what it wants with respect to export and
import; to tell us that we can do this or do that or export
potash or not export it, and so on. I am not saying that the
goveriment would stop anyone from exporting potash. I
am merely saying that these powers are there and there is
no reason why they should be there. That is what I am
saying. During the war, of course, these things had to be.
0 (1410)

A witness this morning told us that we had to stop
people from exporting arms. Honourable senators, there
are no arms made in Canada, or at least, nothing that
today could be considered military hardware. In any
event, when you see all the fighting that is going on all
over the world, obviously everybody seems to be able to
buy all the most expensive tanks and planes, and everything that they could conceivably want, without any
trouble, so why should we be told we cannot export any
arms? We do not produce any arms. We produce shotguns,
perhaps, but that is hardly the same thing.
Here we are faced with all kinds of regulations which, to
my mind, do not apply in this day and age-not to us,
anyway. Therefore, it is a great mistake that we should
have an important bill which is going to put a great many
people in Canada, who are performing a useful service of
giving employment, in a position where they are going to
have to find out if the Governor in Council is going to
allow them to do any ordinary thing that one would think
they should be able to do. Under these regulations they are
going to have to go and find out in a way that just puts
everybody's costs up. If you are planning to produce a
certain article because you can sell it in the United States,
you are going to have to find out if the Governor in
Council will allow you to sell it in the United States, so
you are going to spend a lot of money on this finding-out
process before you can make up your mind whether or not
you can produce the article.
The way costs are going up is unbelievable, and so is the
amount of legislation that we keep putting through all the
time. Things are getting to be so complicated now that,
honest to goodness, any business of any size spends about
8 or 9 per cent of all its expenses trying to f ind out what it
can do and what it cannot do.
The Senate is one place that should take the necessary
time to look at these things carefully and quietly rather
than jam them through the day after it gets them. Many of
our knowledgeable senators are not here today because we
do not ordinarily sit on Monday and Tuesday afternoons.
Some senators with practical experience who could really

help us when we are considering this type of legislation
are unable to attend when we sit at odd times. They are
active in something else; they have other things to do. All
you have to do is look around the Senate now to note how
many really active senators are absent, especially those
who do not live in Ottawa or who are not fortunate
enough to live in Montreal. How many times are they here
when we make a difficult decision? There are at least 17
senators whose opinion on this bill would be valuable, but
unfortunately they will never see it before it is passed.
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed, on
division.

LAND USE
INQUIRY-DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned
debate on the inquiry of Senator Norrie, calling the attention of the Senate to the question of land use in Canada.
Hon. Chesley W. Carter: Honourable senators, I should
like to begin by complimenting Senator Norrie on her
presentation of the inquiry now before us which directs
our attention to the question of land use in Canada. As
Senator Norrie pointed out, there is a widespread clamour
from all parts of Canada for a national land use policy,
and she is to be commended for focusing our attention on
it at this time.
Ideas and attitudes concerning land use have changed
throughout the years in accordance with the changing

SENATE DEBATES

demands of man himself upon his environment. The early
settlers used the land to provide themselves with the basic
necessities, food and shelter, and the use of the topsoil for
grains, vegetables and fruits, the forest for animals, skins
and food and trees for shelter and fuel as well as for boats
and rafts for transportation. With industrialization came a
new set of demands; industrialization needed energy and
so hydro energy needed land for its transmission and
distribution. Industry grew out of the development of our
resources; the minerals below the soil, the processing of
trees into lumber, pulp, paper and other products. The
products of industry had to be transported, which in turn
used up more land for roads, railways, terminals and other
transportation facilities.
Industrialization led to urbanization, which in turn led
to specialization whereby farmers changed from subsistence farming to commercial agriculture. Urban centres
relied upon farmers as producers of food while farmers
relied on the sale of their food products to purchase many
of the necessities that they used to make for themselves.
Incidentally, with the growth of affluence among nations,
this pattern is now being repeated on a world scale.
Economically advanced nations such as the Soviet Union
and Japan are now foremost food importers, thereby seriously affecting the food situation.

e

(1420)

Urbanization increased the demand on our land
resources. Urban life tends toward concentration and
crowding. As industrialization increased and people
became more affluent they demanded better homes, better
designs, better materials and larger housing lots for
individual families. Collectively, they demanded wider
streets and better communications with other urban centres. This meant construction of highways, airports and air
terminals, all of which required large areas of land.
Growing affluence brought the automobile within the
financial capacity of the middle class. This is turn created
the need for parking spaces outside office buildings, churches, amusement centres, supermarkets, railway stations
and airport terminals. This also greatly increased the
demand on available land. It was at this point in Canada's
development that a Special Committee of the Senate on
Land Use in Canada was appointed in 1958. The committee
submitted its final report in 1963. From the deliberations
of that committee sprang two very positive results. One
was the ARDA program, which was embodied in the
Agricultural Rural Development Act. The other was the
Canada Land Inventory. This grew out of the committee's
findings that land use in Canada was greatly limited by
topography, climate, location and difference in soil. The
committee found there were over 500 different types of
soil in Ontario alone. The Canada Land Inventory was
also given great support by the Resources for Tomorrow
Conference held in 1961. Experience with early ARDA
programs and experiments and pilot projects designed for
regional economic expansion made it apparent that without a land capability inventory, programs of land adjustments and regional economic development would be based
on judgment which, in the absence of essential information, would be fallible and costly.
As stated in CLI Report No. 1, at the top of page 2:
[Hon. Mr. Carter.]

May 7, 1974

Canada's relatively abrupt transition from a
primarily agricultural economy to a primarily urbanindustrial economy resulted in changes in land use;
further changes may be expected as new economic and
demographic changes occur. Effective planning for
change of this nature requires an information base of
the physical quality of lands and soils and the location
and quantity of each type.
Regional economic expansion, therefore, made this type
of land inventory a necessity. However, since land is
under provincial jurisdiction it could be carried out only
in conjunction with the provinces. Federal approval forthe
inventory was given in October 1963, and federal-provincial consideration of the program took place one month
later. The nature and the scope of the program were
determined by each province and carried out in full or in
part by the provinces in accordance with a specific federal-provincial agreement whereby the federal government
undertook to reimburse each province for all direct operational and staff costs incurred in the conduct of the project. On the federal side, the projects were carried out
under the aegis of the Department of Regional Economic
Expansion, but it has since been transferred to the Department of the Environment. It was not only an inventory of
land, but also a land capability inventory.
The survey was carried out and data compiled under
four headings: agriculture, forestry, recreation and wildlife, wildlife being divided into two subheadings, one dealing with wild fowl, which comes under federal jurisdiction, and the other under the heading of undulates, which
includes all animals and those birds which come under
provincial jurisdiction.
The capability of land was classified under each of those
headings, with ratings ranging from one to seven, class
one being the highest or equivalent of excellent, and class
seven signifying complete unsuitability.
The survey took into account not only the present use
being made of the land, but alternative uses and possible
multiple uses. The inventory is therefore geared to future
planning rather than land management. The various classifications had to be worked out in conjunction with the
provinces and concurred in by all of them. Much information had already been collected by the cooperative soil
survey organizations of Canada by federal and provincial
departments of forestry, parks and recreation, and from
wildlife studies.
Land use had also been the subject of study by geographers, economists, land administrators and planners.
Geographers from the federal Department of Energy,
Mines and Resources had been engaged in a program of
land use mapping since 1950 and had accelerated the
program through extensive interpretation of aerial photographs. Statistics Canada, the Economics Division of the
Department of Agriculture, and provincial statistical
agencies had been continuously compiling information on
the social and economic factors of land use.
A way was found to integrate all this information, along
with the new data from the inventory itself, so that it
could be computerized, stored, retrieved and analyzed by
electronic computers. A way was found for recalling this
information and producing it on computer-made maps.
The computer mapping technique developed by the

May 7, 1974

May 7, 1974

SENATE DEBATES
SENATE DEBATES

Canada Land Inventory will facilitate more detailed
future studies as more detailed land capability information becomes available and as socio-economic factors
change.
The Canada Land Inventory project was completed in
1971, and nine reports are available as follows:
1. Objectives, Scope and Organization
2. Soil Capability, Classifications for Agriculture
3. The Climates of Canada for Agriculture
4. Land Capability Classification for Forestry
5. The Economics of Plantation Forestry in Southern Ontario
6. Land Capability Classification for Outdoor
Recreation
7. Land Capability Classification for Wildlife
8. Soil Capability Analysis for Agriculture in Nova
Scotia
9. Land Owners and Land Use in the Tantramar
Area, New Brunswick
Coming from Newfoundland, I was particularly interested
in reports Nos. 4, 8 and 9 dealing with forestry and agriculture in the Maritime provinces.
Land capability ratings for forestry run from class 1 to
class 7. Class 1 denotes the productivity of 111 to 210 cubic
feet per acre per year, while class 7 denotes complete
unsuitability. Class 1 capability is found only in British
Columbia. Class 2 land capability has a productivity of
from 91 to 100 cubic feet per acre per year.
The report showed there were no areas of class 1 or class
2 forest land in Nova Scotia or Prince Edward Island, and
only a very little of class 2 in New Brunswick. In fact,
most forest areas in the Maritime provinces fall into the
class 4 and class 5 category, with a few small patches of
class 3. Class 3 has a productivity from 71 to 90 cubic feet
per acre per year, while class 5 has a productivity from 30
to 50 cubic f eet per acre per year.
a (1430)

As far as Newfoundland is concerned, most of the forest
land falls within class 4, although there are considerable
tracts of class 3 and even some of class 2. These latter are
mostly forests of balsam fir mixed with birch and white
spruce.
Report No. 8 deals exclusively with agriculture in Nova
Scotia. The summary appears at page viii of report No. 8,
and reads:
Nova Scotia has a land area of 13,057,000 acres. The
climate is humid temperate. Annual precipitation
ranges from 60 inches in coastal areas to about 40
inches inland; the frost-free period ranges from 160
days on the south coast to less than 60 days in a few
inland valleys.
The uplands and highlands usually have shallow,
stony soils, and rock outcrops are common. Most areas
with significant agricultural potential are found in
the lowlands, where the soils have developed on deep
tills, alluvial floodplains and fluvio-marine sediments
of tidal estuaries. Less than 25 per cent of the province
has agricultural potential under present economic
conditions.

The soils have developed under conditions of high
rainfall, a cool temperate climate, and forest vegetation. This combination of factors has favoured the
process of leaching and, as a result, most of the soils
are naturally acid and have low fertility. These conditions must be corrected before satisfactory yields of
most crops can be attained. The most widely used soils
are relatively stone free, moderately coarse textured
and freely drained. These are preferred because they
can be adapted to growing a wide range of crops. Finer
textured soils have a restricted range of use because of
inadequate drainage, low permeability or other factors. The major soils found in the provinces are podzols and luvisols, with smaller areas of regosols and
gleysols.
Areas of the province having significant acreages of
cleared farmlands with soils suitable for a wide range
of crops have been designated as multi-crop blocks.
These areas total 930,000 acres, of which about 30 per
cent is now cleared arable land.
Other areas having actual and potential use,
primarily for forage oriented agriculture, are designated as limited-use blocks. These areas total 1,911,000
acres, of which about 12 per cent is now cleared arable
land.
The remainder of the province, about 10,216,000
acres, is classed as non-agricultural
land. This area has
some potential for those types of agriculture not
dependent on an arable land base or which require
only a small acreage of good land for a viable
operation.
Three major areas, Northumberland Shore, Annapolis Valley Region, and the Cobequid Shore are deemed
to have adequate acreages of suitable soils to support
grain farming as a major enterprise. In addition, these
areas are suited to the production of small fruits,
vegetables, potatoes and forage crops, including corn
for silage. Of these three regions, only the Annapolis
Valley is considered suitable for commercial production of tree fruits.
Antigonish Shore has a largely undeveloped potential for small fruit and vegetable production. A ready
and growing market exists for these products and for
fluid milk in the Strait of Canso and Sydney industrial areas. The potential of this shore for tobacco production is under investigation.
Sydney and Yarmouth have locational advantages
which partly offset the disadvantages of poorer soils.
A ready market exists in each area for fluid milk,
small fruit, and fresh vegetables, all of which can be
produced on a commercial scale. Farmers in these
areas are next door to the potential markets of Newfoundland and Northeastern U.S.A. and would be in a
position to benefit should these markets be developed
on a large scale.
Lunenburg County is situated reasonably close to
Metropolitan Halifax-Dartmouth. Moreover, a significant acreage of this area is suitable for commercial
production of small fruits, vegetables and tree fruits.
Development of local markets, together with expanded production of these products, would seem to offer

SENATE DEBATES

the best chance for a viable agricultural industry in
this area.
Lowbush blueberries, cranberries, Christmas trees
and tobacco show promise in specific areas of the
province; the potential for expansion in these crops
should be further investigated.
That is the end of the summary on the situation in Nova
Scotia.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: There is nothing on grasshoppers
or anything like that?
Hon. Mr. Carter: They do not have grasshoppers, and
we do not have snakes in Newfoundland.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: It is too close to salt water.
Hon. Mr. Carter: The New Brunswick survey was limited to the tidal marshes of the Tantramar area at the head
of the Bay of Fundy. The principal findings of that survey
are to be found at page 30 of CLI Report No. 9, and are as
follows:
1. The Tantramar area was once one of the most
important and prosperous agricultural areas in New
Brunswick. Now, however, only 79 of the 372 interviewed landowners holding five acres or more in the
area are dependent on the sale of crop and livestock
products for their major source of income. Only 22 of
these 79 landowners reported gross farm incomes
exceeding $5,000 per annum, and they account for 80
per cent of the area's gross farm income. Eight of
these 22 owners are over 60 years of age and will soon
leave the agricultural industry. This leaves the area
with only 14 farm operators who can be considered as
having long-term viability.
Substantial inputs of capital and of management
training would be required to raise the incomes of the
other farm operations to acceptable levels. Given the
magnitude of the inputs required and the current
technological and economic conditions affecting
Canadian agriculture, it is unlikely that such allocations would prove to be economic.
2. Three groups of landowners, those who derive the
major share of their income from non-farm sources,
landowners over 60 years of age but not in commercial
owners, together
non-resident
agriculture, and
account for 82% of the landowners interviewed. They
control 58 per cent of the total acreage and 40 per cent
of the improved agricultural land reported in the landowner interviews.
3. Resource-based income is derived from farming,
forestry and fishing; however, forestry and fishing
account for less than 5 per cent of the total gross
income from resource-based activities.

accounts for nearly 82 per cent of the estimated total
net cash income earned by the landowners for all
sources. Government transfer payments alone account
for 20 per cent of total net cash income and exceed
agriculture and the other resource-based activities as
an income producer.
5. Landowner incomes tend to be very modest; only
9 per cent of the interviewed landowners have net
cash incomes exceeding $6,000 per annum, whereas 74

per cent earn less than $4,000 per annum. The nonfarmers under 60 years of age, as a group, have larger
net cash incomes than the farmers. Only 25 per cent of
the non-farmers have net cash incomes less than
$3,000 per annum in contrast to 61 per cent of the
farmers.
6. The Canada Land Inventory data indicate that
31,000 acres of cleared land are located in the study
area. However, the landowner interviews which
accounted for virtually all of the improved farm land,
revealed that there are only 19,000 acres of improved
farm land. Furthermore, a detailed survey of present
land use carried out in 1967-68 indicated that only
11,800 were used regularly for agricultural uses. These
figures indicate that a considerable portion of the
31,000 acres of cleared land in the area is idle or has
been abandoned by agriculture.
* (1440)

Paragraph 7 describes the pattern of agricultural land
use in the area, and goes on to say:
Two clearly defined agricultural nodes can be delineated on the basis of an analysis of the present
pattern of agricultural land use and the factors underlying it. These are:
(a) the Middle-Upper Sackville area,
(b) the Point de Bute area.
Together these two agricultural nodes produce threequarters of the gross farm income generated in the
Tantramar area in 1967-68.
I skip over paragraph 8, which states that fragmentation
of land holdings presents a major obstacle to the promotion of more effective use of the area's land resources. I
come to paragraph 9, which reads:
The waterfowl habitat of the Tantramar area is of
major significance, even when judged at the national
level. The marsh area contains some of the most productive waterfowl habitat in eastern Canada and is
located on a major lane of the Atlantic migratory bird
flyway.
The report goes on to say in paragraph 10:
The social and community structure of the area is in a
state of disorganization.
It concludes with a number of recommendations, but I
have not been able to find out whether any of the recommendations have been implemented.
The total land area of Canada is estimated at 2,272
million acres, of which about 68 per cent is forest. The 1956
census showed that only 184 million acres were occupied
at that time, and only 174 million acres, or 7 per cent, were
utilized for farming. The 1966 census showed 174.1 million
acres in farms, practically unchanged from a decade earlier. The 1971 census, however, showed a decrease of 2.6
per cent, down to 169.7 million acres, the first drop since
1940.
I have a table provided by Statistics Canada which
shows the decrease by provinces. If honourable senators
agree, I would ask that it be inserted in Hansard at this
point.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is that agreed, honourable
senators?

Hon. Mr. Carter: The table shows a 26 per cent increase

1971 was still only 62,704 acres, that figure has little
significance.
As Senator Norrie pointed out, many changes have
taken place in our attitudes and thinking with respect to
land use since the last Senate committee submitted ils
final report in 1963. Now we are more conscious of the
value of our resources, and the millions who die every
year of hunger and starvation have impressed upon us the
fact that soil is one of the most precious of ail our

Later Mr. Brown goes on to say that in 1961 the grain
reserves of the grain-exporting countries were enough to
feed the world for 95 days. In 1971 the figure was 51 days.
Now he says the reserves are sufficient for only 29 days.
This decline in reserves, the increase in population, which
grows by some 70 million to 75 million people a year, and
the shortage in fertilizer, mean that the world is much
more susceptible to the vagaries of changing weather
conditions.
We have become not only more conservation-minded but
more ecology-minded as well. We have become more conscious and appreciative of our environment generally and
of the interdependence of land, air, water, vegetation,
wildlif e and man himself.
Ten or twelve years ago nobody bothered much about
pollution. Now we recognize it as one of our greatest
problems. During the last decade our values have changed
somewhat and we are now beginning 10 place more value
on the quality of life rather than on more affluence. This,
in turn, has placed more emphasis on the use of land for
recreational purposes, and has raised concern about the
ownership of recreational land by non-Canadians and
absentee owners. All of this has brought home to us the
moral issue of stewardship of the land we possess and of
our duties and obligations to future generations.
A decade ago we were f ar less sensitive to urban sprawl,
and only now are we beginning to recognize what a
menace it is, and what it will lead to if allowed to go
unchecked. Maurice Strong, Executive Director of the
United Nations Environment Program, writing in the
Financial Post on May 26, 1973, stated:
Within thirty years the human race will have crossed
a fateful and astonishing historical watershed. Man
will be living for the f irst lime in a predominantly
urban planet ... We must set to work now before

ments constructed by chance and pressure, and set
fast in unyielding concrete and steel, before we have
time to know whether such settlements are really
worthy of the name of a fully human environment.
Boyce Richardson, writing in the 1973 July/September
issue of Nature Canada, said:
*

(1450)

No one can say that Canadians are not aware-in a
vague kind of way-of the dangers that lie ahead for
our cities. We know that urbanization is the dominant
trend in every country on earth, and that Canada is
one of the most urban nations of all, urbanizing at a
faster rate, almost, than any other nation. We know
that wealth alone is not enough to enable this process
to be controlled and put to the benefit of people,
because we have the evidence of the breakdown of so
many American cities. The remarkable changes that
have occurred in Canada in the last decade warn us of
what lies ahead. Is it not remarkable, then, that the
nature of the cities we are trying to build, and the
methods open to us, remain very largely undiscussed
by the Canadian public? There bas been more discussion about Quebec separatism, the British North
America Act, women's liberation, than there has been
about cities and how they are to grow. Such discussion
as there is of cities is usually negative. Indeed, for
quite understandable reasons, hatred of cities has
become a fashionable emotion. Mankind hating cities!
Could anything be more unnatural and terrible?
If it is hard to admire the job made of managing the
urban growth of Montreal or Toronto in the fifties and
sixties, how optimistic can we be when we examine
the prospect that lies ahead? The projections vary
somewhat, but to take the more conservative, we can
see that by the year 2,000-less than thirty years from
now-Montreal will grow from a population of 2,780,000 to 5,170,000, Toronto from 2,530,000 to 5,250,000,
Vancouver from a million to 1,800,000, Ottawa from
560,000 to more than a million, and Edmonton from
470,000 to more than a million. By that time, the nine
major cities, in which about nine million Canadians
now live, will contain nearly eighteen million people.
The sort of change that this population increase
implies for the physical plant of our cities hardly
bears thinking about. Montreal will have to increase
its occupied dwellings from 815,000 to 1,972,000,
Toronto from 713,000 to 1,813,000, and so on. The three
largest cities by that time will contain 40 per cent of
Canada's population, and will need four million new
housing units. Montreal and Toronto will need to add
between 400 and 650 square miles to their land areas,
and Vancouver between 125 and 250 square miles.

Honourable senators, these figures indicate the importance and the urgency of the motion before us and the
need for the greatest possible efficiency in the use of our
land resources. The Canada Land Inventory can provide
us with the data to select the most beneficial use and
indicate where multiple use is possible. In my opinion, the
quicker this inquiry gets underway the better for Canada,

ADJOURNMENT
Hon. Leopold Langlois: Honourable senators, I move,
with leave of the Senate and notwithstanding rule
45(1)(g), that when the Senate adjourns today it do stand
adjourned until Tuesday, May 21, 1974, at 8 o'clock in the
evening.
Hon. Mr. Choquette: You are skipping a week, aren't
you?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: You shouldn't complain.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, it is moved
by the Honourable Senator Langlois, with leave of the
Senate and notwithstanding rule 45(1) (g), that when the
Senate adjourns today it do stand adjourned until Tuesday, May 21, 1974, at 8 o'clock in the evening. Is it your
pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?
Sorne Hon. Senators: On division.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, we cannot adopt
a motion like that blindfolded. We should have an explanation from the Acting Leader of the Government.
Hon. Mr. Argue: We should have a vote.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, this motion
speaks for itself. It is an adjournment of two weeks from
today. I might say that this is the first time the Leader of
the Opposition has complained about an unusual
adjournment.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Well, it is the first time that we have
had an unusual adjournment.
Honourable senators, despite the clarity of the statement just made by the acting leader, I cannot understand
the motion. We were here on Friday "just in case"; we
were here on Monday "just in case"; we were here yesterday "just in case" and we are here today "just in case." I
do not see why we should not be here tomorrow "just in

Hon. Mr. Langlois: I should remind the Leader of the
Opposition that these adjournments are always subject to
recall.
Hon. Mr. Argue: I cannot see the purpose of this motion.
Hon. Mr. Bourget: You, too?
Hon. Mr. Argue: I think it is a little silly. It makes the
Senate look silly, because the Senate is saying that if the
government is sustained the Senate is going to have a
two-week adjournment. I think that at the conclusion of
our sitting today we should have an ordinary motion to
adjourn until tomorrow and just let events over in the
other place take care of themselves. We do not have to
bring in motions like this, which are basically
meaningless.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: We have received complaints in the
past that we were recalling the Senate unnecessarily"just in case," as the Leader of the Opposition has just
said. But the Leader of the Opposition and my honourable
friend Senator Argue should recognize that if the government stays in power after tonight, the House of Commons
will debate the budget, with the result that we will not
receive any legislation for quite some time. This motion is
made in the light of these circumstances. I do not know
why the senator calls it silly. Does he want to remain here
for nothing?
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh!
Hon. Mr. Langlois: May I finish, please? If any legislation should come to us from the other place, the Senate
will be recalled. As I have already explained, these
motions to adjourn are always made on the understanding
that the Senate is subject to recall. There is nothing
abnormal about it.
Motion agreed to.

SENATE DEBATES
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Larnontagne: Honourable senators, a notice
was circulated yesterday that there would be a meeting of
the Committee on Science Policy when we adjourned
today. I wish to announce that this meeting has been
postponed, because I think that even the members of the
committee will be more interested in the events of today
than those of the long-term future. I might, though, propose a meeting of the committee tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Tomorrow? Can it be held tomorrow if
the fears of my honourable friend prove right?
Hon. Mr. Larnontagne: As I said, "I might".
Hon. Mr. Bourget: In case!
Hon. Mr. Argue: Honourable senators, I wonder if I
might ask a question for clarification. A number of committees are scheduled for tomorrow. Does the motion we
passed mean that there will be no committee meetings
tomorrow?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Unless they have permission to sit
when the Senate is not sitting.
Hon. Mr. Argue: Why wipe out the committee meetings?
There is lots for them to do tomorrow morning.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: The point made by Senator Argue is
worth considering. If we do not sit tomorrow, the committees which were scheduled to meet tomorrow will not be
able to sit unless permission has already been given, and I
do not know that it has. I should like the Acting Leader of
the Government to clarify this, because even if what is
expected happens tonight, dissolution may take place only
at 12 noon tomorrow, or something like that. In the meantime the committees will not know whether they will able
to sit regularly.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, I am in the
position that I am damned if I do and damned if I don't.
The usual complaint is that we recall the Senate too often.
Hon. Mr. Argue: But we are here now.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: My honourable friend the Leader of
the Opposition and his colleague Senator Beaubien have
voiced criticism in the past because the Senate was asked
to come here when there was no legislative work for it to
do. There is no legislative work for the chamber tomorrow,
but a few committees were scheduled to meet. If a committee wants to meet tomorrow morning, all its chairman has
to do is introduce a motion this afternoon requesting
permission to sit while the Senate is not sitting. It is as
easy as that. In any case, may I point out that the motion
has been passed, and any debate now is completely out of
order.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It is a question of trying to help
senators know where they are going and what may be
expected of them.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Apparently a few do not know
where they are going.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I am looking at the majority now.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: You are not the majority yet.

LAND USE
INQUIRY-DEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from yesterday the adjourned
debate on the inquiry of Senator Norrie, calling the attention of the Senate to the question of land use in Canada.
Hon. Frederick Williarn Rowe: Honourable senators, I
have just a few comments to make on this inquiry, but I
would not want anybody to think the fact that I shall be
speaking briefly on it is in any way indicative of a lack of
appreciation of the importance of the subject. In my view
it is extremely important, and I congratulate my colleague
and seat-mate, Senator Norrie, for her initiative in drawing this to our attention. I congratulate also the other
speakers who have made contributions to this particular
debate.
There are one or two other facts that we need to keep
reminding ourselves of in this connection. I recall the
story of Mark Twain-and here I am speaking from memory-who, when somebody asked him what would be a good
investment, replied, "The best investment is, of course,
land." When asked why, he said, "Haven't you heard that
they stopped making land some time ago?" We have to
keep reminding ourselves of this, especially here in
Canada. We have a great geographical expanse, an awful
lot of land, but relatively few people-22 million Canadians live on one of the greatest land masses in the worldand therefore we are inclined to think we can be profligate
with our land, that we do not have to worry too much
about using land for this particular airport or that particular highway. This is a fallacy, honourable senators, and a
very dangerous fallacy.
I suggest we need to remind ourselves over and over
again that land is finite. Whether it be in China or in
Canada, the amount of land available is strictly finite,
and, so far, mankind has not shown any great ingenuity in
increasing the amount of land available. Once land has
been turned into an airport, a residential area or a highway, then it has for all practical purposes been rendered
useless for anything else; the changeover is almost
permanent.
I was interested in the excellent contribution that my
honourable colleague Senator Carter made yesterday to
this debate. He made some references to his and my native
province, Newfoundland. One fallacy we sometimes run
up against is that there is no agricultural land in Newfoundland. This is a fallacy which is easy to understand,
because if you travel around the coast of Newfoundland,
or fly over the province at 39,000 feet and look down on it,
as I did only two days ago, you receive the impression that
there is not very much agricultural land around. Relatively, compared with some other parts of Canada, we do not
have a great deal of agricultural land. However, we do
have some, but the very fact that, relatively, we have less
than, say, southern Ontario, enhances its importance.
I had responsibility for the building of 65 per cent of the
Trans-Canada Highway in Newfoundland, that great high-

May 8, 1974

SENATE DEBA TES
SENATE DEBATES

way which runs in a semi-circle from St. John's right up
north, across to the west coast and down to Port aux
Basques-nearly 600 miles of it. I am not a zealot in this
matter, but it used almost to break my heart to see the
amount of good agricultural land that was destroyed in
the building of that highway. Some of that destruction
was inevitable if we were to have a highway, but in some
instances that was not so and not enough care was taken. I
am reminded of the old dictum, that war is too important
to be left to generals. The building of highways and airports is too important to be lef t to engineers.
Again and again I have seen instances of highways
being built through good agricultural land because the
engineers said that that was the route the highway should
follow. The highway should not have followed that route
at all. I can give a simple example. Near where we have
our little place in the country we had to build a five-mile
access road. Senator Carter and other Newfoundlanders
will remember this. It is in the Foxtrap area, and the road
is known as the Foxtrap access road. It is only five miles,
but, when it was pushed through, many acres of lovely
agricultural land were destroyed. No one gave it a second
thought, and the land is now gone. We do not have that
much agricultural land in Newfoundland that we can
afford to be so extravagant and nonchalant about it-and
we do not have that much in Canada, either.
I offer another example-a personal one. In the 1940s
when I was at the University of Toronto we built a home
in northwest Toronto near Eglinton Avenue West, which
was then on the outskirts. I would suspect that that house
today is in the geographical centre of the city of Toronto.
All the land in that area was agricultural, and it has all
gone-thousands and thousands of acres of it.
During the last few years the Newfoundland government and the Government of Canada, with most of the
money coming from the federal treasury, have been building an arterial road into St. John's. That arterial road
comes in through the Waterford River Valley, and it has
destroyed hundreds of acres of agricultural land. We had
to have an arterial road coming into St. John's in addition
to the existing roads, but I am not so sure, that we had to
have it where it is now. That means that while we benefit
in sorne ways from an arterial road, Newfoundland is
made all the poorer by the fact that that good land has
been lost.
Allow me to make the point that the reason why more
agricultural land is not utilized in Newfoundland is not
that there is no agricultural land or that it is not good
agricultural land; it is that vegetable growing, as in Prince
Edward Island, is not always economic. That is the simple
reason.
In our little place in the country we grow 20 different
vegetables, solely for our own use. They are as good as any
vegetables grown anywhere in Canada. But I could not
produce pumpkins in competition with southern Ontario,
because it costs me much more to produce them in Newfoundland that it would if I were living in southern
Ontario. However, the land is there.

cannot afford to destroy even marginal agricultural land,
because what is uneconomic and marginal today may very
well be economic in 10, 15 or 20 years' time. We see that
phenomenon time and time again.
What Thomas Malthus had to say about that 200 years
ago is still true today. The production of food increases
arithmetically, while the population increases geometrically. So far all birth control methods and propaganda
have been unavailing. They have not been effective in
putting a brake on the population explosion which bas
taken place all over the world, including Canada.
While we may not need the land in our time, our grandchildren will need all the land that is available.
I have one other thought to express before I finish. As I
mentioned, an arterial road is being built into St. John's
through the Waterford Valley to join up with the TransCanada Highway approximately 15 or 20 miles out of St.
John's. The route is a beautiful one. A four-lane highway
is planned with a boulevard in the centre. It is a straight
road with a cloverleaf interchange, excellent shoulders,
and so on. Without any doubt, it is a magnificent piece of
engineering, and the road will be utilized. That road runs
parallel to the Canadian National Railway line over which
not one passenger has travelled in the last seven or eight
years, because the passenger service in Newfoundland has
been discontinued. It has been discontinued for the same
reason that it has been discontinued in other parts of
Canada, because the CNR-I speak with conviction on
this-has deliberately and systematically downgraded the
passenger service to the extent that people have lost their
desire to travel by train.
On the one hand we have the spectacle of a great arterial
road which has already cost $30 million. If that sum had
been applied to upgrading the CNR line, which runs from
St. John's parallel to the arterial road, we could have had a
wide gauge railway without a single curve or grade, carrying trains at a speed of 100 miles per hour or even better.
I find the situation extraordinary and fantastic. I have
travelled on trains all over Europe, some of which travel at
more than 100 miles per hour. There is no reason in the
world why we should not have right here, between Ottawa
and Montreal, and between Ottawa and Toronto, modern
high speed trains which can carry tens of thousands of
passengers back and forth between those centres at speeds
of 100 to 120 miles per hour. If we had such train services,
then obviously fewer people would use the airlines and
highways. I suggest that this is a matter which should
receive serious consideration.
Far from being outmoded relics of the past, railways
should increasingly become an important means of transport of the future. The routes exist. The railroad in Newfoundland already exists. In upgrading it we would lose
some 25 acres of land, whereas the construction of the
arterial road has already destroyed hundreds of acres of
good land, as bas the construction of the Trans-Canada
Highway, and every road and airport we have to build. I
suggest-

Hon. Mr. Buckwold: Would the honourable senator
permit a question? Is he suggesting that by improving rail
passenger service we would eliminate the demand for land
for highways?

I cite that example to emphasize the fact that we cannot
afford to destroy good agricultural land, whether it be in
Newfoundland, southern Ontario or anywhere else. We

SENATE DEBATES

Hon. Mr. Rowe: What I am saying is that if instead of
having 50 million people travelling over a certain highway
route in a given period of time you have, in one way or
another, 100 million, that will necessitate that much more
in the way of highway services. I am sure my honourable
friend is familiar with what has happened in Japan. Had
they not upgraded their railway systems there would have
been chaos now. Had they not utilized the railways available to them, every square inch of the country would have
been taken up by highways and airports by this time. The
same thing applies throughout Europe, where increasingly
they are utilizing their railway systems.
What I am suggesting is that rather than downgrading
the passenger services already available, those services
should be upgraded. A program aimed at upgrading the
roadbeds and equipment would entail the spending of a
good deal of money-in the long run perhaps several
billions of dollars. But this would be a good investment if,
in so doing, we prevented the destruction of that irreplaceable asset, good land. I say "irreplaceable asset," because
no one knows how to increase the amount of land which
man has at his disposal at this particular time. On some
future occasion I should like to develop the theme a little
further.
I do not make these remarks in any sense of recrimination. I am not blaming any particular government for what
the CNR has done. I think what the CNR has done,
regardless of who is responsible, is reprehensible; I think
it is wrong. What the CNR has done with respect to its
passenger services is having a detrimental effect on
Canada, and I feel, if we are to protect our heritage, we
should be insisting that our railway services be upgraded
to the point where a significant proportion of the travelling public will not only be encouraged but will feel it
necessary to use those railway systems as opposed to
relying on motor vehicles and airplanes.
Hon. Mr. Carneron: What about the CPR?
Hon. Mr. Rowe: I have referred to the CNR in making
my remarks because that is the one with which we have
the most dealings. What I have said about the CNR applies
to the CPR. I have not done a great deal of travelling in
Western Canada in recent years, but I have noticed a
decline in the quality of the CPR's service.
To give just one illustration of that, very often my wife
and I would go to Montreal on business trips, and whenever we found ourselves with three or four days at our
disposal after our business was concluded, we would take
the overnight train to New York. We would get on the
train in Montreal at 11.30 p.m., go to bed, and wake up in
Grand Central Station at 8 o'clock the next morning. It
was a convenient and relatively cheap way of travelling to
New York, because we also saved the expense of hotel
accommodation for one night. Until our last two trips, the
service had been very good. However, on our last two trips
the service was so deplorable, everything about it was so
bad, that we said, quite deliberately, "This is it; never
again," and for the last five years we have not taken that
trip. We would not even think of taking a train to New
York now because the service is so bad.
What has happened on that run is happening throughout
Canada and, needless to say, throughout the whole of the
United States. Onlv now have the Americans come to
(Hon. Mr. Buckwold.]

May 8, 1974

realize, to their regret, that they should not have allowed
it to happen. The Americans now have to retrace their
steps. There is no doubt at all in my mind that the United
States is going to have to spend tens of billions of dollars
over the next 10, 15, or 20 years to resurrect the railway
passenger services.

Motion agreed to.
NATIONAL FINANCE
INFORMATION CANADA-CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF
COMMITTEE-DEBATE CONTINUED

On the Order:
Resuming the debate on the consideration of the
Report of the Standing Senate Committee on National
Finance on Information Canada, tabled in the Senate
on Tuesday, April 30, 1974.-(Honourable Senator
Langlois).
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, this order
stands in my name but I would be pleased to yield to
Senator Robichaud.
The Hon. the Speaker: Has the Honourable Senator
Robichaud leave to proceed instead of the Honourable
Senator Langlois?
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Louis-J. Robichaud: Honourable senators, occasionally we read in the press or hear on television that
there is little life in the Senate. Those who are critical of
the Senate should have been here a few minutes ago to
hear the debate between the Acting Leader of the Government, the Leader of the Opposition and Senator Argue on
an important motion respecting the adjournment. It was a
lively debate and one worth listening to by anybody,
particularly those who are critical of this institution.
My remarks this afternoon will not be lengthy. I shall
speak only on the report of the Standing Senate Committee on National Finance that is before us. Following my
remarks in opening, let me add that if those who are
critical of this institution were to follow the activities of
senators, they would realize that we are often called upon
to be in two or three places at the same time, because there
are so many things going on. For example, there are th(
activities of our various committees, which perform excellent work for all of Canada. An example of that is the
report of our National Finance Committee on Information
Canada. I do not suppose I should come to the rescue of
this committee, because I am a Johnny-come-lately
member of it. I have attended only one or two meetings,
since I am a newcomer to this institution. However, I
support this report, which is extremely well prepared,
almost in its entirety. I did not have the good fortune to
attend the numerous meetings held by the committee. I
did not even read all the reports of the evidence submitted

May 8, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

to the committee, but I believe that in essence this is an
extremely good report and that it will result in an
improvement to the operation of Information Canada.
Let me say at once that I believe in Information Canada,
regardless of what anyone in this country might say to the
contrary. I know that some people are opposed to even the
concept of Information Canada. I should like at this point
to establish a parallel between a situation that existed
some years ago in my province and that which existed for
many years in the country as a whole. Until the mid-sixties there was no such service in my province. There was
no such service in Canada until, I believe, 1970. It has now
been created.
When such a service was created in New Brunswick for
the purpose of diffusing information, not political propaganda, I and my party were accused of creating an instrument that would disseminate political propaganda. We
were blamed for it. We created the service regardless. It
has expanded over the years. It is still in operation, and a
different political party is taking advantage of it, diffusing information, not political propaganda, and I would be
the last one to oppose what we then called the Central
Information Bureau in New Brunswick.
The same is true of Information Canada. There is opposition in some quarters because it is said to be an agency
that uses its facilities for spreading 'political ideas or
political propaganda. I do not believe this to be the case. If
the political party that at the present time opposes Information Canada should, maybe 10 or 20 years from now,
form the government of this country, I am sure they would
retain Information Canada, maybe in a different form,
maybe functioning differently, and maybe by making
some changes. Some changes, and good changes, are
recommended in this report. Information Canada is not
perfect, but it is an agency that is essential to the people of
Canada. I believe that as much information as possible
should be given to the Canadian people.
I listened with great interest to the speech made the
other day by the Leader of the Government in the Senate
supporting the recommendations in this report. I also
listened with deep interest to my distinguishd and
esteemed friend Senator O'Leary. I usually agree with
Senator O'Leary, but in this instance I cannot agree with
him. At one point he complained that he has on his desk
such a pile of documents and papers that he cannot read
them all. I took it from what he said that all the documents delivered to him emanated from Information
Canada. This morning I picked up my mail from the
mailbox and found that I had, excluding the correspondence, a total of 32 documents; the mailbox was full. I
checked them, but not one of them came from Information
Canada. They all came from various departments of government, but not from Information Canada.
Information Canada rarely issues or distributes communiqués. For books, booklets and federal documents,
Information Canada is only the publisher, not the distributor. Maybe they should distribute more information
throughout the country, because I believe the people in a
free country such as ours should be informed. I believe, as
Senator O'Leary does, in a free press. I believe in freedom
of speech. I believe that people, whether they live in the
Northwest Territories, New Brunswick or Prince Edward

Island, whether they live in the country or in urban areas,
are just as much entitled to information about what is
going on in the country as are professional people who are
supposed to know practically everything. Even professional people, such as lawyers, engineers and doctors very
often do not always know what is going on. We should
make recommendations for the improvement of the operations of Information Canada. Instead of abolishing it we
should expand it and make sure that everyone in the
country has access to all the information possible, be they
rural or urban people.
There are so many things that could be said about it. I
have certain reservations though concerning the recommendations of the committee, to which I have signed my
name, concerning the mobile information officers. As
Senator O'Leary pointed out the other day, one of the
conclusions of our committee is that the mobile information officer program appears to the committee to have
developed into a social welfare service. And that is a
situation which somehow or other must be corrected.
*

(1440)

We have all been politicians. We are politicians. We all
know what those people were trying to do and what they
were trying to accomplish with this mobile information
officer plan; but today they are abusing it. For example,
not that long ago I had a long-distance telephone call at 2
o'clock in the morning from someone wanting to know
how come his neighbour paid only $2 for a dog licence
when he had to pay $2.50. A long distance call!
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: Was it collect?
Hon. Mr. Robichaud: And I had to answer it at 2 o'clock
in the morning. The simple answer was, of course, that one
dog was a male and the other was a female. Well, I am sure
that these mobile information officers have to face that
same sort of situation once in a while. Maybe it is the price
we have to pay for being public servants.
In any event, I am not going to say I am either in f avour
of or against the mobile information officer plan. I have
not studied it thoroughly enough to do so. Although I have
my reservations about this particular point, I do subscribe
to the rest of the content of the report and I fully support
it, and I hope that the Senate will support all of the
recommendations of the committee with respect to Information Canada.
On motion of Senator Buckwold, debate adjourned.
SCIENCE POLICY
SPECIAL COMMITTEE AUTHORIZED TO MEET DURING
ADJOURNMENTS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Leopold Langlois, with leave of the Senate and
notw,ahstanding rule 45(1) (h), moved:
That the Special Committee of the Senate on
Science Policy have power to sit during adjournments
of the Senate.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it your pleasure, honourable
senators, to adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, in view of the
important program of this committee, can either the chairman of the committee or the Acting Leader of the Govern-

SENATE DEBATES

ment indicate whether any measures are contemplated to
enable the committee to function between Parliaments as
well as during adjournments of the Senate? In other
words, what will happen to the work of the committee if
Parliament is dissolved?
Hon. Mr. Larnontagne: You mean, "just in case."
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Yes. I am asking it "just in case." What
will happen to the program of this committee, which is not
of a legislative nature? I realize this is a rather difficult
question, but perhaps we could have some views on it now.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: I am not an expert on this
subject.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: This situation is covered by the
Senate resolution of March 29, 1972, as contained in the
Senate Journals, 1972, at page 98, which reads as follows:
That, during any period between sessions of Parliament or between Parliaments, the Leader of the Government in the Senate and a Senator to be named by
him from time to time and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, or a Senator to be named by him
from time to time, be authorized to act for and on
behalf of the Senate in all matters relating to the
internal economy of the Senate; and
That within fifteen days of the commencement of
the next ensuing session there shall be laid on the
Table, by or on behalf of the Leader of the Government ir the Senate, a report covering in reasonable
detail all matters relating to the internal economy of
the Senate arising during any such period.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: If you want to give to that motion the
widest interpretation possible, Senator Langlois, it could, I
suppose, be considered as covering activities such as that
which Senator Goldenberg will be dealing with in a few
moments. But I am quite doubtful that it would cover, or
extend to, the sittings of committees between Parliaments.
The publication of a report is one thing; the sitting of a
committee is quite another.
If Senator Langlois suggests that this resolution which
was adopted by the Senate in 1972 would cover the sittings
of committees, I might be willing to accept that, because I
am inclined to think that this should be the case, but at
the same time in my opinion there is no legislation and no
precedent to cover the situation.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, I had occasion
this morning to advise the Leader of the Opposition that
tomorrow morning there will be a meeting of the leaders
of this house and members of the Internal Economy Committee to consider decisions that will have to be taken
during the interim, and I am told that this particular
resolution is the authority for that.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I agree with that, but, important as the
work of the Science Policy Committee may be, I doubt
that the Leader of the Government and the Leader of the
Opposition should be acting without some kind of general
mandate from the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Molson: May I ask the acting leader if it is
contemplated that a committee could meet after dissolution of Parliament?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I doubt it.
[Hon. Mr. Flynn.]

May 8, 1974

Hon. Mr. Langlois: I think it is contemplated. I am not
the chairman of the committee. I do not know what Senator Lamontagne has in mind. Perhaps he should explain
what he intends to do.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: Honourable senators, my previous remarks about the possibility of having a meeting
tomorrow were simply to offset the worries of the Leader
of the Opposition. It was "just in case," that I was saying
we might have a meeting tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: In other words, if there were no dissolution. Of course, if there is no dissolution there is no
problem.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: As I indicated before, I am not
an expert on the rules, but I have had to face this situation
twice before so far as my committee is concerned. From
past experience, and from what I have been told by members of the interim Internal Economy Committee and by
our legal adviser, it is my understanding that committees
die with Parliament. It is an awkward position to be in,
but that is the fact.
Hon. Mr. Molson: That is my understanding. That is
why I asked the question. Up until dissolution all is fine,
but if there is dissolution then the committee ceases.
Hon. Mr. Larnontagne: It merely means that the former
chairman of a dead committee continues to work.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I can see that. Perhaps Senator Lamontagne could tell us whether the Science Policy Committee
met during the period of dissolution in 1972.
Hon. Mr. Larnontagne: No.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: But I understand that the chairman
himself continued to work. For that, praise to him.
Motion agreed to.

LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS
AUTHORITY TO PUBLISH AND DISTRIBUTE REPORT ON THE
PAROLE SYSTEM IN CANADA

Hon. H. Carl Goldenberg, with leave of the Senate and
notwithstanding rule 45(1) (h), moved:
That the honourable senators authorized to act for
and on behalf of the Senate in all matters relating to
the internal economy of the Senate during any period
between sessions of Parliament or between Parliaments be authorized to publish and distribute the
Report of the Standing Senate Committee on Legal
and Constitutional Affairs on the parole system in
Canada.

(1450)

He said: Perhaps a word of explanation would be in
order. The draft report has now been approved by the full
committee. The translation is well under way; indeed I am
advised that the first version of the translation is ready
now. The question is this: Should we hold it up until
Parliament meets again, assuming dissolution, in the fall,
or should we be able to distribute it as soon as it is printed,
which will be sometime in June? My own suggestion is
that the public will be well served if the rePort is not held

May 8, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

up until the fall, and is distributed in the interval. That is
the whole purpose of my motion.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, I merely want to
point out that this motion gives specific authority to the
special committee that my honourable friend Senator Langlois has been referring to. In fact, it clarifies the powers
of that committee in this particular instance.
I was just wondering, although probably it is too late
now, whether the mandate of this committee should not be
clarified to cover situations such as this or situations like
the one which is being faced by the committee chaired by
Senator Lamontagne. I can well understand that a committee of the Senate dealing with any legislation-for
instance, the Banking, Trade and Commerce, which is
considering the subject matter of the Combines Investigation Act-should not continue to sit, because we do not
know whether that bill will ever come before us. That is a
legislative matter, but investigations, like the one by
Senator Lamontagne's committee that has been referred
to, can on some occasions-not during the election campaign, but at least after the election and during the period
before Parliament has reconvened-be continued with
excellent results.
I was trying to find a formula by which this could be
achieved without violating the written Constitution. It
would not really violate the written Constitution, because
there is nothing in the written Constitution about that.
Only usage and tradition cover such circumstances.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Let us establish the practice, then.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: We were trying to solve the problem
faced by Senator Goldenberg, and I was trying to help
Senator Lamontagne to go ahead with his work.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: I must say that if this is feasible
I would be delighted, but I was told on two previous
occasions that it could not be done. Perhaps with some
kind of agreement here, what was impossible up to now
could become possible.
Hon. Mr. Molson: Honourable senators, I would like to
ask the Chairman of the Legal and Constitutional Af f airs
Committee what this means in the way of procedure. To
begin with, I agree that there should not be this delay.
That committee's report is a report to the Senate, but it is
going to be published and some months later, presumably,
it will be presented to the Senate in the normal way. Is it
correct to say it will be published for information purposes only, and will not have the weight of having been
submitted and accepted or approved?
Hon. Mr. Goldenberg: That is correct. I assume that the
chairman of the committee will table the report shortly
after the opening, and we will then debate it in the usual
way.
Motion agreed to.
HONOURABLE H. CARL GOLDENBERG
FELICITATIONS ON HONORARY DEGREE
Hon. Sidney L. Buckwold: Honourable senators, yester-

day we had the privilege of congratulating Madam Speaker on her receiving an honorary degree, with another one
to be conferred this weekend. I should like now to draw to

the attention of the Senate another member of this chamber who is being so honoured. I refer to the Chairman of
the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, Senator Goldenberg, who is to be given an
honorary degree by the University of British Columbia.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: I am sure this is just one more
indication of the high esteem in which Senator Goldenberg is held by the people of Canada.

STANDING RULES AND ORDERS
COMMITTEE MEETING CANCELLED

Hon. Mr. Molson: Honourable senators, before the
adjournment I should like to say that despite the discussions which have taken place about meetings of committees, the meeting of the Standing Committee on Standing
Rules and Orders scheduled for tomorrow morning will
not, in view of the peculiar circumstances of the day, be
held.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Caneron: Honourable senators, there is a
meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee scheduled for
this evening, and I notice that neither the chairman nor
the vice-chairman is here. Is the meeting going ahead at 8
o'clock as scheduled?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: The chairman is not here.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Will he not be here today?
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I do not know.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: As far as I know, the meeting will
be held. There has been no indication otherwise. I might
say that this particular committee has authority to meet,
by resolution of the Senate, at times when the Senate is
not sitting, other than between Parliaments.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: But tonight there is no problem,
because the Senate is sitting today.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: Honourable senators, do I
understand that at its meeting tomorrow the Internal
Economy Committee will take up the suggestion that has
been made by the Leader of the Opposition?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: It might be too late.
Hon. Mr. Lamontagne: Well, the subcommittee will
have to meet anyway.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: I know, but this is the problem. I do not
know whether honourable senators would agree, but I was
just thinking that it might be a good thing to adjourn until
5 o'clock and consider whether we should enlarge on that
motion. Does the acting leader believe that would be
useful? If he does, all well and good; otherwise, we will
proceed with the authority that has already been given by
the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I cannot do otherwise than abide by
the advice I have received. I am told we have this authority, and I do not see how the Senate could change that.

SENATE DEBATES

If we do not have the constitutional right to do that, the
Senate cannot change it. We would need a resolution of
both houses for that, and I think the time would be quite
inappropriate to try to get the assent of the other bouse to
a resolution of that kind.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: You do not need the authority of the
other house for a resolution of that kind. The one adopted
in 1972 was adopted by the Senate, not by the other place.
We have no act in which is provided authority similar to
that of the Speaker of the House of Commons during the
period of dissolution. We have nothing like that here. We
have proceeded on precedents, and the opinion of the legal
advisers of the Senate is that we can do that on the basis
of practice. What I am saying is that the authority given in
this resolution, which was passed in 1972, could possibly
be widened in order to cover a problem like the one faced
by the Science Policy Committee. It may be asking too
much, of course, to try to settle this problem this afternoon. I am merely suggesting it and putting it on the
record so that honourable senators may note it, and then
we can, perhaps later, do our best to permit the continuation of certain activities that might usefully continue
between Parliaments.
Hon. Mr. Hicks: Honourable senators, may I say a word
on this? I can see that it may be difficult to extend the
kind of authority which was given in the 1972 resolution,
for a specific purpose, to cover such things as the meeting
of the Special Committee on Science Policy in the interval
between Parliaments in the event that there is dissolution, but surely it is unfortunate that we find ourselves
debating this issue, and trying to find a way to do this, in
what many honourable senators believe to be the dying
hours of this 29th Parliament.
Would it not be wise for us to refer this whole question
to the Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in
this session of Parliament, if possible, or, if not, in the
next session of Parliament, so that a general formula could
be arrived at and agreed to, which would enable the
Senate to carry on these kinds of activities in periods of
dissolution and between Parliaments? It seems to me that
the Senate, with the relative permanence of its membership, ought to be able to provide the Canadian people with
these services between Parliaments.

e

(1500)

Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, there is not
much that I can add to what I have already said, except
that I do not think the problem is all that serious. What
Senator Lamontagne is asking for is leave te sit tomorrow.
That is the only problem. I do not know what time dissolution will take place tomorrow, if it is to take place. Furthermore, I do not think we need to go into that problem
at this stage.
On the other hand, I am told that this authority which
was given in 1972 is not limited as to time, and is still
applicable. If this authority is not sufficient, then I do not
know how we can handle the situation except by getting a
resolution of the two Houses of Parliament to amend the
power to sit during dissolution. As I said, I cannot see how
we can reasonably expect to secure such a resolution as
this item having regard to the state of affairs in which we
are living today. But, as I have said-and I have to repeat
it-I
have to go by the advice I have received, and I am

[Hon. Mr.

Langlois.]

May 8, 1974

told that we have sufficient authority to do what is suggested should be done.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Honourable senators, I agree that the
only point raised by the motion is whether Senator
Lamontagne's committee can sit tomorrow if Parliament
bas not been dissolved. That is all right, because even if
the Senate is not sitting the committee can still sit. But
the problem I have raised, because it is consequential, is
whether the membership of the committee can continue
their work after dissolution.
If the resolution adopted in 1972 is valid, even though it
is not based on legislation-and I would like to point this
out to my friend, Senator Molson, who appears to be
rather doubtful about what I am saying-then a resolution
giving wider powers to this special committee would
equally be valid. The ideal solution, of course, would be
legislation to provide for that very situation. Such legislation has been considered. We have had counsel look into
the matter, and we have had bills drafted, but they have
never found their way before us or the other place.
I further point out to Senator Langlois that the resolution passed in 1972 was not accepted by the other place,
and that a resolution widening or clarifying the powers of
this committee need not receive the approval of the other
place.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, in my
opinion this debate is completely out of order because
there is nothing before the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: But it bas been useful.
The Hon. the Speaker: It is very important, I admit, and
that is why I did not interrupt, but I think that all the
good that is to be got out of this discussion has now been
secured, and I think we should proceed with the business
of the Senate.
I now call for Motions.
ADJOURNMENT
Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, I move the
adjournrment of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Prowse: Do we adjourn to a specific date?
Hon. Mr. Flynn: The motion bas already been agreed to.
The Hon. the Speaker: It is moved by the Honourable
Senator Langlois, seconded by the Honourable Senator
Bourget, that the Senate do now adjourn. This is not a
debatable motion.
Hon. Mr. Prowse: But do we adjourn to a specific date?
The Hon. the Speaker: The date is Tuesday, May 21, and
that motion has already been agreed to.
Hon. Mr. Flynn: Senator Prowse is asking leave to

Hon. Mr. Prowse: The situation is that there was a
motion which was agreed to rather quickly, and I thought
we might get a chance to speak to it on the adjournment.
It is my view that that motion should be amended.

May 8, 1974

SENATE DEBATES

I am not pessimistic, and I am not particularly optimistic either, but I can see no purpose at all in adjourning
today until the 21st. I say this because in my view nobody
has given any thought to the fact that the 20th is a
holiday, and normally we would be spending the holiday
with our families. I am thinking rather of their convenience than for our own. We have little enough time with
our families, particularly those of us who come from a
long distance. It is all right for those who have to travel
only short distances because they can leave home in the
morning of May 21 and be here in time for the sitting of
the Senate at 8 o'clock in the evening, but that is of no
convenience whatever to those of us who have to leave the
day before to get here for an 8 o'clock sitting.
If we adjourn today until May 21, the whole thing
becomes a nullity if the pessimists are right and this
Parliament is dissolved. On the other hand, if that should
not happen, it means we shall have to go through the
motion of notifying every senator by telegram that he is
required here at an earlier date, presumably tomorrow.
Regardless of what happens, and even if there should be
dissolution, there will be caucus meetings tomorrow morning at 11 o'clock, and I do not think any member of this
chamber or of the other place is planning to leave Ottawa
this evening. So, nobody would be disadvantaged if,
instead of adjourning until May 21, we merely adjourned
until 2 o'clock tomorrow afternoon in the ordinary way. At
that time we can meet and adjourn for whatever period
seems appropriate, or it might not be necessary for us to be
here at all.
Therefore, honourable senators, I suggest that the
motion be resubmitted and reconsidered so that it can be
amended to provide that we adjourn in the normal way.

Hon. Mr. Buckwold: Honourable senators, this debate
may be out of order. I am not sure, but I wish to say that
earlier in the session we endeavoured to indicate to members of this chamber that we would meet regularly for as
long as necessary. At times when there was no work
before the Senate, members would not have to be in
attendance. For this reason we changed the routine of the
Senate so that on occasions we met on Monday and Friday,
as we did last week, in order to compensate for the fact
that there would be times, because there was no legislative
program, that we would not ask members to return.
There is nothing on the Clerk's Scroll for tomorrow, and
no speakers scheduled. In normal circumstances the
budget debate in the other place would proceed for some
days. It is most unlikely there will be a legislative program brought forward next week. The Senate could be
recalled if urgent matters arise, but in normal circumstances it would be quite logical, regardless of this spectre
of dissolution, that the Senate not meet next week because
of the fact that we have no legislative program before us.
This is the idea behind the motion of adjournment that
was presented by the acting leader. It was made to meet
the demands of senators generally who have said "When
we have work to do let us work and let us work hard and
long, but when we do not have work to do it is not
necessary for us to be here just to go through the
motions."

Hon. Mr. McElrnan: Honourable senators, I fully support the proposition of Senator Prowse. I think that we
have been quite precipitate in giving notice of adjournment to May 21.
We have in this house some who are excellent in prognostication, and some are suggesting that the events that
others think will happen, will, in fact, not happen. In any
event, nobody knows what is going to happen. There are
those in another place who say they are prepared to carry
on, while there are others who say that they are not, and
still others who are saying they will defect from their
party on this. In any event, it is a "come-all-ye," and
nobody knows what is going to happen.
Furthermore, by our rules-and Senator O'Leary will
support me on this, I am sure-we are not supposed to take
any cognizance of what is done in the other house. Therefore it seems to me to be only logical and proper that when
we adjourn today we should adjourn until tomorrow. If
certain things do happen, that will have no effect on our
adjournment. If certain things do not happen, and if we do
adjourn until the 21st, there would be a very real effect on
what we should be doing in this chamber.

Hon. Mr. Argue: The Senate has scheduled work to do. I
have in my hands the Minutes of the Proceedings of the
Senate, which indicates that tomorrow at 9.30 a.m. the
Standing Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs is to meet.

e

(1510)

In my opinion, we should, in the ordinary course of
events, lead our own life in this chamber, and adjourn
until tomorrow. I support fully Senator Prowse's
comments.

Hon. Mr. Argue: Honourable senators, I do not believe
the proposition is quite as simple as Senator Buckwold has
indicated. The motion is to adjourn until May 21, but by
adjourning until then we wipe out, obviously, tomorrow's
sitting. We are here, and the Senate has work to do.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: What work?

Hon. Mr. Buckwold: Perhaps the committees will meet.
Hon. Mr. Argue: I am informed that that committee has
no authority to meet.
Hon. Mr. Buckwold: That committee has every authority to meet. That has just been clarified, and I indicated
earlier that by resolution of this house that committee,
together with the Special Senate Committee on Science
Policy, which just received the authority, does have the
right to meet while we are adjourned. That is the
situation.
Hon. Mr. Argue: Then I stand corrected. I was under the
impression that the committee could not meet tomorrow.
There may be other committees that would like to meet
tonorrow but which are not able to do so. I still object,
however, to such a procedure being introduced to this
house on this type of motion. Honourable senators can
shake their headsHon. Mr. Langlois: Well, it is too late.
Hon. Mr. Argue: That is all right. You have heard three
or four speeches by agreement. You might hear another
short contribution by agreement.
Hon. Mr. Langlois: I always like to hear you.

SENATE DEBATES

May 8, 1974

Hon. Mr. Argue: If there is not agreement, I will sit
down. I happen to be a member of the majority party,
which in this chamber used to hold caucus meetings, but
now very seldom does. During most of my experience over
the years since I have been in the Senate the caucus met
for one of two reasons. First, it met when it was considered that a bill must be passed speedily without amendment; secondly, to decide whether we should adjourn for a
week, or two or three weeks. During this session we have
not had caucuses even to decide whether we should
adjourn for two or three weeks. I say, very seriously and
with great respect, that if a caucus of senators on the
government side had met on this question of adjournment-and when Senator Connolly (Ottawa West) was
the leader we always had a caucus on this question; now
we are faced with an announcement-I do not believe we
would have had this silly motion to wipe out Thursday's
sitting that in all probability will be wiped out anyway.
We did not need to announce to the people of Canada that,
no matter what happens, we are going to go on holiday for
two weeks.

off to? We are putting people to unnecessary work and
expense. Every one who is here will be here tomorrow
afternoon at 2 o'clock in any event, or ought to be, because
there will be business before us. I say that that is the time
when we should meet, when we will know what the
situation is and we can do whatever the circumstances
then indicate ought to be done. At the present time we are
taking the pessimistic view that the worst will happen,
that the government will be defeated; or, if it is not
defeated, we are to take a holiday and allow the members
of the other place to proceed with their work, which they
may or may not do.

Hon. Mr. Prowse: Honourable senators, one point that
no one has mentioned is that, regardless of what happens
in the other place, that house could decide on its own
initiative to postpone any vote that would terminate it for
a few days in order to give it an opportunity to deal with
some of the important legislation which is presently
before it. In other words, by agreement they could postpone dealing with the budget until they have dealt with
the legislation. We will know by tomorrow morning
whether that is to happen. I suggest that to move this
motion to adjourn now puts us in a position in which we
shall have to be called back if it is decided that we are
needed here. Unless we receive specific instructions in
writing to tell us to be here, who is to know where we are

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, we have
reverted to Notices of Motions, but no notice of motion
was given. As Senator Langlois has pointed out, we have
already agreed to a motion, and rule 47(2) provides:
An order, resolution, or other decision of the Senate
may be rescinded on five days' notice if at least twothirds of the senators present vote of its rescission.
There has been no suggestion that that should be donc,
and if we are to change the motion which has been agreed
to, this is the procedure we would have to follow. I would
have to take a vote to see if two thirds of the senators are
in favour. In any case, five days' notice has to be given.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, May 21, 1974, at 8
p.m.

Hon. Mr. Langlois: Honourable senators, I did not want
to interrupt but I suggest that this debate is out of order.
The motion to adjourn until May 21 was agreed to earlier,
and I do not believe any honourable senator can now ask
the house to reverse that decision. In any event, I do not
consider that the reasons advanced-and I am pleased to
have had an opportunity to hear the complaints of honourable senators-justify any change in the decision which
has already been taken.

The Twenty-ninth Parliament was dissolved by Proclamationof
His Excellency the Governor General on May 9, 1974
