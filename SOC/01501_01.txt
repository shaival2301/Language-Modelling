SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Hýonourable
gentlemen, we have on our Order Paper but
one item, the consideration of His Excellency
the Governor General's Speech on the ovening of the First Session of the Fifteenth Parliament.
In order that the Senate may discuss the Speech in a serene atmosphere and
with a mind free from preoccupation, I would
suggest that thîs Order be postponed until
Thursday or Friday of this weck.
If this proposai is agrocable to the Sonate I would
suggest that rny honourahie friend who xvas
to mox c the Address (Hon. Mr. Lewis) move
that tho Order be discbarged and be placcd on
the Orders of the Da-,, for Thursday next.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: The suggestion of my
honourable friend quite meets witb my approval.
The onlv q'uestion I would raiso
woîîld ho as to whether it should be TIhursday
or Fridav; but it is flot wvorth wbile altering
the motion.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
When we corne
f0 if, we may decide whether we will take it
up on Thursday or on Friday.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Hononrable gentlemen, I arn a little curions
to know flie reasons for this.
My hionourable
frion.d bas simpdv mado the proposition t0
dofer :the consideration of this item i.intil
another day.
1t, is an unusual course.
My
lionourable friend must have reasons for
making his stiggestion.
Perbaps ho would
inform us wliat they are.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
1 do not know
that, I can do so, in better words than I have
used, tbougb I aim sure it coul'd bo donc in
botter English.
My suggestion is made in
order that wc miay take up the consideration
of the Speech with minds free from any preoccupation, and discuss if on ifs monits.
I
feel that we should ondeavour to maintain the
serenitv of this Chamber and approacli ail
matters in a judicial frame of mind; and with
that end in viexv I think that my suggestion
is opportune.
I beave my right honourable
friend's imagination to add f0, the reasons

Rigbit Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
My honourable friend bas of course larger
opporfunities than I have of hecoming
ncquainted with the atmosýphere of the Senate
af this particular timo.
For my own part
I have not seen any seething excitement, on
eifher sido of the House.
However, I amn
willing f0 def or to my honourable friend's
opinion, and fo take his advice for the prosent if ho thinks we have reached such a
boiling point that \ve are no.t in a position

TRIBUTES TO DEýCEASED SENATORS
AND OFFICIALiS
TH1E LATE 1-ON. SIR JAMES LOUGHEED, HON.
WMI. ROCHE, HON. GEO. H-. BRADBURY,
1-ON. L. G. DE VEIIER

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, 1 take the first opportunity which
offers to express our sorrow rit the sudden
departurc 'fromi this life of the late Sir James
Lougheed, who durin-g twenty yeaxs played a
leading role in this Cbamber.
:Sir James's
if e is an object Iesson to -the rising generation.
In the fuîll sense of the termi ho was a selfmade man.
In bis early teens he began life seriously,
preparing for the carpentry trade, a trade
which requires intelligence and which affords
scopo for artistic values. At the sarne tirne,
being, anxious to learn, ho attended regularly
the Sunda.v school classes of the Hon. Samuel
Blake.
That honourable gentleman, recognizing bis ability and his desire t0 Iearn,
and seeing in Iim talents which would fit him
1
for professional life, suggested tlrnt he should
prepare himself for a higcher station in society.
This~ advice did flot fall up-on umproductive
soil.
Young Lougheed deecided f0 inake an
effort f0 advance himself hy st.udying the
cassies, lie devoted aIl his spare time t.o selfimprovement, and the moment came when he

entered upon the study

of law.

After very bard work lie was admitted f0
the Bar. Hie did not practise bis profession
f0 any extent in his home eifv of Toronto.
At that timo the Canadian Par.flc railway
was forging aheïad on the plains (-f the West,
and ho ohtained a letter of introdunction f0
the Chief Engýineer of that raiiwiiv, a -entleman wbose mime is familiar to us ail, now
Sir H{erbert
lt, wlio at finit tirn" xvqs located
at Medicine Hat. Witb that leiter of recoinmendation Lougbeed xvent f0 Medicine Hat,
where hoe was reeeived by the then Mr. Hoit
and pixeed in one of the offices of the companyv. The road, which m-as still under the
construction departmnent, had then advanced
beyond Mrdicine Hat, at that lime the jumpin,-off point. Sir James. as Nve knew him,
did not romain tliere, but witbin twelve
months reached the place which was f0 be
and which now is the city of Cnl-ary, and
there. 1 understand, ho lived under canvas
for the first month.
If was soon found that Calgar 'v would bo
a divisional point of importancce. and people

JANTARY 12, 1926
flocked li that direction. one of the first
legal dijnculties of some importance that
arose was confided to bis care, and be once
told me of the difficulty of organizing a court.
Rie won bis first case. From the beginning he
toek -an interest in real estate, and applied
hitnself te its development. From being a
real estate owner bie became a builder. He
grew witb Calgary, and helped Calgary to
grow. Hie built one of the firqt substantîal
buildings in tbat city. He engaged in the
insurance business and tbe brokerage business.
fle took part in every activity. There was
nothing that escaped bis attention. And yet
all the time bie was successfully pursuing bis
vocation as an attorney. Rie arrested the
attention of the community to such a degree
that when bardly five years bad passed, a
vacancy occurring in the Senate, bie was offered
He
a Senatorsbip and came here in 188.
was one of the Teal leaders of the West and
practically onle of tbe found-ers of tbe city
of Calgary.
I met ýSir James ýLougbeed in this Chamber
in 1898. At that time bie was dividing bis
attention between bis various interests in
Calgary and the work 0f the Senate, wbicb
was no mean task, the distance between tbe
two points being so great. Diuring the first
years of bis occupancy of a seat in this Chamber hie ratber modestly sat at the feet of the
eIders and imbibed their wisdom. Those eiders
were men of no mean consequence. Many of
tbem held their nominations under Royal
appointment; they were pre-Confederation
men, men wbo bad a wide reputation and
who adorned this Chanter to the full. APtbough only modestly participating during bis
first years bere in the work of tbe Seate,
Sir James Lougheecl early attracted the attention of bis fellow memibers, and, it was
no surprise te me in 1906 when lie was given
tbe leadership of the Conservtitive. Party
in this House.
Wben called to that important post he
applied himself to bis task and discbarged
bis duties brilliantly. le was courteous, be
was genial, hie was resoureeful-perfectly
equipped legally and mentally. Hec bad considerable commercial and financial experience;
be knew the West as few men knew it, and
be rapidly gained not only the confidence of
bis colleagues in this Chamber, but their
admiration and friendsbip as well. In every
position that he beld in the Government of
Canada bie was equal to the task, and be was
often mentioned as a man of proper calibre
for tbe Premiersbip of the country.
To Lady Lougheed and bis family we tender
our most heartfelt sympatby.

Tumning from the West to the East 1 find
a vacancy in our Chamber caused by the
demise of the late Hon. Mr. Roche of Rahfnaz.
Senator Roche was a successful man.of bugi-'
nesg. Hle was for forty years in public lifé,
having est for many terme in the Legisiative
Assembly of Nova Scotia and in the HouNe
of Commons, and he enjoyed the f ull confidence of hie community. He was well read,
he was an original thinker, and 1 should add
a philosopher as well. Those who heard
Senator Roche in any debate always felt that
hie would say something that had nlot been
said, and that bis views would be expressed
in a very original manner. Re was indeed a
true philosopher, looking upon affairs with a
certain equanimity and açertain detacbmnent,
and I arn sure that the Senate of Canada will
miss our colleague, who departed at a fairly
ripe age.
Returning to the centre of the country, we
have been faced by another vacancy caused
hy the departure of the Hon. Mr. Bradbury,
As one of the pioneers in the lumbering trade
of Manitoba, he brought to the Senate lar4è
business experience. He înterested himself
also in military affairs, showing bis zeal by
raising a regiment in the very first months of
the war. Re crossed the Atlantic in perfeet
bealth, and though he did not see active duty
at the front, yet wbile preparing to go, and
wben in France and Flanders, he was stricken
down with a disease which gradually sapped
bis vitality and closed bis career a few months
ago.
In my short contact with Senator Bradbury hie showed himself to be a public-spirited
c itizen, deeply interested in the welf are of
Canada, especially in trying to arrange our
financial difficulties so that with their proper
adjustment this country should go f orward
towards prosperity.
I would refer also to the death of Senator
De Veber, of Letbbridge, who was among us
f or a'numbýer of years, and wbo spoke with
authôrity on matters bygienic and medical.
He took considerabl-e part in discussing, f raming and modMfying legislation on those topics
with which bie was familiar. le had quite
an honourable career in the Northwest
Assembly, of which bie was a member wheu
bie was called to the Senate. In bis latter
years he was in poor health, and new-comiers
in. this Ghamber did not see him at bis best,
but when hie was well bie did bis part
thorougbly and to the satisfaction of bis
colleagues. To bis dutiful wif e, who, ever
since bis appointment accompanied him bere
session after session. we extend our sincere
sympathy.

fs

SENATE

To the family of Senator Roche and to
that of Senator Bradbury we also extend aur
most sincere sympatby. Not only will these
departed colleagues be missed by their
families and their provinces, but I arn sure
the Senate will also miss their presence among
US.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable
1 wisb to join witb my honourable gentlemen,
friend on
the other side in extending the sympathies of
this Chamber -ta the wvives and families of the
memnbers who so lately were with us, but are
now with us no more.
In ail that thbe honouralale gentleman bas
said with regard ta Sir James Lougbeed bie
has not averstated the facts concerning that
honourable leader. As hie bas referred to Sir
James's early life and bis business career in
the West, it is not necessary that 1 should
dwelcl uipon those points; but on one or two
phases with regard to Sir James I would like
ta say a few words.
I bad no acquaintance withi Sir James
Lougheed until I became a memnber of this
Hanse, but for thirteen years I was on termis
of intimate acquainitance, and I think 1 may
say friendsbip, witb bim. During the wbole
of that period tbcre neyer arase anytbing ta
interfere witb aur friendship. He was an
excellent companion, owving ta the fact. that
hie had a verýy active mi.
In ail the years
during wbidb I was thrown very often in bis
campany I never spent a duli five minutes:
it did not matter wbere ane was gaing, or
wbat one wvas doing. If travelling in tbe cars
tbrougb tbe country, and intcrested in tbe
landscape, Sir Jamaes Lougheed was also intercsted in the scenery, tbe farms, and everyt'hing that was going on. He took great interest in railways, and t1 bere was no subject
thaft could Se mcntioned an which bie did nat
know at least something-, and on mnany hie was
tboroughly well informned. I cannot imagine
a greater benefit in the way of friendsbip that
any man could cnjoy tban was my privilege
in the friendship of Sir James Lougbccd; and
1 neyer left bis preseo-ce without feeling that
I bad learned sometbhing, or understood better
the questions that I discussed with him. He
was very helpful ta me wben I vas tryin-g ta
understand the ways of the constitution, and
the metbods of this Hanise.
I sbould likie ta mention one point wbicb. I
think was unique in the life of Sir James
Lougbecd, and wbiclh 1 have not yet beard
mentioned. During the thirteen years of aur
acquaintance a grca.t many men bave came
and gone from rboVb sides of this House, but
1 say witbout reservation, after baving talked
ta at least 90 per cent of the memabers of thisHause, that I never heard a man on eitber
Hon.

Mr. D.XNDURAND.

side of tJbis Chamber wbo did flot say that fie
liked Sir James Laugbeed. That is a remarkable tribute ta bhim, for this Hause bas 96
memýbers, and we might expeet, as one of the
most natural tbings in 'the world, that there
would be same man who had a aninor grievance, if nat a major dislike. I neyer saw any
trace of sueb.
I tbink the bonourable gentlemen an the
other side of the Huse will jain me in saying
that Vbey ndmired Sir James Lougheed-bis
manner and bis character, and the way in
whieh he canducted tihe business of this House
-praatically as mucb as did the meimberii
sitting bebind me.
'Phere is another aspect of 'Sir James
Lougbeed's if e on whichi we must look. Part
of b.is life was passed during a critical periad,
when the fate of this Empire ivas at stake,
and wben he was anc of the pillais cf this
cauntry, one of the wise mcn i,,bo were trying ta direct the country's affairs ta a successfuil issue. Altilougb I was not in the Cabinet,
I was an Committees, and hiad opportunitics
ta observe that there as no wiser head and
no firmer will thagn the head and the wvill of
Sir James Loug-heed. His assistance ta the
Gaveroýment cf the day was cf tbc verY' highest imrportance.

Tbc work that he dýid was

well donc in the service of bis country. The
more we investigate bis if e the more largely
bie figures in sbaping bhc legislatian of this
country. I knaw, as a matter cf faet, that
bis judgment on railway and tariff matters,
and other questions cf prime importance tao
the country very aften prevailed. bis nami,
and work 'will occupy an -important place in
the legislative history cf this country, as those
wba hereafter go througba the records will find.
!Caming ta the leadership cf Sir James
1
Lou-g eed in tbis Hanse, it would possibly be
siuperfluous for me ta say t-hat he was a
madeq leader. Tbe feeling of attacbmcnt whidh
was geneî'al on bath sides cf this Hanse did1
1
not arise because Sir James Lou«g
iccd wvas a
milksop, or becairse hoe gave every man vohat
hie wantcd. Indced, on the ccntrary, it was because lie had a ýmmd of his awvn, that was
naturally predisposed ta be fair, and ta give

CIVIL

PRESENTATION OF REPORT

Hon. Mr. BELAND: Honourable gentlemen, I have the honour to present the report
of the work of the Department of Soldiers'
Civil Re-establishment for the fiscal year
ending March 31, 1925.
In this connection I might say that it bas
been customary with this Department to lay
on the Table at the opening of each Session
a report covering the calendar year.
On
account of the early calling of Parliament this
year, it bas been impossible to supply both
Houses with anything but a report covering
the fiscal year ending on the 31st of March,
1925.

Considerat:on
of nis Excellency the Governor

Hon. Mr. LEWIS: I beg to move that this
Order be discharged and be placed upon the

The motion was agreed to.
ATTENDANCE OF SENATORS
RULE 105A REPEALED

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved, by leave
of the Senate:
That Rule 105a of the Rules of the Senate be repealed, and that Rules 24a and 23a be suspended in so
for as they relate to this motion.

He said: Honourable gentlemen will remember that a few years ago both branches of
Parliament enacted some new rules covering
the allowance paid to members of Parliament.
One of those rules provided that in order to
obtain the full indemnity a member had to
attend seventy-five per cent of the actual sittings of the House. The House of Commons
found that that rule worked some hardship,
and rescinded it; we left it in our Rules and
Regulations. Inasmuch as the Senate may
be taking a somewhat lengthy adjournment,
as is usual soon after the opening of the
Session, and in view of the fact that when we
return, after sitting only one or two days,
we may be confronted with a situation
necessitating another long adjournment, this
rule would entail a great hardship upon the
members from the far East and the far West.
Therefore, not only for the present occasion,
but for all time, benefiting by the experience
of both Houses in this regard, I move, seconded
by the Hon. Mr. Ross of Middleton, the
Leader of the Liberal-Conservative Party in
this House, that the rule be rescinded.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at

leave to oSfer our humble thanks to Your Excelleney for
the gracions Speech which Your Excellency has addresged to both Houss of Parliament.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, I have te
offer what is not'an unusual apology for new
members, namely, that I shail be obliged
to consuit my notes, te an extent which is
possibly not in accordance rwith the flxed rules
of this House; but I arn accustomed te express
my opinions with my pen rather than with
iuy voice, and I can assure you th-at my effort
to speak without notes would be as painful
for you as for myself.
Necessariiy we approach our task in a
manner somewhat different from those who
live the more strenueus life of the other
Chamber. It is not our business te make or
break Governments, to influence the fortunes
cf parties, te look for partisan motives in the
Speech wbich it is our duty te examine. We

the difference in the general percentage of
duties under Liberal and Conservative Governments was not very great. That was due,
I think, not to any insincerity on cither side,
but to the fact that successive ministers of
finance, Liberal and Conservative, found
themacIves faced with practical difficulties
which in the freedom of opposition they had
not fully considered.
The percentage, however, does not tell the
whole story. A tariff is a highly complicated
structure coniposed of several thousand items,
and its influence upon îndustry depends
largely on the Ekiilful or unskillful adjustment of details and the relation of one duty
to another. For that reason it seems te be
a proper subject for the study of such an
Ad'visory Board as is promisedi in the Speech.

we are now confronted. I bear in mind Longfellow's famous invocation to the Ship of
State, and particularly what lie said as ta
the dangers of the voyage:
Fear not eaeh sudden sound and shock:
'Tis of the wave. and flot the rock;
'Tis but the fiapping of the sait,
And not a rent made by the gale.

Many greater difficulties have heen overcorne, and we need have no fears for the
future if, without regard to differences of
party, race or creed, we work together for
Canada, for the country which bas done so
much for us and to wbich we owe so grea-t
a delit of love and service.
Hon. P. E. LESSARD (Translation): Mr.
Speaker and honourable gentlemen, before
comrnenting briefly upon the Speech from the
Throne, may I express on behaif of my
colleagues our aatisfaction at 1having in the
Speaker's Chair a gentleman who perfarmed
the sanie funotion in the last Parliament, and
who, by bis dignity, bie judgment, bis impsrtiality, and his prof ound knowlcdge of
parliamentary law and practice, won the
admiration =nd approval of the Senate and
of all who are intercsted in public affaira.
We are pleascd ta have as Speaker a man
sa distinguished, and we trust that he will be
retained as head of the Sena.te for a long
time to corne.
The Speech from the Tlironc recalîs ta us
the great honour conferred upon Canada whent
the representatives of 55 nations, the most
illustriaus diplomats in the world to-day,
united in a common desire ta maintain peace
among the nations of the earth, appointed as
their President a Caaaadian statesman; and
the Senate lias a right to be especially proud
of the choice, for that statesman is the honourable Leader of the Governinenît in this
Chamber.
My humble congratulations can add nothing to the renown of my honourable Leader.
Will lie allow me only ta tell him that those
who sit beside him here recognize in th
honours which lie lias gathered for biieî
and lis coumtrymien the result of work done
in carrying out the principles of a patriotic
school of which lie was a piapil and one of
the most briliant defenders-a sechool whoe
traditions lie gus.rds intact--that echool of Sir
Wilfrid Laurier. Ail my honourable colleagues
who have seen him at work ini this Chamber
-and I do not hesitate to appeal alea ta the
honourable gentlemen on the lcft-admire hie
eloquence, hie tact, his courage, h-ie courtesy,
and bis great aotivity. Those wlio have read
the newspepere know the important part lie

playcd in the discussions of the League of
Nations. In Europe as well as in Canada lie
lias attracted admiration, and I arn sure it
arouses among the honourable members of
this House a feeling of legitirnate pride ta
mention the lionou-r conferred upon aur
colleague by the representativesl of the
nations. To give utterance ta your thouglit I
would say, Long live aur Canadien «Loubet"!
Since last Session, by thie death of Sir
James Lougheed, the province in whicli I live
has lost anc of its most illustrious citizens,
Canada anc of its most devoted sons, the
Senate anc of its anost enlightened counscilore,
and Hie Mai esty's loyal Opposition in thie
House a loved an ,d revered leader. Voices
more authoritative th-an mine will pay ta bis
mernory tbc hornage it deserves.
The ncw Leader of the Opposition is a
legislator whose reputatian cxtends to all parte
of 0an-ada. I join with my honourable
colleagues in congratulating hi.m on having
been chosen to direct the forces of the left,
and I have no doulit the duties entrusted to
hlm will be fulfillcd with all the ability for
whicb lie is noted. It is, I 'am sure, the
desire o£ ail my colleagues on the riglit that
h-e may be Leader ad the Opposition in this
Chamber for many years to came.
The Speec h of Hie Exccllency inforrns us
that a resolution will be transrnitted ta Hie
Majeety, tendering to him tbe condolence of
the Parliament snd people of Canada on the
death of Queca Alexandra. That good Qucen

Empire, who will always Temember ber happy

Peacemaker King.
The Government cannoe be aceused of
failure ta incorporate in the Speech from the
Throne an elaborate programme ta promote
the interests af tbc country. Neyer in thc
lietory of aur Canfederation lias a more
explicit policy been announced at the opening of a Session of Parliarnent. Wbat, then,

public affaira and with each of the reductions
whi'ch the Governiment will from time to time
be able to inake.
The policy announced by the Governznent
on the subject of immigration is a furtbcr
source of gratification. The greater advantages that Canada will offer to immigrants
cannot but stimulate the efforts of our agents
and induce agriculturists in other countries
to corne and avail themnselves of the incomparable richness of our soil It is agriculturists that we nccd. There is room in this
country for millions of farmers. Our fertile
lands await tbem and will repay them
gencorously for their labour. In Alberta we
have more than 100 million acres of arable
land, of wbich only 1l million acres are
eultivated. Is it conceivable that human
heiogs, white men, should toil as they do in
certain parts of the globe without being able
to put by enough to appease the hunýger of
their farnilies, while here in Canada Mother
Earth, in return for their physical effort,
offers them abuodance and even wealth? We
bave often heard it said, even by our farmers:
"We bave cnough agriculturists: what we
require n0W are industries which will provide
a home market for agricultural products."
People wbo speak ýthus are egotists wbo care
little for the future of this country. More
than all else wve need tilleirs of the soil,
farmers who will conatitute a home market
for the absorption of manufactured goods.
The more solidly tbis market is established,
the more prosperous will be our industries.
Our manufacturera miis find their sustenance
in thc country itscîf before thinking of
exportiog their surplus goods, and this basis
of support is provided by the consumnera who
till tho soil or are engaged in the development
of our other natural resourcea. 1 say, therefore, with the deepest conviction, that if we
would become a prosperous nation we must
in the first place encourage immigration and
the placing of settîcra on the land.
We hava for rnany years deplored the
exodus of large numbers of our people who
have gone to the neighbouring Republic.
This movement was quite natural.
The
disturbances and the economie movements of
a greot country are lîke the flow and ebb of
the tide in their effect on the lesser population of an adjoining country. It was inevitable that after the war a great nation, possesaîng thc largeat share of the world's capital,
should, like a huge magnet, attract the people
of our country, the only country flot protected
from its influence. But we also have a
magnet, which is bound to help in the
repatriation of Canadiens: it is the fertility
Hon. Mr. LESSARD.

of our soil That, however, is flot suffloient.
We must still make sacrifices to bring 'back
our Canadians from abroad. If it costs twice
as much to bring back a Canadian as to bring
in an immigrant from a foreign country, let
us ýmake the expenditure without hesitation.
We shaîl ultimately save by so doing, for we
know it will net be necessary to make any
further outley in order to, Canadianýize the
repatri'ited Canadian, as we should bave to
do in the case of the foreigner. We must
make sacrifices also to develop as much as
possible our basic industry, agriculture. If
agriculture is prosperous other industries will
soGo be in a similar condition. The settler
and the farmer must feel contented in
Canada. Tble best colonisation agent that
the country can possess is the settier who
writes to his relations and friends: "I amn
settled in Canada and arn quite contented
bere." Now, the Government hias announced
that it -%ill submoit to Parliament several
measures to improve the condition of our
farmers. Tbese projects should aIl recive our
cordial support.
One of -these measures will provide for the
establishment of rural credits. This subject
bias been discussed in the Senate at previous
Sessions and I arn sure 'that we shaîl give
it careful and favourable consideration. It is
also for the purposo of assisting the agricultural doasa that an Advisory Board will be
forrned to study the possibilities of revising
the Customs Tariff with a view to lig'htening
the burden of duties irnposed on instruments
of production. Our farmera will benefit further by the opening of new markets for t;heir
products through the commercial trenties
arranged with other British Dominions.
There are two points in the Speech frein
the Throne wvbich interest more especially the
people of Western Canada. The first la that
wbich concerns the completion of the Hudson
Day Railway. A speciel committee of the
Senate soýme ycýars age studied this question
thoroughily and recomrnended the completion
of that lino. It is to hc hoped, therefore,
that when this project is submitted to us it wilI
receive the support of aIl who rccommended
it in the past.
The second measure is that which la intended to give t.o the Province of Alberta
the ownership and administration of its
natural resourcea. For a long time rny province bias claimed its rights in this respect.
Our resources are elmost inexhaustible. My
predecessor, Hon. Jean L. Côté, whose untimely death we aIl regret, and who neyer
loat an opportunity to work for the welfare

JANUARY 15, 1926M
of Alberta, gave you, lest yea.r, a detailed
account of the riches of that province. It ia
sufficient for me to recail to your mind what
he said about our coal mines, perhaps the
greatest in the world, our immense asphait
deposits, aur ail wells, natural g«s and farest
reserves, and ail the possibilities of developing
thia naturai wealth ta make of aur province
ane of the most important in the Dominion.
I adopt his words and sk you ta give to this
measure, when it is presented, the most
sym*pathetic and most careful consideration.
I must not resume my seat without congratuiating most 'heartily the honourable
Senator who has sa eloquently moved the
AddIress in reply ta the Speech from the
Throne. I have much pleasure in seconding
his motion.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen,
it is in order, I think, that on behaif of this
aide of the flouse I should extend aur good
wishes and congratulations ta the honourabie
Senators who have become menibers of this
Hotise this Session. They constitute a great
importation of new and good blood, and when
I look at them I am quite satisfied that this
flouse shows no sign o~fdecline, but, on the
contrary, exhibits every evidence of renewed
strength and vigour, not only for the diseharge
of the ordinary duties of the House but of the
work of this country. We on this aide of te
flouse welcome those gentlemen.
It is also my pleasing duty to, congratulate
the mover (Hon. Mr. Lewis) and the seconder
(Hon. Mr. Lessarci) upon the speeches that
they have just delivered ta us; but I must say
that the speech of the mover of the Address
was much plainer ta me than the speech
delivered by the gentleman who seconded it.
I have no doubt however that in due time I
shall be able ta abstract from the latter a
good deal of the wisdam it contains. I am
not going ta criticize anything that te on,ourable gentlemen have said, and ini a moment
1 will explain why.
Passing ta the Speech praper, there is one
matter which it cantains that concerne us ail,
and on which we can aIl speak, no matter an
which side of the flouse we may sit. Hia
Majesty the King has suffered lately a great
bereavement in the bass of his mother. For
yearsg she was an honaured Princess in
England, and then a Royal Queen, beloved a.nd
respected not only -by British citizens at home
but by people in ail parts of the Empire-I
might almost say in. ail parts of the world.
It is beyond controversy that she was a good
womnan, which, perhaps is a greater titie than
anyr of the others I have mentioned, and I
think it is fitting that we shouid ail join

in expressing aur sincere sorraw and, in extending aur sympathy ta His Majesty the
King in his great loss.
Another matter to which I wauld refer is
the fact that we have in aur midst a member
of this flouse who has been the subject of a
great and unique hanaur during the past year.
I wish for myseif ta extend ta the Leader of
the Governmnent in this flouse my unalloyeI
and heartfelt congratulations upon the great
honaur that has been canferred an him by thae
offer of the presidency of the Assembly of
the League of Nations, an office which he has,
I think wiseiy, accepted, and the duties of
which I have no doubt he will diseharge capahly. There are gentlemen in this flouse who
understand the machinery and the xnechanism of the constitution of the League of
Nations better than I do, although I think that
1 have a general knowledge of it and an
appreciation of the greatness of that institution and of what it mesane ta 'be mae
the president. I have no hesitation at ail in
saying that the honour s0 conferred on the
Leader of this flouse is one in which this
I think we can truly say
flouse shares.
that the flouse is honoured, by the choice of
the Leader of the Government here for that
high position. It is an honour ta my honourable friend's native province, it is an honaur ta the Dominion of Canada, and I have
no doubt that he will long live ta occupy an
important position and ta play an important
part, as he already has donc, in the warkings
of the League af Nations, whether as president
or in some other capacity. I extend ta him
what I know ta be the unfeigned feeling of
satisfaction of this side of the flouse.
Leaving this suhject and passing ta the
Speech proper. there are ane or two things
to be said. In the other flouse the Address
in Reply to the Speech from the Throne is
a critical thing, it is one of those things upon
which governments corne and gavernments go
While it is nat altogether correct ta say that
the adoption of the Speech from the Throne
by this flouse is a formai thing, it is not of
the samne importance as its adoption by the
other flouse. The Speech from the Thirone
is the rnethod by which we receive the message
from Ris Excellency, for which we loyally
return aur thanks; and it is a well-known fact
that if we were ta, vote down the Address in
Reply ta the Speech from the Throne, aur
action would not affect the government of
the day in the least, and that it would continue in office as if we had passed no such
motion.
A peculiar situation exists in the other
branch of Parliament, and I think my hon-

iitliaer Ilouse or of doing anytlîing that could
ho interpretefi as an attenîpt to influence
niaitoers in the other House. I do flot thjnk
ihat situation bas quito ciearod up yet. and
I and the honoxuabie gentlemen behind me
feel that for the present we shoulfi fot askz
for a div isien of the House on this question,
or propose an amendient to the motion. XVe
:110 inclined to let the motion pass; but, so
far as ive are concerned. it must pass with the
distinct understanding that ave do flot acquiesce
in the statemients contained in the Speech
fi-ena the Throne andi that xvlen anv of the
mieasures mentionefi ini it come to this House
we xxili fot feel bound to refrain from acting
iii a perfectly free and indopendent manner.
Taking that position, for the presenit we suspenid anîd postpene ail discussion upon the

have already rnentiened. If we were te p)10cccii te discuss il, wo would bo discussing only

B3ills fremn the other Ileuse, outlining what is

thoso niatters. Therefore we agree te alow'v

which has been conýferred on my humble self
in being called to the presidency of the League
of Nations. I may say that I really feit that
that moment was a most important one in
my ife. when the representatives of some fifty
nations' mounted the rostrum. and solemnly
deposited their votes, flot perbaps so much
for myseif ais for the country wbich, 1 had the
very great honour of representiog. Let me
add that I prized that honour ail the more
because 1 feit that it was shared by ail my
comrpatriots.
On the matters which are contained ini the
Speech from the Throne, I will 'be as brief
as my bonourable friend opposite. (Hon. W.
B. Ross).
Ail the matters which are contained in that Speech will corne to this
Chamber in concrete form.
We have only
the announcement of gener-al policy, and the
Senate wilI have to take the legislation as
it cornes from the Commons, apply its hast
attention to the various matters involved
therein, and decide with absolute independence
every question that reaches this House.
The Speech from. the Throne, wben an
Address is presented in answer to it, has not
the samne importance, in this Chamber as in
the other.
I take it for granted that we
simply foilow an oid, tradition by which the
House of Lords thanks His Majesty for bis
gracious Speech.
It is but a tradition with
this Cha-mber, because it does not bind us to
the policy or policies that are mentioned in
the Speech frorn the Throne. As the matters
comne before us, individually aaid separately,
we treat them. and decide upon tbem.
As we are meeting at the time cd the year
when congratulations are extended, and good
wishes to oux friends ame expressed, I Vhink it
is in order that we should extend our congratulations and good wishes to ail our feliowCanadians.
We should indeed be proud of
our people. 1 have travelled through Europe,
baving crossed seven or eight countries before
returning to my home, and nowhere have I
scen a better country in which to live than
Canada, or a more contented people. Canadians are hardworking and thrifty. 1 had
intended tr. speak of the expanding trade of
our country; but I may simply summarize it
in a word. In the matter of exports Canada
to-day stands second per capita, in the list
of economic activities of ail the nations. This
iact affords sufficient reason to expresBf our admiration for the work of our people in field
and shop.
We have expanded in ail the
natural resource-in the forest, in fisheries,
in the mines, as well as in agriculture.
hn
analyzing our exports it is înteresting to, find
that our industries have done their fair and

17

large share. On the whole, I think we should
be optimistic, and I know that if our people
continue, as they wiil, to labour seriously,
day in and day out, they wilî work out our
salvation.
We have difficuit problems, but
we will face them like men.
The Senate did its share st year in investîgating one special matter which engrossed,
and must continue to engross, our attention.
I arn sure the Senate of Canada will continue
to do its part, and contribute its share o!
wisdom in steering the ship of state into safe
.and proper channels.
R.ght Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourable gentlemen, &fter the stateinents
whicb have been made by the Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. W. B. Ross) and iny bonouraible friend who bas just taken bis seat,
àt is not niy intention to undertake a discussion
of the various paragraphs in the Speech fromn
the Tbrone; but there are two or tbree things
in wbich I wisb to associate myseif with those
who have spoken.
In the first place, I wisb to congratulate
my two bonourable colleagues, who are new
to this House, though not at aIl new to work
for Canada in their own special lines in their
localities so widely distant from each other
in this country of vest dimensions. I arn not
going to utter a single word of criticismn, but
if they wýill allow me the privilege of an older
man in reference to novices in this Chamber.
I mi!ght just say that while I was p]eased to
listen to the speeches tbey made as read, I
would bave been more pleased if they had dispensed with the manuscript, and spoken as
man to man, as I am quite sure they are able
to do, and will bereeafter do. After ail, either
of those gentlemen could stand right up and
talk to anyone eloquently and etrongly, and
express bis views clearly. Well, an audience
is merély one man multiplied by twenty,
thirty, forty or fifty, and it would not be at
-ail d6fficult, if they made up their minds, to
speak effectively without manuscript.
I want to associate myself witýh tbose wbo
bave extended a we]come to the newcomers
in this Chamber. Some of themn were o!d colleagues of my own in another House, wbere
the atmoephere was not always so calmn as it
is reputed to be. and I think really is, in this
Chamber. I arn quite sure that the very
moment they took their seats in this Chamber the atmosphere hrightened and ligbtened,
and they looked upon the men opposite them
as brothers in a common cause, in a plaçe
where prejudices and partizansbip are softened, if not entirely eliminated.
Perbaps
nothing bas struck me so strongly, in my
change from the other House to this one, than

14015--2
RJWEV!f Enx'rON

SENATE
to note the extrernoly non-partisan way in
which members on both sides of the House
approach the questions that are presented 10
therm in the dlijferent Committees, and work
together, as 1 arn bound to say, with on'y
the prirnarv idea of gotting at the very best
that is possible for the good of the countrv'
in the various meýasures wbich are placod bLefore thern. That sarne rernark applies to the
business in this Chamber after we corne frorn
Committees. Now and then a littie of the
old flames flares up in sorne of rny bonourable
1
friends opposite-not in any on this of the
Hoiuse-and gives us a rerniniscence of the
days when the fight was brisker and the cornpetition a little more keen than it is in this
Chamber.
I desire also to associate myseif with those
who have rnacle syrnpathetic reference to the
deatb of the Qucen Dowager. It lust struck,
me. and 1 do not think hýad struck me in that
way bofore, as really a wonderful thing that
the lifo of two wornen bas spread over a
Century of this Ernpire of ours: 1817, 1837,
1926 rnark about a century during wbich the
lives of two Queens have most intimately
affected this wholo British Ernpire. The influence of those two wornen has heen wonderfui indeed. Sornetirnes quite invisible, sometirne quite apparent, are the links and tics
that bind a people to the Crown, and that
bind the people under one Crown to oach
other. I challenge the thought as î,o whether
there bas been any influence in the British
Empire w.thin the last century which hias
gone dlown deoper mbt the bornes of individual
subjects and citizens of the Ernpire of Great
Britain than the queenly, womanly and pure
qualiities of those txvo wornon whose lives span
a century of our progress and a, century of
our best developrnent.
As regards other references to tho Speech

ADJOURNMENT 0F THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. DANDIJRAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, there is nothing on the Order
Paper that we could take up to-day. I
stated, on moving the adjournment of the
House to this day, that if no measure was
fortbcoming, either from the House of
Commons or from the Government, At would
be my duty to ask for an extension of the
adjouroment whieh I then moved. Notbing
bas come during recess from the other HOuse,
and I arn informed that the measures to be
laid before Parliament are mostly mentioned
in the Speech from the Throne or have been
announced by the leader of the Government
in the other flouse. I arn further informed
that these measures, anme of which contain
money clauses and appertain specially to the
other flouse, will ail be presented in the
Commons. Therefore tihe legislation which
will be submitted ta Parliament wiii come
to His Honour the Speaker by Message from
the other Chainher.
This bouse must note also the fact that
the flouse of Gommons has decided, upon
voting the Address, to adjourn to the l5th
of Marcis.
TJndcr these circumstances I do not hesitate
to take the responsibiiity of maving:
That when thse Sanate adjourns te-day 'it do stand
adjourned te Tuesday, the 6tis of April, at 8 p.m.

Thse motion was agreed to.
INQUIRY FOR PAPERS
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: Honourable
gentlemen, if I arn in order I would like to
caîl thse attention of my bonourable friend
the leader of the Governiment ta the fact
that a rather important public inquiry is
proceeding at thse present time and reports
of it are published daily, but for some reason
thse memnbers of thuis flouse are not rece-iving
copies of the report. There are pyrobabiy a
Hon.

NIr.

DANDURAND.

nurnber of honourable Senators who would
like to keep fully informed of the facts as
they are shown, and I feel that it would be
quite proper to supply honourable memibers
of this flouse with copies of the report
published and distributed

daily to members

of the other brandi of Parliament.

May I

suggest to my honouirable friend the leader of
the Government that if this could be
arranged a numnber of bonourable gentlemen
in this flouse would appreciate it.
Hon. Mr'. DANDURAND:

I understand

that a similar request was made by thse otlser
flouse when a Senate inquiry was proceeding
last Session and that we provided tise memnbers of the other flouse with copies of our
report. I take it for granted that this sort

of thing is done on the simple request of
one Chamber to the other, and I will ask
thse Clerk of the Senate to see the authorities
of the other Chamber, in order that whatever printed reports are distributed, daiiy or
otherwise, with respect to the inquiry, may be
made available to thse honourable members
of this Chamber.

APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 1
FIRST READING

Bill 14, an Act for granting to, His Majesty
a certain sum of money for the public service
of the financial year ending the 3lst March,
1927-Hon. Mr. Dandurand.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourabie
gentlemen, this Bill asks Parliament to grant
to His Majesty a sum equal to one-tweifth of
the whoie Supply. The fiscal year haviiig
ended on the 3lst March last, this Bill, if
passed, wilI enable the Government to maintain the various services and to carry on the
Government of His Mai esty. The Bill is in
the usuai form. The items contaîned in it
cana al] h taken up when the main Suppiy
Bill is before us. I do flot know that there
is any special principie in this Bill which.
makes it different fromn any other Supply Bili.
Any of the items can stili be discussed when
the main Suppiy Bill cornes before us, and no
member wîli he prevented fromn expressing
bis opinion of the Biil itself or of any detail
of the Bill. This is the custornary one-twelftb
for-carrying on the affairs of the country.
With the leave of the House I beg to move
the second reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: What does it amount
to?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: $15,934,291.06.
Hon. W'. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen,
I think this is the usual interima Suppiy Bill

that has been coming up to this Bouse probabiy ever since Confederation, or very shortly
after, under both Liberal and Conservative
Governments. The Bill got its third reading
in the other Bouse on the 26th of March,
when statements were made there by Sir
Henry Drayton and by Mr. Robb as to the
effect of the Bill. Both these statements have
to be taken together, because they are interiocked. As I understand it, in passing this
Bill nobody is bound to any item in the Main
Estimates, neither does the Bill advance any
item in the slightest degree. This is merely
a credit of $15,000,000 against a very much
iarger sum. As there are some new members
here, I think it is just as well that they
tshouid clearly understand that we are not
cornmitted in the slightest degree to any item
in the Bill, or to express an opinion or to
give a vote either for or against it in time
to corne. If the Leader of the Government
presents the Bill in that sense, I am perfectiy
content to assent to the second reading.
I think the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable gentleman has fairiy stated, though
perhaps in better formn than I could do it, my
own thought. 0f course, we have our limitations in dealing with this Bill, even under the
unanimous resolution of this Chamber, and 1
arn not liriting, or intending to convey the
idea that I purpose to limit, the power of the
Senate. I may say that quite a number of
the items of the main Suppiy Bill have aiready been adopted in the other Chamber,
but they do flot appear in this Bill. This is
oniy one-tweifth, even of the items already
adopted.
Hon. Mr. POPE: Does it incIude onetwelfth of any and ahl items?
0f the whoie
Hon. Mr. DANDURLAND:

Hon. Mr. POPE: One-tweifth of the items?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: 0f the mass.
Hon. Mr. POPE: Then, in passing this Bihl
we reaily recognize the principie embodiedHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: No.
That is the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
reservation that lias just been made and
which lias been ernphasized by my honourabie
friend opposite.
Hon. W. B. ROSS:
I do flot agree that

Honourable gentlemen,

I suppose we are safeguarded by the statement fuorther on in the Bill tbat this is one-twelfth of the
whole supply to be voted.

Z'2

SENATE

The Bill seems to vary a little from that,
and says one-twelfth of each item.
Hon. Mr. POPE: I would like to know
whether, if we passed this Bill to-night, onetwelfth of every item would be available tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
derstanding.

That is my un-

Hon. Mr. POPE: That is not one-twelfth
of the whole.
-Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
see the difference.

I cannot quite

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I call the
attention of the Leader of the Government
to the fact that the gross amount of the
LEstimates as submitted for the current year
is roughly $345,000,000. This $15,000,000 does
not represent one-twelfth of that total amount
by any means. I think that is the point my
honourable friend who has just spoken (Hon.
Mr. Pope) has in mind.
It would seem
perhaps, that this is one-twelfth of the Civil
Government Estimates.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
we are considering:

This is the Bill

From and out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund
there may be paid and applied a sum net exceeding in
the whole fifteen million, nine hundred and thirty-four
thousand, two hundred and ninety-one dollars and six
cents, towards defraying the several charges and expenses of the public service, from the first day of
April, one thousand nine hundred and twenty-six, to
the thirty-first day of March, one thousand nine hundred and twenty-seven, not otherwise provided for,
and being one-tvelfth of the amount of each of the
several items to be voted, set forth in the Estimates for
the fiscal year ending the thirty-first day of March,
one thousand nine hundred and twenty-seven, as laid
before the House of Commons at the present session
of Parliament.

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I beg leave to
move the third reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. POPE: To-morrow.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

To-morrow.

The motion for the third reading of the
Bill was postponed until to-morrow.
THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS
On the motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand for
the adjournment of the Senate:
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN:
Honourable
gentlemen, before the House adjourns, I
would like to refer to a certain matter. Since
we parted a few weeks ago something of very
great moment not only to this House but to
the country has taken place. One of our colleagues, the Leader of the Government in
Hon. W.

B.

ROSS.

this House, has been to Geneva to attend a
meeting of the League of Nations, and I
see that the honourable gentleman has been
giving some interviews in the newspapers. I
want to remind the honourable gentleman
that if he had net been a member of this
House he would net have been there, and I
think it is of the greatest importance that he
should give the first information to his colleagues in this House. The honourable gentleman went to Geneva when Article X was
still in force, an article which may mean life
or death te the sons of many people in this
country, and I think the honourable gentleman could with great propriety take this
House into his confidence, since it was as a
member of this House that he went to Geneva
and there represented this country.
And whilst he is doing that, there is another
matter. We all remember that net long ago
an honourable gentleman of this House spoke
of the Protocol passed by the General
Assembly of the League of Nations on the
banks of Lake Leman. But something happened te the Protocol; and whether it is
dead or alive now I do net know, and I
would like the honourable gentleman to' tell
us. We were told that if it was lying dormant
it would revive.
There is another point on which we would
all be glad to hear from the honourable gentleman. There was the Locarno Pact. which
was going to be a great thing! Has Locarno
gone the way of the Protocol? Is Locarno
also asleep? Is there a wake going on around
Locarno now? For those who do not study
these questions carefully, what Locarno really
meant it is very difficult to understand. If
one read the debates that took place in the
Legislative Chamber in Paris he would see
that Locarno was net a very wonderful thing.
I give English statesmen credit because when
they know that something does not amount
to much they make a great deal of it. When
the Locarno Pact was negotiated, which
admitted Germany into the League of
Nations, the Right Hon. Austen Chamberlain
came back to England and was received with
acclaim not only by the people, but by Their
Majesties, who singled him out and gave him
one of the highest Orders in the gift of the
British Crown, the Order of the Garter. If
my memory serves me, there are only twentyfour members of that Order. He was proclaimed as a saviour. When such honours
were conferred on the man who negotiated
this famous thing, everyone thought that
Locarno must be all right. But when you
came to look at it, what was it? Locarno
amounted to this: it was simply taking a

APRIL 6, 1926
sponge and wiping off the siate ail the
atrocities committed by Gerrnany. We were
to forget those atrocities; we were to forget
the abominations; we were to forget the
"scrap of paper"; we were to forget the
prosecutions that were going to take place of
those who had been guilty of the worst crimes
civilization ever knew, and we were to take
to our arms our former enemies, thosé who
had disregarded treaties and trampled over
Belgium. wben they had sworn to protect bier.
Everything was to be forgotten, and Germany
and the others were to be taken into the
League of Nations. More than that, Gerrnany was to be adrnitted on special termes.
We were to forget also the sinking of the
Lusitania, when innocent people went down to
their deatlis within a few miles of tbe shore
of England.
That was Locarno. Well, honourable gentlemen, some of you rnay thînk much of
Locarno, but I for one muet say-I know I
arn in the minority in this House-that I do
not think any more of Locarno than I do
of the League of Nations. Of course, I arn
not going to speak of the League of Nations
to-night, because I have already spoken about
it in this House on more than one occasion.
If anyone is anxious to know what I think.
ail hie lias to do is to look up Hansard. I
have said repeatedly that the 'League of
Nations is a splendid thing, a heautiful dream;
but it is too good for mortals: it was made
for angels. I would like to hear froma the
honourable gentleman as to, wliat will lie our
position in future. If Germany cornes into
the League of Nations conditions wlll be
absolutely changed. Formerly -France and
England were the mirror of the League of
Nations: what they decided went. But wlien
a new element is introduced, an element that
was opposed to us and that wants to get into
the League of Nations in order to destroy
the Treaty of Versailles, in order to get
colonies again, and mandates, I would like to
hear fromn the honourable gentlemnan-and 1
arn not speaking only for myseif, but for very
many ýother people who are very rnuch concerned-as to where we are drifting in our
connection with the League of Nations, and
as a favour I would ask the honourable the
Leader of the Government to explain just
wliat lie has been doing lately at Geneva.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
gentlemen, if the honourable gentleman fromn
De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr. Casgrain) had
lîrnited hie inquiry to his laist phrase, I perliaps would have been justified in telling hima
summarily wliat the Assembly hied been called
for; but as lie has roarned ahl over tbe actions

23

of tlie Allies wlio met -at Versailles to sign a
treaty of peace, and lias discussed subsequent
events which have flowed from that Treaty,
I do not feel that at tliis moment I sbould
be called upon to, cover so mucli ground.
The Senate of Canada bas expressed more
fhan once its faith in tbe League of Nations.
More than once it lias declared that this was
an expeniment that should be tried for the
maintenance of peace amnong the peoples of
the wonid. We were without that instrument
until 1919. There was no sucli organization
in July 1914, and it seerns to me that it should
suffi-ce for my honouraible friend (Hon. Mr.
Caegrain) to have the declaration of Lord
Grey, tlien Sir Edtward Grey, that if in Ju>ly,
1914, lie could have appea-led to sucb an association of nations the Great War would
This exprobably bave been prevented.
pression of opinion from a man of the standing of Lord Grey, who played so admirable
a part as peaeemaker at that time, is worth
something. I asic my lionouraible friend, as
I bave asked him before, if lie would deprive liumanity of that ray of hope which
has appeared from these meetings of the
nations. As my honourable friend welh knows,
suspicion and prejudice arise from ignorance,
wbereas co-aperation brings about amity. For
the first time in the history of the world we
bave amity nrnongst the nations: we bave
co-operabion amongst rtbem once a year. But
we bave more: we bave the League Council,
containing the great powers, wlio bencefortli
wilIl bave the responsibility of rnaintaining
peace ini the world. Four times a year they
must meet, and they can be convened once
a montli, or once a week, i-f necesary. Tliey
are close at band, and if any dark cloud appears on the horizon they are called to examine the situation, endeavour to find a solution. and preach peace and arbitration. That
is the new instrument, and I arn surprised
that a man who bas lived througb the horrors
of the last war cannot see tbat there is something new in the world, in the -annual meeting ci the nations, and 'in the meeting of
the great powers every tbree montlis. or
oftener if nedessary, to settle thoee difficulties wbich, if tliey are not settled, grow into
irritating problemas from which emerges war.
Yes, tbere anay be other wars; yes, it is
possible that that instrument may not be
found sufficient for aIl cases; but surely, when
the nations are clasping eacb otlier by the
band, there is somethting new in this world
whicli should bie welcomed by alI men of good
will.

APPROPRIATION BILL No. 1
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third
reading of Bill 14, an Act for granting te
His Majesty a certain sum of money for the
public service of the financial year ending
the 31st March, 1927.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: May I ask the Postmaster General if among the Estimates, of
which this is said to be one-twelfth, there
is any sum providing for a grant to the
strikers in the Winnipeg Post Office in 1919?

Hon. Mr. MURPHY: No.
Hon. RUFUS POPE: Honourable gentlemen, before we proceed with the third reading
of this Bill I desire to express my opinion
with reference to the power that is being
usurped by the Government of the day. I
understood in reply to my inquiry last night
that if we were to pass this vote of $15,000,000
odd it would apply to each and every branch
of the Service for which money will bo voted
in the Main Estimates. Therefore if I were
to offer no objection, my action might bo
interpreted as meaning that I was in sympathy, at least te the extent of this $15,000,000,
with the maladministration by the so-called
Government of the Dominion of Canada teday. I would net like my position to be
misunderstood for a moment. I have belonged to the Liberal-Conservative party all
my life, and, with the permission of this
House, I would say that I have been fortunate
in my inheritance. I have believed that by
adhering to it for the balance of my days I
might be able through the channel of that
organization to render some service towards
perpetuating Canada as a nation giving some
permanency to its institutions. Therefore
I would not like to have my position misunderstood.
A government is supposed to be an organization possessing sufficient power to carry out
the pledges made by its members to the
people of the country at a general election,
or te promulgate policies along those lines, as
time and events may justify, during the four
years of its existence. We all know that the
Prime Minister of to-day, before going to the
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

far-distant and northern clime from which
he has recently returned, made an announcement at Richmond Hill, in which he told me
and everyone else in the Dominion of Canada,
as I presume he had told the Governor General, that because he did nut possess control
of the House of Commons it was impossible
for him successfully to administer the affairs
of Canada. Therefore he went to the people
of Canada asking them to give him control
of the House of Commons in the name of
the Liberal party, of which ho was leader.
He went forth, as I say, and asked the people
of this country to sanction and endorse him.
It is not necessary for me to take up many
minutes of the time of this honourable body
in pointing out that he did not get that
endorsation; and one does not have to be a
student to realize that if he was weak in the
House of Commons during the Parliament
that he dissolved last autumn, he is far weaker
in that House to-day. Further, it is not
difficult to prove that the majority of the
electors who voted for a single party at the
last election voted net for the Liberal party,
but for the Liberal-Conservative party led
by the Rt. Hon. Arthur Meighen. That is
the fact. As for the Progressive element,
which numbered some sixty odd in the last
Parliament, to-day it numbers only 27 members, including all the various stripes and
colours of Progressives, Labourites and Nationalists. I have lived all my life in the
country, and I have witnessed many auctions
and have read many auction bills enumerating
the goods to be sold to the highest bidder;
but never in my life have I seen a more perfect specimen of an auction bill than the
Speech from the Throne which was submitted to us this year, and which evidently
was dictated by those divisions which go to
make up the majority of from three to nine
upon which the Liberal party is dependent.
Under these circumstances, if we are to
place any confidence in the word of the Prime
Minister at Richmond Hili, we cannot anticipate any degree of stability of government from the present aggregation. If it was
truc before the election that the Government
could not carry on suecessfully, it is doubly
true to-day when it is dependent for its
majority upon three or four men who fail to
rise when God Save the King is sung. I am
not in favour of voting one cent, either by
way of interim Supply or otherwise, to be expended by such a government; and I want it
to be thoroughly understood that so long as
the administration of the affairs of this country is in the hands of this sort of people
the Senator from Bedford refuses to sanction

25

APR:IL 7, 1926
the expenditure of a single dollar by casting
bis vote for such a Bill. Canada's indebtedn4eff is a very serious problem. We owe today many mnillions more money than ever before, and the per capita taxation is so great
that the contribution that we have to, make
towards the revenues of the country is a
handicap to us in our devehopment, lying as
we do alongside the UJnited States. I have
no heeitation in saying that the indebtedness
of Canada and the taxation of Canada will
be increase-d under the qiresent regime, and
that if the public accounts of the country are
baanced it will be by tneans of furt'her increased taxation cf some kind. You will find,
'honourable gentlemen, that they will try te
worm out an apparent Teduction of some kind.
But we have heard that story before, and
even the minimum q'ossijbility wiil net redound to the benefit, of this country.
We find the Government offering contracts
to the outeide world, by means cof treaties
that prevent us from balaneing our budget.
1 do not piretend to ibe an authority uipon
financial matters, but when I seek information on that subjeet I go te the beet sources.
I was tdld the other day that the treaties we
had made with Italy and France and $pain,
countries from. which we import luxuries, prevented us from imposing duties on the quxuries te be consumed in this country by those
who can affoi-d to puy for them, and that thi
we are deprived of at least W4,000,000 a year
that might have been edllected andi spplied in
such a way as to lighten the burden of the
people of Canada. If ever there was a time
when $40,000,000 would be acceptable, it is teday. We have also made treaties with Australia and New Zealand. As these treaties have
been in effeet for only a few months the
people of those ceuntries up to the present
time have net been able to take possession
of our markets te the saine extent that they
will in the future. The other day I was speaking te a man who controls some of the large
abattoirs in Montreal. I said, "What is the
news to-day?" "Well, Senator Pope," hie said,
"the news to-day is that I have just contracted
for 2,000 Iambe te ha delivered in my abattoir in the month of May coming, at a price
of 16J cents a pound. The lambs that I put
in last autumn were Canadian lambs, and
they cost me 24 cents a pound." And this is
only the commencement, the first opening of
the door at a time when we require these
markets eurselves. As I have suid in this
flouse, the tendency ef bath parties for a
number of years has been towards a reductien of tariffs, a policy which has always
been centrary te my judgmenit; and I arn as
well satisfied te-day as I ever was that I arn

right, and have been right ail these years, in
opposing any reduction in the protection of
national industries. We have a dumping
clause which might be made use of if it were
not for the fact that Parliament to-day is
controlled by a haîf a dozen men of varieus
stripes and colours who command it to do
what they wish, with the resuit that foreign
goods are dumped into Canada and our own
people are being dumped into the United
States in order to obtain a living.
Now

1

wish to go a bit further.

We had

an election, and it extended to the Province
of Quebec as well as to the rest of the Dominion. I had sincerely hoped that in that
Province we would have a real election, and
that policies would have been discussed., and
that references would not have been made
to things that have been. 1 had .hoped that
the time had corne when the French Canadian
element of our Province would be approached.
upon dlean cut business lines, either upon a
policy of free trade or of protection. I had
hoped tha.t we could have got an honest expression of public opinion f rom the Province
of Quebec. However, those who directed
affairs saw differently, and I know of no time
since the war ceased when there was more
appeal to prejudice and greater corruption
and fraud than in the appeal made to the
people of Quebec upon this occasion. That
vote in Quebec no more represents the policy
of the people of the Province than does the
man in the moon. It is absolutely foreign
to their necessities, to the development of
their natural resources, to anything that makes
for permanency in the Dominion of Canada
and in the Province of Quebec. Ail you have
to do is to go into, our country and see the
deserted homes, the farmi buildings nailed
up, the merchants leaving, and small places,
abandoned; and the priest of every parishi
will assure you of the truth of the statements
I amn making. Do you say that those people
voted for a policy of that sort. Do you say
that the French *Canadian element, as a sane,
practical people, wo-uld vote to deteriorate
their condition in that way? Nol They were
blindfolded, they were deceived, they were
mislead.
My honourable friends on the other side
of the buse may say: 'Tour ranks were
divided by a third party coming in under the
leadership of Mr. Patenaude." I do not say
they were not; but that does not help the
French Canadian of the Province of Quehe.
Whether hie bas been deceived by the Government of to-day in the disreputable appeal they
made to the people of that Province, or

zo

SE-NATE

wvhether he hias been misload by a third manl
running, makes no difference to the Province
of Quebcc; the resuit will be the samne.
At this time, before it is too late, I want to
say to the honourable leader who ropresonts
the Gox crouent of the day in this buse that
ît is high time tbey took the broad view of
Canada for the Canadians, in the fullest possible sense, commercial and patriotic, and for
the upbuilding of the nation. If you continue
on the present narrowv path with whomn do
you coquet? You coquet xvith an elemenýt in
the West that is in many instances, to say
thbe least, of doubtful patriotism. I do not
say that there are not patriotic mcn in the
West; of course there are; but thore us an
element eut in tbat country tint is nlot
patriotie, that is dangerous, and that verv
elomont form.s a considorablo portion of tbe
smnall majoritv tbat the Govorament lias today.
Why, bonourable gentlemen, the legislation
of to-day is nlot prepared by the Cabinet.
gIt is submitted to a Committeo of the Progressives.
Tbey read it over, they bring it
back to the Cabinet, tbe Cabinet reads it
again, and it is reread and passod arouind.
The day of Cabinet representation and govornment in the Dominion of Canada is past. At
the present timo Cabinet administration is a
farce.
Instead of it xve bave consultation on
,the streets.
The fellows wbo engaged in tbe
striko in Winnipeg. t.be Reds, are censultcd.
The men who are inclined to preacb annox,atuen are consulted.
Not only are they concultoýd, but the Govoroment is absolutely
in their hands, and if they cannot ýget wbat
thev want, thon tbe proposed legislation is
clroppe(l; for tbis Goveroment as we have it
ito-day can no more logislate for the good
Liborals of *Canada tban it can legislate for
,the good Conservatives.
Tbat tbo Senate
ishould be called uipon to vote millions and
millions of monoy to be oxpended at tbe
dictation of people wbo will flot stand up for
tbe singing of "God Save Tbo King", is something of which I personally ecannet approvo.
I will go a bit furtber, and then I shaîl have
Jinisbed. Throughout the Province of Quebec
tbe name of Arthur Meigben bias been bandied
iarotund.
H1e bas been ropresented to the
people of Quehoc with blood-stained fingors,
-the blood of their cbildren drippirug from bis
hands.
The honourable leader of this House
ý(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) who had been elected
te tbe vory dignified and honourable position
of Prosident of the Assembly of tbe League
of Nations, sailed back to Canada and came
ioto the County of Stanstead and te, Magoglie lknows wbere it is-while tbat infamous
Hon.

Mr. POPE.

,camnpaigil was going on. I do not say that ho
ordered it, but 1 say tbat bis very presence
there co-operated with tbat defarning campaign.
Again, it is said tbat Arthur Meighen made
ai certain speech in Hamilton.
Tbat was on
iis own account.
He stated certain things
'that lie would do in the event of wnr, if ho
eomnuianded power.
Ho said tbat hie would
refer te the people.
Lot me point out tbat
there is a groat difforenco botween a speech
bv the Right Hon. Arthur Meighen, or any
other man -%who may lead the Cëonservative
,party, and the speech of thbe leader of the
Liberal party. Nover forget tbat tbe Liboral%Conservative
party is founded upen inborited
traditional principles.
We are flot founded
upen the capricieus mentali'ty of any leader,
no matter wbo bo may be-I am net reflecting
upon the Right Hon. Artbur Meighen or anybody elso but we have fundamental principles,
wo submait thom to the people, as we have
,dono for 40 years, and nover in our existence,
when we have been roturned te power, have
wo failed to put those principles into force
at the first Session of the first Parliament after
the election.
Yoti canncvt contradiet that
statement. Tne Liberal party go fortb inte
the country, and they howl one tbing in one
'Province, another tbing in another province,
and something different again in ovory other
one of tbe rnn provinces, and that is about
tbe last we hear of tbeir promises, even thougb
they como back te Parliament.
Tborefore
e particular statement by tbeir leader is very
important te them.
Wbat our leader says
us important te himself.
I have one or two words te say witb regard
te this war (proposition. The exporionce of
tbe late war, wbich was a very serieus one for
ail of us, bas had a salutary offeet on those
people who represont the Anglo-Saxon mentality tbroughout this world. The war came Jike
a boIt from the blue. We hardly knew what
we were te do, or when we wore te do it.
Govornments had te take action. Governmonts compolled this, and Governments cernpelled tbat. I arn gratified te ho able te soy
that thore exists in Canada .and throughout
tbe wide world an organization representing
the Anglo-Saxon mentality, the loyal, patriotic, imperial sentiment of the Anglo-Saxon
people and of those people who are allied
wmth them, and if war sprang up te-merrow
and the Motherland was throatoned, there
would ho a million mon ready, without waiting for the Government of Canada, or the
Government of tho United States or elsewbore, te, march ferward te the ocoan and
sail acress the Atlantic te defend the Metherland against any attack, ne matter whence it

APRJIL 7, 1926M
came. The man who stands up ta-day ta
play thîs miserable littie game of politics that
is played in aur Pravince and in ather places
will not he in evidence. He may stay here
and harp away as lang as hie likes. Old England, the mather of aur Empire, the mather'
of aur liberty-the mather af the warld's
liberty, if you like-never again wfll be aIlowed ta be attacked. Neyer again will she
be obliged or expected ta call upan the offspring in the different parts af the warld wha
do not desire ta go ta hier rescue. They may
aIl stay at home. There will be plenty of men
ready ta fight hier battles. And when the
fight is over the soldiers will remain, as true
men ought ta remain, in the country that made
the trouble, and will there Ievy taxation upon
the people, sa that those who made the
trouble will pay the buis. Our organization is
supreme; it is world-wide; we have no fear.
Sa I do nat care about the littie game of
politics you are pîaying. It is nat honourable
for yau ta play it. It is not fair ta yaur
people, when you have great events requiring
attention and action on your part. However,
if it amuses you ta play that game, do nat
ask me for money ta suzwart yau. You may
foorl -away in this Parliament -long enough ta
create a sentiment in faveur of a dictatarship. That sentiment is being created ta-day,
and I say without hesitation that the time
may arrive, and may not be far distant, when
a dicitarshiqi for Canada may be the only
escape. If we were discussing dictatorships a
few years ago we woiald nat have included
Canada with European countries-Italy,
Spain, Greece, Rumania, etc. I tell you
frankly and honestly that yiou must give this
country relief by wise, constructive legislation; you must remove fromn palitical agitation those elemnents of dissention; you must
unite the two nationalities, French and EngIish, on the common ground of commerce and
trade. If yau fail ta do that, permit me ta
say ta this honaurable body, yau will be surprised ýat haw early a period in the future of
Canada the formn of responsible Government
will change from what it is to-day.
I do not suppose it is of any use, honourable gentlemen, for me ta say mare. I cannat
tell you that I intend vating against this Bill;
I shaîl nat have a chance ta vote, because
there are flot enaugh hanaurable members
who will rise and demand that a vote be
taken; but I wish ta record my abscdute apposition ta the granting of a single dollar to
an administration that has failed ta administer-an administration that is inefficient, full
of intrigue, and surraunded with corruption.

T
1 would like
Hon. R. DANDL RAND:
simply to remind my honourable friend that
hie has lived long enough to know that prosperity and adversity corne in cycles in this
country. We are moving on towards more
prosperous times. Ail the statements of
bankers and financiers are to the saine effect.
I would like to comfort my honourable friend
from Bedford (Hon. Mr. Pope) by telling him
that after obtaining a certain perspective
abroad, one finds on returning to this country
that, if it is not the happiest country in the
world, it is by comparison a very happy
country. And 1 would- like to remind him
that the good old Province of Quebec, from
which hie hails, like myself, is the envy of
other provinces and states nearby; that it is
prosperous: that it knows when it has a good
Government. The Province of Quebec bas
maintained one since 1897. We have shown
surpluses year by year. 'Our trade is improving throughout the Province. Strangers flock
to our cities, which are growing. The population of Montreal, the metropolis, is increasing
hy 50,000 a year, and large hotels are being.
built to receive visitors, who. feel happy in
our midst.
I may tell my honourable friend that this
Supply Bill shows a considerable improvement
in the matter of reductions. The first paper
that I laid my hand upon when last Saturday
1 returned to Montreal from abroad, was that
of a confrere of ours, the Montreal Gazette,
and it commended the Supply Bill for showing
considerable reductions in many respects.
Our exporta are increasing. ApparentlY there
are somne people who are working. Yes, therc
are some who are unemployed, but the people
generally, whether on the farm or in the shop,
are working diligently, and I arn convinced
that fromn month to manth and fram year ta
year the reports will continue to show improvement and conditions in Canada will be
a source of great satisfaction ta aur people.

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time and passed.

PENSION FUND SOCIETIES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. BEILQUE rnoved the second read.
ing of Bill A, an Act to provide for changing
the names of certain Pension Fund Societies.
lie said: Honourable gentlemen, this is
a Bill to enable Pension Fund Societies to
change their names by by-law or resolution,
with the consent of the Secretary of State,
When the Secretary of State has approved of
the change there is to be publication of the
change in the Canada Gazette. This is i
accord with a like provision in the Companies
Act.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I would like to ask
the honourable gentleman about clause 2.
Suppose the Secretary of State does not agree
to the name submitted to him, then he may
give another name. Will that ýother name be
subject to the approval of the contributors?
Would it not be better that they s9hould
assent to one name as beilig preferable, and
then indicate their second and third choices?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It is the same provision 'that is contained in the Companies
Act. It is only in case the name suggested
is objectionable or is in conflict with another
nameHon. W. B. ROSS: It is left to the
Secretary of State in that case. The contributor has nothing to do with it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is the same in
regard to companies.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:
When the Bill is
taken up in ýCommittee we can discuss that.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

SITTINGS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
J desire to give
notice that I will move to-morrow that when
the Senate adjourns on that day it do stand
adjourned till Tuesday the 4th of May next,
at 8 p.m.
With the leave of the House I would like
to refer to the fact that surprise is sornetimes
expressed in the press of Canada at the adOn that point J
journments of the Senate.
would say that, for its regular work, this
Parliament began sitting on the 15th of March.
It was summoned for the 7th of January. and
all honourable gentlemen know why it was
called so early in the year. What did take
place, rather in the other Chamber than in this
one, was what I would call a prologue, a
curtain-raiser to the real at, which is that
of legislating for the good of the country.
This work, as I said, practically started on the
15th of March, and I am informed, as are the
other menbers of this Chamber, that the
Budget Speech will be delivered to-morrow.
I surmise, therefore, that there will be nothing
coming to us before the 4th of May next,
when we shall be here in time to receive all
legislation that may come before the House
of Commons and give it serious attention.
We must net forget, however, that a month
pa.sses very rapidly in Parliament, and that
May is followed by June, and I entertain
a strong hope that Parliament will prorogue
As I have had
before the 1st of July.
occasion to say before, we who have passed

Prayers and routine proceedings.

Hon.

Mr. BEIQUE.

APRIL 14, 1926
the meridian of life feel that our hours are
becoming fewer and that we are entitled to
enj oy part of the summer months else'where
rather than in the chambers of Parliament.
lion. Mr. McMEANS: Perhaps the honourabie ge~ntle'man can inforin us if we may
really empect any legislation fromn the Governmen't en the 4th of May.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Or any time this
Session.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Well, I would
ask my honourable friends, who seemn to have
some near friends within Parliament-and that
means the two branches--to confer wiith some
of those friends, because I have a'lways heen
unider the impression that while the Government could fix the date of the ca.Iling of Parliament the Opposition fixed the dote of the
closing.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Can my honourable
friend assure us that the ship of state has flot
foundered?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would answer
my honouraible friend in the worde of an
amusing Temark made by the Right Hon.
Charles J. Doherty, who was Minister of
Justice. He said that democracy had a very
queer way of dealing with the affairs of state
-that every four years it goes to the poils and
decides-sometiines in a very clear tone, and
somnetimes lýess so-who are the men to administer the affairs of the country for the
four folllowing years. Then th-ose men, select
a cew with a staff of officers for the ship of
state-a commandant, a pilot, and an entire
crew-and give thema charge of the ship. So
far so good; but it does not stop at that. It
thon puts another crew on the saine ship, and
says to them, "Boys, give those other fellows
hell "
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Honourable gentlemen, may 1 he permittod to talk soriously for
two minutes? I have no d'ouUt whatever of
the good intentions of our leader. I think
he is always ready to maintain the dignity of
the Senate and to see that it roceives the
consideration to which it is ontitled. I wish
only to repeat what has heon so often said,
that it is a groat pity that the ýGovernmont of
the day, whethor ihberal or ConservativeHon. Mr. GORDON: Or Progressive.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: -lways
ignores
the Senate so that legislation is sent to us
only after it has passed the House of ComnMons.
We have time and again protested
agamnst this, and I wish to do so once more.
In order to give my honourable friend an opportunity to try to put into practice what we

3

contend for, I wish to mention one piece of
legisiation which will soon be before Parliament, and which might very well be introduced first into this House. It is going to
be a long measure and will require a great
deal of consideration, and it should receive
the mature judgment of this Chamber. I refer to the Rural Credits Bill.
My honourable friend may say that it is a
measure affecting the finances of the country.
Well, from past exporicnce I am led to believe that measures of that kind are much
better first submitted to the scrutiny and criticism of the Senate. Here is an opportunity
of which my honourable friend might wel
avail himself when we meet again.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Honourable gentlemen, the answer given to me, I will not
say from what source, when I suggested that
some Bills should come to this Chamber first
-and I mentioned the Rural Credits Billwas this: "Surely you are not serious; the
Commons want to see it, and it is not certain that if it is introduced first in the Senate
it wîll reach the other Chamber. The Rural
Credits Bill is a very important piece of legisIntion, and it has been decided by the Government that it should ho first discussed. by
the popular branch. I need not give aIl the,
reasons that prompted the Government to so,
decide; but I would suggest to my honourable friend the senior member for Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Belcourt) and ail the other members of the Senate that during this short adj ournment, which I suggest should start from
to-morrow, they make a point of reading the.
two reports of Dr. Tory on Rural Credits. I
had simply glanced at those reports, but while
crossing the Atlantic recently I read and absorbed them, to my great profit. I am sure
that we shahl approach that legisiation with
far greater knowledge and wisdom fromn the
reading of those two reports than if we took it
up without any preparation. I make that
suggestion hecause there is in those reports
the foundation for a good piece of Iegislation
which will do honour to this Parliament.
Such legislation has been on the Statute books
of many important countries, and it seems to,
be admitted that something must be done in
the way of meeting the needs of the farming
community.
We shahl await what the farming coinmunity, through their direct representatives
in the popular Chamber, have to say on the
legisiation which will come before them. It
will be our right and our duty to review it.,
It is important in what it purports to do,,
and important in relation to the general
finances of the country. 1 do not know the
extent of the load which it will place upon.

32

SENATE

the Federal exchequer, but I would urge my
honourable friend, who has already devoted
some time to the study of this question of
rural credits, and who made a most interesting contribution to the discussion last year,
and also all honourable gentlemen who have
not yet read those two reports to do so before we return.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: If I understand the
Rural Credits Bill, it is a financial Bill, and
would not be introduced here. Under the constitution it has to be introduced in the House
of Commons.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not take that
view at all. I do not see why it may not be
introduced here. It is not necessary to introduce it in the other House. Surely we can
consider a Bill of that kind, even if it involves financial dispositions, and it would be
for the House of Commons later on to say
whether or not they will adopt the financial
burdens imposed thereby. There is no reason
why, in the meantime, this House should not
consider that Bill or any other, even though
there are financial considerations involved.
I do not think
Hon. Mr. DANIDURAND:
my honourable friend is right. I think we
could discuss the matter academically on a
motion of resolution, but when it comes to
the Bill itself, it must be introduced in the
other Chamber.
I think my
lon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
honourable friend would aid us greatly if he
would expedite the proposed Bill. I looked
through the reports of Dr. Tory fairly
thoroughly when they appeared, but if the
newspaper reports are correct the proposed
Bill departs radically from the recommendations of Dr. Tory. It is perfectly true that
he discussed the subject rather fully, but he
arrives at conclusions far different from his
own recommendations, if press reports can be
relied upon.
It will probably
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
happen that just as the Session is about to
close these Bills will be thrown into this
Chamber, and we shall not have an opportunity to (1o anything with them, as has been
the case in other Sessions.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My honourable
friend can rely on the leader of this House
not pressing a Bill of that importance if it
comes in during the last days of the Session.
We would have occasion to meet again in
JanuarY next.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I do not think there
is any rule of Parliament to prevent that Bill
being introduced into both Houses simulHon. Mr. DANDURAND.

taneously, although it may be a very unusual
thing to do. I would suggest to my honourable friend that he consider the question.
CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYSTONNAGE AT PORTLAND, MAINE
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. TA!NNER inquired of the Government:
1. Is there a contract of any kind existing between the Canadian National Railways and any person
or Company in respect to the delivery by the National
lailways of tonnage for export at Portland, Maine?
2. With whom is said contract made?
3. What is the date of the contract, and when will
it expire?
4. Does the contract cover tonnage in general or only
relate to speciie classes of goods or products? If to
specific classes of goods or products, what are the
classes?

NATIONAL TRANSCONTINENTAL
RAILWAY-GRAIN HAULED
MOTION FOR RETURN

Hon. Mr. TANNER: Honourable gentlemen, the House having decided not to meet
to-morrow, I ask leave to move the motion
which appears in my name on to-morrow's
Order Paper.
It is:
That an order of the House do issue;
For a return in respect te grain hauled over the
National Transcontinental Railway during each of the
years (crop years) 1923-4, and 1924-5, showing
(a) From what points and to what destinations the
grain was hauled, and
(b) The rates of freight charged in respect to such
grain.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not know
how long it will take to get this information
or what labour it will involve, but naturally I
agree to the motion of my honourable friend.
Sometimes the information asked for by a
member is so voluminous and so costly to
compile that, in order to save cost to the
country, the member is requested to look into the records for himself. I do not know
whether this is such a case or not, but I
remind my honourable friend of that procedure because I know he is as desirous as
I am of reducing the cost to the country of
any return asked for.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I may explain to
my honourable friend that I have made the
motion to cover only the two years, and this
morning the Department of Railways informed me that there would be no difficulty
in getting the information I want.
The motion was agreed to.

Whether they have secured
the advice of the
Presilent and competent officiais of the Govremiment

h
Bay Railway, and, if so, who were such officials, and
what was the advice giren?

He said: Before my honourable friend
answers the inquiry of which I gave notice tha
other day I would like to say that when I gave
that notice I deemed it advisable that certain
information should be received by this House
in regard to that railway.
Since giving my
notice however, I have been informed that
a similar inquiry was made in another place,
and a rcturn was brought down giving certain
information.
I have not bad an opportunity
of reading and studying that return, and I
would b obliged if my honourable friend
would allow this inquiry to stand so that I
nay see what information has been brought
down, and whether it coincides with what I
desired.

Is my honourable friend under the impression that the
other inquiry was on the same line as bis

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I ask that because I saw an answer in regard to the probable cost of the building of the road, but it
d'id not bear on the question of policy which
my honourable friend now raises.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: It was not so much
a question of policy that I wanted to raise,
but I wished to learn what information the
Government had from their officials in regard
to the cost, and everything else connected
with that new construction.

SIXTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF
CONFEDERATION
PROPOSED CELEBRATION

Hon

JOHN LEWIS moved:

Resollvsd, that it is expedient that preparations be
mîade for the celebration of the sixtieth enniversary
of the Confederttion of the provinces of Canada.

He said: lonourable gentlemen, if there
were business of a more urgent charaeter on
the Orders to-day I should be willing to refrain from presenting this motion, dealing with
a matter which may be described as somewhat academic and sentimental; but, inasmuch as there is before us only what the industry of the Divorce Committee bas pro-

MAY 4, 1926
vided for us, we may properly introduce the
matter. I hope to be able to show that it is
of some practical importance; and it seems to
me espécially appropriate that a matter of
this kind, dealing as it does with history,
should be discussed by this body, which contains a very considerable number of those
who have at least a boyish recollection of the
period to which it relates.
Less importance is usually attached to a
sixtieth anniversary than to a fiftieth or a
hundredth; but, after all, these divisions are
merely arbitrary, and are adopted for purposes of convenience. In this case there is a
special reason for a departure from custom.
A celebration was planned for the fiftieth anniversary, but was interrupted by the Great
Wai.. We were then too much occupiedi by
the anxieties of the present to be able to
give much thought to the past. Now, unless
we are to wait for the hundredth, which
probably few of us will see, we have an opportunity to do in 1927 what we planned to do in
1917.
Is there any practical value in these celebrations? Well, experience seems to show
that they satisfy some craving of human nature. No one regards as an idle ceremony the
celebrations of Christmas, or Easter, or
Thanksgiving Day. Our neighbours celebrate
the anniversary of their independence with
fireworks and oratory on a huge scale. We
may think that they are too exuberant. Certainly we in Canada go to the opposite extreme. Dominion Day in Canada, though
observed as a holiday, is hardly celebrated
at all as a national anniversary. Eleven days
afterwards, in Toronto, and I suppose in other
Protestant communities, the anniversary of a
battle in Ireland nearly 240 years ago is
celebrated with an exuberance rivalling that
of the fourth of July on the other side. On
Dominion Day the maple leaf is hardly in
evidence at all. But on St. Patrick's Day
the shamrock is worn by many of us in whose
veins there is no Irish blood, St. George's Day
for the English, St. Andrew's Day for the
Scottish, St. David's Day for the Welsh, all
receive more attention at our hands than the
anniversary of the birth of our own nation. I
have no objection to these celebrations, so
long as they perpetuate no ill-will or revive
the memory of no ancient feuds. But I do
feel that we ought to do a little more celebrating for ourselves, in a sensible way.
A visitor from the United States who spent
some years in Toronto described us as an
inarticulate people, and I have heard the same
remark from an Englishman, a thinking man,
who has made his home among us. "Does it

37

matter?" I may be asked. Well, does any
celebration matter? Are Imperialists right or
wrong in making provision for the celebration
of Empire Day? My own notion is that the
Imperialists are shrewd practical men and
women, and that we might very well take a
leaf out of their book. Do we need any such
aid to patriotism? I agree that even without
such aids much is being done. All good and
useful work, on the farm or in the factory, or
office, or pulpit, or school, is patriotic. We
are all working for Canada as well as ourselves, and I think that it may be fairly said
that Canadians, if inarticulate in speech, are
articulate in deeds that redound to the benefit
of their country. Yet I think there is need
for a little more self-conscious patriotism.
We are a nation in the making, with a small
population scattered over a vast area. We have
in the east a population divided not very
unequally between those of French and those
of British descent. We have in the west,
besides a large British element, large elements
drawn from the continent of Europe, creating
a problem which is described in the United
States as the melting pot. I rather dislike the
phrase as expressing too mechanical a process,
but I recognize the necessity of blending these
efements into a common Canadianism. We
were once threatened with a racial cleavage
between those of British and those of French
descent. That danger, I believe, is now much
less than in the past, and a great deal of progress has been made in establishing friendly
relations. We are now threatened with a
cleavage on economic and geographical lines.
We heard much of discontent in the West,
and more recently of discontent in the Maritime Province§. We have even heard talk of
secession, which I take as not expressing a
serious purpose, but only an emphatic way of
showing discontent. I am aware that for this
there must be remedies more practical than
celebrations. But much d'epends upon the
atmosphere in which the question is discussed, and from that point of view we ought
not to neglect the aid of any national and
unifying sentiment, such as may be evoked
by a worthy celebration of our natal day.
Have we anything to celebrate? Is there
anything in our history calculated to awaken
national pride? In my opinion there are
few countries which can show a history richer
in picturesque and romantic elements, or in
political instruction. In the early period of
French rule we have a great procession of
heroes, soldiers, explorers, missionaries. Concerning this, I borrow the language of

dug out. We talk of such men as belonging
to an "infant community" which needh to be
gradually educated into self-government. But.
t-hat involves an error. For such self-reliant
people it was flot so much tyranny as mere
nonsense to talk of their being governed by
statesmen and officiais living in far d[ifferent
conditions t1housands of miles away.
Out of this condition a large immigration
of Bnglish-speaking people was added to a
large French Canadian, population.
Then arose a problemn which was constantly
appearing for mnany years, occasioned by the
difference in race and largely in religion
between British and French. It was at some
times acute, more rarely dangerous, but it
ivas faced by wvise statesmanship and common
sense, and I think it may be said that, if not
absolutely solved, it is in a fair way towards
solution. The two races combinedi in the
struggle for self-government. It was a Liberal
achievement. but I am still more proud to
know that it was a distinctly Canadian achievement. For while I grudge no credit to Lord
Durbam for bis wisdom, foresight and courage,
I cannot forget that the workable part of the
programme, namely resonsible government,
was originated by the Canadian Reformers,
while they were not responsible for that which
proved to be unworkable, namely the assimilation of the French.'Canadians by the people
of our race.
It is matter of history that the old legislative union founded upon that idea proved
to be unworkable and in the effort to find a
remedy we had the movement leading up to
It was due in part to the
Confederation.
disputes between Upper and Lower Canada,
which finally caused something like paralysis
in government; partly to the need for new
channels of trade, due to the abrogation of
the reciprocity ýtreaty with the United States;
and partly to the need for better means of
defence, as to which we had been notifiedb
the British authorities that we must rely more
upon ourselves.
I will not detain you by recounting the
difficulties which were overcome. They were
overcome and Confederation was achieved by
the skill and public spirit of men of both
political parties. By federalizing the union
they substituted for a rigid bond a bond
elastie enough to admit of expansion eastward to the Atlantic and westward' to the
Pacifie. The feeble, isolated and distracted
colonies of 1864 'have given place to a commonwealth which, if not in strictniess a nation,
possesses all the elements and possibilities of
nationality, with a territory open on three
sides to the ocean, lying in the highway of
the worlcVs commerce, and capable of sup-

porting a population as large as that of the
British Islands. Confederation was the first
and greatest step in that process of expansion.
1 say wîthout hesitation that it has been a
success. There have been periods of slow

are mnere eddies in the stream of our history.
The cure for despondcncy is to look not at
the eddy but at the stream; to let our minds
rest not on short periods but on long periods.
I will not weary you with statistics, but I
invite you to compare for yourselves the conditions of 1867 with those of 1926. And I
may say that you may conveniently do that
by referring to the booklet which. bas been
distributed among you, "Five Thousand Facta
About Canada," by Mr. Frank Yeigh, as well
as to the Year Book and other Governiment
publications. Look at the growth in area; in
population; in railway mileage and railway
business; in agriculture; in manufacturing industry; in domestic and external. trade; in
insurance; in provision for education; and
your hearts will be filled with gratitude for
the past and hope for the future. Look at
the growth o f provision for defence. In 1867
there was grave anxiety as to whether Canada could defend herself in case of a war
originating on this continent, and as to
whether it might require the protection of
the Mother Country. Fifty years lýater we find
Canada more than self-sustaining in regard
to defence. I say this advisedly, because I
take direct issue with those who say that this
country is sponging upon Great Britain for
defence. Canada has been giving rather than
receiving protection, and more than fulfilling
Sir John Macdonald's prediction:
Instead of looking upen
co>lo,»', England will have
a subordinate, but still a

,nerely dependent
friendly nationpeople--to stand

Observe that phrase, "North America,"
showing that even Sir John Macdonald was
thinking only of local defense in Canada and
not even conternplating the possibility of
Canada taking a tremendous part in European
war. I do not dwell upon this, because our
part in the war is being amply commemorated
by Armistice Day and by monuments erected
ahl over Canada, and because our sorrow and
pride are fresh in our memory.
It is not for nie or for this Flouse or for
Parliament to dictate the mode of celebration.
The Canadian Ciubs have been giving much
attention 'to this matter, and I hope to sec
Parliament co-operating with this and other
agencies. I approve of the suggestion that
the cedebrations should not be confined to one
place, but sholÈd he nation-wide, so, that no
city or town or village should be neglected.

POSTPONED

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND maved the second
reading of the Bill.
H1e said: Honourable gentlemen, this ie it
Bill similar to the one which was passed by
this Chamber three or four weeks ago, granting to His Majesty one-twelfth of the supply
for the fiscal year. This represents a second
twelfth, covering the month of May.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I think it will have ta
stand over until to-morrow.
There is no
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
pressing need to take the second reading now.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: Na. I wish to say just
a word or two about the Bill, if it is ta
stand over tilI to-morraw. Tbere is an item,
No. 105, on page 28, which reads:
Hudson Bey Railway, construction and betternients,
$8,000,000.

It would expedite matters to-morrow, I
think, if tbe honourable leader would be able
to tell us a little about that item and about
the Hudson's Bay Railway. There are three
or four different notions in this country as
to what the Hudson's Bay Railway means.
I suppose that it really means a road from
Hudson Bay Junction ta Nelson, or., alternativehy, from Hudson Bay Junction ta
Churchill. Others regard it as a road from
Le Pas only ta Churchill; and others again
include in it the harbour and all the equipment of an ocean port. I cannot find out
definitely what it really is. I thought at one
time it was a part of the Canadian National
Railway ýSystem. I hope the honourable gentleman may be able ta tell us, now or tamarrow, whether it le an integral part of the
Canadian National Systema or whether it is
a piece of road that is operated as the old
Intercolonial used ta be before it was brought
inta the National System by Order in Coundil.
Then perhaps we can be informed as ta the
casts of operatîng that road. I understand
there is a train run between Le Pas and Stop
214 twice a week, but so far I have not been
able ta find any figures or accotants with respect ta that.
With regard ta the $3,000,000 which is said
tao be for construction and betterment, perhaps
the honourable gentleman will be able ta give
us an assurance to-morrow that if the Bil1
passes as it now stands the Government wilh

undertake flot to spend any part of the
$3,000,000 except on the Hudson Bay road that
le being operated between Hudson Bay Junction and Stop 214.
Hon. Mr. DA'NDURAND:
Pas-

Between

Le

Hon. Mr. ROSS: I would say that cither
one would be correct enough. There is a
road from Hudson Bay Junction to Le Pas
and then from Le Pas to Stop 214. 1 take
it that the road from Hudson Bay Junction
to Le Pas is in fairly good condition. The
other road, from Le Pas ta "Stop 214, ie the
line on which I think there ie a train twice
a week. We shall understand the situation
botter if we can get that assurance from the
Government. that no part of the appropriation that we are voting wîll be expended
outside of the road; whether between Le Pas
and Stop 214, or between Hudson Bay Junetion and Stop 214; I do flot care, which.
Hon. Mr. D'AIN.DURAND: Perhaps I can
now give my honourable friend some information, which I may supplement to-morrow. The railway le built and operated to a
certain point, but as to tbe form or extent
of the operation I cannot give preécise information. 1 will give that to-morrow.
Right Hon. Sir GtfKYRGtE E. FOSTER
My honourable friend says, "ta a certain
point." -What point is that, please?
0f course I
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
have not been on the spot. When I speak
of the Hudson Bay Railway I always see it
from Le Pas northward.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE. E. FOSTER
From Le Pas?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
northward.

From Le Pas

Hon. Mr. CORDON: Is it not from Le Pas
to Mileage 214?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 have no precise data at hand. I will get the information
for my honourable friends to-morrow. From
the end of steel to 'Nelson the road has been
graded; so that construction on the 90) miles
that need to be completed is already far arlvanced, inasmuch as the roadbed is ready.
The rail bas yet to be laid, and there are
perhaps some smali rivers ta cross. However,
I shahl give my honourable friends precise
information to-morrow.
The road does not forma part of the Canad.-an
National Railway System. It ie stili controlled
and administered by the Government of Can-

42

SENATE

ada and is under the direct supervision of
the Minister of Railways. As for the work
of maintenance and completion-I would
rather say at present the maintenance work
-the
Minister of Railways has asked the
Canadian National Railway authorities to
proceed with it for him, because they have
the equipment and can do it to far botter
advantage than any outside party. The work
that they do is controlled by the 'Government
Engineer, and they are procoeding under the
direction and with the concurrence of the
Minister of Railways as advised by his own
staff. I think I stated the other day-or, if
I did not, J had it in mind-that the sums
that are being voted, the twelfth for last
month and most probably the twolfth for this
month, would have to be spent anyway on
maintenance work on that part of the line on
which rail has been laid. The work is proceeding under the general authority of Parliament, because, as honourable gentlemen
know, all the Governments that have bren
in power since 1902 or 1904 have accepted
the policy of building the railway, and have
proceeded with the concurrence of both
branches of Parliament to do that work. The
amounts that are now asked are therefore
being voted on a principle and a policy approved by Parliament for the last 22 or 24
years. There is absolutely nothing new in
the fact that a certain sum is included in a
geieral supply bill, except that, as has been
stated, the (Governinent intend now to proceed
diligentlv to complote the road, and have
already presented some figures to the other
Branch of Parliament regarding the cost. I
understand that these figures are being reexamined closely, in order that Parliamsnt
may have as accurate an estimate as possible
of the cost of finishing the road to Nelson.
The figures which I saw in the press were
given a week or two ago, but the Minister
of Railways tells me that within a few days
he will give me some
authoritative figures
which will be in his opinion the nearest approach to an estimate.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Can my honourable friend give us, to-day or to-morrow, information as to what amount of money will
be required to put the road from Le Pas to
Mileage 214 in a reasonably good condition?
Does my honourable friend understand what I
would like to know?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: In connection with
this enterprise I have frequently seen it stated
that certain funds in existence, or prospective
funds from some source, are ear-marked. I
Hon.

Mr.

DANDURAND.

have never seen any explanation of just what
that means. I would be very pleased if my
honourable friend could give an explanation
to-morrow of that ear-marking.
Hon. Mr. DAN'DURAND: I may say that
I saw a statement that a certain area of land
had been ear-marked, and the proceeds from
the sale of this land were to be devoted to the
building of the railway. I read in the newspapers a statement from a member of the
other House to the effect that already $16,000,000 worth of land had been sold and $12,000.000 collected. That was the first news I had,
and those figures were the first to come to my
notice. However, I will try te get that information.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER:
000 been used?

Has the $12,000,-

lon. Mr. DANDUJRAND: Yes, $20,000.000
was spent on the railway, and $6,000,000 on
the terminals.
I have seen those
Hon. Mr. TANNER:
figures. but what I am anxious to do is to
get bock to the source, if it can be done.
Hon. Mr. ROBE.RTSON: I would like to
inquire if the House is to understand that
thiat vote of $3,000,000, designated as for
betterient and construction, is also being used
for maintenance of the 200 odd miles now in
operation?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I would rather
postpone my answer until to-morrow, in order
to have exact data as to what is being done.
if some work has been stcrted already, because no work bas been started this present
season.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I understood my
honourable friend a minute ago to indicate
that the twelfth of tbis vote was now nocessary in order that the maintenance work on
the existing line now in operation might be
kept up. The thought occurs, whether there
is some division as between the money voted
for maintenance and money voted for bottermuent and construction.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I had the statement of the Deputy Minister of Railways and
Canais a fow weeks ago that the twelftlh which
was voted last month, and double that amount,
wsould be needed for necessarv maintenance
work. I simply use the words as he gave
them to me, but I cannot say exactly what
it covers.

Hon. W. B. ROSS: As I understand it, the
honourable gentleman will try to give us tomorrow the full cost of the railway to Nelson;
that will include putting the whole line into

43

,MAY 5,1926
working condition f rom Le Pas to Nelson'.
But I hope he will not lose sight of imy question. He may regard it as hypothetical, but
it is important to me, and 1 trust ho may ho
able to toil us whether, in the event of ouf
passing this vote as it stands, w<e can have
the assurance from him, on bohaif of the
Government, that the expenditure of that item
will ho confined to, the road between Le Pas
and Stop 214, leaving any provision for the
road beyond Stop 214 to ho settled by anothçr
vote, or another Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANI,ýDURAND: Oh, I hope that
the 33,000,000 will ahsolutely complete the
road te Nelson.
filon. W. B. ROSS: But that is not what
I mean. For myseîf, I would ho willing, I
think, to vote for what is necessary to keep
the road in condition from Le Pas to Ston)
214, but not to vote for an expenditure
heyond Stop 214; so that if this $3,000,,000
ineans a road ail the way to the Bay I would
like to know that to-morrow, or whether the
Government will ho prepared te say: "If you
give us this interim vote we will confine our
expenditure to the 214 miles hetween Le Pas
and the end of the track."
lion. Mr. DANDTJRAND: That is to say,
the one-twelfth that this comprises?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not know;
I will have to bring that te the notice of the
Railway Department.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: When the Ministor
speaks again on this subjeet 1 trust he wvill
ho able te inform us as te the views of thie
Gevernment in regard te this railwaywhether they intend te treat it as a colonizatien railway, or as a road which, after reaching Nelsen, will have te ho cempleted by
harbour terminais, the creation of a fooet te
navigate those waters, and the enermeus cxpense whieh will he entailed in endeaveuring
te make it a port of eall as a mercantile
route for freight and passengers, especially
freight. 1 think we would like te have the
views of the Government on these peints. For
my own .part, it would make a great difference
in mny view if the road were te ho merely a
colonization road. Whether or net I weuid
vote in faveur of it, would depend, in fa et,
on whether it was te ho a colonization road,
purely and simply, or whether, after reachiug
NÇelson, the intention would ho te make it
one of the routes te Europe, entailing the
enermeus expense that will ho necessarily in-

volved if it is to be completed as a route for
navigation purpeses through Hudson .Bay and
Hudson Strait. I hope the honourable Minister will ho ahle to satisfy our curiosity in
that respect.
lion. Mr. DANDURAND:* 1 will try to
hring that statement to, my honourable friend.
Of course, I know what has been the stand
taken hy my honourable friend in the past. I
think 'he sat on the Committee fromn this
Chamber which. unanimously declared in
favour of the building of the road, and lie
was somewhat nervous and diffident as to
the navigahility of Hudson Bay.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: That report was net
at ail unanimous, though it -,as passed by a
majority in this Chamber. It was carried un
division.

Hon. Mr. DANDU'RAND: I do not know
if it ivas on division; hy our Minutes it appears as if the report had heen passed unanimously. 1 wouid not claim, however, that the
Senate did pass it unanimeusly, hbecause I
know that my honourable friend from De
Lanaudière

(IHon. Mr. Casgrain)

and

my

honourahie friend from St. John (Hon. Mr.
Daniel) were not very agreeahle to the idea,
because they were not convinced of the
navigahility of Hudson Strait.
Hon. .Mr. DANIIEL: I showed very plainly
in my remarks that the report as brought in
and passed .by a majority of t-hîs ChamheÈ
was not substantiated by the evidence that
was given before the Committee.
Hon. Mr. DANDIWAND: Weil, we will
try, since we have the experience of the cost
of the port of St. John and of that of Halifax,
net to fail into the same pit.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: But you do eut have
to buid a special fleet to go to, those ports,
as you must do if you want to go to Nelson.

reading of the Bill he placed on the Order

REMOVAL OF PORTRAITS FROM
SENATE CHAMBER
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. TANNER: There is a matter
which I wish to mention to the House; it
is tm a sense a domestic matter, with which
probably ny honourable friend opposite and
<ther older niembers of the Senate are more
tamttliar than myself. I find that some members of the House are anxious to know what
has become of a very fine portrait of Queen
Vietoria. which I understand has considerable
historic interest as weil as artistic value, and
which has been represented to me as the
property of the Senate. I understand that this
painting originally hung in the Parliament
Building in Montreal, and was salvaged when
that

structure

was

destroyed;

that

it

was

broughit to Ottawa, and for a considerable
time hung in the Sonate lobby, or near the
entrance to this Chamber, and when the
building twhich formerly stood ons this site
was destroyed by fire the portrait was again
salvaged by the officials of tie Snate. I
am informed that since then this painting has
passed out of the possession of the Senate,
I do not know why, and if is reported that
it is now hanging in one of the rooms of the
House of Comnons.
My purpose in bringing this matter to the
attention of the House is to draw the attention of bonourable members to the loss of
this portrait, and to leave with them the
question whether it is worth while for the
Sonate to assert its right to the restoration
of the painting. I find that officials of this
House and some of the members think that
the portrait should be back in the custody
of the Sonate.
Hion.

Mr. DANIEL.

Hon. Mr. MeLINNAN:
While we are
on the subject of the fine arts I would like
to call the attention of the leader of the
Government to the fact tha.t we have no
longer the two very fine portraits by one of
the greatest English portrait painters, Reynolds, of King George III and his Queen.
Unfortunately they were hung where they
could only be seen at a disadvantage. I
understood that last Session the frames of
those portraits were being repaired, but they
are still absent. It is highly desirable that
they should be kept with us, after being put
in the best order, and placed where they could
be seen to the greatest advantage.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I am unable
to satisfv the curiosity of my honourable
friend at this moment, but I will try to find
where those paintings are, and see if any other
body claims title to them. Of course, they
were in .the Senate at one time. How did
tlcy reach the Sonate? What was our titie
to them? The building, at all events the old
building, was supposed to be under the charge
and custody of the Minister of Publie Works.
Did ie distribute the furniture and the paintings at his own will? Was he making a gift
to the two branches of Parliament of wiat
hutng on our walls? I do not know, but I
will try to ascertain, and lay before the proper
authorities our riglt claim to the portrait of
Her Maiesty Queen Victoria, in whose reign
it was my privilege to grow up.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGiH'BY:
As we are
spîeaking of paintings, I should like to stay
that when I first came into this Chamber. or
shortly afterwards, the suggestion was made
in certain quarters that possibly the war
paintings that now adorn our walls would be
roplaced by others. We all know that there
is a very large number of war paintings that
have never found wall space anywhere, but
I do net know whether anything ias bcn
done in regard to that suggestion or not.
Hon. Mc. DANDURAND:
I utndcrstand
that those paintings were put here temporarily, and one cf these days we may appoint a Committee to decide if we should
try to bring this Chamber back somewhat to
the likness of the old Sonate Chamber. by
opening the galleries on both sides. J confes
that I am net yet reconciled to this form of
architecture, after having Lad before my eyes
the old Chamber of the Sonate, which I think
had no duplicate in any parliament building
in the world. Of course, I have postponed
taking up this question because of the state
of our treasury; but, as finances are looking
buoyant, I hope that before the end of this
Parliament we shall have shown such a

APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 2
SECOND READING

moved the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND
second reading of Bill 96, an Act for granting
to Ris Majesty a certain sum of money for
the Public Service of the financiail year ending the 31st March, 1927.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, in moving
the second reading of this Bill I would like
to give an answer to the questions that were
put to me 'last evening, and with your permission I will begin with the one last asked,
which will perhaps bring the history of the
Hudson Bay railway before this Chamber in
a more logical form.
I was asked if there was any foundation
for the statement that some money or some
land was ear-marked at any time for the
building of a railway to the Hudson bay. I
stated that I had seen somewhere a statement to that effect, but that I had not
scrutinized either the statement or its source.
I may say that as far back as 1882-perhaps
I am mistaken as to the date-land grants
of 6,400 acres per mile were voted for the
building of certain railways in the West. A
charter was secured for the building of the
Hudson Bay railway south of the Saskatchewan river, and north of the Saskatchewan river to the bay, and following the
issuing of the oharter a grant was given the
Hon. Mr. TANNER.

company of 6,400 acres per mile of road
south of the Saskatchewan river; but as it
was felt that peïhaps a similar grant would
not secure the building of the road north of
the Saskatchewan river to the Hudson bay,
the grant was doubled. so that it would
amount to 12,800 acres a mile.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
land to be selected?

Where was the

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I could not
give information as to where the land was
to be secured. Mackenzie & Mann built the
southern portion, extending from their railway to the Saskatchewan river. When I say
Mackenzie & Mann, I do not know whether
they were working under their own name or
under the company's name.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: The Canadian Northern.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
They did not
proceed farther northward. When the Laurier Government came into power its policy
was to abolish land grants, and it proceeded
to do so-I bave not the text of the law
under which it was. done and cannotsay whether
it was under the Dominion Lands Act or
not; but all the land grants that had not
been earned or were not in the way of being
earned were swept away.
That was in or
before 190, when the Land Grants Act was
consolidated.
In 1907, the then Minister of the Interior,
the Hon. Frank Oliver, moved for the revision or consolidation of the Dominion Lands
Act, and stated that apparently the road to
the Hudson bay was not being built, that
no advantage had been taken of the land
grant offered, and that this grant, with many
others, was being wiped away, but that he
intended to fix a rate for the pre-emption of
lands covering a certain wide area, which
could be secured by the homesteader at $3
an acre, in order to create a special revenue
to ensure the building of the Hudson Bay
railway. There was considerable discussion
of that Bill during the Session of 1907. It
was attacked because it was alleged that it
interfered with some acquired rights of railway companies that had land grants. Whatever the objections may have been, they were
felt to be so strong as to preclude the adoption
of the Bill.
In 1908 the Minister of Interior, the Hon.
Frank Oliver, came back to the House with
amendments modifying and consolidating the
Dominion Lands Act.
That was known as
the Dominion Lands Act of 1908, and when
he brought it before the House he explained
that in fixing a price upon lands which could

MAY 6, 1926
be pre-empted by anyone who was prepared
to obtain his patent as a homesteader, it was
to create a special new revenu'e which would
go to the building of the Hudson Bay railway, and that it would be fair to the West
and fair to the East, inasmueh as that railway would be built with money produced
from the sale of those lands. Here is his
statemrent in a few words-I take only an
excerpt, for the debate covers a number of
columns-which is to be found in Hansard
At page 11135, speaking of
of June 1908.
the Bill of the preceding year, he says:
Whnit I had in view was to place before Parliament
a proposition that should put beyond question the
fact that we had adequately provided assistance from
an entirely new source of revenue to enable the Hudson
Bay railway to be built. The pre-emption provision
of, the Bill of last year was placed in the Bill for
the purpose of ensuring and securing the building of
the Hudson Bay railway. It was placed there in
the room and instead of the provision which had
been in the Lands Act since 1882 setting aside a
matter of 6,500,000 acres of Northwest lands for the
building of the railway. I believe that the proposal
I placed before the House, wh.ile it was adequate and
possibly more than adequate for the purpose, would
meet the case in a way that would be acceptable to
the people of the West and to the people of the
East; that it would not in any way interfere with
or hinder or stand against the policy of the governnient; that every acre of land throughout the Northwest was there "for the first actual settler who. would
corne and occupy it on the terms upon which it was

and we considered that in presenting the Bill of last
year to Parlia«nent we wrre nasking adequate provision
for nid to the building of the Hudson Bay rairway.

Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER:

What is the

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hon. Mr. WATSON:

6,400 south of
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the Saskatchewan, and 12,800 north of the
Saskatchewan to the bay.
He brings in the Bill in a somewhat restricted fora to comply with the wishes or to
meet the objections of the year before.
Now I read from page 11,138:
The point we have in view in regard to this preemption matter is that there shall be a railway built
to Hudson bay. If we can get a railway built to
Hudson bay without any pre-emption provision at all
then I am not insisting upon the pre-emption provision.
But I am insisting on the pre-emption provision as
a means of ensuring the early building of the railway
to Hudson bay.

So it was agreed; and the pre-emption
clause went into the Act, and it produced
the following result-which may have occurred
to honourable gentlemen who have read some
of the answers that were made in the other

Chamber to various similar questions that
were put on the Order Paper there from year
to year-that the Department of the Interior
stated that there was no land, or no money
received for the sale of land, which was earmarked for the Hudson Bay railway. Well,
technically that was true. Money came to
the Consolidated Revenue Fund, but it flowed
to that fund through a policy that was established in 1908 by a Government of which the
Minister of the Interior was a member, and
for which he was speaking-a policy which
had the effect of creating a new source of
income which would go to the building of the
Hudson Bay railway.
Now, the reply of the Department of the
Interior has generally been that there was no
specific authority under the Dominion Lands
Act, 1908, for the sale of land for the purpose
of Hudson Bay railway construction, and by
Order in Council of March 16, 1918, PiC. 651,
pre-emption and purchased homestead provisions of the Dominion Lands Act were suspended, and these provisions were subsequently
deleted from the Act by the amendment of
1918, Chapter 19, Section 28.
As honourable gentlemen will see, the preemption clause of the Dominion Lands Act
of 1908 stood till 1918, that is to say, for ten
years. It was there for the purpose of creating a special source of revenue, I repeat, for
the building of the railway.
What has this brought about? The following figures give the answer. While the provisions as to pre-emption and purchase were
in force, the Department of Interior disposed
of pre-emptions approximating
12,763,040
acres, including entries since cancelled, and
as purchased homesteads 1,322,840 acres, approximately, including entries since cancelled.
The total price for which these lands were
sold was: pre-emptions, approximately $38,289,120; purchased homesteads, approximately
$3,968,520. The amounts actually received up
to February 28, 1926, on account of these
purchases have been: pre-emptions, $16,635,639.39; purchased homesteads, $3,191,648.98, or
a total of $19,827,288.37. The balance owing
by purchasers is: pre-emptions, approximately
$7,000,000; purchased homesteads, approximately $3,000,000; or a total of soma $10,000,000.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Would my honourable friend allow me a
question? The honourable gentleman has read
the totals of lands sold and purchased under
a pre-emption clause, upon which he bases
his argument that the product of those lands
was to be kept for the building of the Hud-

son Bay Railway. Would he read that preemption clause so that we may have before

18

SENATE

our minds just exactly what it says, and just
exactly what ground there is for basing his
argument upon it? Was it a special preemption clause pointing to the retention of
moneys for the purpose to which he alluded,
or was it simply a general pre-emption and
purchase clause?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It was a
general pre-emption clause, which covered
certain areas in the Northwest, more especialy
in the dry belt. There was nothing in the
Act which said in so many words that the
amounts levied on the sale of those lands
would be ear-marked or go into a special
fund for the building of the railway; but up
to that time there was no such fee or price
levied upon those lands. and the Minister
who presented the Bill said: "I impose that
price upon the sale of those lands for the
purpose of creating a new revenue which wi;l
go towards and be sufficient for the building
of the Hudson Bay railroad."
My right honourable friend will not find,
in the clause which fixes the foe or price for
those lands, the statement that that money
will go into a special fund; but the Minister,
speaking for the Government, in introducirg
the Bill said: "I am creating thereby a new
source of revenue which will be distinct, which
will be a new creation. which will go to the
building of the Hudson Bay railway. We have
swept away the land grant of 12,800 acres per
mile, and we will replace it by this enactment,
by which $3 per acre will be levied henceforth
on lands to be pre-empted."
This was new
legislation, and he affirmed and reaffirmed that
as his purpose; and very likely he said so In
1907, because he expressly stated then what
he had been fighting for. He reaffirmed it :n
1908, and said:
"I am bringing a more
modest Bill: it does not cover so large an
area as my Bill of last year, but I hope that
it will do what I have had in mind, and
ensure sufficient funds for the building of that
railwav.'
Now, that money has gone into the Consolidated Fund, but I recognize that whon
the Minister made that statement he thoulht
it was a fair proposition for the West. because
it was out of the sale of lands of the West
that this money was comring; and that it would
also be fair to the East, because the moncy
for the building of that railway would not
come from the taxation of the East. It was
a project that was dear to the heart of the
western provinces, -and he felt that he as a
westerner was doing the right thing by the
East, as he was doing the needed thing fer
Hon. Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

the West by creating a new source of revenue
for the building of that railway.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
One other question, for the sake of clearness.
That being the intention or wish of the
Minister, and that wish or intention having
been so stated, is there any record in the
Department to show that, from that time n,
books of account were kept which allocated
the money from those lands, by pre-emptions
or by sale, to the purpose for which the
Minister had wished it might be dedicated?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I read to my
friend the statement which I had in hand
showing not only the legislation of 1908,
establishing the pre-emption and other conditions for the sale of land for the purposes
of the Hudson Bay railway, but also that
this legislation. which was applied for 10 years,
had produced the figures which I gave. Strange
to say, the total money received from that
operation, which the Minister, speaking for
the Government of the day, said was to go to
the building of the Hudson Bay railway, is
about the same total which has been spent up
to this date upon the rajilway and the
terminals.

Right lion. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
But the Minister has net answered my question.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Well, I have
answered so far as my iight goes. I repeat
what bas been stated, that under the provisions of that Act of 1908 $19.000,000 bas been
collected-to be exact, $19.827,287.37-and
that by its provisions there romains due under
the qperation of that clause some $10,000,000.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
But it does not answer my question for the
Minister to say that a certain amount of
money bas been received. My question was
a specific one--were any books of account
kept in which were entered from year to yoar
and time to time the proceeds which came
from the sale of those lands, which, in the
Minister's mind, were dedicated for a certain
purpose?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Well, I -have

not at my elbow the Deputy Minister of the
Interior, but, reasoning logically, I wouid
answer in the affirmative, since he states that
the pre-emption clauses, which have lasted
for 10 years on the Statute Book, have brought
such an amount. How could he give us the
dollars and cents ýif he did not have them in
his book?

MAY 6, 1926
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: The honourabie
gentleman states that there has been $19,000,000 odd collected?
Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Can he state
Hon. Mr. SCHAFiFNER:
what amount of money has been paid out?
Oh, ye.s, I wiil
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
corne to that. Does the honourable gentlemani
mean for the building of the railway?
Hon. Mr. SOHIAFENER: Pardon me. If
the honoura;ble leader states ýthat sa, mucli
money bas been collected, are we to understand, as a great many people understand,
that it was for the specific purpose of building this raiiway?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Then, if thera
was a certain amount coliected, and a certain
amount paid out, there muet be some books
to show those transactions.
lion. Mr. DANDURAND: I make 'this
distinction. Undoubtediy the books of the
Lands Branch of the Department of the Interior wiii show to a cent ahl that has been
sold under that clause of the Act of 1908, the
pre-empting clause, and ail that bas been
colleç(ted definitively or on account, and ail
that is owing; but the proceeds of these sales
went into the Consolidated Fund, the general
fund of the country, and from that general
fund amounits were spent from year to, year
on the -building of the Hudson Bay railway.
The details of the recepit of those moneys
could be bail from the Départment of the
Interior, and th-e spending of the money was
through the Finance Department, under
orders frora the Raiiway Department.
Hon. Mr. TANNER:
I understand my
honourable friend to say that certain iandi
were appropriateil for the construction of
this railway.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Not cxactly so.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I arn coming to that.
What I want to know is wbether that preemption clause referreil to the lands in
specific terms or by specifle decription, so
that, as it were, they were eut out of a great
acrepage of the western country, and cou'ld,ble
located by surveyors, and laid out, or was it
a general charge on somne vast area- of land?
if my honourable friend understands what I
mean, was there a specifie allocation of land
described?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have just sent
for the Dominion Lands Act; but on reading
the explanations which the Minister of the

4,9

Interior gave of the Bill he bad in hand, I
see he referred to the larger area whicha 'hi
Bill covered in 1907, undeýr which homesteaders couid secure pre-emptions.
As he
met with numerous objections because of the
extent of the area, lie restricted the area in
wbich pre-emptions could be secured, and
appiied that pre-emption, privilege mostly to
the dry area, extending from as far north as
Saskatoon and as faxr south as near Calgary
and eastward. I suppose my honourable friend
will find in the Dominion LÀands Act a
description of the territory in which preemption privileges miglit lie obtained. There
is no speciai area surveyed, but a general
large region is indicated. What is most interesting for this Chamber is to know the
amount of purchase money which under that
Act wae to go to the building of the Hudson
Bay raiiway, ýbecause that is what we are
discussting at present.
Answering some other questions, I may say
that the Hudson Day railway, to which the
vote refers, that is, the one-twelfth of the
provisional supply, is the road projected
between Le Pas and Port Nelson, 424 miles.
It does not include the 87 miles between
Hudson Bay Junction anil Le Pas, built by
Mackenzie & Mann between 1906 and 1908.
In August, 1911, the Laurier Government let
the first, contract for construction from Le
Pas to Thicket Portage, 185 miles. In August,
1912, the Borden Government let the contract for the second section, from Thicket
Portage to Split Lake Junction, 68 miles. In
December, 1912, the contract for the final
section, from Split Lake Junction to Port
Nelson, 271 miles, was entered into. Work
on the barbour terminale was closed down in
the fail of 1917, and on the raÀilway in October,
1918, a month before the war ended. By
that timne, track bad been laid to Mile
332, at Rettie River rapids, inciuding the
bridge over the Nelson river at that point.
Detween 332 and Port Nelson, 92 miles, the
riclit of way bail been graded. The road was
turned over to the Canadian Northern Board
for operation when taken off the bands of
the contractor. It is an integral part of the
original Canadian Goveroment Raiiways, and,
with sucb other lines as the Intercoloniai and
Transcontinenctal,
is now manageil and
operateil for the Government by the Canadia'n National Railway Boa.rd. A fortnigbtiy mixed service is given between* Le
Pas andl Pitwitonei, miieage 214.
I have in my hand a statement showing
the expenditure on the.Hudson Bay railway
per year, starting in 1909, and on the Port
Nelson terminais, starting in 1913. I think
the figures of expenditure begin in 1913 be-

cause of the decision which was arrived at
by the Minister of Rai'lways at that time,
Hon. Mr. Cochrane, who stated before the
Special Committee of the Senate:
It was during my term of office that the Port of
Nelson was selected as the terminal of the Hudson
Bay railroad.
The selection was finally decided by
mne largely on the report of engineers. I went myself
to both places, Nelson and Churchill.
The Port of
Nelson was nearer and the railroad would be shorter.
The engineer reported that it would bu necessary to
cross the bad lands for a long distance, where the

bottom was all the way down from six to ten feet
before you got to anything like hard stuff, and I
thought the building of the road would be a very
difficult proposition.

This is the statement of the Honourable
the Minister of Railways, who said that in
1912 he decided in favour of Nelson.
I may add that the credits mentioned in several places in the following statement were
for goods that were sold as being no more
needed:

MAY 6, 1926
Might I ask the
Hon. Mr. GORDON:
honourable -Minister if the amount he bas just
mentioned is for actuel construction, and does
flot include any deficit on the road while it
has been in operation during that time?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
In the operation of the first 214 miles a de6icit has been
with us annually, and it is contained in the
operating expenses. The operating resuits for
last year were: revenues, $45,759.59;- expenses,
$79,974.24; deficit, $34,214.65. Maintenance ii
mncluded in these figures.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: That is for the one
year?
Hon. Mr. DANDURA.ND: That is for lest
year, 1925.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Has -the honourable
gentleman the deficit of eaoh year?
1I think I cen
Hon. Mr. DANUULND:
procure that before the third reading of the
Bill.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Is it indicated
whether that is meTely for the construction
of the railwey, the land set aside and the
moneys eppropriated, if suoh appropriation
there be, or whether it is for the opening of
the route plus the building of the railway?
Does it include the marine end as well as the
land? We have spent only some $20,000,000
ail told, I think, up to the present time.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We have spent

only 814,000,000 on the railway.
Hon. Mr. WI'LLOUGHfBY: Yes, and the
rest on the harbour.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The rest on the
harbour. We shaîl have plenity of time to
discuss, within these walls and outsidýe, the
advisability of reconsidering the question of
the port which should be the terminus of the
railway. I give that as my personal view,
because there is very much te be said against
the port of Nelson, and I hope there are also
some, very good things to be said for. it. 1
trust that when the metter conges to a finality
we shaîl have ocaion to discuss tihe question
whether Port Nelson or Fort Churchill should
be the location.
Hon. Mr. GRIFEBACH:
1- would like
to ask again the question which was raised
first. The Minister is ne dodbt aware that
thrqoughout the years the argument has been
that thds railway was so fer built thsL it would
ultimately be comstructed out of the proceeds
of the sale of lands set apart for the purpose.
1 wus net very strongly impreused with the
evidence which the Mimaster piqt before the
Bouse se te tha.t. Ain I to understand that
1401"à4

51

he relies soleiy upon the speech of the then
Minister of the 'Interior, or does he intend
te subniit, further evijdence Inter on, either
from the statutes themselves or from the
method cf book-keeping or aceounting, or
something else, to, show that as e matter of
fact the moneys from the sale cf these lands
were actuaily set aside for the 'building of
this railway or any railway? In the meantime the honourable gentleman seems te interpret tbe statute by what was said about it
in Parliement. That is not good forra in
court, and it is scercely sufficient evidence
now that these lands were set apart for that
purpose and for ne other.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My henourable
friend will have te, be satisfied with two outstanding fects. A Bill presented. by a Minister
representing the Government wes passed by
Parhiament on the assertion that the poli-cy
embodied in it was te creete a new source
cf revenue te be applied te a certain end. I
do net know that e government could do
enytbing maore solemn than te express clearly
what it intends -in presenting legislation. That
declaration went unchallenged and the legisletien ýpassed wit-h that condition attached and
on the understanding that the money levied
was for a -certain purpose. I have nothing but
the Gevernment policy as expressed by the
Mmnister who had the BIill in hand. Hie stated
that the land grant which thad been giýven
for the 'building cf the reilway was wiped
eut, but was replaced by a new source of
revenue in order tIret the Hudson Bey reilwey
might be ibuilt. That is aIl that I cen present
te my honourable friend. I think that the
country at large teck the statement Vhen for
what it was worth as an officiel declaration cf
poîicy.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: May I inquire in
what provinces were these lands? I sheuld
like te know aiso, if the figures given as te
the acreege represent the total area of land
that was sold in those provinees during that
tirne. And whet were the 'speeific areas?
1 am giving
Hon. Mr. DANDUTRAND:
answers whicih I tihink cover the questions that
were put te me. 1If my honourable friend
wants te obtein more minute deteils he wilI
kindîy let me know in what perticulars. se
that I -may obtain them for him if possible.
Fion. Mr. GRIESBACH: The answer ie
tontained in the Domninion Lande Act, which
mentions the lands cf the Dominion of
Canada in the provinces cf Manitoba,
Ssskatchewan and Alberta.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourablo
friend put an extended question. To the first
part of his question 1 may say that from -niy
reading of the speech of the Hon. Mr. Oliver
at the time, and fromt the description hie gave,
I understand that part of Saskatchewan was
covered. However, we can find eut by Iooking
at the Dominion Lands Act.
Hon. Mr. CGORDON: My question wits,
in %vhatprovinces are those lands tthat were
sold? Are there some of those lands in
each province?
These lands
Hon. Mr. DXNDURAND:
were undor the control of the Dominion of
Canada.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I know, but is the
acreagie which thep liroorable gentleman
mentioned as being sold ail the acreage whîch
was sold in these provinces at thait timte?
0f course. I
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
cannot apportion it iby provinces, but I couid
get that information for my ihonourablo friend
before the third reading, if we took the second
reading now.
Hon. Mr. GORDON:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Would these lands
have been sold and would the money have
corne to the Dominion Treasury if the building of the Hudson Bay railway had not been
under consideration?
0f course, I do
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
not know xvhat wxould have been the policy
of the Govornment of the day, or of the
following Governments; but in the opinion
of the Government of the day it wvas necessary
to raise some money for the building of that
railway, and the Minister ind.icated that mode
and presented i't in the statute.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Were these public
lands availablo for the purposes of settiement
and were they for sale in any event?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: They wore not
for sale, generally speaking. I ha-ve flot the
Statutes under my haiad. People were clamoring for a larger area than the quarter-section,
and t4he law prevented thern front getting a
second quarter-section. Under this Act it wae
provided that they should ho enabled t~o get
another quarter-section by pre-emption at a
certain prico, and for the first time they were
made to pay for the privilege of ohta1inïing a
seoond quarter-section; but at the samne tirne
the censideration in the mind of the Minister
was to raise some money for the 'building of
the Hudson Bay railway.
Hon. MIr. GRIESBACH.

Hon. Mr. GORDON: Arn 1 to understand
that if thie Hudson Bay railway had n-ot hen
startod these lands would not have been sodA?
Hdn. Mr. WATSON: Hear, bear. That is
right. That was a necessary inducement.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: If .the building of
the Hudson Bay ra.ilway had not been staýrtod,
would these lands in question have been sold?
That is a
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
hypothetical question, which I can hardly
answer- what Parliarnont would have docided
at a particular session if it had decided
in the previous year that there should bo no
Hudson Bay railway.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Did the buildinr of
the road facilitate the selling of these lands?
Hon. Mr. WATSON:

Yes.

answers in the affirmative.
because I do not know to what extent the
land wh:eh would come under the preemption clause was situated in Manitoba or
near that railwav.
Hon. 'Mr. GORDON: Perhaps the hioncurable leader wouId allow the honourable
gentleman fromt Portage la Prairie, thon, to
aInswer that question.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: 1 simply say that the
prospect of getting the Hudson Bay railway
was the inducement for many people to purchase those lands at $3 an acre.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: But none of that
pre-empted land was sold in the Hudson Bay
aiea.
Hon. Mr. DANDURA.ND: That is wby I
cannot answer that question.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Tbe Statute itself outlines the area. The roasen wby the
policy. nas adopted, apart frorn the purpose
of raising funds, was te give people who cecupied

areas in Western 'Canada, that were

not very productive an opportunity of elearing more land to add te their present holdings. The pro-emption law did net apply to
cther parts cf the country, where an area of
160 acres w-as sufficient.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

It is estirnated

that $3,00000 are required te re-condition
and complote the line te the present end of
tiack at mile 332. Tie and the placing cf
them. on this part cf the Iine will require
about a millioen dollars. There are at present

ballasting is also necessary; banks require to
he widened and sags raised; aleo warped rails
to be replaced. The estimate of $3,'000,'000 is
intended to cover as much of this work as
it is possible to accomplish this season.
The work of re-conditioning and completing to Mile 3M works out on an average
of a little less than $10,000 a mile. To complete to Mile 214 would, on that basie, require about $2,000,000. Two-twelfths of the
present vote of $3,000,000 would be $500,000.
To Mile 214 the road is in shape for -trains
to run over, provided great care is taken.
From M-ile 214 to Mile 332 the road is now
in such shape that it is impossible to safely
operate trains over it, owing to the condition
of the rails and roadbed. It rnay therefore
bc assumed that the cost of re-conditioning
from Mile 214 to Mile 332 will be greater
per mile than from Le Pas to Mile 214. However, it is quite clear that much more than
two-twelfths of the vote wiil be required
between Le Pas and Mile 214.
Hon. Mr. SOHAFENER: Did the honourable gentleman state about what it would
cost to continue the road from Le Pas to
Mile 214?
About 510,000
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
a mile.
My honourable friend from St. John (Hon.
Mr. Daniel) asked me whether it was intended
to treat the Hudson Bay railway as a colonization road and not as an ocean outlet.
As to that, it can be stated that it is the
policy of the Government to complete the
railway to the port, although the amount at
present in the Estimates will flot accomplish
that object. As to further expendi ture on
port facilities, that is not contemplated in the
Estimates now before the House. It is the
intention to do the work covered by the
present Eatimates with the ra.iiway'sg own
forces.
As I have stated, we shaîl perbaps have.an
opportunity next Session-I arn speaking now
on my pers'onal responsibility-to discuss the
whole question of Port Nelson.
With this explanation, whieh I have made
sa full as possible, I would ask you to take
the second reading of the Bill, and would suggest that. the third reading* be, put off till
Tuesday evening next, so tJiat anyone who
desires to examine these figures and express
an opinion on any of the various questions
that they cover mnay have plenty of time to
do so.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: Did I understand
that about haîf a million dollars would bring
the road into a proper state to the point to
which. the train is now runling?

No; 1 said
Hon. Mr. DANDURÀND:
that $500,000 represents two-tweliths, or onesixth, of the total subsidy of 53,000,000, and it
will be absorbed in that first section up to
Mile 214.
Hon. Mr. MoLENNA.N: One other point-r
could the honourable gentleman tell us the
date of the debate in which Mr. Oliver made
that statemenit?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It was on the
23rd of June, 1908. The debate starts at
page 11125 of Hansard, under the head of
".Dominion Lands Act Amendment." I have
read fro.m page 11135 to page 11138.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: Rs the undesrtaking as
given in the other House renewed here? That
is to say, are these interim Supply Bills just
for the purpose of enabling the Government
to carry on, and is it understood that they
will flot incur expenditures on anything new?
Hon. Mr. DANDJR.AND: I may say that
whatever the honourable gentleman and myself stated with regard to the first twelfth
covers this twelfth also.
Hon. Mr. CURRY: Has the honourable
gentleman any estimates of the probable cost
of the completion of the entire railway to the
harbour of Port Nelson?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, I have not.
As to the harbour at Port NelsonHon. Mr. CURRY: It might run into
$8,000,000, $10,000,000, or $12,000,000.
Hon. Mr. DANDUR.AND: We might have
a discussion upon that at next session. The
present Bill does not cover it.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bull was

DEATH 0F HON. WILLIAM MITCHELL
TRIliUTES TO HIS MEMORY

Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
gentlemen, we deplore this day the death of
an old colleague of ours, who sat in this
Chamber for more than twcnty years, the
Hon. William Mitchell. He was a son cf
the province of Quebec, and cf that very
interesting section cf that province called the
Eastern Townships. He was, in the full sense
of the word, a self-made nman. He developed
a large lumbering buýsiness, and for the purpose of bis operatione lie ýinterested himself
in the building cf the Drummend Counties
Railway. IIis main object wus te tap the
timber limits, but the Uine was no well located
thet it was purchased as a link between Levis
and St. Hyacinthe by the Intercolonial Railwsy.
Seriator Mitchells hume was in the pretty
little towui of ]9rummondville, in which he
was chiefly iuterested. He became Chairman
of tbe Protestant Board of Education cf
that municipality, and eut of his own resources he built a ehool and provided for its
maintenance.
The late Senator bad a very great cirele cf
friends becanse of bis geniality, bis kînd
beart, and bis loyaltY. When i good healtb
he attended the Seate veguierly, and we haed
the advantage of bis mature judgment and bis
business experience.

us. Siekness within the lust two years kept

APPROPRIATION BILL No. 2
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third
reading of Bill 96, an Act for granting to
His Mai esty a certain sum of inoney for the
Public Service of the financiaI year ending
the 31st March, 1927.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, in My Temarks last week on the second reading of this
Bill I mentioned the expenditure that lied,
been made in the port cf Nelson. Remembering that considerable criticiem had been
heard over the selection of that port, I stated
that prâbably before we came to the point
of equipping the port we woul have occasion
to discuse the niatter again in this Chamber.
I notice that in soine newspaper the statement hbu beein made that, speaking for the
Government, I eaid we would take up the
mnatter of the port, and finally decide as to
wb*t terminus should be selected, as between
Fort Churchill and Port Nelson. 0f course,
I simply made the statement which appears
in Hansard, and which at the time I stated
to be my personal view. As a matter of fact
the Government has not yet approached the
question, either from far or near. I simply
tbought that 'when we came to that point
a discussion might arise in this Chamber as
wveil as i the other over the justification for
the selection of the port. I statod thnt Port
Nelsou Iiad been selected .by the late TEon.
Mr. Cochrane, whe liad declared before a
Commlittee of tbis Chamber that the selection
was made after hie had visited the two ports.
1 was asked if in the Act of 1908 there had
beetn :y special area described in. wbich preemptions eould be secured fer quarter-sections.
At the moment I lied nlot the Act before me,
but in ansWer to that question I will point
te section 27 of chapter 20, 1908, of the Do-

56

SENATE

minion Lands Act.
The description is there
fully given.
It is, as stated, a territory which
is adjacent to the American line, and I 'have
a plan, which I will lay on the table, showing
exactly the area described in the Act. It is on
the dividing line between Saskatchewan and
Alberta.
I was asked also if I could indicate what had
been sold in Alberta, and what had been sold
in Saskatchewan.
I have two statements
which completely answer that question.
If
additions are made of all these figures, they
may not exactly tally with the staitement which
I read last week, but the explanation is simple,
that that statement was as of the 28th
February, while this one is as of the 3lst
March, 1926.
Moneys have been since collected on account, which increase the amount.
I need not read these figures; they are
practically those that I gave as a whole, while
these are now simply separated, because I was
asked what had been' collected from the sale
of Saskatchewan lands, and what from the sale
of Alberta lands.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: You might give us the
total for each province.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The totals appeared last week, and they vary very little.
I will give the statements.
The statement
regarding Alberta is as follows:

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Were these amounts
obtained from sales of land and pre-emptions
absolutely ear-marked and laid aside for the
building of the Hudson Bay railway?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I will try to
repeat as' clearly as possible what did take
place. The Minister, in wiping out the land
grant for the building of the Hudson Bay
railway north of Saskatchewan, from Le Pas
to the Bay-that grant being 12,800 acres per
mile-declared that he was substituting for
that land grant a certain area of land which
he described, and which I could read to my
honourable friend if he desired it, where preemptions could be obtained for $3 an acre,
thus .creating a new source of revenue which
would go towards the building of the Hudson
Bay railway. In the previous year, 1907, the
Minister had, by his Bill, covered a large
area; but objections were formulated, and
in 1908 he brought in this Bill, and said that
he hoped there wou;ld be a sufficient return
fron the sale of those lands to secure the
building of the Hudson Bay railway.
Now, I have given the figures showing what
the lands have produced. The Minister described the area, and the plan on the table
indicates exactly what it is. The description
in the Act is as follows:
Comîmencing where the west line of range twenty-six
west of the fourth principal merid-'un intersects the
nterna-tional boundary; thence east along the international boundary to its intersection with the Minineapolis, St. Paul and 1Sault Ste. Marie Railway;
thence nort'hwest along the said railway line to its
junction with the main line of the Canadian Pacifie
Railway; thence west along the Canadian Pacifie Railway to the third principal meridian; thence north
along the third principal meridian te the north line
of townshlip forty-four; thence west along the north
line of township forty-four to the Calgary and Edmonton Railway; thence south along the Calgary and
Edmonton Railway to its intersection with the west line
of range twenty-six west of the fouirth principal meridian; thence south along the west line of the said

range twenty-six to the international boundary: Provided also that this right te obtain entry for a preemîption chall not apply to any township in which an
area of eight square miles or more lias been accepted
by any railway company as part of its land grant:
Provided further that, when conditions obtaining
n any township are such as to make the requirements
of fifty acres of cultivation excessive, the Governor in
Council may fix a lesser area in respect of that
township.

This was the area which by this Act was
affected, under that new policy for the building of the Hudson Bay railway. The Act did

MAY 11, 1926
not say that that money would go into a
,special fund; but the Minister, speaking for
the Government of the day, said -that hie
hoped to secure sufficient iromn the sale of
lands under that plan for the building of the
railway. That is ail that J can state; it is
the policy which brought about the enaotment of Parliament in 1908.
Now, the money was not put into a special
fund-not ear-marked. as a specini fund. It
went into the Consolidated Fund. I recognize that any subsequent Government could
have decided to alter the policy, with the
sanction of Parliament, which is supremne:
but Parliament did not jalter that policy, but
proceéeded to carry it out in the following
year in the building of the Hudson Bay railway, and it was continued by the three Goverîiments that followed. Fromn 1909 to, 1918,
fromn year to year, the work of the Hudson
Bay railway went on concurrently with the
receipt of the moneys fr6m tie sale of those
lands that were to be levied on for that
purpose.
With these f ew remarks and explanations,
I move the third reading of this Bill.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES~: I would like to ask
the honourable Minîster one or two questions.
By the resolution passed by Parliament in
1882 or 1884, 12,800 acres of land per mile
were offered to any company that wouid build
this railway, and this land was to be north
of the Saskatchewan river.
0f that I am
Hon. Mr. DANDUR.AND:
not sure. 1 cannot say where it was to be
taken.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: It was to, be north
of the Saskatchewan river. The land that
was to be given south of the Saskatchewan
river was 6,400 acres per mile. The reason,
I think, that 12,800 acres were given north of
the 'Saskatchewan river was because the land
was not quite s0 vahiable.
Is my honourHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
able friend making an affirmnation or putting
a question?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I started out to put
it in the formn of a question. and the honourable Senator saîd hie was not able to answer.
Then I made an affirmation to a certain extent, and on that I arn going to build.
Before my
Hon, Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable friend prepares the basis of an
argument, 1 wouid like him to look at the
statute which states where that land is to
be taken, because I do not know.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: What 1 wish to ask
the honourable Senator is this. Provided the

s

land that was allotted for the building of
the railway was to be north of the Saskatchewan river and in the province of Manitoba,
what was the reason for changing that and
pre-empiting lands in the provinc-es of Sa&katchewan and Alberta? Was it because the
lands ini Aiberta and Saskatchewan were more
valuable and more easily sold than the lands
that were first given for the con.-truction of
the railway?
1 can not
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
answer my honourable friend, hecause I have
not the statute which granted the land in
1882. Por that reaison I cannot say for certain where it was to be located. But I
would draw the attention of my hionourable
friend to the fact that this land which is
mentioned in the Dominion Lands Act of
1908 is described by the Minister of the time
as being in the dry heit. I do not know
whether this indicated a land of greater or
less value than other lands, -and 1 do not
want to express any judgment as to the
value of that land. Ail I know is that hie
gives his reason for limiting the area to that
section.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: But there is no
evidence at ail in the Act that when Parliament passed it the intention was to use the
money produced to build the road. As I
understand fromn the statement which the
honourable gentleman has madc, it was thc
polîcy of the Minister of the Interior, and
hie expressed the hope that the money derived from that source might be used.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, not might
-that it would.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: But ]?arliament 'in
passing that Act neyer said it would be used
for that purpose.
Parliament
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
passed that Act upon the declars.tion of
policy of the Goverument that brought it
down. Here is the Minister, who, speaking
for the Government, brings down an Act
with certain money clauses in it, and declares
to what purpose that money will be applied,
and why hie is bringing forward this legisiation. Parliament listened to the statement
made by the Minister, representing the Government, and accepted the policy and voted
that law.
Hon. Mr. GOR DON: Is it not a fact that
every Act must stand upon its own f oundation and the language expressed in it? There
is nothing ini the Act at ail to show that this,
land was being sold only for that purpose.
1 will answer
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
niy honourable friend, I think to his satis

58

SENATE

faction. The Act itself does flot say where
the money will go. That being so, the money
went into the Consolidated Fund of the'
country, but yearly Parliament stood by the
policy enunciated by the Minister, and for
ten years and more voted the money for
the building off the railway. A new source
is indicated which will produce a sufficient
amount for the building of the railway, and
year by yetar Parliament sustains that policy
and votes the money taken out of the Consolidated Fund, and yearly the policy brings
forth its frtuits, and similar amounts are recoived from the sale of thoSe lands.
1 canflot understand the purpose off the question
off my honourable fricnd, becatise it 15 a
policy that is fair to the West becatîse the
West wbich is bent on building that railwav
will produce the xnoney for the construction
off it, and that is fair to the East, which wili
not be taxcd for that railway wbich, diverts
trade Vowards the north, And from the
moment, that polciy was initiated and the
money spent, it was with my honourabît
frjend's concurrence. He was in the House off
Commons. Did he demur to ffhc policy and
say thiat he was noV bound bDy the Actthat lie wanted the mnoney to go elsewhere,
that lie wanted the railway. but wanted it
bilt out of other money? No, my honourable friend himselff accepted thiat policy.
I see that in 1908 the honourable gentleman
ffrom Boissevain (Hon. Mr. Schaffner) was in
the Houseý and participated in the discussion.
T
Iarn under the impression that the leader off
my honourable friend ffaid that with that
money or any other money the Tailway would
be built.
At aIl events, the money was
obtained througb the new source off revenue
created by that Act, and the railway was buiît
so far as it bas gone, and with the concurrence off my honourable friends.
What
does it matiter. I wonder?
What is the interest that lies back of my honourable friend's
mind when be raises a question as to this
money being ear-marked.
t bais gone Vo the
Consolidated Fund and to the railway.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: How many railways
were mentioned in the Dominion Lands Act?
M'as the Hudson Bay railway mentioned, and,
if so, was it mentioned alone?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not believe
there were any mentioned in the Dominion
Lands Act, but there was one mentioned whcn
the Act was amendýed.
Hon. Mr. GORDON:
My bonourable
friend must know that there was no otbi'r
place for the money to corne from than the
Consolidated fund. But wby waýs this money
used for that pu-rpose?
It came from the
general fund and was not ear-marked.
Honi. Mr. DANDUIVAND.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
There is no
question but that the railway could hiave been
bujît out off the general fund; but when this
new source off income produced $19,000,000 or
$20,000,000 and the minister said, "I am crearing that new source off income to build that
railway," even thougb the money did flot go
into a special fund, but has gone Vhrough the
Consolidat-ed Fund, it bas found its way to the
railway.
Hon. M.r. GORDON: Before that Act was
passed considerable land in those provinces
had been sold,,and I would like my honourable
friend to teIl me the difference in tbe wording
off tbe different Acts that were passed. . VaýS
this Act differently worded?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I stand subjeet
Vo correction, but my information is that there
was no land sold prior to this At-tbat this
was a new policy.
People had been getting
bomesteads for nothing-, but tbey were clamouring for second bomesteads, which the law
refused them, and the nîinister said: "I wiIl
give t'hem thcir second homesteads under
certain conditions.
They may pre-empt a
neiglibouring lot, and when they bave executed their application and are entitled Vo
a patent on their bomestead, tbey may preeinpt under certain conditions whicb are stated
in the Dominion Lands Act."
This w-as a
new policy.
I believe it was the first time
that lands were sold.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL:
Was not the new
policy simply Vo give tiese people a chance
to buy pre-emptions?
Was not the preemption the new part of the policy?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Not the mere selling
off the land.
It was tbe giving to the landholder off an opportunity off obtaining a preemption.
It is the pre-emption that is new.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: For a number off years,
beginning about 1880 or 1882, a settler could
get a pre-empti-on in addition Vo bis homestead at a dollar an 'acre.
I cannot say for
Just how long that law existed, but it wa-s for
a number off years.
Hon. Mr. MeCORMICK: I would like to
know whether any off this $3,000,000 vote ivas
applied to the building off the 92-mile link?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I stated last
week that this $3,000,000 would not go beyond
the point wbhere the rails are laid.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen,
before this Bill passes, there is just a word or
two off explanation that I wish Vo make, largely
on account off some questions that I have heen
asked as Vo the scope and extent off the Bill.

MAY 11, 1926
The purpose of the Bill is to enabie the Government to carry on. That is ail it is. It
docs not deai with the Estimates flually for
the year; it ie an Interim Suppiy Biil. After
iooking over the statute and consulting with
oid parliamentarians, I find that prior to, 1918
the Interim Supply Bill wis different in form.
from the one befoore us. It a1waye had two
schedules abtached to, it. One schedule ga've
the Governmeft, of the day the whole of any
itemg that were voted by way of supply, and
the other contained not ail the items in the
Estimates, but a eected number of those
items, and th~e Governmelbt got a grant of
one-sixth from time to time until finally the
In 1M18, inimaàn Suppiy Bill was passed.
Istead of the sdhedules the Estimates were
used. This was done on a certain understanding that, is made very clear by a discussion that
took place on the 4th of May this year ini the
other House hetween Sir Henry Drayton and
the Minister of Finance. It will be found, on
page 3235 of the House of Commons Hansard,
M4r. Robb moved the resolution which is the
the substance of the Bill now before us:
Mc. Itabb xnoved:
B.esolved, that a %umýnot eoceed.ing $15,034,291.06
being one-twelfth- of the ainount of enoh of the seveml
itemis to be voteti as set foetjb in t-he Main Es4timates
for the fi"ca yeear ending Maroh 31, 1927, isk1 before
tIhe Hotue osf Comnn at the present, ameion osf parliarnent. be granted te Hin Maifesty, on aocount for the
fiscal year eMng Mai'oh 31, 1927.
Sir Henry Drayton- It la underwtooti, e4pin that the
resottion is agree<f to, on the terma allready 5tipuls.ted:
nothing b; consented ta, no righte axe waived anti the
preâent proceclure may not be usei <fortihe purpose of
authorizing any new expenditures.

Mr. Robb:- Quite s0.
The way that has worked out since 1918 is
that the Goverament is given a seemingly
large grant-to-day it is one-iweifth, and
we have already given one-tweifth--with the
understanding that it applies only to those
things which have already been aut'horized and
that the Govrerament will not use any part
of the grant on things that are new and not
yet authorized by Parliament Bo when the
honourahie leader on the other side of the
Rouse tels us tiat the twa-twelfths contailled
in the two lnterin Supply Bis wil entirely
provide for the road that ls bei*ng ope.rated
between the Pas and Stop 214, if not more.
then i cannot sze that thie Bill ducs anything
more than give the Government what is in
the nature of ordina-ty -annual suppiy for
taking care of this piece of road, and the
whole question of what happens 'beyond that,
or what happens in the Bay or out in the
Straits is for the future and is stili to be
settled by Parliament. I ame making thise

expianation bccause severai persons have asked
me just what the scepe and the meaning of
the Biil are, and 1 de not think theTe can be
any mieunderstanding of it with this plain
statement made in the oCher House, which of
course would ho binding here.
Hon. M'r. DANDURAND: In the very
numerous answers that I had to give to questions that were put there may appear to, be
some confu8ion. There is none in my mind
as to the first and second twelfths being hardiy
sufficient t-o go te Mile 214, but 1 ýadded in reply
te other questions put that the .read was built,
with rails laid, to Mile 3,32, and that the
S3,OOOOO would not go beyond putting the
railway in perfect order as far as the rails were
laid.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: That is aIl right. The
amount might put the rails in ordèr a11 the way
te Mile 332, but, as the Biii stands now, al
the Government can take under this Bill is
money 'for the road that le in operation, which
they are working as a going concern and for
which they mu4t have supply- unless they are
to close down. But if they are going to roake
expenditure heyond Mile 214, they will have
to wait until the final Bill is passed.
Hipn. Mr. DANDURAND: 0f course, 1 do
net know what kind of work is needed beyond
Mile 214 for maintenance, because what applics
in respect to maintenance beyond Mile 214
and what applies before may be exactiy on
the same fo(eting.
The motion was agreed to, aRd the Bill was

60

SENATE

He said: Perhaps it is due to the House to
offer a few words of explanation as to this
Bill. There are three branch lines contemplatcd :by it. One you will find indicated
in paragraph (a) of Section 1 of the Bill: it
is a uine in the province of Alberta running
northerly for ýfifty or sixty miles from the
Bassano branch. The next one is referred to
in paragraph (b) : a line from a point on the
northwesterly line originating at Moose Jaw,
to run away up noîlth and thence on to
Edmonton.
The proposition is to build a
uine from a point at or near Rosetown, which
is west of Saskatoon, some forty or fifty miles
to a point on another branch line called the
Pheasant His branch. The other one is
an extension provided for in clause 2, which
would enable the Company within two years
after the passing of the Act to, build a line
already provided for in a Statute of 1920, from
a branch line, again not very long-forty or
flfty miles perhaps--from Pheasant Huis
branch in a northwesterly direction. They
are both west of the city of Saskatoon.

naine of the Dominion Express C-ompany to
that of the tCanadian Pacifie Express Oompany. and I desire to move, with the consent
of the Senate, that the Bill do now re:ceive
the third reading.
Hon. Mr. MeMEAY'S: It'is very unusual
to change the naine of our corporations.
-Somebody might have an objection to it. I
'have no objection, but I can conceive that
the naine might be confused with others.
ljnless there is some important reason for
hurry, I do flot see why the Bill should have
its third reading now.
Hon. Mr. HAYDON : I have been informed
that the Canadian Pacifie Ra.ilway ia simply
asking that its express company, formesqy run
-under the namne of the Dominion Express Coimpany, may t-ake the railway's name, and that
the railway's express company mnay have a

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill

CANADA EVIDENCE BILL (EVIDENCE
0F PERSONS CHARGED WITH
OFFENCES)
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. McMEANS moved the second
reading of Bill 13, an Act to émend the
Canada Evidence Act as regards the evidence
of persons cbarged with offences.
He said: This Bill is similar to the one
introduced by myseif in this House last year.
At that time it was considered advisable, before passing sucb a Bill, that the different
judges, attorneys generai, and ail those having
to do with the administration of criminal
justice, 8hould be asked to give. their opinions.
Those opinions have been given, printed, and
distributed to eacb of the members. I do not
know that I can add anytbing Vo what I said
last year in connectien witb the bill. Its
obj ect is simply to bring the Canada Evidence
Act into conformity with the English Act.
Under the Canadian Act a man charged
with an off once may give evidence on bis
own-hehalf, but if hie does flot do se the -fact
cannot be commented on cither by the judge
or by the prosecuting counsel. The difficulty
is that a man giving evidence on bis own
behaif can be cross-examined as to previeus
convictions; so be is in this position, that if
bie does not go into the box and give evidence
the jury very weli know that lie could have
gone into the box and denied the crime, and
they will say to themselves that be might
have denied on oath the commission of the
offence. But they do not refleet that if he
bappens to be one of those unfortunate men
who committed previous crimes hie can be
examined as to those previous offen-ces. The
consequence is that bis refraining from giving
evidence bas a very serious effect on the
minds of the jury, and sometimes bas the
effeet of increasing bis sentence.
Under the Engiish Act a man accused of
a crime .may go inVo the box, but hie cannet
he exagained as to previous convictions. The
presiding judge, if bie thinks it his duty to
do so, may comment te, the jury on tbe fact
that the accused did net go into the box.
Under the Canadian law, if the accused
does not appear as a witness there la ne
comment, but if hie goes into the box ail
previeus convictions may be given in evidence against him. It is the policy of the
English law that if a man commits one offence
he can only be tried for that, and flot tried

62

SENATE

for other offences when charged with but
one offence. Our Act was passed in 1893,
and the English Act was not ýpassed till 1898.
If any honourable gentleman desires te
have any further information on this matter,
he should read the very exhaustive report
which was made by the Chief Justice of the
King's Bench of the province of Manitoba,
who goes into the matter at great length,
traces it historically, and gives several reasons
why he thinks this Act would be of great
benefit to- this country. If this honourable
body consents to the second reading of the
Bill, it might then be referred to a Committee before whom these different opinions
would be laid.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is one of
the clauses of the Bill that has been mentioned, but there are others.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: The other Bill was
one that was brought down from the House
of Commons, in which they struck out the
word "perjury," and provided that any evidence a man gave on a trial could net be
used against him in any way, and that Bill
exepted perjury. I suggested at that time
that it be referred to a Committee; but of
course that Act is dead, and it will have to
be introduced again.
The consensus of
opinion, however, is very strong against it.
When that Bill reached this Chamber it was
referred to a Committee at the same time,
when the opinions were asked concerning the
Bill about which I have been speaking, and
the same parties were also asked their opinion
on that Bill. If the opinions were favourable, I presume it would be the duty of this
House to re-introduce that Bill, and send it
back to the House of Commons.
It is a matter of regret that iso few opinions
have been given by judges and attorneys
general throughout the provinces on legislation so important as this. We have some
opinions here that were given by judges of
remote county districts, one by the Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, and
others. A large number are strongly in favour
of the Bill-I will not say the large majority,
because I have not gone through the matter
sufficientlv to say so. I would suggest that
it go to the Committee, and that they report
back to the House.
Hon. Mr. WILLOiGHBY: I would like to
know if the honourable gentleman has looked
into the discussion that took place in England in connection with their existing law,
and as he proposes it should be, and if he
ever discussed what we have now and what
they have not got in England. This Bill is
Hon.

Mr.

MeMEANS.

introducing what the honourable gentleman
considers an improvement on the existing law,
and I think it is; but it strikes me that there
must have been a discussion in the English
House before the completed Act was passed
by that House, in which there are so many
eminent lawyers, ex-judges and others accustomed to administration of law.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I can only say, in
reply, that Chief Justice Mathers made a
very exhaustive report on the matter. He
traces the law evidence from the year 1695;
but the law moved very slowly, and the
accused were denied the right to give evidence at all. In the early Stuart period that
right was conceded, but it was net till after
the Revolution that witnesses for the defence
were, permitted to be sworn. Speaking about
the English Act, he says:
After tih Canadian Crimtinal Evidence Act had been
in force five yeaIrs, the Timperial Parliamient, in 1898,
passed what is known as the Imperial Criminal
Evidence Act.

They must have had the Canadian Act
before them at that time. He proceeds:
LAke
lie Caniadan Act, i
moakes every parson
charged witi an offence, and his wife or husband, a
competent witness for the defence, but in ttwo other
important ispects it
loes not follow our Act.
By
setion 1 (f) it eiacis that "A person charged and
called as 't witness in pursuiance of this Act shall not
he asked and if asked shall not be jequired to answer
any questions tending to show that he has comtmitted
or been convicted of or been oharged wtth any offence
other thtait that wherewth hie ts then charged, or is
of ban character, etc."
It then enunerates the exceptions as (1) when eviduee of a previous crime would
lbe adducable to proe the etrte charged; (2) where
tie lus sougit te establish his own charaeter or
attaeked the eharacter of the prosecutor; or (3) has
given evideice against any other person charged with
the samie offence. Under the Iniperial Act an accused
person nay safely go into the witness box on bis own
bebalf, ne matter what bis past has been, because he
imust not be asked about previous criinal practices,
or as to his character, ecepit hi the cases mentioned.

I need net take up the time of the House
with further quotations. It is a very exhaustive report, and if the Bill goes to the
Committee it can be read there.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I will read
those opinions, if I have not already read
them. When were they gathered and printed?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
They were, received since the last Session of this House,
by the Clerk of Committees.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I have not
taken cognizance of those opinions except that
they were distributed te the members of the

Hon. Mr. McMSEAN'S: The only way I can
answer that is by pointing out that prior to
1893, when the Canada Evidence Act camc
into force, 'the accused, or the husband or wife
of the accused, could not give evidence at ail.
The honourable gentleman will recollect that
verv often counsel for the prisoner would say
to the jury: "We regret that this mani cannet

gentlemen, if bie were allowed to go into that

SECOND READING
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT moved the second

provisions of the Griminal Code respecting
the possession of weapons.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Honourable gentlemen, the title of the Bill giv es a pretty fair
idea of its purpose. It is the same Bill which
I had the bonour te introduce in this lieuse
in the year 1921, and provides for the saine
remedies. At that time the Bill vas read a
first time, but on the second reading, after
a discussion took place, the debate was
adjourned. and the Bill was net reaehed aga.in.
The Bill, 1 think, was amply justifled and.
I should say, wvas demanded by public opinion
Hion. Mr. BEIQUE.

Since. then the demand for
at the time.
legislation of this kind has very greatly
increased. Lt is a matter of public notoriety,
that the use of revolver, for instance, which
is one of the weapons that I arn trying te have
removed from seciety. has very much increased.
Whether this is a result of the war and the
familiarity bred at that time by the promiscueus use and display of arms I am not
l)rqpared te say, aitbougli I think the war is
a factor which bas contributed very largeiy
te extend the use of the revolver.
We knew that the provision which bas existed in the Criminal Code for the purpose ef
preventing the possession and carrying of
revolvers and other weapons tas neyer really
been obsorved: anyene at any time can go and
purchýase a revolver; even beys in their %teens
can go and buy a revolver or an air gun or
s-ometbing of that sort.
Statisties te-day show that a very large percentage of the crimes cemmitted atre committed gticc.esfiilly simply because it is se easy
te procure a revolver or some other weapon
which cao be concealed upon the persan, and
'thbat thýere is a demand for some drastie
measure in the United States, in England, and
in France, cao be shown by newspa.per extracts
which I have collected since the Bill was
submitted the first time.
When the Bili was
first before the lieuse I had the pýrivilege of
reading a number of newspaper extracts which
1 think were vPry convincing, and I now have
a number of others which have appeared since,
and which contain an almost universal demand
not only for a stricter measure te guard the
public against the danger of firea.rms, but for
a law te poohibit the manufacture, importI could cite a

large number of newspapers in wbich that
opinion is expressed clearly and empbntically.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Does the bonourable
gentleman propose te prevent importation?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes, that is tbe
main object cf this Bill.
Lt is true that I
bave taken advantage of the Bill te de«1 witb
the provisions with regard te weapens nrow in
the Code, and 1 miay say that 1 bave suppressed several articles cf the C'ode for the
purpose of removing what bas been the source
of embarassrnent and confusion te the courts
in carrying eut the present provisions -of the
Code in this respect. But that is net the main
purpose cf the Bill. The main purpose of the
~Bill is te, prohibit the importation, manufacture and sale of the weapons described ini

MAY 11, 1926
Hon. MT. BELCOURT: That is provided
for.
The use of the revolver is limited to
those people who are authorized to use it for
police or railitia purpoeses.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: How wiould they get
themn if 'the importation and manufacture were
.prohibited?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The importation
would be placed under the control of the
authorities of the country.
It may be that
the only way to accomplish such a purpose
would be for the Dominion Government ta
provide that the importation of firearms should
be under the control of an officer specially
appointed for that purpose and responji'hle to
the government.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Then you would permit some revolvers to, be imported for that
purpose, but you would flot permit any to be
manufactured.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: 1 would make no
distinetion between manufacture and importation.
I want to prohibit the manufacture,
importation and sale, except under strict govîernment control. This I do not think should
*be government fonction, but it must be performed by some officSi direcdy responsible ta
the government.
Under the Bill nohody else
would bc allowed to import, buy, or manufacture a revolver.
A great many -of the
,erime-3 to-day are the result of the promiscuous
uise of the revolver, and that is the only way
.)-ou are going to prevent this class of crime. I
do. not know whetiher honourable gentlemen
care at this late hour of the night to hear
these newspaper extraots, but perhaps I may
'be permitted ta read a few of them. Ulere is
one. Judge Kapper of New York says:
Bardly a day passes, that we do not read of 'holdups sund rdh'beries by armed mn.

.sbould say tbat, with this idea carried tlirough, violent
crime wculd sisortly ha maiteriallly leusened, m.d within
-a reasenable period of time would substantially disappear.

The next article is taken firomn one af aur
local newspapes--the Evening Journal. Iii is
entitied. "Why n-ot?" and reads as follows:

No gond reasco against this prohïbitioqs exista.
Revolvers are useless except for crime or war, and net

Civilza.tion could stop the revolver; but ne country
needs wait in tis matter -for any otiser. Any country
rould advantgeously prohibit the revolver within ils
imits. Why net Canada?
Will net anme Member cf Parliament or Senator
move to ibis effect?

The following is part of an article whîch
appeared in the Ottawa Journal. I will read
only two orothree lines of it:
Tise conimon sense ef the revolver question la te

Another anc is entitled "The Revolver." It
says:
Six factories in eue town i Spain are devoted te
the mantufacture of cheap revolvers, and 500,000 of
thene murderous NvEapona are exported te the United
Sta.tes eath year n the erders of consciencelesa.

Tise tariff comnmission

Penny wise, pouud fooliss. If there is any gond
argument for stopping tise importation of cheap
revolvers, tise aame argument ta gond for stoppiog tise
importation cf ail revolvers. If revolvers are an evil
thing, are they any Ilas evil weien they are of the
iniogt efficient aud dendly kind, as expeusive revolvers
are?
And if gond argument exists egainet importation cf
revolvers because they are evil. does net the sae
argument apply against home marnufacture?
Why permit revolvers, et aIl? Even Dur police are
net supposed to shoot firat.

Judge Ackerman, of New York:
I do ot know cf ne single case where a revolver,
legally carried by a permit, stopped a hold-up or a
burglary.
The hold-up man la alwaya ready and

Very well. I move
that the report be taken into consideration
on the 25th of May next.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may as well
state now what is my objection. For a number of years it has been the consensus of
opinion in the Senate, inasmuch as the House
of Commons had only two officers at the
Table for the much heavier work it has to
carry on, that when the occasion came we
ought to reduce our representation at the
table ta that of the House of Commons. That
has actually been done. I cannot understand
why, in the reorganization which is before
us, the position of Second Assistant Clerk at
the Table is net dropped, for I have been
under the impression that we would not appoint a third officer at the Table. It is somewhat dangerous to maintain a vacancy, because temptations may arise.
That is the
reason why I ask that the report be not taken
now.

communication with the governments represented on
the Concil of the League of Nations and submitted
to thei a memorandum having for its object the
ellicidation of certain problems of importance connected with Germany's co-operation i the League.
As will be seen from the memorandum, a copy ci
wlich is appended hereto, the object was to ascertain
thue attitude of the said goveraments with regard to
G~ermauuy becoming a memiber of the Council of the
Lengue of Nations as well as with regard. to the
participation of Germany in the sanctions provided for
in Article 16 of the Covenant. The memnorandumn
was also intcnded to informn the snid Goyeruments of
Germany"a viciva concernmng certain other points connected with the question of Gernuany's adhesion to
the ceague.
Trhe German Governmeut has now received the
answers te the Memnorandum. It notes with pleasure
ihat uts decision bas been accorded foul approval in
the replies furnished by the Powers represented on
the Council of the League. The Germen Government, moreover, believea the replies justify it in
concluding that its wish for Germany to have a seat
on the Council of the Leaguie ie being favournbly
considered by the Governoiienta now represented on
the Couincil.

On the 14th of M-arch, 1925, the Council
answered that note of the 12th of December,
saying:
The Coutneil notes with satisfaction the declaration,
witl, which that commrunication opens, that the Germuan Governiment are of the opinion that the 'political
developreents during the pat year have rendered it
possible for Germany to join the League", together
with the stateunent in the enclosed memnorandumn that
the Germen Government have "decided to seek the
early admidssion of Germany" te the League of Nations.
The German Governmcnt have already consulted the
ten Governments who are repreaented on the Counicil
and inive -received
uh-oritfïtvs rlYe1 I-o-m alFd-f
them. Any observations which cen now bie made by
the Council, composed as it ia of representatives of
these saine Governments, will obviously not be at
variance witl, those replies.
The Couneil is glad
therefore. to lealro that, with one exception, which is'
deait with later, the replies are satisfactory to the
Germen Goveroment.

The "one exception" to which, the Council refers does flot bear upon the permanent
seat asked for by Germnany but upon the interpretation of Article XVI of the Covenant.
After that answer of Council the way
,seemed fairly clear, and after the Locarno
agreement Germany proceeded to ask its admission to the Assembly. Its application was
made on the 9th of February, 10M.
The
Council met on the 13th February to consider the application, and decided to cali a
special session of the Assembly for the 8th
of March.
To the minds of those who look back upon
those proceedings there now appears a strange
situation. Unanimity ini the Council was essential. for the granting to Germany of a
permanent seat. When the Council met on
the l3th February to consider the application
of Germany it knew of the condition precedent that was required by Germany, and with
that knowledge it proceeded to caîl the As-

sembly. Now, the query is in every mind,
why was not the question raîsed on thle l4th
of March, 1925, when the answer to Germany
was given by the Council? The answer of
the Council to the petîtion of Germany, in
which Germany stated that it had sent a circular t0 the ten Governments, contained the
statement that those ten Governments seemed
agrecable to grant Germnany a permanent
seat, aind the Council took note of the fact
that those Governments had so answered.
The Council was composed of the representatives oi those ten Governments that had received that circular. Why was not that question put again on the l3th of February last,
when the special meeting of the Assembly was
called to consider the request of Germany to
become a member of the Assembly?
The
Council knew at that moment that there was
a condition precedent--that Germany should be
assured of a permanent seat. It is somewhat
difficult to say why, but my surmise is that
nine of the ten states having answered unequiivocally in the affirmative, and not being
apprised of the evasive answer of Brazil, took
for granted that there wvas unanimity in the
Council.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUTE: What was the answer
of Brazil?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The answer of
Brazil was only disclosed to the world when it
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: When, and what was
it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will read the
statement made by Mr. de Mello-Franco,
when he declared that the position of his
Government was irrevocable and final against
granting a permanent seat to any one if
Brazil did not get one.
Right Hon. Sir GEýORGE E. FOSTER:
Has my honourable friend the answer of the
Brazilian Governiment to the inquiry made
by. Germany?
Honl. Mr. DANDURLAND: I arn just about
to read it. Mr. de Mello-Franco, on the
I7th of March, 1926, had to mount the rostrumi
and explain bis veto. The request of Germany
f0 enter the League had been referred to t-he
first Commission, caqled the Political Commission, presided over hy Sir Austen Chamtberlain. It had approved, and when tihe
Assembly met Sir Austen Chamberlain was
called upon to make the report.
He was
the Ohairman and Rapporteur. Mr. Chamberlain, mounfing tihe rostrum, said:
The proposition which 1 have the honour to make
to yoti cependa upon a declaration which bas been
made to me by the honourable representative of Brazil.

ready to accede to the present demand of
Poland.
Great Britain, through Sir Austen Chamberlain, at the very first opportuoity it had in
Geneva, notified the. Poli-,h Delegation that
it would not have Great Britain's support
for a permanent seat. Poland realizing the
situation, tceased. ta, caima a permanent seat
and said that it would be content to bave
an annual seat if the Countil, when voti.ng
a permanent seat to Germany, voted for the
establishmen!t of a, seventh annual seat in
order that Poland mdght imvmediately enter
the Couqncil. Germany refut-ed that profposai.
There was considera'ble digoussion aver the
request of Poland for the creation of a, seventh
seat. A new permanent scat was being created
for Germany, and Poland was getting considerabie support for another annual seat. But
Sweden, whieh bas a vote in Council, being
one of the six Mexubers elected from the
Assembiy, deciared that it would put ite veto
upon the entargement of the Coaci outside of the admission of Germany to a permanent seat.
At that juncture there was a deadlock.
What was to be done? Many newspapers
were assailing Sweden rather sharply, because
it was sup.posed to be the mouthpieee of
Germnany. Sweden resented this imputation,
and in order to sbow that it was absoiutely
disinterested in the matter it offered to resign
is seat-in--the-Councif-anct thus-nnke -an
opening for Poland. Everybody thought that
that was tbe solution. Sweden wouid resign,
there would be a vacancy among the elected
Members, and Poiand would get that annual
seat. To the surprise and dismay of ail,
Germany again refused that offer of Sweden.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: May I ask,' wbat
wvas the reason given by Germany at that time
for not accepting that proposition?
Germany
DANDURAND:
Mr.
Hon.
ciaimed that the Assembly had been called
simply for the purpose of giving it a perrmanent seat; that it had been so stated to
the Reichstag; that ail the people of Germany feit that this was the day of Qermany's
re-entry into the concert of nations and that
it should have the whole stage to itseif.
Those are flot the actual words which were
officially spoken, but it couid be gathered
from a reading of the German papers that
Germany felt slighted at the idea that Poland,
in order to protect itself fromn the doings of
Germany in the Council, was insisting upon
entering at the same tixne. There is, I understand, considerable bad blood between the
two nations, and the newspapers had worked
up public opinion to such a degree that the

7

representatives of the Government did not
feel safe in returning to the Reichstag if they
Arere obliged to enter the Council arm in
armi with their neiglibour Poiand, who in
,heir estimation had dispoiled them of the
territory which I have just mentioned. That
was the situation. It must always be remembered that wben a iDelegate was expressing his
opposition to a proposai it was public opinion
in bis own country, and sometimes near-by
electoral or parliamentary opinion, which
forced hini to take the stand he did. At that
stage sympathy, which had gone considerabiy
in favour of Germany, veered against it, because it seemed unreasonable that a proposai
so fair as that of Sweden to resign its seat
should be rejected by Germany. There was
considerable depression throughout the various
delegations. I was in contact with many of
them. 1 could see that there was despair in
the hearts of those who had been carrying on
those negotiations. Mr. Briand stated that he
could not understand the position of the Germans a nd would await their counter offer. The

matter of fact, Germany feit tha t it had lost
the sympathies of the Delegations, and the
next day made a step towards conciliation in
declaring that. it would enter the Council with
two new Members, but not with one oniy. It
would not agree to Sweden's seat going to an
ex-aily, orjinother words,-to Poland, but that
if some near friend of Poland would resign
with Sweden, Germany would then consent to
enter with the two new delegates of the Assembly. So Mr. Benès was appeaied to, and
be said: "I will consuit my Goverument, but
you rnay rest assured that within a few houri
I shall put my seat at your disposai." CzechoSiovakia, which had been elected to a seat from
the Assembly, offered to resign with Sweden,
in order that Czecho.ýSlovakia's seat might be
taken by Poiand and Sweden's by Norway, or
Holland, or Denimark.
You can imagine, honourable gentlemen, the
relief that this proposition afforded to ail the
Members, who had been waiting from day to
day to see the end of the entangiement,,when
it was found that at iast the trouble had been

There is ne use elosing Our eyes te the fact
that there was real consternation in the
Assembly when the resuit of ail that work
proved abortive; but 'I realize that outaide
the Assembly there was stili, greater con6terna(tion. In the Assembly the' memLbers
had bpsen so fparf.ul of a division between the
Great Powers that they were mueh relieved
when that danger vanished, and the Brazilian
incident was taken as a simple accident resuiting from the rigid. rule of unanimity. Outsade
of the Assembly consternat ion was greaterand why? Bacause the !press correepondents
had led the people to believe fantastic stories
of eonspiracies andi plot.tings between the
nations of Europe. Those machinations were
pure fabrications. I stated in a speech in
London 4hat the war correspondents had not
been demobilýizeti, fhat they were stili on the
war-path; th.at although noxious gases were
being pro-hibited by -the League of Nations,_
the foreiýge correspo-nidents were peisoning
,publie Opinion every morni.ng. The phrase
I used, "war correspondents on the war path,"
was but a figure cf speech. I had in mind,
and I did mention, the foreign correspondents
whe daily cable to Arnerýcan and Canadian
newspapers from London and the continental
capitals. I cou-Id give dozens of their dispatches which have oreated. the impression
and the conviction that the European
ceunt ries are liere and there and every-where
stcheming and plotting against each ethier.
The necessary effdet cf this work in America
is to create suspilcion of and contemipt for
the European Governments. Those correspendents think that they must be sensati-onal, and when they are not anelodramratic
they suggest or maguify incidents into
tragedies.
I will give but one example of their handiwork. The incidenta whie'h developed at

resuit of the legitimate ambitions of the
various countries involveti. We see public,
opinion in those countries asserting itself,
and i need net stress the dlaim of Brazil
for a permanent seat. Brazil says: "Yeu have
three European representatives occupying

77

permanent seats; Germany will go in; that
South America *has ne perwill be four.
manent seat. This Council is becoming a
Eurepean instrument or organizatien. Is not
South America, with its eîghteen republies,
important enough te have a permanent,
seat?" And when Brazil speaks thus, it is
South Aançrica, represented by Brazil which
is claiming that it is entitIeti te a permanent
seat. I say that in order that one may grasp
the reasen for the action cf each country.
*Hew did the press correspondents, during
the wekls preceding the reunion at Geneva,
present those questions te the American and
the Canadian public? We were told that a
plot wa.s being hatehed te secure for tihe
Latin nations the control or domination of
the Council. We were teld that France andi
Italy were plotting te :bring Spain and Brazil
into the Counci'l in order te increase their
influence and power ever the Angle-Saxon
group compeseti of Great Britain, Germany,
and the northern nations. One correspondent
went further. He saw a plot, headed by the
Pope, te ensure the hegemony of tihe Catholie
Church in the Couincil. This was a most
viexeus propaganda, as it tended te raise
suspicion hotween two important groups of
people on racial and religious lines.
This was the situation when I lef t Canada
fer Europe. When I landeti in Europe, what
did 'I flnd te be the fact? Latin andi Catholie
-&hpronieSpain as far back as 1921 hd
of' a permanent seat from a country neitiher
Latin nor Catholie-Great Britain-as deeclared efficially in the House cf Cemmons cf
Great Britain by Mr. Baldwin, when the
Lloyd George Government was in power.
France had shown eympathy for only one
country, andi that wa.s net a Latin countryFrance had declareti sympathy for Poland,
its ally on the other side cf Germany. Mr.
Briandi explaineti that France favored
Poland's entry into te Council se as te
enable Germany anti Polanti te tiiscuss their
divergences by a direct andi friendly contact
while ethcrwise 'France, which wants peace
with Germany, would risk being in a constant
wrangle with her over Poland's affairs.
The representatives cf ail the countries
at Geneva were
that were gathereti
animated by
te best intentiens, andi
were working fraternally toward an amicable
solution. AUI those nations that were supposeti te be wrangling amongst Vhemselves
were working hand in hand te finti a solution
that would be acceptable te the whole Assembly. We must beware, honourable gentlemen,
of the correspondents who see in Europe
nothmng but rivaîries, suspicions anti hatreds.

MAY 12, 1926
We must not be surprised that there are
serious differences of opinion in a League of
55 nations, where public men from ail those
nations corne together, where very dificult
questions are up for discussion and decision,
and wliere generally the feelings of delegates
are strong in proportion to the vastness and.
distribution of the questions themselves, and
the consequences which may grow from thern.
In n conference of 55 nations we must look
for differences which go deeper than those
which stir smaller aggregations. But, after
all, wlien we take the history of the League
in its critical moments we find that those
strongiy-marked differences are ahl overshedowed and rnellowed in the end by the
one great idea that dominates the whole-that
we are aIl a human brotherhood, and that it
is best that peace-should dominate, and that
war should be thrown into the dîscard. That
is the conviction that icomforts and animates
me, and 1 arn sure ail others who watch with
interest the work and progress of the League;
and tliat is the thing tliat gives hope and
courage for the future.
I arn not going to comment upon what bas
taken place in detail, but there was one step
whicli, if it had been determinedly taken,
would, I think, have obviated ail this difficuity. When the arrangement was made with
Germnany on the besis of the Locarno pacts,
and those pacts were only tq be put in operation when Germeny should become a memaber of the League and have a permanent
pl >ace upc>n the Council, the process of carrying out that agreement was a simple one.
None of these difficulties would have arisen
îf no intimations had been made that possibly
this or the otlier thing might lie done at the extraordinary meeting of the League that was
called for the one purpose only. But somehow
or other the idea got abroad that there was a
possihulity that at that extraordinary meeting somnething else miglit lie done in addition
to what the meeting was definitely called for;
and the moment that that idea began to
work, there developed sentiments of personal
pride in the man, national pride in the nation,
and the desire for beîng even with or ahead
of another nation; ail such difficulties cropped
up, and first one and tlien. another made a
bîd for a permanent place, and wanted it
secured at that special and extraordinary
However, no examination or
meeting.
autopsy will bring back life to a man that is
dead; so it is not of much use going back;
but to îny mind that would have been a
dlean and clear .path out. The agreement
with Germeny was that she sliould lie given
a permanent place in the Council of 10 as it
then existed. For that purpose and that alone

79

the Extra Session was called. Any intimations made or hopes held out that Poland or
Spain or any other should be added and the
2onstitution of the Council thus changed were
-nischaievous and dangerous.
But out of ail this there cornes good, and 1
can see two things which are encouraging.
One is that the League of Nations canflot be manipulated and managed under
the old systern of secret diplomacy.
There was a spice of that old lieresy at the
bottom of the recent difficulty. There was
an idea aimong a few of the strong and powerfui that if they agree'd upon a thing the 55
nations would corne in and agree to it as well.
But the very breatli of ýlife of the League of
Naitions is that it shall discusis and settle its
affairs as a League of Nations, and nort by
any manipulations or intrigues or cabals
amongst, even the most powerful of nations
who, think they can settie matters at a teepaPty and corne to a conclusion whirah t'iey
can put over on 55 different nations. 1 syimpathize absolutely with one remark made by
De Mello-Franco, wlio put the idea, very
etrongly, as did other members of the delegation at bliat meeting, that the League must lie
worked in the League atmosphere, and witih
the League spirit, and on the League basis,
and flot with eny threatened or possible infusion of the oid spirit of secret di'plomnacy.
If that lesson bas been learned-and I believe
;-tlias been absdlutely and thoroughly learned
aow-the League has made a great step
iorward in the wor]d, and is a greet deal1
better off than it was before, on account of
this little trouble that liae taken place,. That
is one thing that 1 think has come to the
good.
The other is that when you corfne down to
the critical point you do not find men laugliing and jeering at the League. Where it is
a question of make or break you do flot find
levity, but you find a spirit of the most intense
concern, and the deepest feeling, and t.he convict ion: "This thing must be made right;
this thing cannot be allowed to go wrong;
we are liere la this forum with the world's
eye8 upon us, end professing to be working
for the peaice of the world; we must keep
that in mmid; that muist be oui guiding star,
thwt mus;t be the spirit that animates us.
Individual pride and consequence, and state
pride and eonsequente, must be put in Vhe
retreat rather than in the front, and the
internationaq, the world spirit, must conquer
over the individual or national or sectional
Spinit.
We ha.ve heard talk about haviug Latin
combinations and Brit.ish conebination, and
the like of that. The very talk of it is poison

QUESTION OF PRtIVILEGE

lion. Mr'. DAN_,DURAND:
I think nmy
bonourable friend fri
Picîcui (Hon. Mr'.
Tanner) bas soome matter wldelh hie wishes to
preýent to the IIousc.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: 1 think it is fitting
in this Chamber to iake a brief staternent
in a imatter of importance that relates to tbe
Province of Nova Scotia.
Recently tbrouglb the press of that Province
Hon. F. B. MeCurdy, a former member cf
the H1ouse of Commons as a Conservative,
and for a time Minister of the Crown, issueda statement. in regard to what, are known as
Maritime Ri.gbts.
In tbiat statement, Mr.
MecCurdy makes it plain to mie that bis first
clnaýce is ",that, the right te live and do
business in Nova Scotia should be establiâlbed
witbin Confedera:tioni." He adds: ",but. if this
is impossible of attainiment, then in the
interest of bo-me and province I would not
besitate bo witbdraw ratber than attemipt te
,carry on under the present system, that is
sàpýping or province for the enritbment, of
Central Canaýda."
Fo-rther on be says that
"thbe demand for repeal would be made as
an alternative forced opon us in case 'tbe
Government and Paila,mnent cf Canada sbeuld
refuse, tîpon demiand of our local GovernHon Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

ment, te relax and modify tbeir regolation
and control cf trade, taxation and the fisheries
in order tha-t the pouliar interestc, cf our
Province may no longer ho prejudiced
thereby."
I observe that in places outside cf Nova
Scotia this statement is being regarded as a
prenooncement on behaîf of the -Conservative
Party of Nova Scotia. I do net se onderstand it. I take it to be the expression cf
Mr. McCurdy's personal views. Wben I say
that in tbe general Provincial elections cf
1925, and tbe general Federal electiens of the
samne year, Mr. MeCordy did net engage
activelv in tbhe campaigns, as be formerly did.
on bebaîf cf the Conservative Party, I arn
stating a fact. Mr. McCordy, ne doubt, sinccrelv bcliev es that the Province could ho
better served by following a course wbich be
prev iously ootlined in a pamphlet poblisbed
over bis signature, and to whicb he referred
in bis recent statement; and he rcfrained frorn
nctivitx' in the ýCenservative ranks.
In this connection it is to ho noted thlat
tbe Province is represented in the present
House of Commons by men wbe were elected
last October; and that tbey bave very clearly
laid before Parliament and the country the
claims of tbeir Province. Not one cf tbem,
as far as I bave observed, bas deemed it te
ha either prudent or necessary te inveke or
threaten sccession.
In my opinion it is unfortunate tbat Mr.
McCurdy should cboose the present moment
f0 re-introduce wbat is censtrued in places
f0 ho a tbreat of secessien in Maritime questiens. Te do that, 1 tbink, is likely to projudice Maritime interests.
Nova Scotia is just now looking bopefully
te ber rpeently elccted representatives for
leadership. So are the ether Provinces. The
other day the lieuse of Cemmons, on tbe
motion cf one cf tbem, W.r A. Black, ef Halifax, unanimously approved of a resolotion
ealling foir redrez-s cf certain Maritime transportation grievane.5
The Dominion Goverriment bas been se mucb impressed by the
dlaims of the Maritime Provinces tbat it bas
eenstituted a Royal Commission, with wide
powe rs, to examine into tbose dlaims. The
Board cf Railway' Commissioners bas been
ong-aged in investigation cf Maritime coinpl1aints in regard te freigbt rates. The recently-appointed Tariff Board is said te he
engaged in inquiry inte tbe ceai and steel
tariff. Members cf tbe lieuse cf iCommons
in general bave heen expressing a desire sympathetically te ce-operate with Maritime
inembers, and the newspaper press at large
bas beoýn equally sympathetic.

~MAY
SUnder these circumnstances, and ini view
of the fact that Mr. MoCurady's statement
is being regarded as a threat of secessionalthough it is qualified-it was, in my opinion,
an errer of judgment to intervene with such
a statement. Nor do I believe that the considered judIgment of the people of the Maritime Provinces will approve of the re-opening
of secession propaganda. There is no reason
why the interests o! the Maritime Provinces
should flot be fairly and satisfactorily adjusted, and grievances redressed by the Fedciral Parliament, without calling up the old
phantôm o! secession, which played its political part in Nova Scotia between 1867 and
1887, but was subsequently relegated te the
grave by the politicians who made use of it.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

THE 'WINNIPEG STRIKE 0F 1919
QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE

Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: Honoura bIc
gentlemen, because of the announcement that
when the Senate adjourns to-night'it wili stand
adjourned for two weeks, and because of à
matter of eonsiderabyle public and very serious
personal importance t-hat should be mentionefl
te-day, I crave the indulgence o! the Hou.sr
for a few moments te bring to the attention of
the House, and particulariy of the Government,
an incident which oceurred yesterday.
It was. only about ten minutes before the
House met this afternoon that a private
citizen o! Ottawa calied me on the telephone
and drew my attention to certain statements
contained in the House o! Commons Hansard
o! yesterday. 1 could ecarcely believe that
any honourable member occupying a seat ini
Parliament could so far depart -from the truth,
knowing that he was doing so, as an honourable member of the other House did. Therefore, while it is fresh in the mninds of ali, it is
desirable, if. possible, that truth should overtake misstatements o! !act. I therefore propose, te refer to a statement whioh appears on

872

SENATE

page 3414 of the Hansard of the other House,
and which was made while the honourable
member representing the constituency of
Kenora-Rainy River was discussing the
Budget and 'inoidentally dealing iw'ith the
propriety or otherwise of sending troops into
Nova Scotia when the 'lamentable coal controversy was taking place there last year. The
honourable member made use of the following words:
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I do not like to
interrupt the hýonourable gentleman, but 1
think hie is out of order in dealing with such a
matter. I understand that hie is reading from
the Hansard of the House of Commons.

tbemselves into a voluntary militia force
under the command of the permanent officers
in that district. Tbey were neyer called into
service by any government.
In addition to that force there was in Winnipeg a post of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police, whicb bas been stationed there, I
suppose, for the last forty years--at aIl events,
for a considerable time. That force consisted
of 49 men, not one of wbom was brought from
outside the city of Winnipeg during the whole
trouble.
So much for tbe statement of the facts of
the bonourable member. 1 challenge bim or
anyone else in or out of Parliament to deny
what I bave said as being true.

MAY 17, 1926
sbould parade in violation of the Mayor's
proclamation for a speciflo purpose which
could not be accomplished otherwise, and that
was ta go ta the Royal Alexandra Hotel,
which was the headquarters of the Minister of
Labour at thet time, and drag hlm out and
beat him up and send him home in a box
ta the Government of the day.
Those were the words of the resolution as
they eppeared in the newspaper next marning, as I recaîl it. That was a fairly interesting situation. Within two houre of the time
that resolution was passed, the Minister of
Labour got inta communication with the
solicitor for the Winnipeg Tredes and Labour
Council, and urged themn nat ta violate the
Mayor's proclamation, saying: "The Mayor'a
proclamation gives yau the riglit and privieage
of meeting in any publie park in this city
and discussing your trouble, but forbida you
ta parade the streets. If it in me yeu want
ta talk ta, I will meet you Saturday marriing in any public park, at eny heur yeu may
name, and will answer your questions and
diseuse your trouble." What resulted? A,
committee of seven men, if I remember correctly, met in the Alexandra Hotel on the
Saturday mornung. I was not asked. ta go ta
any public park ta carry on the conference.
There were present at that conference General
Ketchum, Commissioner Perry of the Northwest Mounted Police, the Mayor of the city
of Winnipeg, a gentleman who had been
delegated ta represent the Departnient of
Justice, and myself. The con! erence proceeded, and demanda were made, saine oi
which were reasonable and were conceded,
and sorne of which were wholly impassible
and had ta be denied. At twenty-five minutes
past one, one of the committee said: '<WeU, let
us get out of here and get somnething ta eat
bef are the flght begins"ý-referring ta the
parade that was ta start et two o'clack.
Another said, "Don't be in a hurry, we are
not gaing ta eat; we will figlit better on an
empty stomach." The gentlemen whose names
I bave given were prisent and heerd that
conversation, and no doubt cari verify what
ISay.
His Worship the Mayor left the hotel anid
went ta the City Hall. By that tume there
were et least 10,000 people corigregated around
thet building and along the main street, and
et twa o'clock the parade began ta form. e
Worship the Mayor protested againat bis proclamation being violated and in~forined the
leaders of what would ensue, but tliey persisted in their attitude. Then Heu Worship
read the Riot Act, anid called upon the
Mounted Police te assist in maintaining
order. Neither the Gaves-rment riar your

8

humble servant had anything ta do with that,
although I may say that it was perfectly
proper and the only thing to be done at the
moment.
Within twenty minutes after that the
Mounted Police, wha were quietly endeavouring to clear the street, were attacked with re.volvers or rifles fired fram the roof of a local
hatel opposite the City Hall Square, and one
of the horses was injured and one of the
riders badly beaten up and disabled, while
others were attacked. The Mounted Police
rode around the City Hall and came along
William avenue, by the side of the Union
Bank, where a number of men were thrawing
missiles at them. The missiles included.
broken bottIes and pieces of concrete broken
up roughly, which were rather nasty things
ta be bit with. After having received the
command of an officer ta protect themselves,
one of the Mbunted Policemen ordered a
man standing on the sidewalk ta refrain from
throwing a missile which he bad ini hie hand
and which lie was &bout ta discliarge. The
man persisted in bis attack, and was ehot. by
the policeman. That was the only casualty
in a generel strike which lasted over five
weeks. Immediately following this incident,
i Worship tbe Mayor appealed ta General
Ketchuri ta came ta the assistance of the
Mounted Police and ta restare arder. Before the valunteer militia force errived the
throng bad commenced ta disperse and disappear, everybody realizing that probably
something more serious would happen as a
resuit of the shoating. The volunteer military forces took charge of the main street,
and forbade trafflc upon it, or crassing it,
except et certain points, end continued ta
maintain order during the afternoon and
evening.
The next day, Sunday, aIl waa
quiet,' and on Monday the trouble waa praotically over.
I bave taken the pains ta state these facts
ta the House, and ta ail others interested,
because of the fact that I was present in the
samewbat responsible capacity of Minister of
Labour at that time, and because. 1 resent
bemng charged by a member of Parliament
with being responsible for the loss of life on
that occasion~, when I lied nathing whatever
ta do with it. Neither was any other mani in
authority responsible for what oocurred; only
the mani himself being to blame.
May I conclude by expresaing the hope that
tbe Government will see that the honourable
member, who ia a junior member and supporter in another place, and who nay lack
experience, although lie bas been a member
of a provincial legialature, is eautioned egainat,

for their reputations will flot idly submit to

DELAY 0F LEGI-SLATION
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. POPE: Honourable gentlemen, before the Orders of the Day are called, and
with the permission of the House, I would
like to remind honourable gentlemen of the
fact that this Session began about the 7th of
Januar -v and bas been prolongod until the
presenit time, when, I .surmise, we are approaching the last thirty days of the Session.
In the Speech from the Throne there was
much made of certain measures which would
corne ibefore this House foi' consideration, and
w-hich -we should have an opportunity of con-

sidorin- deliberately and carofully.

We are

aIl "m'are of the criticism that has been
lovelled against this honourable body by certain portions of the public press, some political
organizations, and others who choose to
criticizo. We are es.sentially a revising bodyto revise legýislation coming from the other
Chamber-and it is unfair that important
measures ,shouild be so long delayed that when
they roacli us 'vo eithor have to pass them
with aIl their imperfections, without having an
opportunity of ffiving them due consideration,
or to refuse to pass them altogother. When
xve refuse to pass legishation xve are said to be
political in charactor.
So far as I am concorned, my politics are well known, but I do
not permit themn to unduly influence my
actions in this C'hamher in reference to public
ineaýsures. A public measure is for the welfare
of the public and should receive the benefit of
the best attention and judgment that we are
able to give it.
We hear that Bills~ are coming along slowly-rural credits, the, revision of valuation of
soldieîs' lands, the Grain Act, the Alberta
Resources Bill, and so on-and I would ask
the honourable members of the Cabinet ir:
this Huse, if they oxpeet this House to givc
considei'îtion. to those measures, to exorcise
their influence with the Cox ernmeot of thc
day in order that we may have a fair opportunity of diseussing and considering these
measuies, and of socuring in committoe the
information necessary to enable us to give an
intelligent vote upon these important questions.
I am not saying that this situation is the
fault of one political party more than another,
for this sort of dilly-diallying and delaying
this Chamber is an old, old story, and bas

MAY 26, 1926
been going on for years. When we are made
the suJbject of unkindly criticismn in various
parts of the country I think that we should
raise our voices against being treated with
contempt, and we should demand sufficient
opportunity and time to properly consider
ail measures.

ORGANIZATION OF SENATE STAFF
CONCURRENCE

IN REPORT OF COMMITTEE
AS AMENDED

On the Order:
Consideration of the fourth rport of the Standing
Comiilt.tee on
Internail Econoymy
a.nd Contingent
Accounts.-Ho,,. NIr. Daniel.

Hon. J. W. DANIEL: Honourable gentlemen, when I introduced this report of the
Committee on Internal Economy and Contingent Accounts a few days ago the honourable
the Government leader in this Chamber took
objection to h!tving the report considered
at that time, and he voiced bis objection
partly in these words:
I cainot iunder''and
w
in the reorganization
which is hefore tus, the position of Second Assistant
Clerk at the Table is not dropped, for I have been
under the impresioi thiat we would not appoint a
third officer at the Table. It is somewhat dangerous
to taintain
a vacancy, because temptations may arise.
Thai is the renson why I ask that the report he
not tokei now.

That I consider to be an entirely reasonable
objection, and I tbink it is one that probab'iy
all of us would have had if the intention of
the report were to have a new Assistant Clerk
placed at the Table. That is where the misapprehension arose. There is nothing at all
in the position of Second Assistant Clerk that
gives the holder of it a place at the Table of
the Senate. The late Mr. Lelièvre, when ha
was appointed Second Assistant Clerk of the
Senate, was given a seat at the Table because
there was then no one at the Table who was
faniliar with both the English and the French
languages. Mr. Leliòvre was familiar with both
English and French and was able to give the
assistance required at the Table. The report
of the Committee, in recommending the appointm.nt of a gentleman to the position of
Second Assistant Clerk of the Senate, did not
at all contemplate that gentleman taking a
seat at the Table. It was the intention to have
him continue the work that he is now doing.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: What is that work,
please?
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Translation of French
Debates.
If the honourable gentleman bas
been in the habit of reading bis own speeches
he will know how satisfactorily the work of
translation bas been done. Personally I do
lon. Mr. REID.

not see those debates and am not in a position
to judge, but those who do read and use them
tell me that the work is very weill done. I
may say in this connection that before Mr.
Potvin was given this work to do under a
contract whicb pays him 4,000 a year, the
work was performed by two officials at an
annual cost of $5,000. Therefore, not only bas
bis work been done much more satisfactorily,
but it bas cost 31,000 a year less.
The difculty which the honourable leader
of the Government experienced with regard to
that position, and which I have no doubt all
rvho were not acquainted with the facts in
the matter also had, woulld be satisfactorily
adjusted, if the Senate is agreeable, by slightly
aitering the wording of the report, so that the
description of -position No. 4, instead of being
put down as "Second Assistant Clerk," would
have added to it, "and Editor and Chief
Translator of French Debates." That would
spcify entire!y the work that he would have
to do, and there would be nothing in it to
indicate or suggest any likelihood of bis being
requested to occupy a seat at the table. So I
intend, before moving concurrence, to ask the
permission of the Senate to add those words
to the description of position No. 4.
This new plan will not create any additional
expense on the Senate or the country. We
all know that in the work to be done in connection

with

this House

the

Clerk

of

the

Senate is now and always bas been very
economically inclined, so far as economy is
consistent with efficiency. I have taken the
trouble to calculate how much the old plan
cost; and in arriving at the amount I have of
course added the sum of $4,000 per annum
which was paid to Mr. Potvin for the work of
translating the Debates into French, because,
although he was not a member of the organized staff, still ho was doing staff work. The
total was $80,280. In the new organization
there are t wo positions put down which it is
not the intention of the Clerk to fil at the
present time. They are included merely in
order to give him the power to have the appointments made in case of emergency.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: What are they?
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: A third Parliamentary
Reporter and a second Confidential Messenger.
lon. Mr. CASGRAIN: What does "Confidential Messenger" mean?
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I shall have to ask
the honourable gentleman to refer back to
the time before I became a member of the
Senate, for that was the title given to him
then. The honourable gentleman was a member before I entered this House, and ho would

MAY 26, 1926
bave a better opportunity off knowing. I do
not know off any reason why the employee in
question should :be called a Confidential
Messenger; ail messengers ouglht to be confidential; but that is -the way it is put down
in the elqssifications off both the Senate and
the House off Commons. He may be a littie
bigiher up than! the ordinary messenger.
The cost under the new organization will be
$75,740 as against $80,280, 80, there can be no
possible objection on that ground. In other
respects, certainly so far as the Committee is
concerned, Vhiey were very glad indeed to have
an opportunity off recognizing tihe meritorious
work off Mr. Potvin, and considered that he
would be a valuable addition to the staff off
the Senate. I wou'ld therefore ask permission
to add the ffollowing words to position No. 4:
"Editor and Chief Transiator off French
Debates." That will make the situation clear,
and will remove any misapprehension or amnbiguity as to the position off this new officiai.
Hon. MT. POIRIER: Honourable gentlemen, the correction that bas been made is to
my mind an appropriate one, but we should
remem'ber t-hat the appointmnents off officiais
off the Senate are made by the Civil Service
Commissioners.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Not these.
They 'have relinHon. -Mr. POIRIER:
quished their rights se, far as tihe officiais who
sit at thé Table are concerned, but as has been
said, Mr. Potvin will not sit at the table,
thereffore we will be encroaching upon the
rights and privileges off the Civil Service
Commission.
I have no objection whatsoever to the
appointment off Mr. Potvin. I think he is a
good translator. I will nlot go to the extent
that my friend to, the right has gone in saying that the translation now is much better
than it was beffore. I have read both translations, and both are good, and in my opinion
the translators previously employed couId
translate at least as well as Mr. Potvin.
As against the economy off $1,000, there is
the ffact that we have practically no more
French translation off our Senate Debates.
Last Session there wae not one speech printed
for the use off Senators. The Committee on
Debates and Reporting, to which I belong,
was asked by one honourable Senator for the
translation off his speech, and he was toidhe did not say by whorn-that he could get
it upon paying for it. That is altogether unsatisfactory. Last Session there wa8 not one
page off the French translation off the Debates
issued, and although we have been in session
two or three months this year, so ffar not one
page bas appeared.

89

Hon. Mix DANIEL: Have you made any
speeches?
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: What is the use off
expending $4,000 if there is no result from
it?
We
Hon. Mx. CASGRAIN: Hear, hear.
neyer got it.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: I have nothing but
sympathy for Mr. Potvin, but I would like
to see the privileges of the Senate maintained.
If we have a French translation we should
have it flot one or tivo years after the speech
is delivered, but beffore it becomes stale. I
arn as much in favour as anybodW of maintaining the rights and privileges off the French
language in the land, but if it is to be simply
a matter off show, and there is to be no bottom to it, I will agree to the abolition off a
translation of which we have no knowledge
and ffrom which we get no use or benefit.
I see that there is attached to, the position
the titie off editor. I did flot k.now that this
gentleman anýy more than other transiators
was an editor. Why the titie editor? The
transiators off our laws are not the editors off
our laws: they are simply transiators. Why
the titie editor? If the transiator were the
editor, that would make him responsible for
what I have said to you about the nonappearance of the Debates last year. I do
not put the blame for that on his shoulders;
I think he dîd ail he could to have the translation printed. Not being able to do anything in the matter we had one of the most
influential members off our Committee--I
think he is in the Chamber, I will not name
him-go to see about it, and his failure wa8
as absolute as my own. He could get no
satisfactory answer. Thereffore we have practically no French translation off our Debates.
I may also say that I think that the Comrnittee that looks affter the translation off the
Debates has been treated somewhat cavalierly
in. this matter. If anyhody knows what we
need, it is the Committee on the Debates,
and they should have been consulted, and
that hss not been done.
I notice also that the position off the Sergeant-at-Arms is to be abolished. To an old
timer, and I happen to be one off them, this
is' regrettable. This position is abolished, I
suppose, on the assumption that we are ail
inoffensive, and týhat no danger can possibly
arise from the ire off any off us. That may
be a mistake, honourable gentlemen. I remember several occasions, one especially,
when but for the intervention off the Sergeantat-Arins there might have been serious -happenings in the Senate. I reffer to the time
when a fight was threatening between. Mr.

SENATE
Ross and Mr. Millar, when one of thema was
called a toothless old serpent. If it had flot
been for the interference of the Sergeantat-Arms and the display of lis sword, we do
flot lknow what might have happened.
Bon. Mr. DANIEL: Is that the time there
ivas a referenca to a toothless aid viper?
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: Yes, that is the word
that was used.
I think it is regrettable that the office of
Sergeant-at-Arms should be abolished-not
that the Mace Bearer does flot do the work
very gracefu'ily; ha is an ornament to the
job; but we are abolishing what exists in the
Bouse of Lords, of which we are supposed ta
be a reflection. Sinca tities are formed for
ýpurposes, I would rather have the gentleman
who carnies the Mace called the Sergeant-atArrns, and have that ornamental position retained in the Sanata.
Bon. Mr. McMEANS: The Senate is going
ta be abolislied anyway.
Bon. Mr. POIRIER: Among other things
I notice that the Chief Transiator is put away
down on the list. Mr. De Montigny is a very
capable gentleman, and one of the cleverast
amployees of the House.
Bon. Mr. DANIEL: Be is in the same
position he occupied bafore.
Bon. Mr. POIRIER: Bis position is one
which carries respect, and I arn sorry to see
àt placed so far down on the list. Bowever, I
have no serious objection ta the report except the one whicha I have already raised, that
we have no practical or useful translation of
the Debates of this Hlouse.
Bon. Mr. DANDTJRAND:
Bonourable
gentlemen, when this report first came ta the
Senate I thought there was ta be but one report. I had been informed the day beýfore by
the Clark of the Bouse tha~t it was his intention simply ta lay down a sdhenia of arganization outlining- the functions of officiais, 'but
flot giving names or salaries, because that
would be tantamount to classification, a matter which is under the jurisdiction of the Civil
Service Commission. 0f course, that was as
far as the Clark, could go. But apparently
the Committea tha-t met next day went furthen, and, being uninformad as to that developmant, I thought it proper ta express a doubt
as ta the prapriety of mainrtaining a second
Clark, Assistant under the sdlieme of organization.
During the last quarter of a century I have
been foilowing t.he work of the Senate, and
its budget, and I have found that aur Clerks
Hon.

Mr. POIRIER.

of the Senate have been very conscientiaus
in their efforts ta reduce expenditure, and I
think aur expenditure, compared witli that of
the other Bouse or any other departmant,
stands in a very good liglit. I feIt that aur
gcod wark in this connection would ha somewhat affected in the public eye by the fact
thait we had three officiaIs at the Table wlian
the Commons had but twa. I have often
heard Commoners remarking that aithaugli
we have so little ta do comparad with the
other Bouse, yet we have three officiais at thc
Table and thay have only twa. Tharefora I
rose ta express thc opinion that thare should
be only two officiais at the Table, in order ta
remove any appearance of ýlaxity or too 'great
liberality in 'the appointment of aur staff, as
I fait that we miýght be open ta unjust
criticis-m in that regard. The Chairman of
the Internai Economy Committee afterwards
brought forward a second report of whidh I
was -totally unaware at the tima, and after the
expianation that ha lias givan I amn quite
agreeable ta the report.
In answer to my honourabie friand from
;Shediac (Hon. Mr. Poirier), who dlaims that
the positions released by the Civil Service
Commission are those of the officiais at the
Table. I may say ithat I think lie is undar a
misconception. Thc releasa doas flot cover
the officers at thc Tabla, but thc Clerk, and
the flrst and second Assistant Claerks. These
names ara given, but it is not added, that they
arc at the table. As a matter of fact the twc
ýneed not be at the Tabla, and aven bafore thp
report was adoptad the Clark could have
exercisad bis own discretion as ta calling one
or two clarks ta the table ta as.sist bina. This
report makes it quita clear that the Clark
may assign dutias ta the Second Clark Assistant which may not necassarily invoiva attending the sittings of tlie Bouse.
As to the propriety of appointing an officer
,w~ho ivili have charge of the translation of oîir

Debates, this question lias been discussad for
at least 25 years. I have consistantly favorad
the appointment of such an officer, and 1
suiz-ested this same idea ta the Clark of the
Blouse some lime ag-o. so that I arn fully in
accord wîîh the report. I may add that 1
w-as infornied that the amount allowed to the
party who had the contract for translation ivas
not sufficiant, and the amount that lia is allowcd under this report is about what ha recaivad as contractor; yat I must candidly
say I avpect that towards the end of the
Session lie will at times naad temporary lielp,
in ordar ta maintain lis work frorn day ta

which rnay 'ho grantod out of the Contingent
Accounts of the Sonate.
The arnendrnont of Hon. Mr. Daniel was
agreed to.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL rnoved concurrence in
the report as arnended.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There je one
rernark I should like to add. I have had some
representations occasionally in this case, as
in others, concorning the list which appears
in this scheme of organisation. Sorne mernbers of the staff have been under the impression that the num-berîng of these positions
indicated the order of procedence. There je
nothing in that representation. The numbers,
as they corne down, do not really indicate
the true position of the officers of the Sonate
towards each other.
Hon. -Mr. TURRIFF:
Might I asic the
Chairman of the Comrnittee if concurrence
in this report means that the appointrnents
suggested can bo made now by the 'Clerk of
the Sonate without any further action?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There je only
one appoîntrnent.
Hon. Mr. TUIRRIFE: I would lice to point
out that at a rneeting of the Internai Economy
Committee sorne weeks ago, whidh was fully
attonded, where the Assistant Clerc was appoiiited, it was generally understood that no
second Clerc would be appointed. I listened
to the romance of my honouraible friond frorn
Shediac (Hon. Mr. Poirier) and also those of
the mover of this resolution (Hon. Mr.
Daniel), and it seerns to me now that this iâ
an opportunityHon. Mr. DANIEL: Would the honourable
gentleman allow me a moment? I Vhink if
ho wiIl wàit tili the next report ie brought
in hoe will see that the appointrnont with the
narne of Second Assistant Clerc doos not interfere with bis views as to what ought to
take place in keeping the Table as it is now,
with only tw;o Clercs there.
Hon. Mr. TURIRIFF: Well, I have only
a word or two to say. If wo make another
appointmont it rnay not moan anything juet
now, but it will moan incroased exponse to
the Sonate before wo are through with the
matter, thought it may ho sorne years fhenco.
The work of the Sonate je being done very
satisfactorily at presont, and I s00 no roason
whatever for increasing tho staff. The individual with whorn it is now proposod to
deal draws a liboral' allowance, and I hiave
no objection. to that; but here is an opportunity to practise a littie ecouorny such as
my honourable friends have mentioned. I

think the internai economy of the Senate is
being carried on well, -but if it is satisfactory
why should we go on making appointrnents
tyhat are flot necessary to the efficient working of the Sonate? I arn against concurring
in whiat rnay lead to additional expense in
future, even if it doos flot involvo extra expense now, and I thinkc it would bo bettor to
let well enough -alono.
Hon. Mr. R'EID: I would lice to asic a
question in connection witbh the wording of
this report, which says:
The Committee recominend that the present plan of
and the fol-

Organization of the Senate be cancelled,
lowing substituted therefor.

I .should like to asic one of the lawyers
present whothor the adoption of Vhis report
with the word "'cancelled" would autornatically
cancel ail the officiai positions and involvo
reappointments. I would suggost that instoad
of the word "cancelled" some other word
shou'ld be used, suoh as "changed."
Hon. Mr.. DANDUItAND: I would think
that this is one and the sarne action; the
cancellation is done at the saine timo as the
new schemo of organization je creatod, so
that there ie simply a substitution of one
organization for the other.
Hon. Mr. REID: But you are cancelling
your whole organization, and substituting a
new organisation for the one that existed.
When you cancol the old organisation do you
not cancel ail the old positions with it? If
so, the officiais should be reappointed to the
now organization. I arn not objecting to the
change, but I arn raising that question.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Daniel was agreed

SOLDIER SETTLEMENT BILL
FIRST READING

Bill 17, an Act to amend the Soldier Settlement Act, 1919.-Hon. Mr. Dandurand.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, this Bill was the occasion of considerable debate and division of opinion as to
the form it should be finally given.
From
the echoes that had reached me I was under
the impression that it was a very much involved Bill.
I have examined it carefully
and find that it has been whipped into shape
in such a way that it will probably meet with
very little opposition as to the form.
I will
ask that we take the second reading on
Tuesday next.
It was ordered, that the Bill be placed on
the Order Paper for second reading on
Tuesday, June 1.

PRIVATE BILL
REQUEST FOR SUSPENSION OF RULES

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. L. MeMEANS: I crave the indulgence
of the Senate to ask that Bill 92, which is on
the Order Paper for second reading to-morrow,
be given second reading to-day.
The circumstances are rather unusual.
The Bill is
one to regulate some insurance matters in connection with the Grand Lodge of Orangemen
They have to give some twenty days' notice tc
all their policy holders, and as that will have
to be done within a very short time, and this
honourable body is not sitting continuously,
but is meeting only two or three days a week
while awaiting legislation from the House of
Commons, the Grand Lodge will be placed in
a very difficult position with regard to this
matter unless the Bill can be given second
reading to-morrow and posted, so that it may
be referred to Committee by next Wednesday
at the latest. The Bill has passed the House
of Commons without any objection. It deals
only with cash surrender values of policies
and matters of that sort.
Under these
special circumstances I would ask that the
Senate be good enough to allow this Bill to
be read a second time to-day.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I understood
the honourable gentleman to say that he
wanted the second reading to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: No. The Bill is on
the Order Paper for to-morrow.
I want the
second reading to-day.
The honourable
gentleman who has charge of the Bill, the
honourable Senator from Welland (Hon. Mr.
Robertson), has been away for some time.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: They will not attain
their object in that way, because the Bill
would still have to be sanctioned.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
I am informed by
the gentlemen who have the matter in charge
that if the Bill gets second reading and passes
the Committee they will be satisfied to send
out the usual notices.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Would the honourable gentleman state whether those notices
of which he speaks refer to the passing of
the Bill or have any effect upon the procedure
of the Senate?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
Not the slightest.
Under their by-laws and regulations the Grand
Lodge are required to send notices out to the
different policy holders twenity days previous
to the meeting of the Grand Lodge, so that
any objections to be made can be considered.
The Grand Lodge have been called to meet

93

MAY 27, 1926
on a certain day, and it is now very close to
the twenty-day period; so if they could get
the Bill referred ta Committee and the Commaittee would paso it, as it passed the House
of Commons, they would send out their notices
at once.
Hon. Mr. DANhIEL: It relates simply ta
the principle of insurance?
It has the
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Yes.
usuail clauses. There is no objection ta the
Bill in any way. It bas passed the House of
Commons without a dissenting vote.
There is no
Hon., Mr. DANDURAND:
objection except that which. arises from aur
rules. There is a very exact proc-edure that
must be followed in order to ad'vance a Bill
ýfrom a fixed date ta an earlier one. 1 think
there is a certain motion that musit he made;
and even if we went through that pracedure
it would be necessary, in view of the fact that
the Bill is down for second reading tamarraw, ta have it understood that the Senate
cwould not be comnmitted ta the prineiple
of the Bill, which might bc discussed at the

third Teading.
might dlaim that he intended raieing a point,
or challenging the second reading, on the date
for which it was fixed.
Certainly, that
Hon. ,Mr. McNEANS:
would be understood.
The Hon. the SPEAKE R: I understood the
bonourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. McMeans)
ta say that he did not propose that the Bill
should go before the Committee until, say,
next Wedneeday.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I understood that
the Hause would ikely adjourn this afternoon
until next Tuesdny, and it is necessary ta
have the Bill posted..
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Thon 1 would
point out ta the honourable gentleman that
Lie could perhaps attain the same abject if he
would leave the Bihl as it stands, to came up
for second reading on Tuesday, and then
move for the suspension of the ruhes with
regard ta the further stages of the Bill. It
would came before the Banking and Commnerce Committee on Wednesday, and the
hanaurable gen'tleman's abject would be attamned.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I undersbood the
Bill had ta be posted eame days in advance.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The effèct wauld
beh'far-reaching and the precedent might bedangerous. l wouhd suggest ta my haonourable friend that we take the second reading

an. Tuesday next and then suspend the rules
in order ta allow the Bill ta go ta the Committee the next day.
Haon. Mr. McMEANS: Ail right.
INQUIRY FOR RETURNS
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I would like
ta, ask the honourable leader of the G-overnment if he has been able ta obtain the returns
for which 1 moved on the 1lth instant?
Hon. Mr. DA'NDURAIND: If the honourable gentleman will give me a memorandum
I shalh have inquiry made after the House

happy ta do that.

have fallen behind, in their payments will
hegin to feel that after ail they did not
make such a bad bargain.
The amount involved is quite large. There
are sorne 11,000 soldiers wbo could appear
before the Board to ask for a revaluation
of their lands. How many of that number
will feel like doing Bo it is impossible to
say; but I may inform honourable gentlemen
that in Soutbern Alberta a questionnaire was
sent out to the soldiers who were borrowers
from the Government, and some 40 per cent
of themn answered that tbey were satisfied
with the amount they had paid and as to
the possibility of meeting their obligation3.
If they answered in that manner during last
winter, I hope that the position of quite a
large number of themn has gradually changed
for the better, even in the large area which
suiffered through drougbt and lest three or
four consecutive crops.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: -What proportion of
the soldiers wbo got land under those circumstances miade good?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I arn informel
that of the soldiers who went on the land
some 75 per cent are stili on the land.
The question has been asked: why go to
the rescue of that class of debtors? In the~
rough and tumble of life, in ail vocations
and callings, some people fare well and others
do not. Why make that distinction? The
answer, I believe, is a very simple one. First,
the men are returned soldiers, and we have
decided to do the best the country can do
for them. The seconid reason is that the
Government is the creditor and is interested
in protecting its mortgage. The soldier may
get discouraged and leave, and. then the
Governmenat will have the land on its hands
and will have to dispose of it, and certainly
will not be able to dispose of it at better
than the existing market value. If there is
a real disproportion between the price paid
for the land and the existing market value,
there should be an effort made to retain on
the land the soldier who, though still fighting
an upbill battle, hias shown a desire to remain on it. It seems to me that we are
interested in retaining on the land those
soldiers who have nmade the effort and have
passed through the lean years, and that there
should be a revaluation, rather than that
theyý should be allowed to face the necessity
of advertising and selling the piroperty to
the public.
Under this Act thoee who, have left their
farms have the preference over ail others of
re-entry if there is a revaluation and they
think they can mak-e good. Those who have

paid in full are outside
the Act.

witb this legielation. I thinc that on the
whole thia is a very generous provision.
May I say that a couple of years ago I bad
the honour of being one of the Empire
Parliamentary Delegation who went to South
Af rica, and with one or two others I returned
via Australia and New Zeal'and, where I bad
an oppoftunîty of diseuasing on the spot
what tbey were doing for the soldiers. I bave
a memorandum made at tbe time, and flnd
that tbey followed a course very similar to
our own and witb very similar results. The
desire there, as ini Canada, was to re-eetablish
the soldjier on~ the -land so far as possible,
when hie could noet get back to bis oid occupation. In New Zealand, as here, the prices for
aal holdings, ordýhards, boeuses, and aIl kinds
of thingu, were inflated. Ini this country our
lands are particularly grain-growing bands.
New Zeaýland bas been obliged to make a

revaluation of lands, and has flot stopped
d'oing so yet. There they appropriated nearly
$100,000,000. out of which $85,000,000 'has been
expended for the re-establishrnent of a
comparatively sma'll number. There were about
22,000 who were eligibie for re-eâtablishment
under the seheme, but perhaps flot a third of
that number-I would say flot a half-actually
Vook advantagc of it.
Being a Westerner, and 1 think reasonably
famniliar with agricultural values in the Western Provinces, i know tlhat conditions in
Canada were unfortunately most unfavourable
for the acquisition of lands by anybody. W/e
were going throug-h a time of inflation. Live
stock deprcýciated after that, in some cases
more than 50 per cent, and, as m-any men
familiar with the Wet know, became practically of no value. The least valuable breeds

at prices that lef t the shipper actual-ly in
debt. The same conditions affected agricultural land in Saskatchewan, where values depreciated from the peak prices at the end of
the war perhaps one-third. 1 know one district
in Saskatchewan, with which I arn more particularly familiar, where private vendors or
coînpany vendors were obligated to make readjustment to purchasers in order to hold them,
and in many cases thoýe readjustments represetetd ,even one-haîf of the sale price, after
intaking into consideration accumulated
terest, taxes, etc. The same remark is truc
ail over Saskatchewan, and also Alberta, and
to a lesser degree in Manitoba.

Bill in greater detail.
W/e have dealt with the soldier very generously. In 1922 we placed ah bhis in.debtedness together in a funding operation,' and
gave hirn a remission of interest for four,
three and two years respectively, I think it
was, from th-at date. But even that did not
solve the problem. It did something, but it
did not re-establish the old prices.

then there was a Board constituted for the
purpose of valuing that land and seeing if
it was worth what the soldier was ready to
give. At the city of Regina one of the most
coMpetent managers of a boan cornpany was
on that Board. Sirnil-ar Boards were established all over Western Canada, I believe. So
that the soldier had the benefit not only of
wh-at little knowledge of land value be
possessed-and those men were largely farmers
or farmers' sons who were returning-but the
benefit of the advice of the Soldier Settlement Board officers. H1e had the whole staff
to assist him in selecting and apprasing the
value of those lands.
The present measure is due simply to deflation iii the value of lands in Western Canada. Even in the Western States there is a

extent of from 25 to 35 per cent, and I arn
advised by competent authority that in sorne
cases there bas been a deeline of 40 per cent.
So that we are doing a good stroke of

GRIESBACH:
Mr.
Hon.
gentlenmen, -there is a feature of this Bill to
which I would like Vo draw the attention of
the House. The Soldier Settlement Board
was oniganized in 1919 to deal exclusively

with the settblement of soldiers on the land.
The Government bas deeided during the past
two years that this policy had about worked

itqelf out, and that the time for stabilization
and liquidation had corne. Meantime the
Government bas turned the Soldier Settlement
Board into a settlemnut orgaîîizathjn. aind
after five or six years of -useful but I may say
costly ex'perienee the Governrnent now proposes Vo place up-on -the land settlers who were
brought here under other schemes. The Government hopes, and the Board undoubtedly
muist hope, that, the lands which have fahlen
or are aibout Vo 'faîl or which rnay fahl into
the hands of' the Government, rnay be dispcsed
of to those incorning settlers, and in some cases
the Board bas dealt with them in that way.
But this situa-tiýon involves one of the
strongest arguments with reference to this
Bill, and may detract somiewhat .fromn the
apparent generosity oif the Governrnent.

There is no doubt that their land was sold
at prices that were too high. I understood
the Leader of the Government to say to-night
that $5,000 would be advanced to soldiers in
the buying of land, and then he said that a
certain sum in addition would be given for
the buying of implements and stock, but he
did not state how much.
I gather it was
about $2,000.
That would leave a soldier
with a debt of about $7,000, and many of them
are inexperienced in farming.
Now, from my experience in the West, I
would say, without fear of contradiction, that
there is no one who wants to be more
generous to the returned soldiers than I
would like to be; but I think that generosity
should apply not only to soldiers, but to
others. It is possible to be too generous, and
generous in a way that does the recipients
a great deal of harm. I am confident that
very few men in the West could be placed
on a quarter-section of land, which was the
usual amount that was purchased, with a debt
of $7,000, and who, even though there were
good times with fairly good prices and crops,
would be able to make their purchase a
success.
I think there was not sufficient care taken
in that respect. That is the principal criticism that I have te make-the lack of care
taken when the land was purchased. I know
of a number of soldiers who got money for
implements and stock, and who did not stay
very long on the land. but left both farm
and implements, and the Government could
do nothing but sacrifice both implements and
stock.
We have plenty of time to consider this
measure, and I think the Government should
have given a pretty clear description, not of
how many soldiers have made good, but how
many have left the land altogether-who
simply got up and walked off the land and
left the stock and implements that had to
be sold by the Goverment. The Government should tell us how much is owing by
those who are still on the land.
I agree with all tihat bas been said in
favour of re-valuation. There is no man in
the West to-day who sold land privately at
the time that these soldiers were settled on
the land who bas not had to make a readjustment. I would not go so far as some,
and say that the reduction amounted to 50
per cent, but they certainly have had to
readjust, and I think the Government bas
taken a proper step in introducing this
measure.

he wants. I am informed that of the 17,000
I mentioned who have borrowed money for
the purchase of farms, 10,000 are not in
arrear.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: Can the honourable gentleman tell us the result of the
properties that were abandoned and sold? I
understand there was a considerable loss.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 2,400 farms out
of 6,600 have been re-sold, at an increased
price of $200,000.
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN: That is, there was
no loss on those farms
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
There was no
loss on the purchase price of the farms, but
there was on the stock and machinery.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: There is a point
I would like to mention in reference to this
Bill, though not as it is drafted. It seems to
me that on the principle of equity it does not
go far enough. The soldier who has paid in
full, by successful farming, economy and
thrift, or the man who wished to be as it
were independent, without this obligation to
the Government hanging over him and who
got money elsewhere. has in my opinion a
greater claim than the man who has fallen
behind. The man who bas fallen behind, so
long as ho has persevered at al], is the one
who is considered favourably. The man who
has absolutely made good, directly or indirectly, seems to me to have a greater claim,
which is ignored in the Bill. However, the
failure to recognize it may be only temporary,
because with his greater claim he will corne
back with a very strong case for consideration,
particularly when the men who have been less
successful and less resourceful have received
whatever advantage may come to them
through this Bill.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: May 1 suggest
something to the honourable leader of the
Government? I have this evening been placed
in possession of a copy of Sessional Paper
No. 169 of the House of Commons, a return
to an order of the House of Commons made
on March 15, 1922, in which there are a
series of nineteen questions dealing with
soidier settlement, and answers to them; also
information from the Department of Indian
Affairs. I think it would be very illuminating
to have that on our records.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will the honourable gentleman send it over?

happy to do so.

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Honourable gentlemen, it seems to me that one of the last
remarks of the honourable gentleman representing the Government exposed the real
weakness of this Bill, the weakness anticipated by the soldier settlers generally, which
is that under the administration of these provisions the man who has tried to live up to
ais contract, who bas got assistance outside,
and who bas developed bis land to the very
greatest extent, will be penalized because bis
t hrift and industry and enterprize have produced a condition which is apt to lead the
Board to say, " This man has no fault to
find-see how well he bas done with bis holdngs." On the other hand, the less thrifty
rnan, who bas long ago been disc@uraged, and
h as donc comparatively little towards makng good on bis enterprize, will have the adantage of the apparently large depreciation
f bis holding.

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Yes, up to tbe 3lst
of December. That is the date of this return. EI"ven thousand in arrears; eight
hundred paid in full-and we bring forward
this Bill as the remedy for the situation.
My experience of the administration of the
Acts of this Parliament by boards is that
they are nearly always9 subi ect to the regula tion of restrictive Orders in Council. Parliament passes an Act intended to be
generous; the Government cornes along in
a week or two with an Order in Couneil
taking the teeth out of the Act making it so
narrow in its application as to take away a
great part of the generosity intended by
Parliament. It seems to me that we should
sean very carefully the provisions of this
Act, and not only as to the technical requirements of some of the sections. For instance,
the failure to deal with the case of a man
who got land at the beginning at an entirely
fictitious price, as many of thein did, should
be carefully considered. There are cases to
my knowledge in which land was sold at
prices which were regarded by the public as
ridiculous. Those men have no relief, because they must show depreciation in value
between the time of purchase and the present
time. It is sufficient for the Board to show
or to argue that there bas been no depreciation in value; that the soldier was simply
charged too bigh a price at the beginning,
and that the land was neyer worth it, and if
that be done the soldier has no relief under
the Act. No doubt these details can be
better attended to in Committee than on the
second reading, and for that reason I have
not gone into. themn at length.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I think the statement was made that these lands that had
been taken over had been sold for a larger
sumn than they cost. I also want to ascertain whether the question of taxation
was taken into consideration. These ahandoned lands are a menace to the muniespalities both in the province of Mallitoba
and in the province of Saskatchewan. I know
there must be a very large number of
abandoned farms in certain districts. Up to
the time of the purchase of these la.nds the
municipalities relied upon them for taxation,
but wben they were abandoned the taxes
would not be paid, and I take it the municipalities have to bear the baqs.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The taxes were
paid for tbe Iength of time the soldier was
on the land.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Did- the government pay themn right up to the time the
soldier abandoned it?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Hon. Mr. McMF.ANS: I am very glad to
hear about that.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: There is no payment
of taxes after the land is abandoned.
Hoxl. Mr. TAYLOR: There is no payment of taxes when the soldier is on the
land if the titie is in tbe Government.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I arn informed
'hat the taxes are paid while the soldiers are
on the land.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: It is an open sore
in the district of New Westminster that the
soldiers do not pay taxes and the municipadity will flot build roads. And this Governnient advanced the munificent suma of S500
to build roads.
lion. Mr. BELCOURT: As I understand
it, theonly serious objection whieh has been
made to the purpose of this bill is that it will
.not mete out even justice. to everyone who
took land under the Soldier Settlement
sebeme. Notwithstanding the possibility that
lands *were overvalued, a certain number
have iucceeded in making all their payments,
and some hon, gentlemen think that
such men ought to have an opportunity of
coming in and making a dlaim under this
bill. As against that, have we not the presumption that tbey have no grievance? That
is established by the fact that they have
succeeded and prospered, from which I
think we can infer that the land was not
overvahîed.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Does by honourable friend flot Vbink it would be only hums.u
nature for the individual who has succeeded
to say that he has succeeded because of his
own efforts, not because of the quality of
the land?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Because be bas
succeeded, I presume be bias no grievance at
all. He could not make out a case of buying land at too higb a price.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That will not
deprive hlm of bis grievance.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: If- my honourable
friend will give the matter a littie tbought, I
think he will see that his argument falîs to
the ground. Suppose, in place of these men
having been put on the land, you turned
them into grocers down here-one on one
corner and the other on another. In the
course of a few years one of those men will
be prosperous and the other will fail.
Hon. Mr, BELCOURT: That does not
convince me.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. GORDON: One man is thrifty
and attends to business and is on the job
from morning until night. He makes a success every time; the other man does nQt.
The same thing may apply to those soldier
settlers. Two men may be placed on land
side by side, and one will make a success
and the other will not. It may even happen
under prohibition that one is a great boozer
and the other is not. Many things may
enter into the matter, and I feel that even
if only one hundred, instead of nine hundred,
have paid up fully, they should be repaid
in the same proportion as the others. To do
otherwise would be penalizing the thrifty.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
They are always penalized.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: In dealing with
this Bill, we are not striving to guess as to
the cause which prevented one man succeeding when it did not prevent the other, except-and the whole Bill is predicated upon
that-that ho paid too much for the land.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
Does the honourable gentleman find that the number of
abandonments has been greater in some districts than in others? From my knowledge,
settlers have been put where the land is impossible.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
May I give a
partial answer to that? There is a settlement
on the National Transcontinental at Kapuskasing, where three or four hundred soldiers
were placed on the land. They got very considerable advances at different times and
remained on the land eighteen months or
two years altogether.
All those soldiers
abandoned the land, because, they said, they
could not succeed. A]most immediately those
farms were taken up by settlers who got no
advances of any sort, and they made a great
success of them.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
answer the question.

That

does

not

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I will answer
the question that has been put. Undoubtedly
there has been a greater abandonment in
certain districts because the land was poorer
than in others. My honourable friends have
neglected to take into consideration the fact
which I stated, that in Southern Alberta 40
per cent of the soldiers now on the lard
have answered that they were satisfied with
the price paid. Sixty per cent were not.
This year they may be. The Board will
have to consider why some applicants have
not been as successful as their neighbours.
I draw attention to the clause which says:
Where there has been a decrease or depreciation in
the market value of such land, not the result of neglect
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

or mismanagernent on the part of the settler, to make
provision for the revaluation of the said land.

This is not a Bill te reimburse people
who have bought a piece of land and paid
for it: it is an effort to retain thema on the
land.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
If there were a
provision that you could take these men off
bad land and put thema on good land I
would be glad to see it. I know of cases in
Manitoba where they were settled on land
from which they could not make a living;
you could not put it on the market and get
fifty cents an acre for it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
In that region
most of the land was Dominion land and was
givon to the settlers. Money was advanced
to thern later on for improvements or live
stock.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: There is one point
I am not clear on. I thought I understood
the Leader of the Government te say that
of the 25,000 returned soldiers who had taken
advantage of the Soldier Settlement scheme
10,000 were now on the land and were not
in arrear in their payments.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
information I have.

That is the

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF:
That information
is not much good in that shape: it may
mean something or it may mean nothing.
Have those 10,000 settlers paid up the money
they agreed te pay when they took the land,
or have they been given extensions of time
covering time that has gone past? In order
to have any complete understanding of what
we are dealing with I think information
should be given as te what number of that
10,000 have made payments on their land,
and what amount they have paid, and what
number of the 10,000 have not made any
payments on the land whatever.
I am
strongly in accord with my honourable friend
froma Boissevain (Hon. Mr. Schaffner).
If
you advance a man $4,000 or $5,000 or $6,000
or $7,000 on a quarter or half-section, I do
not believe he can make good with that load
on his back. I lived for many years in that
country and have seen many settlers, and
good settlers, get one or two thousand
dollars which they were not able te pay
interest upon. How could a man with a load
of from $5,000 te $7,000 make good? The
scheme was wrong in the first place: it was
bound te fail from the very start. Te my
mind we ought te go very thoroughly into
this and find out exactly where we are, and
try te produce a Bill that would be of some
advantage te the soldier settler, and that

The choice ones have been sold ta some
advantage, but we must not run away with
the idea that we are going ta be able ta sell
the balance ta advantage. That is absurd.
No boan company can do that. -So, ini dealing with this whole question we want ta
have a thorougli knowledge of it and ta do
the best tha.t is possible under the circumnstances. There are somne cases in which the
soldier settlers do nat deserve any consideratien at all. 1 have heard of a man who
said: "I do not care what I pay for the
land; I arn going ta get a big advance for
machinery and stock, and I will make some
money anyway." That man is not deserving
of cansideration, and as far as possible na
consideratian should be given him in the way
of spending mare money on him. Be went
into, the business in the wrong way and cauld
nat possibly make good. What we want ta
do is ta make a Bill that will help thase
who are going ta try ta make good on the
land they have.

Bam. Mr. CALDER: Most of this discussion, I suppose, should really take place in

carry on the discussion now, but there is oine
point that I 'wauld like to have made peifectly

ta a st-atemenit brought beifore the BHouse by
the honouraible gentleman frorn Moose Jaw

that 824 soldiers had paid their debits in f ull.
Does that mean that the arnount they aiwe ta

SENATE

On section 1-revaluation of lands sold to
settlers:

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: If the Board has
not disposed of the land.

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: We have not had an
opportunity of going fully into this Bill, and
I think it should be postponed for a day or
two until we know something about it.
Hon. ;Mr. DANDURAND:
Well, if my
honourable friend will allow me, I will read
the Bill, which I think is in very clear English. If anyone has any doubt as to the
meaning of any clause I will give the explanation. As I said last week, I thought the
Bill was somewhat involved, but there had
been a discussion on it elsewhere that lasted
for three or four days, more particularly on the
constitution or the District Arbitration Board,
whether it should be comiposed of one judge
only, or a committee of three parties. There
was no party discussion: everyone gave his
opinion freely as to the formation of that
Board.
Now we have the scheme before us, and it
will be for the Senate, if it prefers, to have
the alternative of one judge only. I think
that if we go on clause by clause my honourable friends will find that it is a very reasonable Bill, which enables a Board, under certain conditons, to revalue the land of the
soldier who has gone behind.
Now I will read the first section:

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Is it clear that
this would apply to the soldier settler ýonly?
It bas occurred to me that five years hence
the Bill might be invoked in aid of a civilian
settler who bas bought from the Board in this
present year.

1. The Soldier Settiernet Act. 1919. eihapter seventy-

one of the statutes of 1919 (first session) as amended
by chtipter nineteen of the statutes of 1920, and
by
chepter forty-six of the statutes cf 1922 and
by
chapter fifty-three of the statutes of 1925, is further
amended by adding thereto the ifollowing section:68. (1) Notwithstnnding anything in this Act the
Board is iereby emipowered upon the application
of a
settler who has agreed to purchase any land froms
the Board, who has not assigned or transferred his
mrterest in his land, whose agreernent with 'the Board
has not been ternnated or rescinded and who
has
not repaid his indebtedness to the Board-

That is, one who is still there on his land,
and who bas not abandoned the land, and bas
not terminated his agreement with the Board.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That does not sav
that the man must be on the land.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 'It goes on:
-- and where Itiere has been a deoerease or depreciation
in the market value of such land not the result
of
neglect or mismanagement on the part of the
settler,
to make provision for tihe re-valuation of tihe said
land subject to the .following conditions:-

Hon Mr. BELCOURT: He may apply even
though he has left the land.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Through the
last clause, if he has abandoned his contract,
if he bas vacated the land, he will be given a
preference for a re-entry over anyone who applies for that piece of land.
Hon.

Mr.

DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In the interpretation clause, "settler" means a person who
at any time during the war has been therein
engaged on active service in a military force.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I just wanted to
make sure of it.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Do I understand
that the soldier himself bas to make the application?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: But supposing ha

not they be in the same position?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

do not see why, if the proper evidence

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
Can the honourable leader tell us what amount would be
involved by the widening of this Bill to include those soldiers who have paid?

value.

Mr. GRIESBAOH: Production value?
Mr.

DANDURANID:

Production

Hon. Mr. CALDER: But that is net market
value.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I would say that
the market value is what the land would sell
for at forced sale.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes, that is the market
value. I can give honourable gentlemen three
or four concrete cases that I know of. The
honourable member from Moose Jaw (Hon.
Mr. Willoughby) bas referred to the fact that
private owners of land have had to reduce
their contracts. I know of a case where a
contract was reduced from $9,000 to $5,000
in order to keep the farmer on the land. It
had not that market value, and there was no
market value of the land at $5,000; it was
simply a case of keeping the man on the land
in order to prevent it from running to waste.
We know that all through Saskatchewan, for
years past, there has been no market sale and
no market value of the land; you could not
get buyers; consequently, when you use the
phrase "market value of the land," as a test
of what should be donc, I say it is dangerous.
We should try to find some other expression
that would meet the situation.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I think the point is
well taken, and if the honourable gentleman
who has just spoken does not care to make
a motion J will move that paragraph (c) be
amended by striking out the word "market"
in the eighth line of the paragraph.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: And just say "present
value of the land."
I think that is much
wider, and the Arbitration Board can use
whatever yard-stick they like in making the
value.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will accept
that amendment. We may not take the third
reading to-day, and if it is suggested that
another form should be brought before the
Senate, I will comply.
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD: Have you been
able to get that information for me?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In Nova Scotia
475 soldiers have settled, and 118 have abandoned the farms.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: There is another expression here. This is the paragraph on which
the whole section is founded. It reads:
68. (1) . . . and, where there has been a decrease or
depreciation in the market value of suh land not the
result of neglect or mismanagenent on the part of the
settler,

What I want to know is who is to be the
judge as to whether or net there has been
neglect or mismanagement?
Hon. Mr. BELAND: The Board.
lon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Arbitration
Committee.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR:
That is the point.
The section does not say so.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes. if my honourable friend will wait till we reach paragraph (e).
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: But that is another
paragraph, while this is the very initiation
of the proceedings. I have had experience.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But my honourable friend will sec it is subject te conditions.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Yes, I have had experience with another Act, with this same
Government, with another Board of the Government, which warns me of the danger of
this paragraph. I fear that if this paragraph
is left as it is, we will be met with an Order
in Council, probably, saying that no applications are to be considered by the District
Court unless they are first passed upon by
the Soldier Settlement Board as comin
within the cover of those words that I have
just read: "the result of neglect or mismanagement on the part of the settler." If the
Soldier Settlement Board, sitting at Ottawa
here, get the hallucination that there has
been neglect or mismanagement, that soldier
will find himself completely out of court.
while Parliament does not intend that at aIl.
I think we are going on too hastily with this
Bill. I am satisfied there is no one in this
House who has studied this Bil., and we are
too hasty in attempting to put it through tonight in the face of pit-fal'Is such as these.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I think we are
benefiting by the exchange that we are having.
I think my honourable friend is in error when
he is under the impression that the question
of the revaluation will be left in any degree
with the Board. All this matter will come
exclusively under the Committee which is to
be appointed under this very clause.

Now, I

Notwithstanding anything in this Acit, the Board is
hereby empowered upon the application of a settler
who has agreed to purchase any land from .the Board,
who bas not assigned or transferred his interest in the

land,-

The Board is the proper party to determine
that because these are facts that are in the
books kept by the Board-- whose agreement with

the Board bas not been terminated or rescinded si
who has not repaid his indebtedness to the Board, and where tiere has been a
decrease or dapreciation in the market velue of such
land not the result of neglect or misrnmanegement on the
part of the settler, to make provision for the re-valuation of the said land subject :o the following
conditions
(a) Application for revaluation shall be submitted...

I suggest that it would be unseemly that
before the trial takes place the Board should
think of rendering a judgment. The whole
purpose of the Bill is to allow a Committee,
composed as explained later, to determine the
eottler's claim; and when that lias been
determined, then the report cones back to the
Board. It must not be forgotten that it is
the Board that is the creditor. It is the Board
that advances the money. The Board is the
party most interested, and it ses that the
conditions mentioned in what is practically
the preamble of the Act are observed. When
depreciation is claimed, of course the Board
has no authority to stay its hand and say:
"You siall not go before that Connittee,
because we have decided that there has been
neglect or minsmanagement on your part.'
I
think that question goes to the Comnrittee
as a matter of course. What does the
Commsittee inquire into? It inquires into
these very questions. Is it in paragraph (c)?

So there is no discretion on the part of the
Board. Once a claies of depreciation is
received, it is the duty of the Board to send
it to the proper Arbitration Committee.
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:
Honourable gentlemen, I would again point out that the words
"not the result of neglect or mismanagement"
are an essential condition of the authorization by the Governor General.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I want to ask the
honourable leader of the Government a question. Who is it that makes the decision in
regard to the question whether or not the
reduction of market value is or is not the
result of neglect or mismanagement on the
part of the settler?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The Committee.
Hon. W. B. ROSS:
decision.

The Board makes that

Hon
Mr. CALDER:
The Arbitration
Committee.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Arbitration
Board.
Hon. Mr. TANNER:
The Arbitration
Board?
Well, where in the Act is that
authority given to the Arbitration Board?
. Hon. W. B. ROSS:
The Arbitration
Board is tied down to one thing.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: That is what I see.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: At line 40 it reads:
tioii tlie hearing of all evidence submitted the
Commîittee shall decide tIhe extent to which depreciation
in value lias taken place.

Now, that is what it decides, and nothing
else. Prior to the application going to the
District Arbitration Committee it goes bcfore the Board, and the Board can decide a
great many things.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
The B5ard can
never decide as to whether there has been
neglect or not.
Hon. W. B. ROSS:
construct that Bill.

Then you have to re-

lon. Mr. CALDER:

That is true.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: There is not one
item of authority for that Committee to decide that question.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: It is of the Arbitration
Committee that the honourable gentleman
is thinking. That is right.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The authority of
the Committee is determined by the previous
part of the section.
Hon. Mr. BELAND:

Paragraph (c).
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The investigation
must be carried on under the terms which
precede, and which determine the kind of
inquiry that is to be made.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

The difference or depreciation in value te be deterinined shall be the diminution, not due te neglect or

-and the inprovements sold ta the settler, as cernpared with the price et whidh the settier agreed ta
purchase t'he aid land and unprovements froma the
Board.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: The Board cannot
move a step until that question is settled,
because the wording of the section, as my
honourable friend read it, precludes them
from rnoving until then.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: As I see it, the
difficulty cornes in the coxucluding portion of
the Bill, paragraph (j):
The Board inay, with the alpproval of the Governor
in, Council, make such regulations as bnay be necessary
for the executian of the purposes of tii section;

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
That is procedure.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Yes. That cannot
change the substance of law.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Suppose it is procedure, I have a right to discuss procedure
if the honourable gentleman will allow me.
I amn making a point that is very important
to many thousands of soldiers. and 1 arn
making it seriously. It gives the Board power
to mnake regulations for the execution of the
purposes of this section That means that the
Board may at the very outset say: "The
,conduct of the settier is something with whîch
we alone are familiar: we have been dealing
with him during the whole of his period on
the land." The Board may say that the
burden of proof shall be placed upon the
settier to show that depreciation is not the
resuit
of neglect
or
mismanagernent.
"Negleet" is plain enough. but what does
"mismanagernent" mean? The Board may
say that the rnan rnight have treated his
farrn very differently; see how So-and-so
treated similar land." Well, ail farmers have
not the same degree of ability in treating
land, and if the Board arrogates to itself to
,say whether the farmer has misrnanaged his
land, and if it inay refuse to allow an appeal
to the Local Arbitration Board, we shahl be
faced in connection with this legisiation, wilih
the sarne difficulty that has beexi the curse
,of the Pension Board legisiation. whereby a
Board set up by the Governrent may sirnply
say, "We think So-and-so, and the hurden
of proof is on you to show the contrary."
The soldier in rnany cases-cases that are

109

before the Board now-finds it physicaliy
impossible for him to furnish the proof. The
Board rules hirn out, saying. "In our opinion
the onus of proof is on you." IJnder this
Bill the Board may make regulations declaring that the burden shall he on the settier
to show that he has not mismanaged his land.
The moment that >is done the whole thing
hecomes another running sore to the thousands of settlers.
As I sec it, the matter would be remedied
by leaving out those words in the introductory section. I have no objection to their
being in the sections whereby the Arbitration
Committees are authorized to deal with applications, provided that the Arbitration Committee is allowed to deal with the whole
subject, and the vital part of it is not referred
to the Soldier Settlement Board.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
Doos not paragraph (h) cover the whole thing? The
matter hms to go to the Arbitration Board.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHiBY: I do not think
it does.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: It is very narrow
Hon Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable gentlemen wihl notice that paragraph (e) heaves
it optional with the Department or the Minister whethcr a District Arbitration Committee is appointed at ail or nlot The Minister
may appoint District Arbitration Committees
if in his opinion it is necessary. When such
a Cornmittee is appointed these questions
shail be referred to the Cýomrnittee, but it
is not compulsory that the Committee be
cstablished, as I read paragraph (e).
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGIHBY: The object cd
the Government, 1 take it, is to leave it to
the Board of Arbitration. Idf that is so, then
it should, be ahsolutely clear.
lion. Mr. BELCOURT:
Subsection 8
makes it impenative.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: What we do not
want to do is to put it in the bands of the
Soldier Settiemertt Board, by merely saying
he has mismanaged his land, to put a stopper
on any application a man, ray make.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Oh. no. Some
honourable gentlemen may he worried as to
who is to hear the onus cdf proof. But you
eau only establish mismanagement and neglect
by positive evidence. You cannet prove a
negative.
Hon. Mr. CGRIESB-AOH: But the matter
to go hefore this Arhitration Committee
must be conseemted to by the Soldier Settiement Board.

110

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

No.

A man must
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
apply to the Soldier Settlement Board for a
revaluation, and the matter must then be
passed on by the Com.mittee. If the Soldier
Settlement Board is empowered by this clause
te say, "We will not pass it on because he has
mismanaged his land," a grievance is created.
It seems to me that what the honourable
gentleman from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Taylor) wants to do is to take it out of the
iSettlement Board and
hands of the 1Soldier
make it a question for the Arbitration Board,
because there you have a representative of the
Soldier Settlement Board and the representative of the soldier himself. Do net stop
a man bringing his appeal because of :power
given to the Board.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: You have to define
the remedy or right which this Bill creates.
That is what is done by the first part of section 68.
Then the detail of the manner of
exercising that right is determined.
The Act
provides under subsection (b) that the moment the application is made the Board shall
refer it to this arbitral Committee. In other
words, this arbitral Committee cannot possibly deal with the matter except in the
manner indicated, and the Board is not in a
position to perform its duty until this committee has inquired and made a finding. Then
it is up to the Board to apply the decision
made by this inquiry Committee.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I would suggest that
my honourable friend let this Bill stand over
until to-morrow, and that we go on with the
rest of the Order Paper. iPerhaps our thoughts
will be clearer then.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Although they
may be absolutely useless, I have no objection
to adding in line 18, after the word "settler,"
the words, " as determined by the District
Arbitration Committee."
lon. W. B. ROSS: That will not work.
That will force you to reconstruct the whole
Act. because as it stands now the Board deals
with certain things and makes a reference over
to the arbitral Committee who are now tied
down to one thing, namely fixing the value.
If you are going te enlarge thatHon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not claim
that I am enlarging that. I believe that under
paragraph (c) the arbitral Committee will have
to determine that very fact-that there has
been a depreciation in value from the amount
paid to the present value, not owing to neglect
or mismanagement on the part of the settler.
Hon.

Mr.

GRIESBACH.

I claim this is the mandate given to the
arbitral Committee, but I have not had time
to look at the whole autonomy of the Act.
The Board, as represented by the gentleman
at my elbow, has no intention of undermining
that feature.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Was it the intention
of the draftsman that that question should be
settled by the Atbitration Comnittee?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is the Arbitration Committee alone who settle that.
The Board merely
Hon. Mr. BEIQTJE:

according to that decision.

precedent.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not believe
it is necessary, but I am mentioning it in
order to make it clear that the Board has
no idea of taking over the determination of
those facts under this clause.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: It would be easier to
insert the amendment in paragraph (h).
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yeu can do it by
adding a very few words-"as then defined."
Then, I will
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
move to adýd in line 42 on page 2 the words
"as then defined."
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Then you will have to
take those words out of section 68.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Does not my honourable friend think that the Act, when it
purports to create a remedy, must define the
remedy?
The first part of section 68 is to

It is a remedy for reparation or compensation,
Hon. W. B. ROSS: The way the matter

the man has fallen down through his own
neglect or mismanagement.

of the whole business.

Look now at section

Hon. Mr. MURPHY:
That is the first
draft. Those words have been eliminated.

-where there has been a decrease or depreaiation in
the market value of such land not the result of neglect
or misnmanagenent on the part of the settler.

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: I am glad they have
been, because they would be very dangerous.

Now, paragraph (h) plainly leaves it to the
Soldier Settlement Board to say whether or
not the application before them is supported
as aforesaid, in this subsection 1; and then,
if the Soldier Settlement Board thinks it is
so, they proceed by the next section to refer
it to the District Arbitration Committee. But
they do not refer it to that Committee unless
they are satisfied that the claim is supported
as aforesaid, that is, that it is not due to what
they may think is neglect or mismanagement.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: I take it that the support required there is the declaration of the
claimant.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Yes. Paragraph (b)
is the only one in which the word "supported"
appears prier to its appearance in the paragraph to which the honourable gentleman
has just drawn attention. Speaking subject
to correction, that is the support referred to
in paragralph (h); otherwise there would be
ground for the apprehension that my honourable friend expresses; but obvi-ously it
refers to the requirement set out in paragraph
(h), which refers to support that must accompany the application.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR:
I understand the
foundation of the honourable gentleman's
argument, and how it might be argued that it
means that.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: It can bae made clear
beyond any doubt or eontroversy if the words
were inserted: "supported as defined in paragraph (b)."

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Yes, 'certainly. That
would prevent the Soldier Settlement Board
from applying all those other sections, which
I .am apprehensive they may do, under cover
of the authority given them in the final section, to make whatever regulations they like.
I am glad the honourable gentleman has
called attention to paragraph (b), because
there is something there that requires attention also. The concluding lines of this paragraph call for:
-a written staterment of the sertier setting forth his
belief as to preserbt value of the land and his reasons
theretfor, and the names and addresses of any persons
whon the settler proposes as witnesses to the present
value:

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
My honourable
friend is not reading from the Bill before the
House.
Hon.

Mr. TAYLOP

Hon. Mr. BELAND:

That is right.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: You suggest the
other amendment as required by paragraph
(,b) ?
Hon. Mr. BELAND: There is no objection
to that.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:
as amended.

I move .paragraph (c),

The Hon. the CHAIRMAN:
Strike out
the word "market" in two places. Shall paragraph (c), as amended, be adopted?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I do not think you
have got this matter right yet. If a settler
wishes to get the Soldier Settlement Board in
motion, certain things have to happen, according to new section 68. He has to make
an application, and it has to appear that he
purchased land from the Board, that he has
not assigned it, that he has not trnnsferred
his interet, that his agreement with the Board
has not been terminated or rescinded, that
he has net repaid his indebtedness to the
Board, and that there has been a decrease in
the market value of such land, not the result
of neglect or mismanagement on the part of
the settler. Now, that has all to appear before the Soldier Settlement Board gets in
motion at all, in order to start the other
Board.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
My honourable
friend is wrong. I would ask him to read
paragraph (b); the support is defined there
clearly-as to what he must do. These are
things which are to be determined later on,
but his application will be referred to the
Committee for the purpose of ascertaining
those very things.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: But the Soldier Settlement Board are not entitled to start in motion
at all until these conditions are first complied
with.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The section says
the application must be supported, and when
the affidavit or supporting evidence cornes in
the Board must refer it to the Committee.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Are all those words in
new section 68 down to line 20 to have no
meaning at all
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: As I said before,
new section 68 creates the remedy, and defines
it.

JUNE 1, 1926
Hon. Mr. TANNER: It goes further; it
says that must appear before any step can b
taken.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: New section 68
lias but one objeet; it is to dfine and determine exactly this new remedy created by this
Act. Then there are subsections providing
that there must 'be an application supported
by an affidavit, showing certain things. Then
the subsection determines the way to ascertain this compensation. That has to be done
by a tribunal of arbitration, and in making
their compensation they must hear evidence
and take into account whetlier the depreciation of land has been caused by mismanagenient or negleet on the part of the applicant.
Th-at is What this Ar'bitration Committee investigates. The Board does not investigate
anything at ail; ail it has to do is to ascertain
that the application 'bas corne, and is supported by affidavit. The Board has nothing
to do but imrnediately refer it to this Arbitration Committee, who hear evîdence on ail
the requirements of the Act, and report to the
Board, and the Board acts accordingly.
Hon. Mr, TAYLOR:
Wbat is the objection to making the B-il say so?

this depreciation is not the resuit of negleet
or mismanagement on bis part.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I would suggest that

we discuss this any further.

We have here quite a number of legal lights.
I confess that 1 read the Bill witbout any
idea that there could be something like a
deep-laid plot behind it, and I do nlot think
there is.
Now, what does new section 68 purport to
say and do? Simply to indicate wlio will be

is the' settier. Then the Bill proceeds to say
that notwithstanding anytbing in tliis Act

115

JIJNE 1, 1926
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Mr. Chairman, I
would rather withdraw tbe motion if it is
flot going to be put.
Hon. Mr. BELGOURT: The honourable
gentleman from Edmonton is discussing the
motion now.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: My suggestion is
very short, and to me it seems to be quite
sensible. I do flot know bow it may appeal
to others. Take paragraph (b) and complete
this provision by saying that the a.pplication
shall be supported by a statutory declaration
witb regard to the requirements of subsection
1, setting forth that the settier bas agreed
to purchase the ]and, that ail the other conditions have been complied witb; that the
land bas depreciated in value and not because of any wrongdoing on the part of the
applicant, and then amend paragraph (h)
by saying, "Upon the receipt of an application for revaluation supported as required
by paragraph (b) ." It seems to me that in
this way you take out of the hands of the
Board the power to declare that, on account
of wrongdoing on bis part, the applicant cannot proceed furtber wben be bas merely filed
bis statutory declaration setting out bis
dlaim. If paragraph (h) is made to read,
"U[pon receipt of an application for revaluation supported as required Iby paragrapb
(b)", tbe matter goes right ahead. Tbat is
the suggestion that I would offer.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: The applicant asks for
a trial.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Asks for a trial
and gives bis statement of dlaim.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: That is thec way it
ought to be reconstructed, but in its present
f orm you have two trials.
I would rather
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
witbdraw my motion.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I arn going to
make another attempt, a very brief one. I
will flot repeat what I said about tbe first
part-the finding of this new reçnedy. I amn
going to put my explanation in the negative,
if I may. I say that when the application
cornes to tbe Board the first tbing the Board
must do is to see that tbe application-to
use the words of the Bili-is supported by
an affidavit containing the particulars mentioned in the Statute. That is the first requirement. If tbere is no affidavit supporting the application, the Board is not called
upon to ref er it, and that is the end of the
matter. The Board xnay say: 'UIt is flot
supported by affidavit and yiou have no
dlaim; tbere is notbing to refer." Then tbe

Board may, as my bonourable friend the
leader on the other side said a moment ago,
proceed to consider tbe questions tbat are
mentioned tbere. For, instance, bas tbe
settler's agreement with tbe Board been
terminated? If it lias been terminated, then
tbere is notbing to -investigate; there is no
occasion to refer the matter to this Arbitration Committee. If tbe settler has repaid his
indebtedness, again tbere is no occasion to
make a reference, because the Act does not
provide any remnedy for bim. If there is no
affidavit, or if tbe evidence is before the
Board, blinding tbem, that these other conditions that I have just mentioned exist, then
there is -nothing to refer; the applicant bas
not brought bimscîf witbin the provisions of
the Statute and be cannot expect any investigation as to a decrease in value of bis
property. If the Board flnds that be bas a
rigt--an incboate or indefinite right, not
ascertained as to the amount of compensation, it refera the matter to this Ai'bitration
Committee for the purpose of baving the
amount of :compensation detcrmined, the
Committee being empowered to take into
consideration the various restrictions and
conditions imposed by tbe Statute. Then
tbey give their decision. Tbey find eitber
tbat tbe application is cntitled to compensation or that be is not. If be is not, of
course, that ýis the end of it.
Hon. Mr. BELAND:

The Board?

No, no: the
Hon. Mr. BELQIOURT:
The Arbitration
Arbitration Committee.
Committee's decision is final. It reports to
the Board, and the Board is bound to accept that decision a.nd act upon it. If the
Committee find that tbe applicant is not entitled to any compensation, the Board gives
no compensation. Il tbe report of .tbe
Ar*jitration Committee is that be is entitled
to, say, $500 compensation, the Board arranges tbe 'books accordingly, gives bim credit
for that amount, and makes the entries, and
tbe whole matter is settled. But there is no
evidence of negligence or of mismanagement
on bis part except what is given before this
tribunal of ai'bitration. It is only failu-re te
comply w1ith the ;conditions mentioned in
section 68 that wMJi prevent tbe applicant
f rom baving bis application Teferred te tbis
Arbitration Committee, and such failure may
appear by tbe books of the Board, wbicb in
themselves constitutes evidence. I bave read
the Bill, and it seems to me we have been
discussing for two bours a great many clifficulties and complications wbich are not te
be found in it at alýl.

SENATE
Honourable gentleHon. Mr. TAYLOR:
men, I think that in two minutes I could
show the honourable gentleman who has just
taken his seat something that he has not
mentioned and that is absolutely fatal to his
argument; but I am a.ware that there is a
motion that the Committee rise and report
progress. I really think we should put this
off until tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Honourable gentlemen, before the motion is put I would like
to draw attention to this point. My difficulty is with the wording of paragraph (b).
The honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) says that according to his reading of
the Bill the Arbitration Board or Committee
decides everything--decides all questions of
fact.
Hon. Mr. BELGOURT: No. My honourable friend misunderstood me. I said that
there were certain facts which might appear
from the books of the Board, with regard to
the conditions mentioned.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: But I understood the
honourable gentleman to say that it is the
Arbitration Committee that decides the question whether or not depreciation was due to
mismanagenient on the part of the settler.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: Yes, I say that
the sole function of this Arbitration Comquestion of deprecia-

nittee is to decide the

tion.

It has nothing else to do.

Hon W. 13. ROSS:

That is right.

Better get an
Hon Mr. STANFIELD:
opinion on it from the Justice Department.
lon. Mr. BEIQUE: But may I ask a
question, so that I may understand? Does
the honourable gentleman contend that the
Arbitration Committee decides the question
whether or not the depreciation is due, wholly
or in part, to the settl'er?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
only thing it has to do.

Yes.

That is the

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: That is what I understood the honourable gentleman to say. Now.
my difficulty about that is the wording of
paragraph (h). which says:
Upon rccpt of an application for revaluation supported as aforesaid, the Board shall refer the sane to
the District Arbitration Commnittee who will thereupon
fix a convenient timue and place and upon the hearing
of all evidence submitted the Committee shall decide
the
extent to which depreciation in value has taken
place and its decision or that of any two of its members shall be final and conclusive.

My difficulty, I repeat, is due to the use
of those words, "the Committee shall decide
the extent to which depreciation in value has
Hon.

Mr.

BELCOURT.

taken place."
It would be much clearer
if after those words we added, "and as to
whetber such depreciation was or was not
the result of neglect or mismanagement on
the part of the settler."
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: We have covered
all that by adding after the words "in value"
the words, "as above defined."
I move that
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the Committee rise and report progress. But
I may state that I think we can redraft the
first part of section 68 so as to provide that
when an application is submitted to the
Board, containinig certain things, the Board
shall refer those matters to the Committee.
Hon. W. B. ROSS:
do it.

That is the way te

The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: I understand
there are no amendments to report yet.

RE-PORT 0F

COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON presented the
report of the Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours on Bill H5, an Act to
Incorporate the Detroit and Windsor Subway
Company, and moved that this report be
taken into consideration to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Honourable gentlemen, whcn this Bill was before the Committce I pointed out that under clause 7 the
capital stock of the company is to, consist of
1,000,000 shares without nominal or par value,
and that there was no guarantee that the
company would not commence operations
when it had no assets in its treasury. It is
incumbent upon companies of this kind to
have a fair amount in their treasury before
commencing operations. I stated,' and it was
understood, I think, by the Committee, that
1 would look into the matter and would
prepare a notice of motion to be made when
the report would be taken into consideration.
I give notice that whcn the report is taken
rnto consideration I will move:
That the following be added to section 7'The conipany shail not commaence ifs operation or
dolarsincur sny liabilfty before a sutn of At lesat

I would suggest $25ýM0

or $50,000-

-has been paid iato ifs treasury, and wbich sum shall
not be withdrawn except for the pueposes oi the
uuiderta.Icilng of the company or espon its dissolution."

In the case of a railway company, under
the Railway Act. it cannot commence its
operations before 10 per cent of its authorized capital bas been subscribed. There is

there a guarantee that if liabilities are incurred there will be something with which
But in this case,
to pay suoli liabilities.
as the shares are to be without nominal
or par value, and as the shares can be issued
as paid-up shares for whatever consideration
may be fixed by the promoters of the oompany, I think it would be bad legisiation to
allow the company to begin operations before
there is a reasonable amount in the treasury.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Do I 'understand that the honourable gentleman gives
that as a notice of motion on the third
reading of the Bill?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: No; when the reort
of the Committee is taken into consideration.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It is not the
ruie to amend a report in that way. If the
honourable gentleman wighes to have the
report refered back to the CommitteeHon. Mr. BEIQUE: No. Let it be on
the third reading.

But
there comes in then a report from the Soldier
Settlement Board to say: "A certain number
of dollars of that depreciation has been determined by us under paragraph (c) as due

I think, if
those two are read together, that conclusion
is inevitable, because if there is not to be a
diminution from the finding of the Committee because of neglect or mismanagement,
what is the use of including that in paragraph (c)?

122

SENATE

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: My understanding
of subsection (1) of section 68 as amended is
that it ensures to the applicants an appeal to
this Board. I followed the honourable gentleman from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Taylor)
in his argument dast night, when he sai1d that
the clause as it stood might enable the Soldier
Settlement Board to block the proceedings by
interjecting that the soldier had not farmed
his land properly. That point seems to be
covered by this amendment. The remainder
satisfies me. inasmuch as the man has an
undoubted right to appeal under the first
clause. Nothing can stop that: it must go
forward. If the declaration which is required
does not disclose the necessary facts upon
which an appeal can be made, then the
Arbitration Committee wili have to strike out
the application and the appli.cant must accept
that. He must have bought the land, be must
have agreed to pay a certain price, and he
must have contractual relations with the
Board. I am quite satisfied that paragraph
(c) is merelv a direction to the Arbitration
Committee as to the law upon vhich they
shall make their finding. With the alteration.
I think that down to the end of paragraph
(h) the first clause of the Bill is all right.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: As I understand the
situation, a settiler makes application to the
District Superintendent, and he cannot by
any action prevent that application coming
before the Arbitration Board.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Absolutelv.

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: I do net want to be too
pcr.;istent, honourable gentlemen, but this is
a matter affecting many hundreds of soldiers,
and I want it to be made perfectly clear, The
question is munch larger than that. As pointed
oct last night by the honourable gentleman
from de Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique), the
Arbitration Committee has no authority to
inquire as to how much of the depreciation is
due te neglect and mismanagement: its
authority is expressly defined here.
The
Committee shalll decide the extent to which
depreciation in value bas taken place. After
that is decided in percentage or in dollars,
what is to be done next is set ont in paragraph
(i), namely, that their finding is te be taken
and treated as provided for in paragraph (c).
When you refer back to paragraph (c) yeu
find that there is a requirement that such
proportion of the depreciation as is due to
neglect and mismanagement on the part of
the settler shall be deducted from the award
of the Arbitration Boards. Now, as I say, the
settler bas no opportunity of meeting a computation of that kind unless it be made by the
Arbitration Committee. I am quite content
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

that it should be made by the Arbitration
Committee, if the settler is represented; but
I am not satisfied that it should be made by
the Settlement Board and deducted by the
Arbitration Committee.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I understand the
honourable gentleman has referred to what I
said last night. It is true that last night I
was under the impression that the clause was
net clear because of the wording of subsection
(h); but when I was told by the honourabie
member from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) that
the words "as herein above defined" were to be
added, that satisfied me. I think with the
addition of those words it is clear that under
subsection (h) it will be for the Arbitration
Board to pass upon the whole question of
wbether there is any depreciation, and if so,
what amount, and whether or not it is due to
neglect and mismanagement.
I quite agree with the honourable gentleman
who bas already called attention to the fact
that paragraph (c) merely defines the depreciation upon which the Arbitration Board will
have to pass.
Hon.
says:

Mr.

GRIESBACH:

124

SENATE

of the Department of Justice to the representation made to my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Then we have done
with that, and if the cross-examination is
discontinued I will proceed.
I have very serious objections ta this clause
as it stands at present.
You are going to
make thirty, forty or fifty different Arbitration
Boards throughout the country.
That will
create dissatisfaction and there will net be
uniformity.
You will have a Board on one
side of a line reducing the price, and another
Board on the other side of the line increasing it.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: Not increasing it.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
Making it higher
than the valuation fixed by the valuators on
the other side of the line.
There will be no
uniformity about it. There will be thirty or
forty different Boards.
The Bill is drawn in such a way that there
will be three Arbitrators, and two of them
may make the decision, which will be final.
It is unnecessary for me to say that you can
never have forty different Arbitration Boards
that will not be divided upon some principle.
Error will creep in. In some cases the valuation will be too high; in some cases it will
be too low.
There will be, as I say, a great
deal of dissatisfaction.
My idea is that there should be a Provincial Board-one Board of Arbitrators for each
province. The Board could take evidence as
to the valuation, sitting in different parts of
the province, and at least their decision wou'd
be uniform. How are you going to work in
a matter involving such a huge sum of money
as will be involved in these reductions, if you
have to appoint Arbitration Boa.rds in forty
or fifty different places? Then you provide
that there shall be no appeal. There may be
cases in which one man may be influenced by
a graat deal of sympathy for the soldier; on
the other Land, another man will say that the
land in the particular district in which ha lives
is of greater value. There will be a great deal
of dissatisfaction and no uniformîity at all.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: How many Soldier Settlement Districts are there in the
Province?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: In Manitoba? I do
not know how many in Manitoba, and I do
not know how many in Ontario.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBA.CH: There is probably
only one in Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Noosense!
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Ask the question
and sec.
Hon.

Mr.

DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I do not have to
ask the question.
The honourable gentleman may ask for his own information. I
desire to point out that the absence of any
appeal from the decision of two arbitrators
will result in nothing but confusion and dissatisfaction when such huge interests are left
to the decision of Arbitration Boards composed of different individuals. I would like
to sec that clause redrafted, and if I am
allowed I will move an amendment to it to
the effect that there shall be a Board for each
province.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:
Honourable gentlemen, I think that the suggestion is worthy
of serious consideration. Yesterday the same
thing occurred to my mind, not only for the
reason that dissatisfaction is liable to be
created because one Board wii deal more
iiberally than another, but also for the reason
that the cost will be considerably increased
if there is a multiplicity of Boards. I think
the suggestion to have one Board for
each
province should be seriously considered.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Before the honourable
memiber for Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. McMexans)

consider the question whether it would not be

person who wants fair play and justice but

kinds of conditions creating discontent. Besides what the honourable member for Winnipeg has pointed, there will be the enormous
expense. There are three personse to sit with

in twelve months by one Judge, because he
would have to go into each Judicial District
and hear the witnessee at hand. Each case
vill stand on its own merits, and you will
have cases in British Columbia, in Nova
Scotia, and all over the Northwest. If you
think that these matters may be settled
within the next five years and there is no
harm in delay, then the Senate can suggest
the Exchequer Court. But, honourable gentlemen, do not forget that this is a matter
in which we are threatened with the departure
from the land of the thousands of settlers
who have remained there in spite of adverse
circumstances and are hoping for some kind
of relief. Now, is it judicious to appoint a
judge whose duty it would be to investigate
all those cases? He can do it admirably if
the necessary time is given him, but I wonder
if anyone can assert that the work may be
done by a single judge, who would have to
hear witnesses regarding the conditions in
certain small areas and would have to go
from one Judicial District to another. This
Bill speaks of Judicial Districts, and although
I have answered that there is but one
Settlement Board in Manitoba, it must be
remembered that there are more Judicial
Districts. I doubt very much that the purpose of the Bill would be effected in the
way jušt proposed.
There was a rather
lengthy discussion on this very question of
the composition of the Board, and I believe
the general consensus of opinion among
members from the West was in favour of
some kind of local Board. The division of
opinion was as between having one County
Judge alone, and having him assisted by a
representative of the Soldier Settlement Board
and a delegate from the soldier claimants
themselves. After an exhaustive discussion
the conclusion was that which is embodied
in the Bill. Now, I leave this matter to
the Senate, but I am afraid that if the
suggestion to refer the matter to the
Exchequer Court is adopted there will be
considerable dissatisfaction and harm will
ensue.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
Could not the
matter be adjusted in this way, that the
Governor General could appoint for each
province an arbitrator who has some experience in land matters? I think the honourable member from Edmonton (Hon. Mr.
Griesbach) supposes that there is only one
Court to sit in Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
from that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

I have receded

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
And the gentleman sitting next to the honourable leader of
the Government says that there is only one
Settlement Board.
The Bill does not say
that at ail.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No.
I have
just mentioned the fact that the Bill refers
to the Judicial Districts.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
That is what I
wanted to expiain-that there are a great
many different Districts. My only desire is to
help the returned soldiers as much as possible,
and I am very much in favour of the Bill. but
I can sec the confusion that will result. Could
not the honourable leader suggest that the
Government appoint one particular judge or
arbitrator for the whole province of Manitoba?
Then let him go through the province and
take the evidence. and settle the matter. In
that way we would have uniformity of decision. I would also suggest that in the event
of there being, in the opinion of the Minister,
any miscarriage of justice. provision should
be made -for an appeal. Mistakes are bound
to creep in sometimes in cases of that kind.
This is too serious and too important a matter
to pass over casually by giving the County
Court Judge and two other men in every
District in the country full power to deal
with it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
This Chamber
has a perfect right to express its opinion and
to set up a tribunal of a different kin fron
that which is embodied in this Bill.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: But we are facin
a decision that has been adopted after very
long discussion, lasting days and days. in the
other Chamber. Is it worth while altering the
constitution of the Committee and adopting
the alternative which has already been rejected
by the other House? Of course. we have the
right to do so. and to express our opinion.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I think the honourable
gentleman is rather exaggerating the time that
it would take the Exchequer Court Judge to
make the valuations. The seeding season
for this year is over, and you have
at least six or seven months to give the
Exchequer Court Judge for the work to be
done. I venture to say that he can decide
all those cases satisfactorily inside of four
or five months.-perhaps three or four; because if he goes into a district, takes one
farm into consideration, and settles upon what
has happened in regard te deterioration of
land> in that district, the question is practically
settied for all the farms in that district.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: No.

JUNE 2, 1926
Hon, W. B. ROSS: Very largely. 0f cours,
there are side questions. But there must be
some general principle affecting land ail over
thle Northwest, whether the deterioration may
be piaced at 10 per cent, as one -man has
estimated it, or at 20, or, as bas been estimated
by some, as high as 50 per cent. When he
bas arrived at the principie to appiy in the
district, the heavier part of his work is done.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: In any case the
very extended period mentioned by the honourable leader of the Government can be
divided by two, because there are two Judges
in the Exchequer Court, and Mr. Justice MbLean could do bis share of the work. Probably
lie would be more familiar with thé Eastern
sections, as hie cornes from Nova Scotia. One
Judge niight take the Eastern section of the
country, and the other one, who knows the
whole country very well, could take the Western sections. I think the suggestion made is an
excellent one, and I arn sure the valuations
could lie made very quickly, because, as the
honourable leader of the Opposition in this
Bouse says, when the extent of depreciation
in one place had been determined, that would
apply within a pretty wide radius from the
particular properties, and then it would be
imerely a question of declaring that the depreciation was so *much for this land, and so
much for the other. The honourable Senator
from De Salaberry MHon. Mr. Béýique) reminds me of the Home Bank and the thousands of cases that had to be decided. There
was no trouble in that connection.
Hon. Mr. CALD~ER: They are not decided
yet.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: In regard to this section, I think that, with ail the machinery
required, it would lie cxtremely expensive.
Take, for example, the province of Saskatchewan. It basHon. Mr. CALDER: About twenty Districts.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: About twenty Judicial
Districts, presided over by District Court
Judges. In each of those judicial districts
there are settlers who will make application
under this Bill for readjustment of their
land. That will mean the creation of 20
Boards. I think that every one must agree
that that would be an outrage, and the expense would be enormous.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: And no uniformity.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: No uniformity. Honourable mexnbers will recolleet that a year
or two ago a Bill came to this Bouse from

127'

the Bouse of Commons relating to pensions,
I think, suggesting that we appoint a Board
for practically each rnilitary district in every
Province. A Committee of this Bouse got
together, and cut that down to one Coinmittee for the entire Dominion, and that plan
worked out very satisfactorily.
If we pass the present Bill with this clause
as it appears, it will create very expensive
machinery, and will flot be satisfactory. As
pointed out by the honourable gentleman
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. McMeans), there
will be no uniformity, and of course that
wiIl create a great deal of discontent.
As I stated on the second reading of the
Bill last niglit, I think the whole scheme is
wrong. The soldiers. particiilarly tho.se in
the western county, are agitating for a scheme
entirely different from the one outlined in
this Bill. They have repeatedly asked for a
reasonable reduction or entire elimination of
the interest that is being charged on their
accounts. Now, that need not involve any
expense at ail. Ail that would lie necessary
would lie to elirninate the interest that has
been charged, either in part, say one-haif, or
altogether, and that would satisfy ail the
soldiers from one end of the country to the
other.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: For the time beîng;
but interest would simply hegin to accumulate again, and you would have to start the
plan once more.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: We might start from
the beginning. and charge them only the
original amount advanced for land and
equipment.
If the argument
Bon. Mr. CALDER:
is that they have paid too mucli for the
land, how are you going to improve their
condition by simply wiping out the interest?
Hlon. Mr. GILLIS: The plan is based in
this way: the amount is fixed for a terni of
25 years with principal and annual payments, and the interest amouints practically
to almost as much as the amount originally
borrowed. If the interest is eliminated, they
will be able to meet their principal payments yearly. That is what they have asked.
It may not lie a feasible sebeme, but they
have asked for it. I think the country would
flot lose any more money by that scheme
than by the present one.
Bon. Mr. CALDER:

And save ahl costs.

Bon. Mr. GILLIS: Save ail costs. There
would lie no arbitrations, and I think we
couid make conditions that would lie more
satisfactory, and that would satisfy the
soldiers. Under this Bill we are going to

SENATE
have discontent, and I think it will cause
more soldiers to abandon their land than
have gone thus far. No matter whether the
consideration of the Arbitration Committee
is right or wrong, the probability is that the
soldier will be discontented, and I question
very much if this Bill is going to accomplish
the object the Government have in view.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I would like
to know if there has been an estimate of
the cost of this revaluation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is impossible
to say, because it ail depends on the number
of cases. There may be 11.000 cases in which
action will be necessary.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: How many tribunals
will you have, and how much per day will
the members of those Committees receive?
They will sit as long as they can; they would
sit forever if possible.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It is impossible to say how many tribunals there
will he. because every individual settler has
the right to appoint bis own arbitrator.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Yes, and we
are going to pay for it. I think we al!
recognize, those who are nost kindly disposed to the soldiers as well as others, that
we -annot begin to give general satisfaction,
and trhit there wili still be grievances in the
mindcs of nany of theni that we cannot
rcnedy. Ail that we can pretend to do is
to give even-handed justice, and make the
Comnmittees function properly in order to
kecp those people on the land; that is the
se ttlement idea. If it were possible to simplify the machinery, and cheapen it very
-largely in its adjudication, in the way suggested by my honourable leader, the idea
wouid certainly be well worth consideration.
Wlatever other results would accrue, we
would have uniformity, which would be very
desirable, and also an enormous reduction
in the expense.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I quite agree that if
it is possible to croate one court to deal with
the situation it would be proferable, from
many standpoints which have been explained;
but I fear that one judge or even two judges
of the Exchequer Court could not possibly
handle the situation within a reasonable time.
The case of the Home Bank bas been referred
to, but I understand there are a great many
claims pressing for decision in that case. se
that the situation there has not been dealt
with as rapidly as some honourable gentlemen may have thought it would' be.
I thoroughly agree with the remarks made
by the honourable gentleman from Whitewood
H on. Mr. GILLIS.

(Hon. Mr. Gilis). that we have 20 judicial
districts, and I am safe in saying that there
is not one district in which there are not returned soldiers. On the other hand, I take it
that every one of those 11,000 returned
soldiers who are in arrears is going to make
application to have the price of his land reduced. That is only natural; if there is a
chance for reduction, they are going to put
in applications.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: An application
does not cost anything.
lon. Mr. CALDER: No, it does not cost
anything; so we will have 11,000 applications
to be considered. Now, one of the purposes
of this legi-slaton is to keep the men on the
land, but if this work drags along for two or
three ears the men will disappear, and that
is not desirable. In our province applications
will come from 20 districts, there wiil be 20

the Goverinment and to ail concerned. If it
is at all possible to eliminate that and provide
soie sinplified machinery, I think it should
be doue.
My personal suggestion is that in a province like ours three Arbitration Committeos
instead of 20. could handle the situation in
sutilcient timie. Let the Boards be constituted
in the saie way, making provision for representatives of the Soldter Settlement Board,
the' judges, and the representatives of soldiers,
come together and reach conand let ther
clusions as to the yard-sticks that should be
applied in every portion of the province.
In

that way

the tribunals could handle this

mxatter in reasonable time, and also do evenhanded justice so far as it can be done. If
it were possible that the Exchequer Court,
or their agents properly instructed, could
handle the situation throughout the whole
Dominion, that would be preferable, but I
fear that they would not be able to do so
witîhin a reasonable time.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: There is very serious
objection to these Boards. We ask ourselves,
how are they going to be paid-by the year,
or by the day? One would not appoint a
man who has a yearly salary, for he has his
work to do, and he would drive through it
as fast as ho could, and get it out of the way.
If you appoint a Committee and pay the
members $30 or $40 a day, you do not know
when they will finish their work. We know
that in this wicked world these things are
spun out as long as possible. So we do net
know what this plan will cost, and when we

SENATE
The objection that was made by my friend
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. MeMeans) seemcd
to me a rather vital one-that you will have
no uniformity, no strict line upon which, decisions wilI lie made.
Here you have a Board whie.h bas been
appointed with the ides, of being good to the
soldier settiers. Thjs Senate wants to be
good to those settiers, wants to sec tliem
fairly treated, and, if there is to lie a divergence eiflher way, wants it to be on the
side of generosity rather than that of parsimony. There is no objection to that; bu,
when you corne to the systemn which, is embodied in this Bill, and follow out what it
means, it is going to run into tremendous
expense, it is going to affect a variety of
minds on whjch the decisions of these Boards
wilI operate, and in the end are you going
to give mucli satisfaction to the soldier
settier bimself, or is it going to end in multiplying dissatisfaction, because a man on
this side of the line, or in some other district, lias been treated in a certain way, while
another a few miles distant lias been treated
,on a different principle?
At least we have gone far enough to make
sure of two things: that this is a most
baphazard way of getting at justice in the
matter, and that it is a most expensive way
as it looms before us at this time. Everybody knows that in assessing damages and
arriving at valuations there is sucli a thing
as expert knowledge, and there is sucli a
thing as no knowledge at aIl about such
matters, and no particular adaptability for
it; but there exists a strong sentiment tliat
you will make it as pleasant as you can for
the man who prefers the dlaim. Now, we
want to make it just, and perliaps a littie
more than just, to the claimant, and give
him. the very best judgment possible; but this
country lias some stake in the matter
as well,'
and where there are millions of dollars in
values -to be taken into account, and treated
by a multiplicity of Boards, some with lack
of experience, 1 feel that we are facing a
very important question as to expense and
as to methods.
At first siglit I took the suggestion which
was made by the lionourable leader of the
Opposition (Hon. W. B. Ross) as being most
excellent. He has named a man of experience, wlio lias been at the work of valuation
for 20 or 30 yes, and lias become an expert at it. He lias a conscience, even thougli
lio possesses this expert knowledge, and lie
applies ahl this expert skill and a good deal
of bis sympatliy, and all bis conscience to
bis decisions, and in the end lie gets at wliat
is tihe just mean to be given in lis valuation.
Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

That is an important quality to have in a
man, and one whicli in tlie end will give more
satisfaction to the soldier settlers tlian will
the decisions of all those different amalgamations of Boards, 100 or more in number,
made up of all classes of persons, witli and
without experience. If we could carry out
this suggestion, and secure during the course
of a year the time whicli two judges of tlie
Exehequer Court could give to those decisions, there would lie no doubt in my mind
as to the wisdomn of adopting that plan.
O ther suggestions bave ie en made whicli are
well worth thinking over a bit. There is an
utter lack of information. It may be a very
diffcult thing to give the number of Boards,
and the expenses, and so on, but as the
matter cornes before us it would seemn that
the numnber of Boards would lie very large
and the expeoses very heavy. I think that we
should take time, and give sucli senatorial
wisdom as -we possess. a little opportunity for
action before we finally settle tlie matter.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: May I ask the honourable gentleman's opinion ýwith regard to
the number of Boards? Would lie favour a
smaller number of Arbitration Boa.rds, say
one per Province, or one for the whole of
Canada, or as many Boards as there are
judicial districts?
Riglit Hon. Sir 'GEORGE E. FOSTER: In
the flrst place, we mnust have macbinery whicb
will not cause delay. As between a hu.ndred
or more Boards and the other alternatives, I
would le favourable to having two or three
Boards for a province, if one cannot do it.
We bave to try to provide machinery that will
do the work within the time, and -give it tlie
utmost attention at the lowest cost.
Hon. Mr. -GORDON: If the Boards are
flot limited in number, no doubt aIl kind of
trouble is going to arise. ýLet me point to
paragrapli (e), which says in part:
Provided, however, that any settler applicant may,
if he so desires, norainate an ax'bitrator to represent hirm
upon the hearing of his application and in every suiol
case tise arbitrator so noqninated shall replace the third
arbitrator to lbe appointed. by tihe Minister as aforesaid.

Any person- can see wbat that would lead

Hon. Mr. BELAND:

Hou. Mr. GILLIS: This la a very important feature of the Bill. As we are going
ta adjourn until Monday next, why flot appoint a small committee ta take tlus into
considieration sud ta report on Monday night?
Our .past experience with -such committees
has been very satisfactory, aud probably such
a committee could devise somne scheme which
would meet with the approval af 'the House.
We cannot close aur eyes ta the .fact that
this provision is a blot on this piece of legisîstien.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I am impressed
with what liais been said about the leck of
standardization. As the honourable gentleman from Regina (Hou. Mr-. Calder) says the
lack of a cominon yardstick la a seriaus matter.
One is inclined ta wonder whether a common
yardstick caun be applied ta land values al
over Canada. I know the expense invalved
by this legislation will be very consideable.
We are trying ta extricate ourselves -from a
difficulty, and we are cosifronted with the
prolhlem af txying ta deal with the soldiers
before they leave the land.
As I explained last night, the Saldier Settlement Board cannot reduce the amount which
a settler owes ta the Board; but when the
Board has iu effect forced him off the land by
demandiug sa much that he caunot remain,
then it is in a position ta sell the land ta the
incoming settler at a price which it thinks is
about right, or for as much as a man will pay
u'pon the advice of his frieuds.
Speed is ai importance in this whole question. If I remexuber the phrase correctly,
"Bis dat qui cito dat,"ý-ii you give quickly
you give twice. If you delay the benefits
you hope ta confer they will be lest. For
that reason I am dlspased ta feel that any

by a large number ai people, and would
1401&.--%

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It occurs ta me
that we cannat say definitely that it would
bie preferable ta have three arbitral courts
in each province. Prince Edward Island, for
instance, would perhaps need but one; Nova
Scotia might need oue or twa; New Brunswick one or two; Quebec and Ontario, perhaps four each. Wheu we are considering the
expense we muet not overlook the fact that
it is the expense of trying each case. You
might have one committee or arbitral court
that would try say fifty cases, and it 'might
cost as much as two arbitral courts trying
twenty-five cases each. If we .think over this
question until Monday, perhaps we wiil se
saine way of reducing the number of arbitral
courts per province. There are represeutatives in the Senate from ail the praviÏnoes,

should proceed along the lines laid dowu ln
the Bill.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: May I ask if we
have on record a statement of the number of
applications that may came fromn each
province?
Hou. Mr. DANDURAND: No. We have
a total af 11,000 cases. I suppose we could
get frein the Board the number af cases per
Province.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: If we had that information it would be comparatively easy ta
determine the number of tribunals required
ta hear the cases iu each Province.
Hou. Mr. BEIQUE: It would be useful
also ta have the information as f ar as passible by districts.
Cou1d inHan Mr. MACDONELL:

of the evidence in each case.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: The Exehequer Court
Judge knows as a rule how long it takes him
to assess the value of five or tan or fifty
acres of land taken for railway purposes or
for public works. He couid give pretty good
advice bow f0 manage the committees. It
wouid heip us if we knew definiteiy on Monday eveninýg that the Judge of the County
Court or District Court who wouid act on
the commiftee would simply be paid bis
out-of-pocket expenses-and it could ba insarted in the Bill-and that the member of
the Soidier Settiement Board on the committee-I presume that ha is a man on a
saiary-was f0 be on thc sama footing as
the Judge. That would maka the statament

even though we decide to put the matter in

Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Why not leave if entiraly tn a Judge witbout the others?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: That is another alternative; or you could leava it f0 the County
Court Judga to make an assessment and pass
it on f0 the Exehequar Court Judge, who
woul check if over.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
In connection with the proceadings on the
Bill in the other flouse, does my honourable
friend know whefber or not Judge Audatf e
of the Exebequer Court, for instance, was
ever taken into consultation as f0 the carrying out of sucb an operafion as this? I
shouid think such a conference would be
very instructive, and thaf bis advice wouid
be very valuabie.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: May I ask if the
Government will also consider the question
of fhe right f0 appeal.
Hon. Mr. CAiLDER: Jusf one further
question. The Posfmaster General referred
fo the fact that a Civil Sarvant-that is, a
member of the Soldier Settiement Boardwould be one of the arbifrators. That is
scarceiy the way that I understand the Bill.
If says the Arbitral Court shahl consist of
a Judge and a representative of the Soldier
Settiement Board. Now, if there were fwenty
court.s operating in the Province of Saskatchewan, the Soidier Sattiemen-t Board would
neyer appoint twenty of their officiais as

many f0 acf as arbifrators. I presumne the
Bill neyer confemplated thaf the arbitrator
should be one of t.he officiais of the Board.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Not one of the
permanent officiais.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: It must be someone
appoinfed f0 represent the Board, and he
would draw bis per diam. and aliowances.
Hon. Mr. CA$G.RÀIN: Every man bas
a right f0 appoint lis own representafive, so
thara would be just as many Boards as -there
would be cases.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: If the soldiers would
agrea, I fbink if would be very much better
that their organizat.ions sbou.d select tbe
men f0 acf as arbifrators for fhem, instead
of baving an arbitrator for every soldier who
makes an application. Those men would
bacome expert and would expedite the work,
wbereas if fbere is a new arbitrator for every
soidier who pufs in an application if will be
a terrible job.
Tbe motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand was
agreed f0, and progress was reporfed.
OLD AGE PENSIONS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDIJRAND moved tha second
reading of Bill 21, an Acf respecting Old Age
Pensions.
Hie said: Honourable gentlemen, this Bill
aims af providing old age pensions for people

wbo have reached tbe age of seventy.

If is

hitherto been made te lagishaf e in tbis maffer,

There are two main classes of persons who

ara in need of such assistance. The largar
ciass comprises those who are dependent upon
relatives, friends or strangers wben fhey bave
hecerne enfeebled and are incapable of earning their ewn living. Sucb people-and we
bave tbern ail about us. througbeut the country-consfantly feel that as dependents fbey

but represcnting a considerable number, is
composed of thosa who bave made an effort f0

In f act, some of the
Eastern Provinces have lost considerable numbers of their younger generation te the new

to see how this sceme applied to ail the
provinces woul'd work, and what it would
entail as a matter of financial responsibility.
Hon. Mr. 'MeMEANS: I would like to
say that if the present policy of the Government continues, there will Dlot be any but oid
men in Canada, as the young ones are going.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend is drawing me far from the present
Bill; but I may tell himn that if he looks
at the mevement of trade, especially nur export tradte, during the past menth, he will
see that the population must surely have been
on the increase, or elsc oiir men have been
working day and night, because the immense
jump in our exports shows that there is in
Canada a vast working population producing
materials.
,Hon. Mr. GORDON: The honourable gentleman is thinking about the outgoing docr

Hon. Mr. DA'NDURAND: We are both
thinking of the outgoing door, but my friend
thinks the people are geing out. Hie is making

Hon. Mr. M-cMEANS: They have ail gene

Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND: My honourable

it has most abundantly at hand, and if ho

that are situated as we are, and dcveloped

find the same conditions prevailing there.
,Hon. Mr. GORDON: Yes, but be wants

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Welýl, we are
doing it large-ly, ewing te the good policy
that has been cstablishcd in this country for
the last few years.
New, soe
may ask wfhy we are asking
the provinces te, join in this work. 1 believe
that a large pension scheme te cover this
whole country could ho administered fromn
Ottawa, only with very great difficulty, and
at a cost which could net be borne. The
provinces have machinery at hand,' and a
personnel which covers their various departments, and they ean administer such a new
institution
and
distribute
the pensions
throughout their respective territories at onetenth of the cost it would be te the Dominion.
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

The draft Bill providing for old age pensiens provides for a maximum pension of
$240 a year, reducible by the ameunt by
which the earniags of the annsuitant exceed
$125 a year, te every person aged seventy
years or over, resident, and having resided
for at least five yoars in a province which
adopts the seheine, and having resided in
Canada for at least twenty yoars. The total
annual cost te the Dominion will be half the
total ameunt ýpaid eut as pensions, the other
ha-If being borne by the provinces which
ad'opt the scheme.
It will therefore be seen that the cost te, the
Dominion will depend upen
(a) the numbor of persons aged 70 and
over;
(b) the numiier of these persons who have
resided in Canada for at least twenty years
and in a province adepting the scheme for
at loast five, years;
(c) the prosent inconie of those persons;
(d) the number of provinces which adopt
the scheme.
As te (a), the number of persens 70 years
of age and over in Canada, according te the
census of 1921, given on page 66 of the report
of the special committee of 192, was 247,103.
As te (b), it is believed that *there is ne
reliable information. It might bo safe te
assume that the number immigrating te Canada within the last twenty years aged 50 or
over at the time of entry would net be very
large, and might be nýeglected, the total population new agcd 70 or ever bcing regarded as
having been rosident in Canada for at least
tweoty years. As te the length ef residence in
any particular province, there is ne information.
Hon. 'Mr. ROBER'ISON:
Might I interrupt my ho-nourable friend te ask if the
Government have infoTrmatien as te the proportion of the 200.000 odd people who are past
the age of 70 and are in straiten 'ed circumstances, and would necessarily seek relief unider
this Bill?
Hon. Mr. DA NDURAND:
No, I do flot
think that information is available.
As te (c), the present means of the population aged 70 and upwards, there, is no information as te, Canada.
The special cernmittee adopted for the purpese of thoir estimate the proportion of the total aged population eligible for pension in Australia according te 1921 figures. These shýowed that appreximately 40 per cent of the population 70
years of age and ever qualified for pension.
On this basis the number qualifying in Canada would be 40 per cent of 247,103, or 98,841.

JUNE 2, 1926
As to the proportion of this number which
would rank for full and partial pensions, respectively, there is no information, but in view
of the fact that in most pension countries
practically ail pensions are -for the maximum
amounts it would be saf e to assume that the
samne condition will apply here.
The Bureau of Statisties has in proces of
compilation information as to the yearly wage
earned by workmen in Canada in age groupa,
but it does flot deal with income other than
wa.ges. This information when compiled, may
be of some assistance in estimating. the probable reduction in pensions due to, present income, but the information is not available
at this date.
As to (dl), there is no information.
In view of the absence of authentic information I do not believe that any better estimate can be made than that made by the
This was as
special committee ini 1M2.
follows:
Total population aged 70 and

40 per cent.. .... ....
Total annual pension at $240
23,721,840
.. ...
....

Dominion's share annually.. . 11,860,92
This makes no provision for the natural increase in the old age population frýom year to
year. On the other band it assumnes that al
provinces are going to adopt the scheme.
As to the approximate effect of one or more
provinces fâiling to adopt the scheme, this can
be estimated by observing the percentage
which, the population over 70 in each province bears to the total populetion over 70. This
is shown by the ýfollowing table, compiled from
the Bulletin of the Bureau of Statisties on age
distribution by provinces, as shown by the
sO
Sixth Census of Canada, 1921.

135

From the foregoing it will be seen that if,
for instance, the Province of Nova Scotia
failed to adopt the seheme the cost above estimated would be reduced Iby exactly 10 per cWnt

to $10,674,M2.

If British Columbia alone

adopted the scheme, the cost would be 3.9 per
cent of the above estiinate, or U462,575.
Those are the main figures whidh 1 have
in my possession concerning this Bill. I do
flot know that 1 can add very much more nt
this stage. Mfter tihe Bill gets its second reading and we go into Committee, it will be in
order to examine the whole machinery which
is to be found in the Bill for its operation.
The main idea is contained in clause 3, wbich
reads as follows:
The Governior in Councti snay make an agreement
with the Lieutenant-Governor ini Counicil of any privince for the payaient to such province quarterly of an
amount equal to one-hsalf of thie net mme paid out
during the preceding quarter by snch province for pensions pursuant to a provincial statute authorizing and
providing for the payment of such pensions to the
persons and under the condiitions apecified in tihis Act
and the regulations mnade thereunder.

The agreement can be denounced or ended
by a province that has signed it; but the
Federal authority, whîch has bound itself to
subscribe haif of the amount paid by the
province under the agreement, will need to
give 10 years' notice to the province before
putting an end to the agreement, for the
ohvious reason that the province, having madle
obligations, must carry them out.
Clause 5 reads:
Before any agreaement made pursuant te tAxis Act
cornes into eperation the Governor ini Council shall
aipprove thse achrne for the administration of pensions
propcsed te be adopted by the -province, anmd Do
change- in such -scerne shall be mnade 'by the provine
without the consent of the Governor in Couricil.

Naturaily no province can be coerced under
this Act: each must come voluntarily under
it.
The question 'bas been asked why this
o
o
~~~seheme is emibodîed in an Act before being

submitted to the various provinces. The
reason given is that it would be difficult, if

of it, which would then be discussed at the
next Session of this Parliarnent. Personally I
arn rather favourable to the idea of crystallizing into an Act the offer of the Dominion of
Canada, because the provinces will thus know
what the Dominion is ready to do, what it is
offering, to what it bas bound itseIf by -its
offer-which wiIl not be simply a tentative
offer, but a reality. The provinces will have
to examine rninutely into the scheme and
decide, either individually or collectively, to
corne undeT it.
There is no question that 'to-day's provisions
for the care of men of 70 who are in need
are inadequate. 1 have had occasion to state,
and 1 desire to repeat, that rnost of the
present systems are imperfect; that none cover
ail the cases of need that exist; and t-hat I
believe there is enough spirit of solidarity in
the population of Canada to decide to do the
fair thing by the men wbo have oarried rnost
of the heavy Joad and done the bard and
heavy work which helps to make thîs nation.
They are the men who have worked througlb
storrn and rami; tbey bave been without the
advantage of higher education; and we owe
thoma a large measure of sympatby.
This Bill represents a humanitarian movement which is sweeping over the various
counitries of the world, and I arn sure that
the people of Canada are disposed not to
lag behind, but rather to rnarch in the forefront of progressive development. I believe
this measure is only a beginning.
It bas been said that the arnount of $240
a year, or $20 a month, is very srnall. Everybody xviII realize that, but we must enter upon
tbis new field with some degree of prudence.
Only tbose can benefit under this Bill who
are not earning, or are not in possession of
$W6 a year, wbicb represents a dollar a day.
It is not a large sum, but I think it will
be welcomed by the people at large.
We must not forget tbat tbis wurk is now
beinii done in sorte forrn or~ other: the Ioad
is being carried to a certain degree by institutions, municipalities, and provinces.
We
know of men ail around us wbo have been
prevented frorn establishing bornes because
of having had to provide for sorne mernbers
of tbeir farnilies. There is not a citizen of

Canada who does not know, and see under
bhis own eyes, people who are in want yet are
being insufficiently provided for. Tbe duty of
the community is obvious, and I think it is
time that we systernatized tbis problem of
the care to be given to our old people who
at the age of 70 are in need.

LINE BILiLS

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen,
before the Orders of the Day are called, there
is a matter which I wish to caîl to the attention of the Senate. It arises out of a report
that was submitted to the House by the
Leader of the Government a week or ten
days ago. This Teport is made uxtder a requirement of the Acts incorporating a number
of branch lines of the Canadian National
system, that a return of the expenditure
shaîl each year be made to Parliament.
This is a very we il prepared report, but it
is a very difficult one either to print or copy,
and there are one or two things in it that I
think should be placed on record, and made
known to the coun try hefore it is pigeonholed. Honourable gentlemen will remember
that in 1923 a Bill to incorporate a large
number of branch uines, which were set out
in the schedule to the Bill, was thrown, out
by this House. In 1924 a large number of
Bills for the construction of these branch
lines were brought in separately. A number
of these Bills, on which according to the
Estimates there yould have been a total
expenditure of 312,249,000 were thrown out.
I will give the reporter a statement of these
to show what happened at that timne and
in the following year, and showing a total
saving to the country through the nonconstruction of these railways of $11,634,000:

During the Session of 1925 Bills for tAie construction
oi the Bengough Line and The Turtleford Line were
again introdxced and e provision was contained in es.ch
of the Bils that part of the eost oi construction wae
to be provided i rom certain trust funds to the credit
of thie Provice ai Saskatchewan.
In the case of Bengough Lino, the Bül oi 1925 reduced thie ml2eage fronii 115 miles to 27 miles and the
cost fran' $3,706,000 to $945,000, and, of the $945,000,
$400,000 ie provided irom thie Trusts funds. Instead oi
the Nebie>bal Railways providing 33,706,000, a aliod
f or undethe Bill oi 1924, the railway, under the 1925
B'U, provides 3545,000, a reduction of $3,161,000.
In the case of Turtieford LUne, the Bill oi 1925 provided for construction of 67 miles at a cost oi $1,87,1,
000, as ffa nst 102 miles in the 1924 Bill et a cost of
$2'313,000. To construct lthe 67 miles called for under

National Railways was reduced by 81>243,000.
The act'on of the Senate in thiis moatter af brasich
lines construction resuited in a saving ai 111,634,000.

0f the Bills that did pass this House there
are two which we amended, requiring the
Canadian National Railway and the Canadian Pacific Railway tu get together to see if
they could not by means of a joint arrangement save soine money to the country-I refer
to the Kingsclear and Vancehoro line, the
estirnated cost of which was $2,123,000, and
the Kamploops-Kelowna branch on which it
is estimated by Governme'nt officers that there
bas been a saving to Canada, through the
arrangement entered into, of $100,000 a year,
which capitalized at five per cent would
amount to $2,000,000. This statement also

Annual saving, 8100,000.

From this it wilI be seen that through the
interference or the assistance of tte Senate,
whjchever vou choose to cal] if, there has
been a saving of 815,000.000 or 816,000,000.
I arn anxious that this information should
go upon the records of this House, because it
shows a saving that has been effected. without
any in.iury to the public service. In the last
two cases, as a, matter of fact, the service is
better than if would have been if the roads
had been built independently.

Bon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But we gave
instructions to the presidents of those two
railways f0 conte t ogether and try to harmionize their interests in such -a way as f0 avoid
the building of that uine which the Canadian
National wanted f0 rua through a valley and
link with the Canadian Pacifie. I was not
aware of what had taken place, but I amn glad
to find that the action of the Senate 'had the
good effeet of bringing those two railways
together.
As to the Kin'gsclear and Vanceboro Bili
there again we had considerable difficulty in
coming f0 a conclusion, but the Senate dis]
'suggest that the fwo, railways shourd corne

PASSAMAQUODDY BAY ELECTRIC
DE'VELOPMENT
SECON-D REA:DING OF DEXTER P'. COOPER
COMPANY INCORPORATION BILL

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON *noved tlie second
reading of Bill 93, An Act to incorporate The
Canadian Dexter P. Cooper Company.
Hon. Mr. MdMEANS:

Explain.

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Tliis Bill incorporates a company to develop power on tlie Passamaquoddy Bay.. IV is an international propositio*n as it involves tlie St. Croix river. It
is a new kind of developmnent. There is now
no electrical development of this nature in any
part of the 'world, but we are fortunate that in
the Bay of Fundy we bave very higli ides, as
well as natural provision for storage of power
on tlie Passarnaquoddy Bay. Mr. Cooper an
engineer who is wel'l knn, particularly in the
United States, lives on Campbello Island, and
for a nuniher o! years while 'le has liad bis
borne tbere, lias made a study of this question
He
of developnient power fromn the tides.
lins gone into it very carefully, and finally bas
been advised to incorporate a company.
Tliere axe reservations in the Bill that
nothing can lie done until t'he Department of
Public Works and the other departaments of
-the Dominion G'overnment iwhich Are interested are consulted. Tlie company cannot
take any steps without the consent of the
Governor in Council, se I tbink every interest lias been well protected.
I would move the second reading of the Bull,
and would suggcst that Ît be referred to thie
appropriate Comniittee.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Has the province to
give permission as well as the Federal authorihies?
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I do not know exact.ly liow the province is interested. I think
Mr. Cooper has been in consultation with the
provincial Government, but I do noV know just
wbat the resuits of thie consultation are. 0f
course, the province o! New Brunswick is in-

139

terested, as well as the state of Maine, and
also the International Waterways Commission,
as well as the Federal Governments of the
United States and Canada, and these have to
be consulted in one way or another.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Hlow xnuch is this projeet suipposed to cost?
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: The proposed coet
of this de'velopment is between $70,000,000 and
$100,000,COO, and the power estimated to be
developed is between 500,000 and, 700,000 horsepower, or about 3,000,000,000 killowatt hours-about the saine amount as is developed at
present in the Canad-ian Niagara. When the
Bill cornes before the Committee Mr. Cooper
will be present and will give aill necessary information of a teclinical nature or otherwise,
as the Cornxnttee may desire..
I thinik this la a scbeine into whîeli we can
afford to loçak very carefully, with a view of
encouraging develop'ment. It is not the only
proposition of this kind that has been talked
of, and thie is nlot the first time that such a
plan has been proposed. IJp near Moncton, at
the rnouth of the Petitcodiac river, we have a
sornewhat simular condition, and a proposition
Engineers cont.here has been discuased.
nected with the Departrnent of Railways and
Canais have gone into the matter, and I
remnember that a lecture was delivered at
Moncton by one of those engineers, showing
the feasibility of euch a seheme in the Petitcodiac river, but on a arnaller scale. So far
as I arn ajware, however, no persn bas put
money into such a proposition yet in that
particular district.
The question of marketing this power is a
large one, but Mr. Cooper seorns to be sure
that not onlv is it practicable that the power
can be developed at a reasonable figure, but
that hie can find a mnarket for the greater
proportion of the power, wbich can be sold
on very reasonable terrns. He seems to be
confident, also, that lie can find the capital
to go aliead with this construction. According to the statement hie lias made it will
require 5.000 men four years to construct the
works, and it wMl not only involve the deve:lopment of power, but its transmission as
far as Boston.
I may add that the state of Maine views
this project witli very considerable satisfaction,
hecause it liad a special Act providing that
no power could be exported from tliat tate.
Before Mr. Cooper could proceed lie liad to
apply to the Iegislature of Maine for permission to export power. It was not given without a plehiscite. Last year a plebiscite was
taken in the state, and tlie vote was over-

140

SENATE

whelmiýngly in favour of Mr. Cooper's scbeme
and in favour of granting-for the first time,
1 think, in the history of the state-permission
to expert power if Mr. Cooper goes ahead with
this development.
Hun. Mr. CASGRAIN: Honourab]e gentlemen, tbis is a very interesting matter, and I
arn surprised that honourable members did
nlot know of it, because the plans of that
seheme have appeared in the newspapers. I
think I saw them very fully explained in the
Montreal Star.
Passamaquoddy is a very large bay, and in
it there are islands, betwecn wbich there are
barrages erected. I suppose we shahl hear the
details of the seheme when this matter goes
te Committee, presurnably the Committea on
Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours. The details
will be most interesting. It appears that they
ivili have power conti.nuously for the 24 hours
-perhaps not as miich at one «time as at
another, but continuous power. The water
wvill be coming in on one side-say, the
northern end of the bay-and going out, say,
on the south side. That is what I gathered
from the description I saw in the paper.
The idea of harnessing the tiýdes has been
rather widespread. There is talk of a similar
large development on the Severn river in
Englanýd. But nobody has carried the idea
through yet. It may be practicable, however.
This is a particularly favourable spot, on
account of the very great difference of level
that exists in tbc Bay of Fundy. I arn toMd
that the tide rises ncarly sixty feet.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: How much?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Nearly sixty feet.

Hou. Mi. DANIEL: We have heard of it
for a great niany years. Why is it necessary
to rush it through?

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Not down there.
Hon. Mr. CASCRAIN: Not down there?
Because it is ton near the ocean. I suppose.
But at Joggins, where the Joggins Mines are
located, it goes to very nearly sixty feet. and
that is not very far frorn there.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: That is away up at
the head of the bay.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Anyway, with al
this watcr rushing up the bay twice a day
and comning down again. there is certainly
an immense amiount of power stored.
This is one of the miost interesting things
that have corne before Ibis Hoiîse for a long
tirne. and I would certainlv like to sec the
Bill.go t0 the Comrnittec on Railways, Telegraphis and Harbours, and, if necessary, the
rides. suspended, in order that it may be sent
to the other House as soon as possible, so
that, the Bill may nt fali by the way Ibis
ycar thoîgh. wc are neparing the end of the
Session.

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON:
Honourable gentlemen, I have no objection 10 the Bill going
to the Cornmittee on Railways, Telegraphs
and Harbours, but I thought that was not
the proper Com.mittee te which, to refer a
Bill of this nature, whicb does not deal with
raîlways or telegraphe.

Hon.

Mr. ROBINSON.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It will flot necd to
be rushed. I arn informed that it bas passed
the House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: However, I think the
mfatter is an extremely important one, and it
bas 10 do with international relations as well
as other things. I have no objection to the
second reading, but the Bill will have to be
examined very closely in détail in the Coinmittee. I presoîne the intention is to send it
to the Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours.
Hon. Mi. ROBINSON:
Honourable gentlemen, I do not know what the will of the
Senate is, but I would suggest that this Bill
be referred to the Comamittee on Miscellaneous Private Bills. It is not really a railway Bill.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It is a Bill that
ought to be deait with by the Committee on
Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours.
Tlîe motion was agreeýd to, and the Bill was
read the second lime.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON moved that the Bill
ho referred to the Standing fCommittee on
Miscellaneous Private Bis.
Hon. Mr. DANIL:
and Haibours.

Hon. Mr. DAaNDURAND: The honourable
gentleman who has charge of the Bill cao
explain to the Senate why he suggests the
Private Buis C'ommittee.

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: It relates 10 a barbour. It bas very much indeed 10 do with the
harbour.
This is absolutely a harbour arrangement.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Certainly.

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON:
I have no objection, on'îy I thought it was flot the proper
Committce, as Ibis bas nothing to do witb
the harbour.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: 0f course, it bas to do
with the hairbour.
The motion was agreed te, and the Bill
wvas referred bo the Standing Committce on

Hon. Mr. McMIEANS: Wili tihe honourable

Hon. Mr. H.AYDON: Honourable gentlemen, this is a Bi respecting certain .patents
of James MoCutcheon Coleman, who is a
resident of the city of Montreal and has a
series of patents, which are set out as Patent
No. 148735, granited on the 17th of June, 1913,
for car construction; another one, granted
on the same date, for flexible lockj oints for
car bodies and trucks; and a!nother one,
granted on the 29th of April, 1913, for car
construction. These patents were, aocording
to the usual patent practice, granted for a
term of six years. He failed to, pay his
renewal fees, and ihrough the misadIvice, of
his sdicitors and, through his own ill-health
the time given under the statute for the payment of these fees was allowed to laps. The
result of the non-payment was that the if e
of the patents expired. He now asks in this
Bill that tAxey ha reinstated.,
What kind of
Hlon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
patents are they? Wlhat does he do?
Hon. Mr. HAYDON: They are patets,
some of them, for flexible lockjoints for car
bodies antd trucks. I do not lcnow the particular kind of device; 'but I do know that
in the course of my own practice as a solicitor here for twenty or twenty-five years,
applications of this kind have been coming
before Parliamentary Committees almost every
yesr. I trust that the explanation will be
accepted by the House and that the Bill will
be referred to the proper Committee.
The motion was agreed to, and, the Bill
was read the second time and referred to
thbe Standing Cornmittee on Miscel-laneous

Hoa. -Mr. HAYDON: Honourable gentlemen, in respect to the same Bill I move:
That Rules 24A and 119 be auspended i en far as

patents of Jaume MeCutcheon Coleman.

The ides is that posting may be excused,
in order that the Bill may proceed without

The motion was agreed to.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the third
reading of Bill H5, an Act to incorporate
The Detroit aind Windsor Subway Company.

142

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Before the Bill is
read the third time, I beg to move the amendment that stands in my ýname, and which is
as fo1.lowvs:
That the followiig be added at the end of section 7:
(5) The comipany shail flot commence its operatinns
or incur any liablxity before a sum of nt Ieast 350,000
has been paid ioto lys treasury, and which soin shall
ot 'be withdrawn, except for the purposes of the undertaking cf the company, or upon its dissolufiioýn.

This Bill provides for the construction of
a tunnel which, aocording to the engineer
who appeared before the ýCommittee, is to
cost some $12,000,000. The capital is to ha
divided into no-par-value shares, which may
be allotted as -decided by the Board. This
opens the door to the contpany commencing
operations and incurring liabilities when there
is nothing to meet them. In -legislation of
this kind it is usual to guard against that by
providing for a reasonwble amount of money
being put into the cornpany hefore any liabilities are incurred. Before any raiIway company can commence operations ton per cent
of the authorized capita must be subscribed.
Hon. Mr. REID: Would it not he well
to have a clause in the Bill stating that the
work must be, commenced and completed
within a certain time?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Clause 21 makes provision for the commencement and completion
of the work.
Hon. Mr. POPE: I would like to ask the
Leader of the Governinant if we did not have
an application before us a year or two ago
for the same undertaking?
Hon. Mr. S.llARIPE: Last year.
Hon. Mr. POPE: I object to the third
reading of the Bill until wa know whether
or flot there are charters already existing. My
information is that there are-it may not be
correct-and in that avent I object to the
third reading.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSO'N: I think the honourable gentleman is misinformed if he is of
the opinion that there is an existing charter
for the construction of a tunnel. There was
an application made at the last Session of
Parliament, but the charter was not approved.
When the application was renewed this year,
as 1 understand it, steps were ta.ken to a.scartain whether the interests that opposed it last
year were still opposed to it, and the information submitted to the Railway C'ominittea
indicated that the parties who objected ta the
granting of the charter last year have this
year withdrawn their objection and have, by
way of resolution, endorsed the application.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

Hon. Mr. POPE: With that explanation I
am satisfied.
The motion was agraed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, as amended, and passed.
SOLDIER SETTLEMENT BRLL
FURTHER

CONSIDERED IN COMMITTFE

The Senate again went into Committee on
Bill 17, an Act to amend the Soldier Settlement Act, 1919.-Hon. Mr. Dandurand.
Hon. Mr. Robinson in the Chair.
On ýparagraph (e)-District Arbitration Commîttees:
,Hon. Mr. DANDUIRAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, whan we adjournad the study of
this Bill we were dealing with this paragraph
(e), which aims ta create District Arbitration
Committees for the arbitration of dlaimns which
miay be made for the revaluation of lands
purchased fromn the Soldier Settiement Board
by the soldiers. We adjourned it with the
idea that sorna. less cumbersome proposai
might be suggested ta the Senate. It was
represented that there would 'ha hundreds of
thesa Arbitration Committees appointad
throughout the country, and in view of the
fairly general representation from. memibers of
this ýChamnber that the machinery should ha
simplified I agreed to adjourn the further
consideration of the Bill. I would now ask
if any member bas thought of a more simple
system than the one proposed in the Bill.
Hon. Mr. GLLIiS: Did the honoura)ble
gentleman give any consideration ta the proprosal I made the other night in the matter
of interest? I think that would giva the
solution-to make an adjustment of the interest on the advances mada for land and
equîpment. 1 understand the soldiars are
now paying 5 per cent, and when thair accounts are in arrear they are charged 7 par
cent. I think the original loans advanced ta
settlers would run from $4,000 ta $7,000. With
the payments spread over 25 years the interast
amounts to more than the original principal
or loan granted for land and equipment.
As I said the other night, thara bas been
a considerabla agitation among the soldier
settlers for an adjustmant of the interest
charged from. the very beginning. If this
could be arranged it would not involve any
expenditure for raadjustment such as is outlined in this Bill, and I helieve by redueing
the interest the Governuxent could suceed in
satisfying the settlers much more easily
than under the proposed plan of revaluation.
I think the Government should take that
suggestion into consideration. Thrre is a
ganeral desire among the settiers that some-

JUNE 7, 1926
thing of that nature should be 'brought about,
and I arn satisfied it wouid be better for both
the Government and the soldier settiers. I
trust that the honourable leader of the Government will give the matter some consideratien.
1Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Does the honourable gentleman suggest that a certain
amount of interest be deducted. from aIl the
loans?
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: 0f course, each case
must stand on its own merits; but what I
suggest is that instead of charging 5 per cent
the rate should be reduced to 2j per cent.
Haîf a loaf is better than no bread. 1 would
like to sec ail the interest wiped out, so thât
the only charge would be the amount of the
principal advanced for land and.-equipment.
That plan would probably not involve any
more expense to the country than the
machinery that is provided in this Bill, together with the reductions that will be made
in the cases that are adjusted.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: At one time to-day I
thought that the suggestion made by the
honourable gentleman who has just spoken
might perhaps solve the difficulty, or might
be suggestive of something else that would
settie it. I thought that perhaps the simplest
solution of the whole matter would be to
pass a short Act making a reduction of 25
per cent ail aiong the line to those men who
had fallen down, but who wished to go on,
and a refund of 25 per cent, of course, to
those who had made -good. But I have been
disabused of that notion. 1 had some conversation with one of the officials, and 1 sec
now that we will not understand this Bill
completely unless we get it into Committee
with one or more of the officers of the Soldier
Settlement Board before us. I do not know
that I understand the Bill yet, though I
know more about it than I did.
We cannot treat thèse soldier settlers as a
class. I had thought we could get clear of
the enormous cost we are liable to incur in
rnaking these individual valuations in the
way suggested, for we must consider that we
may have as many as 11,000 applicants, and
11,000 Boards-because every applicant might
have lus own arbitrator-and I do net know
where we would land.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The henourable
gentleman speaks of 25 per cent. Does he
mean 25 per cent of the original price?
Hon, W. B. ROSS: Yes; you make a bargain for 34,000, and we will cut. you down
to $3,000 ail along the line. I thought of

14a

that plan, but I arn now satisfied that the
problem will have to be solved in a different
way, because some settlers got good lands
and some got bad lands. Then there are
other complications, because some men have
been dcaling with the lands, making leases or
givîng mining rights, or oul rights, and that
sort of thing. I think the best thing to do is
to send the Bill to a Commîttee, and bring
hefore us the -men who know about this
question and can tell us just exactly what
are the facts up to date.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: We are in Coininittee now.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Yes, *but I suggest
getting the Bull to another Committee where
we can call witnesses.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I do not sec
any provision in this Bill for any mutual
arrangement between a soldier settier and
the Board, or the Board that would be. The
Bill contemplates an ar'bitration in every
case.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: When the Bill
was introduced, as coming from the Department, there was that provision, but it was
struck out i the other chamiber.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Does my honourable friend not think that that is implied?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: 1 do not think
there is any provision for giving legal effect
to an agreement. The Bill proposes to deal
in a generous way with the soldier settiers,
and I think it would be inclined to deal in
a generous way, and that in a large number
of cases there would be no necessity for an
Arbitration Committee at ail. I think we
would be encounterîng a litge expense under
the proposed plan. and ti.at we would get better satisfaction for the soldiers, and a better
system, by the appointment of a judge. He
stands before them in ail matters between
litigants and the judgment of a single judge
is usually accepted. Therefore we miight consider the appointment of a judge to act as
sole arbitrator.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would the lionourable gentleman suggest that by an Order
in Council a judge in cach province should
be authorized to hear those cases? When the
Bill came before the other Chamber that
question was discussed at Iength, as to the
appointment of one judge, or an arbitral
committee of three memibers.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: This is a very important matter -because of the large amount
involved, and the machinery will be very

SENATE
expensive. I think it is our duty to examine
carefully int
this Bill. There is no idea
of obstructing the Bill but we should pass if
only with the proper knowledge of its details.
I think the suggestion made by the honourable leader on the other side (Hon. W. B.
Ross) should commend itself to this honourable House. It might be referred to a Commit tee where we could hear the representatives
of the Board, and have proper information
on which to form a sound opinion.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I tbjnk there is
provision in the Judges Act to prevent .iudges
froni a.cting in arbitration proceedings. I do
not know whether that applies to the county
court judges, but it does to the superior court
iudges. I doubt whether it would be wise to
have judges on these Boards. The judge bas
te0 bc paid for bis work, and he wuuld bave
to be taken away from his other duties, wbich
occupy a great deal of bis time. If the Bill
is referred to a Committee we shall bave more
information.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUJGHBY:
I tbink the
ju.gc, under our Act, would on]y get bis
moving expenses.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes. I do not
think the judges are prohibite'd from sitting,
but my impression is that they are prohibited
from reýceiving fees.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Yes, but if we passed
a Bill requiring a judge to do this work it
would override the old Act. I intended to
move. at some stage in this matter, that an
Exehequer Court judge or the Exchequer
Court should be the arbitrator.
1 would move now that the Committee rise
and report progress. and then I can move
that the Bill ba referred to the Banking and
Commerce Committee, which I tbink is the
must suitable to deal'with this matter.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have no objection to referring this Bill 10 any Special Committce, or one of our Standing Committees,
and I agree to the proposition; but I draw the
attention of the Senate to the very great difficulty of making a sfraightline cut eifher in
interest or in capital. I would remind the
Senate that the other day I stated that a
questionnaire had been sent to the soutbern
section of Alberta in order to learn the situation of each purchaser or borrower, and 40
par cent of thamn answered that tbey were
satisfied with their purchases. A large number are not only satisfied, but bave made
cnough money to pay their interest on the
capital, and some of them owe notbing.
Wa must not forget that the idea of tbis
Bill is t0 try 10 retain on the land 11,000
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE.

soldiers who are now there. Ail of these
11.000 do not intcnd to leave, but if 50 per
cent are becoming more and more discouraged,
and it is seen by an examination of their
accounts that they been unable to maintain
their payments either of capital or of interest,
and they dlaim a reduction because, in their
opinion, tbey paid too large a suma for tbe
land, then those cases, and only those cases,
should be examinad into.
I think that wa threshed out fairly well tbe
general principles of the Bill, and we balked
at the costly machinery provided in the Bill,
and the appointment of a number of Arbitratien Committees. Now wa may review the
wvhole situation in a Committee, with representatives present from the Department and
the Soldier Settiement Board; but I still
insist that honourable members of the Senate
should bxy to devise a more simple sebeme
than the one whidh tbey behieve to be ton
costly and too difficuit of application. Perbaps
an Arbitration Committae or an arbitral court
for a province-or two sncb Committees according f0 tbe importance of the provincewould be satisfactory. I would suggest, tben,
if it is somewhat inýdifferent, that we aocept
the idea as it cornes fromn the Commons regarding the formation of that Cornmittee.
Most of tbose interestad ini thîs Bill- and
they were numarous-came to tbe conclusion
that there would be greater satisfaction with
the soldiers if a small Committee of tbree
wera to examine mbt the cases. If on tbe other
hand tha Senate favours the appointment of
one judge, or a judicial tribunal of two or
three judges, it will be for the Sonate to take
action accordingly.
1 move that the Committee risc, report
progress and ask leave to sit again.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Just a moment.
Probably the bonourable leader could give us
information on this point, witb respect to
tbe judges. A great deal bas been said about
judges beiug unable to receive pay. Is there
any machinery by which you can force a judge
to act on an arbitration if be is not to ho paid
for doing so? Is thera any .iudge in the country
wvbo would take an appointment if ha were
preventod from receiving pay for it? Suppose
the judge says, "No, I do not want a job of
that kind." I think the probability is tbat
that is what be will say. Whore are you going
f0 gef the judge if you do not pay bim? You
cannot compel him to act. There is notbing
in the Bill which says that the judge must
acf. Is ha going to put in a mo>ntýh or so on
this work, te the nagloct of bis otiber duties,
if ho cannot receive any consideration for if?

JUNE 7, 1926
Hon. Mr. DANDUiRAND: 1 do flot see

expenses are paid I do flot know what

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 0f course, if

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I thought it was the
province that directed the work of the judge.
I thought that ahl we did here was to appoint

was the auth ority that stated what he should
do. I do flot know; I arn not a lawyer; but
I have had' that idea.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is so.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: 1 asked the question mereiy in order that when the Comnmittee met the honouraibie gentleman would
be able to give themn that information.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We are sending this Bill to the Committee on Banking
and 'Commerce. I shahl look into the question.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: I think perhaps the
Banking and Commerce 'Committee is not
the proper one to deal witb it. I have just
been looking at the namnes of the members.
There are some honourable Senators returned
soldiers and others, who are not members
of that Committee, and who ought to he
en any Committee dealing witb this Bill.
I think this BiH- will require a speciaI Comnmîttee. If the honourable gentleman wi1l let
the matter stand until to-morrow, I will submit to him a list, arid a speciai Committee
can then ha appointed.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I thought it was suggestecl the other day that we shou'id have
figures as to the number of cases in each
province.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAN'D: Not the number of cases. We do not know what cases
W arise.
'I
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The possible applications.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: W~e can know
ouly the number of persons holding land,'
and can divide the 11,000 possible elaimants.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Lt was understood that
we were to be informed of the possible cases
in each province.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That information will be laid before the Committee.

as possible by districts or counties.
Hon. J. D. REID: Honourabie genitlemen,

Committee.
with regard to those persons wbo wilI benefit
fro m the Bill as it now stands, but there are
severai classes who receive no -benefit whatever and who are in my opinion just as muoh
entitled to consideration. In clause 68 as it
now reads there may be a great deal that
would not be fair to some settiers. It refers,
for instance, to a settler "who bas not assigned
his interest in his land." A settler may have
assigned to a son or some other member of
his family who is to carry on the work.
There may be a good many cases of that kind,
and in sucb cases there would be no benefit
whatever from that clause. Then there is
the settler wbo bas paid in full for his farm,
and paid perhaps a great deal more tban it
is now worth. Sucb a settler ought to receive some advantage too. Iii fact, I would
like to see the Bill cover aIl w~ho took part
in tbe war and who settled on the land.
I intended moving, if we had piroceeded
witb tibe Bill this evening:
Th-at thie words "purchesed or" aie added after the
word "has'
in the third line, and that al the
words comnlencing with the word "who" in the forth
line up to and ineluding the word "Board" in the
seventh Une be struck out.

Then the clause would read in this way:
NotwMtstarding anyth-ing in this Act, the Board is
hereiby emnpowered upon the application of a settler
who bas çurchased or agreed to purchase any land
f rom the Board, and where there has been a decrease
or deprec;ation ini the market value of such land not
the restlt of negleet or misnisnagernent on the part
of the settaer, to make provision for re-valuation
of the said land subject to thie following conditions.

The Hon. tbe OHAIRMAN: I would call
the bonourabie gentleman's attention to the
fact that tbat subsection has been stricken out
and a new one siibstituted.
Hon. Mr. RLOBERS0N: Honourabie gentlemen, before the Comamittee rises, and for

settlers have succeeded admirably: they have
their payments up to date, and, I think, have
no complaint. That is probably true in
various districts, but in other districts it is
not true. I well recall being during the past
year on Vancouver iIsland and about sixty
miles north of the town of Nanaimo where
a group of about seventy soldier settlers had
ten-acre plots and were ail supposed to be
raising chickens for sale and to derive enough
income to make their payments and live.
Any honourable member of this House visiting that particular locality and seeing some
of the ten-acre plots upon which those settlers
had, with assistance, erected little homes and
put a little stock, such as a cow, a pig or two,
etc., would immediately come to the conclusion that it was utterly impossible for
them to succeed. The soil could scarcely be
called gravel; it was almost too stony for
that. Huge pine trees grew here and there
over this gravelly, rocky soil. There certainly
was plenty of grit there for the chickens to
make shells for their eggs, but there was
nothing else for them, and it was impossible
to raise on some of those lots anything to
feed a chieken at ail. To my mind, a number
of the settlers ought to be taken away from
those plots and placed where they would have
a chance to succeed.

The province entered
into an arrangement with those men, and they
have had some difficulties in regard to it. I
do not think the cases to which the honourable gentleman refers are those of settlers
under the Dominion scheme.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I am inclined to
think that my honourable friend is not referring to the sane locality. Some fifty-five of
these returned soldiers sought a conference
with myself and a gentleman who was with
me, and they urged for a re-valuation of their

was really pitiful to listen to some of the tales
that those boys told us in the little hall in
which we were assembled that night. They
had asked us to come there to meet them and
hear what they had to say. This is the first
opportunity that has presented itself to me to
bring the matter to the attention of the Government.
Hon. Mr. PLANTA: Would the honourable

district?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It was near Cumberland. I forget the name of the village.

Hon. Mr. PLANTA: I am inclined to think
the honourable member for Victoria (Hon.
Mr. Green) is correct.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I do not recall
that that particular question was raised by
them, but I do know that these returned
soldiers did apply for a conference with the
honourable member who sits in the other
House for Burrard and myself, who happened
to be visiting that locality at the time, and
they urged for re-valuation of the land, for
reasons which were obvious. It undoubtedly
is true that here and there throughout the
country soldier settlers placed by the Federal
Government find thernselves in a similar predicament to-day, though probably there is no
fault to be found with the officials in charge.
Therefore ail settlers have not an equal opportunity at the present moment, and it will
be necessary to give more consideration to
sorne cases than to others.
Hon. Mr. PLANTA: I would like to assure
the honourable members of this House that
the description of the land on Vancouver
Island that was given by the honourable
member for Welland (Hon. Mr. Robertson)
does net apply to the whole of Vancouver
Island.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I certainly agree
with moy honourable friend. Vancouver Island

Sir:
The enclosed memoranda caver the three main subjects upon whichi the Dominion Marine Association

Ottaw~a.
While they provide a rather detaLUed outline of the
subjects they deal with, the Association will be happy
to answer any question whieh may arise in your mind
in reading theni.
Canada's Iîsland Marine supports anme 20,000 men,
which on the censlus bitsýs means anme 100,000 Canadians. This is dirsetly. Through the neeasities of
life these 100,000 support many thousando more in
industry and in commerce; while the bonis theiselves,
in building, in equipnient, and in maintenance, are a
further inaterial factor in aur industrial life.
This office will i4ppree:ate your inquiries upon any
phase of the industry and the situations confronting it,
and the Association asks your symnpathitic interest in
end support for the Canadian Mercantile Marine.
Most respectfully yours,
(Signed) Robert Lipsett,
Manager.

I ask is:
How long are these vessels allowsd ta remain in
Cana«dian waters, at one tans, without paying dut'ea?

Hon. Mr. BELAND: Before the honour«ble gentleman proceeds f0 hl.s second
question. may I ask hlm whether the ships
to whlch he hias referred, coming frorn a
f oreign to a Canadian port, are not subjected
to the marine dues which are collected frorn
every foreign slip calling at a Canadian port,
af the rate of two cents per ton for t hree
trips each season?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: That la so: two
cents pur ton; that ja for a trip. Those foreign
ships make only one trip lu the season. They

proceed to the head of the Lakes. They
should be tuýrned around and corne back and
get out again. What 1 arn cornplaining of is
that they do flot get out again: they stay
on the Great Lakes in competition with
Canadian s-hips, and they do flot contribute.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Do they ply
their trade between Canadian and American
ports, or do they simply do a Cana dian coastwise trade?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: They ply t-heir
trade between Canadian and American ports,
and, being f oreign ships, they enjoy certain
privileges which I doubt very rnuch are given
to Canadian slips. So the people of Canada
are actually permitting what no other
civilized nation would permit. There i.s a
duty on .ships, exeept British ships, coming
loto the country; and latelv, I arn told, an
exception has ibeen made by statute-and I
think it is a proper exception-in favour of
such :German q~hips as were taken over by
British owners as reparation. Since those
ships have becorne Britishi-owned, I think it
is right to except thern, although other people
objeet to that exception. 1 think that the
minute they become the actual property of
British owners and are of British register
they should be entitled to corne in free of
duty. But as to German ships that have not
been taken over, or Norwegian ships, or ships
from otiher Scandinav-ian counti-ies, Wihy should
they be allowed to corne loto Canada without
paying anything at ail?
The ex-Minister of Labour is good enougli

anybody quits that ship hie leaves lis wages
behind hlm. I do nlot discuss what hours
they work or how much they get; that is a
different question; but the fact remains that
Canadians are deprived of those wages.
It seerna to me that this Huse, or the
Government, rnight devise some means iby
which these ships, if they do flot pay duty,
would pay at least so much a day for trading
lu ýCanadian waters. Mark you, honourable
gentlemen, the people who own ships in
Canada have to pay taxes. No matter how
much the foreign ship earns, it pays no incorne fax, whereas the Canadian ship must

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: May I ask the honourable gentleman this question-whether the
treatrnent given to vessels of the United
States is flot the same as the treatment
given hy the United States to Canadian vessels plying between Canadian and United
States ports?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I amn very glad
that the honourable member for De Salaherry brought up that question. There is
the sore 'point: the treatment is not the
sarne. The treatrnent we receive from the

anybody to say that the United States has
ever granted us such a privilege. Furthermore, if an Arnerica vesel is forced to get

soon as it returns to the American aide it is
charged flot only duties, and very ihig~h duties,

they are discouraged, and any American ship
that can posssibly limp acros to American
waters will go to. get its repaira done on the
American aide. It is not the same at al
wit h our regulations. I arn very glad the
honourable gentleman brought up that question, because that is the one sore point.

free, 'but after that period you must psy duty
if it remains in the country. Those vessela,
as I have said, manage to rernain the entire
season.
My ihird question is:
Are there any customas regulations permaittiflg these
vessels to carry on business in tbms country without
paying duties7

The f ourtih is:
Do these vessels

embploy

canadian seamnen?

They do not, as 1 said a few moments
ago.
Do these vessels contribute anything
Treasury? if so, how much?

to Canada's

We shall hear the answer to that inquiry
with great interest. Just realize, honourable
gentlemen, what it means to the owners in
this country. Here is a veasel corning frorn,
say, a Germa" port. It entera here and it
enjoys ahl the privileges, and under conditions
that are rnuch more favourable than those
of Canadian vessela. The men are ehl signed
up. There can be no strike on those veasels,
for if the men struck they wouid only lose
their pay. They are paid only if they corne
back. and, as those men have no money, they
have no other way of getting back to their
own country. Even though they may not be
satisfied with the treatment they receive,
they must stay on the ship until it returns to
their home port, andi then they are paid off.
This is a matter with which, 1 behieve, the
labour unions shouid concerfi thernseive8, and
I wouid be with them in that respect.
Are the supplies (ship's stores) for the maintenaefe
of the crew of these vessels dutiable?

These supplies should be dutiable after a
certain tirne. I understand. that a vessel
corning in even tas far as Port Arthur would
need supplies for the return trip and also a
certain quantîty of. supplies in the event of
emergency, but the arnount should be limited
1
and it shouid not be as rnuch es woul d be
required for an entire season's work. There
ahould be some regulation by the Department of Customs as to the length of tirne these
supplies should laat.
My ninth question is:
Is it the intention of the Goverrament to stop thia
discrmninstiofl against our Canadian Mercantile NavigatýOn Cornpan;es psyiPg taxes, licenses, fees, and subject to Canadian reculations; also -paying the higher
wagoe to Canadian labour, using Canadian supplies,
and paydng, moreover, income tax on their profits, il
any?

The tenth is:
1s it the intention to tax these foreign vesseis to put
then on an equal footing with Our own Canadin
bottons?

SENATE

Honourable gentlemen, I hope that this
matter will be taken into serious consideratien by the Government and that the abuse
will he remedied in the near future. It is a
crying abuse. The Marine Association protested against it on the 2lst of May, and, as
far as we know, their protest has been pigeonboled without anything being done. This is
,a grievance whicb, in the interest of ail
Canýadian ewners. should be redressed at the
earliest possible moment. The foreign slips
should be asked te pay. If they do not pay
the regular duty, and if they are needed,
say, on the Lakes, then let thema pay s0 mucli
a day. a rate equivalent to at leýast some part
of the duty that they ought to have paid.
I thank the bonourable members of this
House for their attention.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
May I ask, my
honourable friend one question? I understood
him to say-and I think it is true-that at
certain seasens: of the year the ýexistîng regulatiens are sometimes waived and American
vessels plying between Canadian ports on
coastwise business are given a privilege that
is denied oor American friends during the rest
of tbe year-that tbey are allowed te engage
in coastwise trade without any special permission?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
My honourable
,friend may remember-perhaps bie was a
Minister of the Gevernment at the timethat an Order in Council was p.assed allowing
American vesse's te pliy, say, from Port Arthur
te Port Coîborne. That, in one wvay, was a
very wreng thing te do. because it simpiy
.caused congestion at Port Coîborne and
Canadiao vesseis lest a wbole trip by the
fact that American vessels were standing there
te be unileaded and had thc right of way.
That is ail that we get for it. TIen, I understand, those other foreign vessels would come
under the saine regulations; for, after ail.
American ships are also fereign vessels. But
wîy should vessels net paying duty, having ne
righ1-t te de business without paying, de these
things without regard te Canadian regulatiens? AIl these reg-ulations are very enerous.
and why should they be able te continue tbese
practices te tIc prejudice of tbe Canadians?
Hon. Mr. RE'ID: Honourable gentlemen,
se far as I am concerned. 1 am in sympathy
witî what the boneurable gentleman bas
stated. If it wene possible te bave Canadian
trade, say from the West, carried exclusively
in Canadian vessels. I am sure that is wîat
every honourable gentleman in this Clamber
would wish. TIe bonounable gentleman states
that Norwegian vessels are carrying grain
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

duning tIe whole seasen between Canadian
ports. If se, it mnust be un(ler some law passed
by this Parliament. Under our Customs Act
they would net be allowed te do se. I bave
net that Act in my bands, and have net had
time te look it up; but if those Norwegian
vessels are doing that, I think I cao explain
bow tbey may le doing it. Lt must be
under what is called the Faveured Nation
Treaty with Norway. Great Bnitain makes
a treaty witb Norway, containing a clause
allowing trade between two ports in the samie
country, say by English vessels in Nerway,
and by Nerwegian i essels in England; and
if wve in Canada bave accepted that treaty,
of ceurse these vessels bave a ri.0lt te trade
in Canada.
It is possible that by that
Trcaty, te which Parliainent agreed, we bave
given that permission. If se, tbe only way
te remnove the difficulty would ho te witbdraw our acceptance of that Treaty.
0f course, the honeurable gentleman gees
farther than refen te Norwegian ve.rsels. H1e
speaks cf vessels cf other foreigo nations,
wvhich ef course would inelude the United
States. I am fully in accord witî ail le bas
said in regard te baving grain carried in
Canadian bottcxms; but lie knows that perbaps
the largest portion of our traffle in the West
is carried fromn Port Arthur te Montreal in
Amenican vessels, because they are large
ýesels, with a capacity of 300,000 or 400,000
hushels, that cao carry grain cbeaply te
Buffalo or Per-t Coîberne. Such vessels used
te pass through the We~lland Canal, but cannet de se IIow. An American eompany bam
t-we classes cf sbips-one a Welland Canal
sbip and one of the 30,000 or 400.000 bushel
class. The largen ships go from Buffalo te
Port Arthur, whene tîey take on 300,000 or
400.000 bushels cf grain and returo te Buffale
witb the cargo. Dees thc honeurable gentlemani want te stop tîat?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
stop Î..

No, you

cannet,

Hon. Mr. REID: Then thc Canadian grain
is takzen eut of the ecx ator in Buffalo, put
in another American vessel, and taken te
Montreal. In that way our Canadian traffic
is carrieci entirely frem a Canadian port te
another Canadian port in Aînerican vescls.
Hen. Mr. CASCRAIN:
fectly right.

Yes, that is per-

Hon. Mr. REID: We cannot stop that. On
tIc other Iand, if a Norwegian i essel wants
te operate on the Great Lakes and can operate
at a lower rate. and takes a cargo cf 75,000
bushels te Buffalo, it bas a rigît te carry it
from Port Arthur te Buffalo, er from Buffalo

JIJNE 8, 1926
to Montreal. Or it can do batter than that;
it can arrange with those large vessais to bring
the cargo to Buffalo, and from there it can
take it to Montreal.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAJN: Exactly.
Hon. Mr. REiID: So this difflculty is not s0
easily straightened out as the honourable
gentleman has statad.
Hon. 'Mr. CASGRAIN: But I would like
to ask the honourable gentleman if it is flot
worth trying to remova?
Hon. Mr. REID: Yas; I was just coming
to that. If it is a fact thiat Ndr.wegian vessais
are carrying freight from one Canadian port
to anothar, it is the duty of the Government
to stop that. I neyer heard that that waà
allowed, until the honourwble gentlaman statcd
it. It was not dona whan I had anything to
do with the administration.
Hon. 'Mr. CASGRAIN: It is only three
or four years old,
Hon. Mr. REID: The matter should have
been left as it always ha.s been. Perhaps the
honourabie gentleman who succeeded me
allowed that, but I do not think ha would
have been guilty of it.
Hon . Mr. BUREAU: It was flot done by
the honourable member, nor is it done now.
Hon. Mr. REIýD: The honourable gentleman also rcferred to the privilege granted
to American vassels to carry Cainadian grain
say from Port Arthcur to Midtland and other
Georgian Bay ports. He complains that that
bas been going on for saine time. Perhaps
it may hava bean dona two or threa timas;
but the only time I ever heard of it being
dona was at a time when the elevators at
Port Arthur and Fort Wilýliam ware fillad
up, and could not possibly take any more
grain, and there wera no Canadian vassals
to take it away. The farmars in the West
were urging that their grain shouid ha taken
to the elevators at Port Arthur and Fort
William. The demand thus arose for more
storage, and the only privilege I avar heard
of was that American vefflels, when about to
leava Port Arthur on their last trip of the
season, wara allowed to taka on a load of
Canadian grain. That privilege was granted
solely in ordar to raldeve the congestion in
tie clavators at the head of the lakes, and
it was donc simply to halp the farmers of
the West to gat that much more storage. It
resultad in providing additional storage
capacity of 10,000,000 or 12,000,000 bushals
for the winter.
But I do not beliave this Governmcnt or
any othar aver granted a privilege of that

1

kind except on the occasion I have mentioned, and it was only done because it was
absolutely necessary to assist the farmers to
save their grain froma destruction.
Hon. Mr. CASGR.AIN: May I a«k the
honourable gentleman if hie is aware that at
that samne time there were Canadian bottoms
emkpty?
lon. Mr. REID: I neyer heard at that
or any other time, that there was one Canadi'an vessel wîthout anything in it. It wa.s
only after every Canadian vessel was Ioadad
cno more Canadian tonnage was availand
able, that that privilege was given, and it
was onil' done to relieve the elevators. So
mnany éleva tors have been built in the West
since then that I do not believe even the
privilage of a single trip bas been given for
a number of yaars; and I do not think any
Government would give such a privi:lge uniess the farmars feared t.hat their grain was
going to suifer, a.nd that t'hey could flot get
any furthar storage at Fort William or Port
Arthur.
I am in favour of doing everything possible
to hold our traffic for Canadian bottoms. I
would 'lika to see our Canadian vessels fully
employad, and more than we now have if it
wera possible. If the present practice comes
under the Favoured Nation Treaty the
difficulty can 'be removed by the Government withdrawing from the Traaty; I do
not see any other way out, for foreign ships
can carry traffic between two Canadian ports
by unloading from one vessel at an American
port an.d then loading for a Canadian port
in another vessel.
Hon. Mr. TUItRIFF: *May I asic the honourable gentleman who is making this inquiry if I understood him to say that an
American vessai could take a cargo at, say,
Port Arthur, and carry it to a Canadian port
in Ontario, and that the American vessai got
the 'cargo while the Canadian vessel was
standing empty at the wharf? Also, could
hie tell the Bouse if the American vassal was
carrying the wheat or other grain at the
samne rate per bushel as the Canadian vassels?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I will he very
glad to taka Hansard and show it to the
experts, and get thair answers to that question. My information is that the Canadian
vessais wara deprived of making one more
trip because the American ships were in tha
way. But I will ha vary glad to gat the
answer from the axperts and give it to the
honourable gentleman.

152

SENATE

,Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Hoqaourable gentlemen, it strikes me that this
discussion bas eitber gene too far or has nlot
gene far enough. To my mind it has flot ici t
the matter in a satisfactory situation. If I
read Hansard as I have heard my benourable friend tell us this afternoon in his disquisition on this subjeet, I must coma te the
conclusion that sometbing is going on which
is nlot rigbt and .iust-not just to our own
people, and flot right as regards the administration. It throws on the Govcrnment itself
the imputation of allowing to go on things
wbich are not authorized by the law.
On
the other band, wbat is authorizad by the
law and by international courtesy and agreement, reciprocally
eonsidered, is perfectly
proper, and sbould not go out to tlic country
as baing wrong and as censtituting a grievance.
I wish my benourable friand had put bis
questions in a form that would bave brought
e definite answer; that is, in a motion for a
return. Or, if be does flot do that, the questions shouýd have been put se that tbe answers
would have met every one of his aliegations.
If those allegations are right. there is something wrong in the state of Dcnmnark. If they
are wrong, then the answers to the questions
would have put the right situation before uis. I
tbink we must have a compiete answer from the
Goveroment with raference to this matter s0
that it may go on Hansard, and may correct
the wrong impression, if one bas 'been made,
or we must bave a. return brought down
wbicb will bring us ful] information, if the
members of the Government are flot in a
position just now to give a complete and
authoritative answer.
I agree with wbat bas becc said by my
bonourabe friend who bas just sat down
(Hon. Mr. Reid). My remembrance of the
matter is that when American vessels were
allowad te transform tbemsalves into storage
elevators at the end of one season, tbe el evators in the ports at the head of tbe lakes were
congested, and tbey teck upon tbemselves the
position of storage vesse's, and thereby conferred a real benefit on the farmers who
wanted te get their grain out. Nor do I halieve that at tbat time ia single American
vesse] was allowed to load if there was a
Canadian vessel that was in a position te do
that same thing. Tbat is my impression, end
I bave a general idea of wbat was going along
during my time.
This matter ougbt net te be allowed te rest
just wbere it is now. We ougit te bave a
very full answer frem some member of the
Geveroment, putting the rights of the case,
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

or bave a return breugbt down se that we can
study it fer ourseivas and come te our own
conclusions.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: Wa will bear fromn
the Gevýerment when I get tbe answers te my
10 questions.
Hion. Mr. DANDURAND:
Wall, my boncuirable friend sbou'd ýperhaps bave acceptad
my suggestion tbat bis inquiry should stand.
This was my answer wvhen the notice was
cailed. But my benourable friand insisted
upen preceeding, and aithougli he put 10 questiens I th'ink ha answercd. four or five of themn
te bis ewn satisfaction.
I de net know that there is a scintilla of
evidence undariying the statements made by
my boneurabia friend. I do not know if ha
bas been on the Great Lakes, and lias scen
some ef these vesseýs. My lioneurabie friend
says be puts questiens, but be bas .preceeded
for baîf an heur te answer tbem. I weuld ask
bonourable gentlemen and the public te suspend .iudgmant until the answers ceme.
Hec. Mr. CASGRAINÇ:

I will, tee.

Hec. Mr. DANDURAND:
But my bonourabla ýfriend should perhaps have been
patient anougli te await the answers, er at ail
events net make bis strictures or cemments
befora the answers came when I b.ad the questions in band. I bave nut got themn in hand.
Now, my bonourabla friand bas discuas;ed the
question, wbich is quite a large oe, bearing
on our foreign trada and our international
law.s---becaiisa the foreign vessais that are in
the lakes are cbiafly American vessels. They
are thare by riglit. Perhaps others aise are
thera by riglit. and are obeying the laws of
Canada. If they are proceeding under regulatiens based upen our ewn laws, we can ef
course amend these regulations; but surely
vessa's thiat are plying- between Canýadian and
American ports are doing se in the face of
twe ýGevernments, Canadian and Amierican,
and I would be very much surprisad if thay
were doing anytbing illagai. I do net believe
they are, and I take fer granted that those
vessaIs that coma frem Nerwtay or ether
Seandinaviagn ceuntrias ara on probab'y the
same footing as the American vesas.
AIl these questions naed te be sifted. I have
net the facts in hand, but the Senate may rest
assured that it will have jail the answars that
the Departments can furnish, and than my
heneurabie friand can comment upen those
answers in soe form or other.

MONTREAL-OITAWA TRAIN SERVICE
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. C. E. TANNER: Honourable gentlemen, I wish for a moment to direct attention
to a matter to which I referred some time
ago. My honourable friend who lias just come
to this side of the Huse (Hon. Mr. Casgrain),
according to the information given us by
the Leader of the bouse, asked some questions
When I
and answered them liimself.
,directed the lionourable Leader's attention
about four weeks ago to a matter in whicli the
Eastern Provinces are interested, my lionourable friend from De Lanaudière (Hon. Mr.
Casgrain) intervened very kindly witli some
information, and I hope lie will now be able
to supplement that inforimation, if tlie lionour-

153

able Leader of the Government is not able
to do so. I asked in regard to the train
service on the Canadi-an National Railways,
connecting Ottawa with tlie Maritime Provinces. There is a train arrîving in Montreal
from the Maritimes about nine o'clock in the
morning, witli ihicli, some years ago, there
was a close connection. Later, that connection
having been cut out, passengers by taking the
tunnel train in Montreal at one o'clock could
reacli Ottawa at lialf-past four. Some four or
five weeks ago tlie tunnel train was cut out,
so tlia% passengers arriving in Montreal from
Haliflax at aine o'clock in tlie morning liad
to wait until the departure of the Canadian
National from Montreal at four o'olock in the
afternoon. My lionourable friend to the lef t
of the Leader of tlie Government (Hon. Mr.
Casgrain) intervened to say in rather rebuking
tones that an i.mproved service wus advertised
in the newspapers, and that if I liad read the
newspapers I would have learned that arrangements were to be made on the 2Oth of May
which would be quite satisfactory to the people
of the Maritime Provinces. I said that ucli
predictions or - promises were not always.
fulfilled, and I regret to say that as far as I
can learn, my statement lias been borne out
while that of my lionourable friend lias fallen
to the ground. Now, I have been kecping in
touch with the railway people, and as late as
yesterday I ascertained that no arrangement
sucli as was promised by the honourible
gentleman from De Lanaudière lias been
made, but that it is stili necessary for
passengers to wait in Mon'treal until four
o1clock. I hope the honourable gentleman
will be able to give a .supplementary statement or that the Leader of the Government
can give us a statement which. will assure mc
that tlie information that I got from the railway company -is not correct, and that tlicre
really is or will be a more prompt service in
the future.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may say that
mAy honoura-ble friend from De Lanaudière
was su positive that he rather paralyzed-me
in my intention of seeking information.

JUNE 8, 192615
The addition of an area of wholly nonagricultural landsa to the Lar-ch His Forest
Reserve in British Columbia is essential
to the development of a forest woi-king-plan.
for the Larch Hi-ls district. The enlarged
reserve is to be developed as a demonstration
f orest and given. more intensive protection
in order that it may serve an edücational
purpose in improved foi-est methods.
The proposed Shuswap Lake For-est Reserve,
als9o in British Columbia, is comprised of an
iarea of strictly non-agricultui-al land, being a
rugged and precipitous country of high altitude,
Ail lands suitable for settiement have been
aarefully excluded, leaving within the proposed
reserve an area which is incapable of sustaining
settiement. The proposed reserve includes
some excellent tiimber. which however, is es
yet too remote for profitable exploitation. To
ensure adequate protection thereof it is
essential that facilities foi- communication and
transport, which can be afforded only in foi-est
reserveis, be provided.
As honourable gentlemen will see, the Bill
is very technical.* It tis the work of an entire
staff of explorers. surveyors and engineers,
and we must i-ely on the value of ouistaff in that Department and accept their
work without appointing aüy expert we may
have in the Senate or outside to verify their
bearings.
The motion was iigreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
May I ask my honourable friend if he could
give us information on two points? On the
one hand, the total tarea of land deducted from
the parks for agricultural or settiement purposes? And what is the measurernent of the
portions which. if thiis passes, will be added to
the parks of the country?
Hon. Mi-. DANDTJRAND: I have the information under rny hand, but it will take a
little while for me to find it. As we shall go
into Commiittee to-morrow, I will fui-nish the
information then.

The Senate resumed fromn yesterday the adjourned deéiate on the motion of Hon. Mi-.
Dandurand for the second reading of Bill 21,
an Act respecting -Old Age Pensions.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: Hon'ourable gentlemen.
I arn not going to inflict any long address
upon the Scnate in respect of this Bill. I shail
not make any reference to the roerits or the
demerits of an old age -pension system. There

are librairies on the subject, and, I have no
d-oubt that every member of this buse bas
read !as much on old age pensions as I have
and knows as much about them.
But the Bill before us is peculiar. I do not
eay there neyer was another Bill like it; I
think there have been a -few like it, and there
may be one or two like it again; but as a i-oIe
we ai-e legislating on subjects over which. we
have jurisdiction. In this case, according to
the Department of Justice, the subject-matter
over which we are legislating bas been assigned
under oui- Federal Constitution to the Provinces. I think if is a good general rule to lay
down and to follow. as closely as possible, that
the Parliament of Canada, or any Hlouse
le.gislating under a similar constitution. should
confine itse&f to those subjects which have
been assigned to it. and the Provinces f0 the
subjects thaf have been assigned to fhem.
The fi-at occasion since I have been in this
House on which a similar question of jurisdiction came up was the introduction of a
measure with respect f0 the highways. The
position I fook on that subject was exaetly
the samne as the position that I amn taking foday. I spoke againsf the Highways Bill and
voted against my .party on that subject, and
-from aIl that I have seen of the Highways
measure un oui- Pi-ovince I fhink my vote was
entirely correct. Had that money been in the
hands of the Provincial Government itself, to
be disposed of as its own revenues, fhey would
have got more out of if than they did gef.
There would not have been as much hurry
and rush as there was f0 spend money on the
highways and get aIl thaf could be got ouf
of the Dominion Governmenf before the
expiration of the time set for paying the
rnoney.
Now you have brought down another
measure which, right on ifs face, postulates
an agreement with nine provinces. Unless you
arrive at an agreement with the Provinces,
you are simply legislating jin the air.
There ai-e fwo ways of dealing with the
thin.g. You mighf pass an Old Age Pension
Act thaf you thoughf was perfect. place it in
the Statute Book. and then leave if to the
Provinces f0 corne in. If you do, that, you
will have f0 spend -a long fîme in working
out an o1 d age pension sysfem. When you
have flnished, Province numýber 1 may say,
"Ail izihf, we will corne in;" number 2 may
say. "No, we will nof;" number 6 may
say, "lWe will corne in;" and number 9
may say, "No." You have an absolute meffl.
If you go ahead. wifh one, two or three of
the Provinces and they receive large sums of
money from the Dominion Goveroment under

156

SENATE

your Act, the Provinces who do flot corne in
are in this position, that they are drawing
nothing from you for old age pensions, and
yet, in the general resuit of our taxation. they
are helping to pay. You will find that the
Province is nlot going to submit to any such
thing as that.
Take my own Province of Nova Scotia. 1
remember when. in the early eighties, the incorne cnd the expenditure of that Province
amounted to about $40,000 a year. Last year
it was something like $6,000 000, and that
Province does flot know whieh way to turn
to make ends meet. At the present moment
I cannt tell you what the deficit was last
year, but it w-as 'abnormalHon.
hall.

Mr. TANNER:

A

million and a

Hon, W. B. ROSS: -on account of the
failure of the mines to pay a royalty, owing
to the suspension of work. 1 think the deficit
was not far short of a million dollars.
Hon. Mr. TANNER:

A million and a haîf.

lion. W. B. ROSS: Under this B:1, if the
Province of Nova Scotia were to corne in,
it would have to be prepared to pay at once
something between two and two and a half
millions. with the prospect of the amount inereasing. Mark you, after this Bill had been
passed and provided a pension of $240 a year,
if 1 know acything about it. the aged people
in this country would nlot be satisfied with
$240, and it would not be very long untiil the
pension would have te 'be worked Up to one
dollar a d-ay, or perhaps doubled to $480 a
year.
However, tcking it as it is. that
Province would be called upen to meet an
expenditure cf more than $2,000,000.
No
mattor how willing they are in regard to old
cge pensions . they cancot do it. They have
taxed every known or imaginable thing that
can ho taxed. You know what happened at
the last election there. The cause is cf course
a matter cf opinion; but the wisest heads that
1 knew cf say th'at the movement which wiped
eut the Governmont that was in power for
ferty years, by a vote cf 40 to 3, wvas sirnply
a revu'sion against what had been goicg on
w'ith regard to money. What the Province
hais to do now is te eut down exponditure
instead cf taking on more.
I cm going te vote against this B:l1 myself
for the reason that it is promaturo.
It is
simply imaginary legislatiion until you get the
Dominion Government and the Provincial
Governments te confer and arrive at an agreement upon the main principles of an old age
pension soheme. If you can get that done, I
Hcrn. W. B. ROSS.

shaîl be prepared te do what I can te help
te work it eut. What is the use cf our
spending a week or ten days on an old age
pension sebeme when we knew that the Provinces. wbo have the jurisdiction, are net the
meving parties?
That is the strange thing
about this proposed legisiation. If the Provinces had presented a seherne, on which they
had agreed, dealing with a matter over which
thoy have jurisdictien, and bcd asked either
for a vote fer old age 'pensions or for an
increase in their subsidy. then I could tinderstand this House giving- the request a very
patient and considerate hearing and perhaps
rendering them some assistance.
But why
sheuld we take this matter in hand .and force
it upon the Provinces, without knowîng what
view they would take, beyond this. that -e far
as they have aswered to interrogatories, it is
cither a negative or the grossest kiind cf
indifferenco te the soheme.
Possibly the
u!tirnate result will be, il you agitate it long
eneugh. that they will tell yen, "If you are
eceer for old age pensions, then vote them
yourselves. ccd lot us alene."
N\ow, I arn net prenouncing any opinion on
old age pensions. 1 can conceive of an eld
age pension scheme that weuld have monits et
its proper time and in its proper place. I have
aiways had the notion that in a unitary
govornment-if, for instance, we wore a
legislative union-we could thrash eut this
question froim beginning te end. The subjeet
is se compliceted that it is bard te know
whicb way te turn in working it eut. StilI it
might bo p)ossible te cenceive of an old age
pension sohome, though I arn certain that it
would require a contribution te some extent
by the beneficiaries. I have had, as I say,
the notion that in a unitary gevernment I
would favour a scheme cf tihet kind, and I
have had such a notion in mind for thirty
years, but it was elweys cenditioned upen the
man himseif doing something. A man who
wvill net spend ton cents te help himself
belongs te a ciass that you cannet do anything
for, and it is net worth while leg-islating fer.
That would be my opinion.
I need net detain you further on this
matter. I intend te voe against this Bill, on
the ground that there is ne manifestation cf
a desire on the part of the Provinces, nor is
there any agreement arrived at with the Provinces, and therefore it is a purely imaginary
Bill that we are asked te pass. We do net
know what would happen.
Hon. G. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
gentlemen. I notice thet year by
tien cf the Dominion Parliament
more and more upon provincial

Honourable
year legislais infringing
.iurisdiction.

XJN.E 8, 1926lo
The duty of the Parliament of Canada, as I
conceive it, is tio pass legisiation for the general advantage of Canada, that is, legisiation
which necessarily affects more than one province. Jurisdiction in matters concerning the
people of each Province bas been given to the
Provincial Legisiatures, and in consequence the
Provincial Governments themselves have taken
care of the feeble-miiided and the physically
weak and helpless, or have delegated their
authority in that respect to the municipalities.
It bas been recognized that that is therir duty
and their business. 71e Dominion Governiment,
in pursuance of that policy of trespass, which
has been growing with the years, now pui'pose
taking a hand in the protection of the feeble
and the care of the helpless. They propose
to provide by legisiation for old age pensions
to help those who cannot help themselves, in
such of the Provinces as agree to go into
partnership with thcm, and only in those
Provinces. This proposai shows that the
logislation to which they are inviting our
assent is Provincial and not Federal.
I~f it is the duty or the right of the
Dominion to proviide old age pensions, why
should it not provide lunatic asylums, bouses
of providence, shelters for the deaf and dumb
-in fact, institutions for assistance for ail the
poor of the country? The unreasonableneas
of such a position is quite apparent. Therefore, in my judgment, this Bill is not only an
improper 'infringement upon Provincial rights
and dutieé, but it is ultra vires of the
Dominion Parliament. We may he told,
"Parliament may do anything." W.hy, Parliament may not do anything. Parliament must
respect the law if it expects the people to
respect it. The British North America Act
bas laid down and described and circumscribed
the jurisdiction of this Parliament, and if thies
Parliament, simply because no person wili
question its legislation, passes Acts when it
is not quite satisfied and clear about its
jurisdiction, it is doing a wrong and is
setting the law of Canada at defiance. Many
statutes have been enacted by this Parliament
which are in my opinion utterly void, and
which, if any person had the înterest to have
them. tested in the courts, would be set aside.
We go along from year to year passing every
statute which we think is politically advisable;
and in saying this I am net speaking of one
Government more than anotiher. We do not
consider as carefully sa we should whether
we are acting within our jurisdiction. As for
me, 1 am not going to vote f or this Bill,
which I believe is ultra vires of this Parliament.
We know that the Government, before
introducing this measure, made inquiries from

the various provincial Goveraments. 1 have
not read their replies, but I am told that
in most cases, if not all, the replies from
the Governments of the Provinces indicated
their opposition to this legislation; and I
do not tbink it is proper or decent for the
Dominion Parliament to force a policy
on the Provincial ýGovernmentý which
they do not or may not wish to adopt. It
would not be considered a friendly act for
the Provincial Governments to endeavour to
cmbarrass the Dominion Government by
passing legisiation and asking them to assent
to it mercly because the Provincial Government thought such legislation was wise and
proper, wbile the Dominion was entirely opposed to it.
This is just the converse. The Dominion
Government. for some reason-I think most
of it is only a profession-seemed to think
that it was wise and proper and statesmanlike for the nation to pay pensions to these
old people; but I think, if the Dominion
Government had a proper respect for the
Provinces, they should hold their band at
least until the Provincial Governments were
in accord with this view.
The business of looking after the poor is
a Provincial matter, and the Provinces should
not be dictated to or embarrassed by the
Dominion Government; and I am not going
to give a vote which will help them to so
embarrass the Government of the Province
in which 1 live. This matter is to me not
one of policy at ail: it is a matter in which
I think we have no j urisdiction; and, expecting that the rights of this Parliament will
be respected by the Provinces, I propose by
my vote to show that 1 respect the rights of
the Provinces.
The statement to which I referrcd, as bas
been just pointed out to me, appears as
No. 88 in the Journals of the buse of
Commons of Canada for June 16, 1925, and
the answers of the Provinces appear there. .
Hon. N. A.. BELCOURT: Honourable
gentlemen, I do not propose to say anything
in regard to the policy of this Bill, or the
question of pensions generally. I have risen
merely for the purpose of asking my honourable friend the leader on the other side (Hon.
W. B. Rose) and my honourable friend from
Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) if they
have not based their oibjections to, the Bill
on false premiees. There is nothing ini this
Bill which forces any Province to act upon it.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I said
moral force: I did net say mandatory force.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: I did not, cither.

158

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The honourable
member said he would oppose forcing the
people of any Province. He did not make
a distinction between moral pressure and any
other pressure. I took him to mean any kind
of pressure. But I submit that no Province
is bound to do anything, or act in any way.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Oh, I admit that. Any
Province can stay out or come in as it likes.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Quite. Then my
honourable friend from Hamilton stated that
this is not a Bill for the general advantage
of Canada. I submit that it is such a Bill,
because any part of Canada may take advantage of it, though we are not forcing it
on any Province. Some argument is to be
drawn from the nature of the Bill; that is,
while we are not forcing it on Canada, we
are offering to every part of Canada the
advantage of coming in under it. It does not
propose doing something contrary to the
general advantage of Canada, but it offers
every part of Canada the advantage of some
money or some other benefit which this
Parliament wishes to put at their disposal.
For these reasons the argument that it is
being forced on the Provinces, or that it is
net for the general advantage of Canada,
seeins to me to be a false ground on which
to base objection to the Bill.
I would net assume that my honourable
friend would wish to deprive seven or eight
of the other Provinces of the advantage which
may inure to them through this Bill because
one Province, say Nova Scotia, is not in a
position to take advantage of it. In this
world therc are a great many things that one
cannot take advantage of, but surely he is
not going to ask his neighbour te forego an
opportunity because he himself cannot take
advantage of it. That is an illustration that
is pertinent to this Bill. It is net because
one or two or three Provinces have not the
means to take advantage of this Bill that
âny honourable gentlemen should want te
deprive the other Provinces of its benefits.
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD: Those one or two
or three or four Provinces that cannot go
into it would have to pay their proportion of
the 50 per cent granted by the Dominion.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That may be, but
Nova iScotia can get it if it chooses.
-Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Would
the honourable gentleman permit me te draw
his attention to a matter that he may answer
now or afterwards. Here is the opinion of the
Deputy Minister of Justice:
Referiiig to your letter of the 12th instant, asking
to be idv.sed with regard to the authority of Parlia-

Hon. W. B. ROSS.

ment to legislate on the subject of old age pensions,
I may say that this subject does not fall specifically
within any of the enumerated subjects given to the
Dominion under section 91 of the British North
Ameerca Act, but does in my judgment fail within
the subject "Property and Civil Rights in the Province" committed to the Provinces under section 92. I
am of opinion, therefore, that the subject matter of
pensions has been entrusted to the Provineal Legislatures rather than to Parliament.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
that in any way.
Hon. Mr. BELAND:
that letter.

I do not dispute

Ask him who signed

Hun Mr. DANDURAND:
Yes, but my
honourable friend should continue.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not dispute
anything ny honourable friend has read, and
it does net matter what the source of it is,
because I think it is quite correct constitutionally.
But that is just what we are
not doing here.
We are net ousting the
jurisdiction of the Provinces; they may go
on and pass this Act, or any other Act.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: That is not what you
said in regard to the labour legislation.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That may be,
I have one bridge te cross at the moment,
I do net propose to cross another.
The
says distinctly, in plain English, that the
is not to be of

but
and
Bill
Act

any value or is net to be

resorted to unless the Province has agreedany Province.
If we were undertaking to
legislate against the Provinces in a matter
of that kind, it would be clearly unconstitutional, but we do net propose te do anything of the kind,:
On the contrary, this
legisiation is subject to the Provincial law, and
is only to have force if the Provinces and this
Parliament can agree.
We are net dictating
to any Province; we are net trying te embarrass, and we would net embarrass, any Province, because this is legislation in which the
Provinces may ail share. If they do not take
a hand in it, then there is nothing done.
The leader on this side points out te me that
my honourable friend from Hamilton did net
read the whole of the opinion of the Minister
of Justice, or his Deputy. Following what he
read, Mr. Edwards goes on:
I do not mean to suggest that Parliament has net
the power to legislate upon the subject so as to assist
the Provinces or te establish an independent voluntary
scheme-

Exactly what I have just said.
-- provided that in either case the legislation does not
trench upon the subject-matter of property and civil
rghts in the Province, as for example, by obligating
any Province or person to contribute te the scheme.

JUNE 8, 1926
Exactly the argument I endeavoured to
make.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Read the
nlext paragraph.
Hlon. Mr. BELCOURT: Very well:
The enactment of such legislation would, however,
involve the assumption by the Dominion of obligations
involving heavy exjpenditure-

That is another thing altogether.
But go
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
on.
Hon. Mr.-BELCOURT: Hle proceeds:
-with regard to a matter which. doee not fait specifically within the Dominion field of legislation.

I arn trying to
I do flot dispute that.
point out that both of my honourable friends
who have spoken on this subject can see that
theli argument is based on nothing.
Hon. W.' B. ROSS: I would like to asIc
my honourable friend if hie has read section
19 of the Bull. Who takes control of the
whole situation?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Section 19 reads:
The Governor in Counail shall have power from
t:'me to time, on the recommencdation of the Minister
of Labour and with the eapproval of thse Treasury
Board, to niake regulations, flot inconaistent with thse
prcv siens of this Act, witb regard to the pens3ions
here'n provided for.

1 do not quite understand why my honourable friend referred to section 19.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Section 19 gives the
Governor in Council control. of the whole
scheme.
Hon. Mr. BEJjCOURT: Oh, no; it is also
subject to section 3; this is ail predicated
upon that:
The Governor in Counceil, *iay make an agreement
with the Lieutensint-Governor mn Council of any province for the,peyment te, such province quarterly of an
amount equal tsi one-ha-if of the net auma paid out
during tise -preceding quarter 'by auch province for
pensions pursoant to a provincial atatute authorizing
and providing for the payment of such pensions to
the persons and under the cionditions apecified îin this
Act and the regulationa made thereunder.

The whole thing shows that no Province is
dictated to or embarrassed. Nothing is forced
on any Province, but the Province is invited,
purely and simply, to corne in wîth the
Dominion Government and together make a
seheme upon whieh they both have some
jurisdiction, which would be deipendent
aitagether upon the agreement.
It is 'the
agreement only that would give this Parliamient jurisdictiosi to deal with it at ail.
I
subrmit, with ail respect, that my honourable
.friends have flot advanced any reason for
opposing this Bill.

159

Hon. C. P.BEAUTBIEN: Honourable gentlemen, I arn at a loss to understand the position
taken by the honourable gentleman fromn
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt). Surely no one
can dispute that a large amount of money
under the control of the Federal Government
will be voted and disposed of by this Bill.
What is this money being voted for? Is it
for a matter within the jurisdiction of the
Federal Parliament? My honourable friend
was asked a moment ago to read the answer
te, this question, coming directly fromn the
Minister of Justice. What did the Minister
say? That Parliament has not the right f0
dispose of suins of money which will ho paid
for old age pensions.
lion. Mr. BELCOURT: He has not said
anything of the sort.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Here is what hoe
says:
The enaetment of such legisiation. would, however,
nvlethe assomption by the Dominion of obligations
involvng heavy etpenditures with regard to a matter
which does not fait 9pecifically within the Dominion
field of legisiation.

Is not that a clear, positive and absolute
answer to the question that I have asked?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes, but it is a
different thing from what my honourable
friend said a moment ago.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
No, it is not.
The only ground for the contention that this
Bill may be within the jurisdiction of Parliament is that it does nothing at all except
offeT assistance to the Provinces. I contend
that the Minister of Justice has clearly stated
that this Bill is b-eyond the jurisdiction of the
Federal Parhiament. If this is only a Bill to
assist the Provinces, -even thon it would do
it unconstitutionally: that is my contention.
May I say one word now, as far as xny
own Province is concerned, on the consequences of this Bill if it should becomo law?
In Quebec we have a state of things based
on the Confederation pact, which state of
things is reflected in our Civil Code, and
imposes upon the family certain obligations,
.particularly upon ftic descendants, -for flic
support of progenîtors, and vice versa.
There is in
Hon. Mr. BELCOUTRT:
Ontario, also.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: My honourable
friend can speak for the Province of Ontario
if lie wishes. I want to be very brief, and
on-ly touch on the effeet of this legisiation
in the Province of Quebec. There is a very
wise provision in the Civil Code, basod
enf.irely on natural law. We consider that the
nucleus of society is the family, and that

160

SENATE

nucleus is kept together, healthy and strong,
by the obligations of one member towards
another-by the children's obligations to
maintain and uphold their parents, and of
course by the collateral obligation of the
parents to look after their descendents. Not
only has t.hat principle been working smoothly
in my Province, but it bas had a steadying
and excellent influence on the people. If
you make the family good, healtby, and
solid, and if you keep every member of it
devoted to every other member by bis
responsibilities. wbich are powerful tics, then
you are working for the good of society. If
this Bill passes, the obligation of the cbjîdren
te look after their father and mother and
grandfatber and grandrnother goes by the,
Board. Is that a good thing? You would
only bave to, ask at randorn to learn w-bat
would be the answer of the Province of Quebec. That is why I arn surprised to sec certain of rny colleagues from that Province on
the other side of the House favouring a Bill
of this nature. It strikes a blow at the very
basis of our Civil Code.
Hon. Mr. BELCOUIRT: In what respect
does it go against the Code? In what way
does it interfere or affect the provisions of
the Civil Code?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I must be very
obscure. 1 will try to make myseif clear.
O~f course it does not repeal the provisions
of the Code, but the need is gone; the paternalism of the bonourable gentlemen on the
other side bas brought in the State to relieve
the child of a natural and civil obligation.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: In wbat way does
it rehieve bim?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: If the parents are
in need, the child is obliged to provide for
them: the law says be must do so according
to bis own means and according to the needs
of bis parents. If the State provides for the
parent, why should the cbild be called upon
to do so? I say be is not called upon to
provide; be is not obliged to fulfil the natural
obligation of maintaining bis father and
mother; the State bas come in and is doing
that for him. Is that clear? If it is not, I
arn afraid I cannot make myseif understood,
although I would very much fike to do so.
Hon. Mr. BELiCOURT: Oh, I am stupid.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: In the second
place, in the Province of Quebec, when tbe
family cannot for one reason or another look
after it.s old people, the law proviýdes that
the municipality shahl step in; and if the
municipality does not or cannot do so, then
the Province intervenes. That condition of
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

affaîrs bas lasted a long time and has produced institutions tbe like of which-and 1
think I shaîl flot be contradicted in this-are hardly to be duplicated the world over.
Let me tell you, honourable gentlemen, that
the biggest and perhaps the finest building in
my Province is now dedicated to poor people
who cannot take care of themselves, most of
wbom are incurable. My honourable friends
on the other side know that is true. There is
an admirable system organised' by charity.
wbich an improvidenit band, through political
interference and nothing else, wants to brush
aside altogether. And for what, may I ask?
'Have I not beard my bonourable friends
across the Huse deplore the fact that doles
have been instituted in Great Britain? Do
they refleet now that doles, after ail, are provided by the British Government only to the
'exten-t of 25 per cent and that the balance
is contributed by British workmen? Yet,
honourable gentlemen are asking for legisla'tion under whîch no contribution at ail is
required, and under which everytbing will
be banded over without any effort whatsoever
on the part of those who will benefit.
SDo you think, bonourable gentlemen, that
if we ever open tbe door to such legislation,
we shaîl be able to close it? Now is tbe time
to think. We must take a stand now-not
after the Bill is passed. How often bave we
beard it said tbat the Biitish, people could
not get away from doles? No longer ago than
last autumn, during the -meeting of tbe Interparliamentary Union, I heard a number of
British parliamentarians say that politically it
is impossible for them to get away from doles.
Still, bonourable gentlemen, the people of the
Old Country bave excuses. They are flot
living in a land where the opportunities are
equal to ours. After aIl, they bave age to
carry, with al its miseries in a great many
forms. For one tbing, they bave too much
population for what they can produce in the
way of food. Tbere are 700 people per square
mile in Great Britain, whereas we have only
.3; and the sun of our future is rising hefore
US. Why should we put upon ourselves the
handicaps of ail the old countries of Europe
when we are not obliged to do so? ks that
.iudicious? Is it judicious for us to impose
.upon our country such socialistie legislation
as this-because it is ýnothing else-when there
is no cal for it?
In looking rapid-ly over the history of this
legislation, what do I find? From time to
time Parliament bas been dickering with it.
Committees to investigate it were const.ituted in 1908, in 1912, in 1913, a pious
motion in 1914, another in 1922, a delegation in 1923, a unanimous resolution

JUNE 8, 1926
in 1924 ta refer the matter ta the Provinces.
Mfter this lengthy consideration of the matter,
Parliament came ta the only conclusion that
could properly be reached, and since this was
a matter belonging ta the Provinces, the
Committee unanimously said: "Let us refer
it ta the Provinces." Last year, and more
especially this year, for reasons upan whicb
I do flot desire ta enter, but which I think
are apparent ta everybdyWill my hon.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
friend allow me ta ask if he is flot making an
errar when he says that those reports stated
that the mlatter should be referred ta the
Provinces, and whether it was flot that there
sbould be a conference with the Provinces?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: What I have here
is "referred to the Provinces."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I know ai two
reports of Commîttees of the ather Chamber,
and neither of them, as far as my memory
gaes-and I read them very lately-s-tated
that the matter shau1d be dismissed from the
Federal arena. There is in one case a recommendation that there shauld be a conference.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: The Committee
had conferred with, the Provinces, and the
reply is given in the report.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I arn ready ta, admit that probably tihe Leader af the Gaverament is better informed than I amn as ta the
details of that legisiatian, and I will take his
version of it, which I do not think is very
different from my own. Whether the conclusion is ta refer the matter ta the Provinces
or ta canvene tihe Prime Ministers of the different Provinces ta deal with it, ta my mind
the resuit is absolutely the same. In other
words, after considering the matter for years,
always under the same pressure which we are
bound ta feel more and more as we go on,
Parliament bas came ta the conclusion that
the question should be referred ta tihe Provinces, where it belongs.
Now, honaurable gentlemen, if we f allow
that principle, can we say there is need of it?
There is only one Province, namely, British
Columibia, ths.t has -asked for it after ail these
years.
The Prime Minister said that he was going
ta call a oanference af the Provincial Premiers,
and for two days naw Vhey have been sitting
ini this very city. Are they anxiaus for this
thing? Have you heard ai any resolution
being pamsd ta, that effect? No, yau have
not heard one word. But tihere is more. What
about the answer af Quebec? My honourable
friend knows the caipabilities af Hon. Mr.
Taschereau. He is a very able, sober-minded,

trustworthy man. What does Mr. Taschereau
say? He says he will have nothing ta do with
legislation ai that kind. Is not that an authority for the honourable gentlemen across the
House? Why ehould he refuse?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: He bas every right
ta do so.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Certainly, he bas
every right, and every wisdamn besicles, in
refusing the amaunt af money yau offer ta
him, attached, as it is, ta, the legisiation in
question. Mr. Taschereau is not more desiraus
ai having bis people in the Province of Quebec brought up ta that school ai sociali sm than
are mast honourable gentlemen opposite.
Now, honourable gentlemen, just one word
more. The Eastern Provinces pay about 75
par cent ai the taxes of this country. Wbat
is going ta happen if the Western Provinces
accept this legisiation and the Eastern Provinces refuse it? What is going ta happen is
this: 75 per cent ai the contributions of the
Federal Treasury ta every one ai those Western Provinces will be paid 'by the East; and
wlhat will be the compensation? Is it fair?
And that is the weapon in the bands ui the
Goverument to-day. They know very well
that their legisiation is not popular, but they
turn ta the Provinces and eay: "You will
have ta pay anyway; will you take it? If
you take it, you get your share; but, if yau
do not take it, you do nat get your share
and you pay for the others."
I regret baving spoken at such great length,
honourable gentlemen; but I arn absolutely
and daterminedly opposed ta this legisiation:
firstly, because it is unconstitutional; secandly,
because it is uniust; thîrdly, because it is
totally un:wise, and, fourthly, because it is
absolutely unwarranted.
As ta the last point, honourable gentlemen,
I hardly need ta develop it, but I may refer
honourable gentlemen oi this House ta the
words of the gentleman ivho presented this
legisiation ta Parliament. What does he say?
It is this: III hear my opponents say that this
is gaing ta impose an additional burden on
Canada. -It is not at all-why? Do you think
that the aged people are nat now being looked
ai ter in this country? Certainly they are being looked after." He daims that tha only thing
they intend ta do is ta change the burden
from where it now rests ta the Federal Government. Well, honourable gentlemen, I say let
well enough alone. As far as we in the Province ai Quebec are concerned, we wish ta leave
the burden where it is. One of the highest
privileges we possess is ta look after aur own
aid people, and it is an aven greater privilege
that we have been allowed the liberty, by

our people what they are to-day.
Hon. J. D. REID: Honourable gentlemen,
I wish to say just a word or two on this Bill
to give the reason why I intend to vote
The ýGovernment appointed a
against it.
Committee on the 1st of May, 1924, and from
the records it appears that on the 12th of
May action was taken by that Committee.
The first thing they did was to write a letter
to the Minister of Justice to find out what
power they would have under the proposed
Pension Act. The reply has been given to
the House. Next, on the 23rd of May, 1925,
they addressed a letter to the several Premiers,
and their replies appear in the official records
of the House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Would the honourable gentleman mention the names of the
Provinces that are in favour of the legislation
and those that are opposed to it?
Hon. Mr. REID: So far as I interpret the
replies, every Province is against it. The
gentleman who has just taken bis seat (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien) said that British Columbia
was in favour of it. I will read the letter
from the Premier of British Columbia, and
you ,can place your own interpretation upon
it. On June 2, 1926, Hon. Mr. Oliver, writing
to the Chairman of the Committee, says:
Your exiplanaton of how the propoesed scheme was
expected to work certainly tends towards a better

understanding. Should the Parliament of Canada pass
legislation along the l'nes suggested in your report of
last year, I presume the question wou!d then arise
as to whether or not the Provinces would co-operate.

I do not interpret that letter as saying that
British Columbia is in favour of this legislation, and yet that is the strongest letter of all.
There is another reason why I am not in
favour of this Bill. The Government appointed a Committee to investigate and to
report their findings. After taking a long
time they did make an official report, wbich
appears in the records of the House. I will
read the recommendations of this Committee.
They reported unanimously:
fHaving given very careful coisideration to the opinion
submitted by the Department of Justice, and also to
the respective views of the different provinces, your

Committee have come to the folowing conclusions:Firstiy, that if the Dominion Government were to
proceed now with a schene of old age pensions, it
would have to be prepared to bear the entire expense,
which would a.pproximately amount to twenty-three
million ($23,000,000) dollars annually, according to the
data ohtained in your Committee's investigations.
Secondly, that in view of the prescent financial conditons and heavy taxation of Canada, your Committee
would not feel warranted at the present moment in
reccmmending such a large additional expenditure,
annually.
Hon.

Mr. BEAUBIEN.

Thirdly, that this measure of social reform, in the
opinion of your Committee, is very important, and
Fourthly, that since it la the opinion of the Department of Justice that the matter is one coming under
the jurisdiction of the Provinces, although open to
assistance from the Federal goverement, your Conmittee, therefore, strongly recommend:1. That the Federal government arrange with the
Premiers of the different Provinces for a conference to
be held during the coming Recess of Parliament at
which an old age pension system shall be given the
fullest consideration with a view to securing cooperative action, and that the report of the said conference be laid on the Table at the next Session of
Parliament for future consideration and action.
2. That the Chairman of your Committee, and one
other of its members who would be familiar with the
subject matter, be invited to attend the said conference.
3. That a copy of this report be forwarded to cach
Premier of the several Provinces.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: May I ask my
honourable friend to give the reference?
Hon. Mr. REID: It is in the Journals of
the House of Commons of Canada, Volume

of this report. The Government knew that

recommcnded a conference with the Provinces: none bas ever been held. The Committee reported against a Bill of this kind:
their report was unanimous. Even those who
were in faveur of old age pensions-and there
were members on that Committee who were
strongly in favour of the scheme-joined in
making a unanimous report to the effect that
it was not right to bring in that Bill. Yet,
without consulting anybody, the Government
draft a Bill and present it to Parliament.
Is that fair to the country? Never in al]
my experience have I seen or heard of any
Government treating with such contempt a
report brought in by their own Committee.
Surely the Provinces should have had some
say. It is not as though the matter were
urgent. Nearly two years have elapsed.

JVNE 8, 1926
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Would the
honourable gentleman tell me who was guilty
of contempt?
Hon. Mr. REID: Yes. 1 think the Government are. They treated their Committee
with contempt when they neyer even recognized it. They would not even submait the
matter to the Provinces.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But what my
honourable friend has read is a report frorn
a Comrnittee of the House of Commons, is
it not?
Hon. Mr. REID.- A Committee of the
House of Commons. The report was presented there, and they have treated their own
Committee with contempt.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But, I ask, who
is responsible for the contempt? Here we
have a Bill that passes in spite of that,
and is sent here unanimously from the Cornmons.
Hon. Mr. REID: The rnajority of the
Committee of the Commons were Government
supporters.
You neyer saw a Comittee
appointed but the Government had control of
it by a rnojority.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, but 1 say
that this Bill last week passed the flouse of
Commons unanimously.
Hon. Mr. REID: Passed unanimously?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. REID: I do not know anything
about that, but 1 do know that the Governnment did not treat that Comrnittee fairly;
they did not treat the people fairly; they
did not give the Provinces an opportunity to
be consulted, although the whole question is
one of provincial rigbt.
1 do not want to take up further tîrne. My
purpose in rising was sinmply to read the report of that Committee.
Hon. F. B. BLAOK: Honourable gentle.
mien, I desire to make a few remarks on this
Bill. It is of the most vital interest to that
section of the country frorn which I corne, the
Maritime Provinces.
Il agree entirely with
the rernarks of the honourable gentleman from
Middleton (Hon. W. B. Ross), who leads this
side of the flouse. There are rnany reasons
why I for one would oppose this legislation,
but hie has given one good and sufficient reason,
and I do not intend to go further into the
reasons except to make an explanation to this
House, and, I hope, to enlighten it, as to the
effect that this measure would have upon the
three Maritime Provinces.
14015-ilj

o

You are well aware that, for the past few
years at least, conditions in the Maritime
Provinces, from the point of view of finance,
business, and population, have been on the
down grade.
There are rumblings, and you
have frequenthy heard the word "secession."
I want to say that every man who cornes from
the Maritime Provinces deprecates the use of
that word. There is no real secession sentiment in the Maritime Provinces, but I want
to say to honourable members of this flouse,
and through them to the people of the country,
that in the legislation enacted now or in the
future by the Dominion Parhiament consideration must be given, if I may say so, to the
rights, the responsibilities, and the losses of the
people of the Maritime Provinces, or you, and
not the Maritime Provinces, will be responsible if that word becornes a hive one down
there.
May I point out to honourable gentlemen
opposite, end to the members on this side
of the flouse as well, tbat legislation of this
kind has not been asked for by any. Province
of Canada. I have read everything that I
could read in the hast two weeks on what bas
taken place with regard to the question before
either flouse of Parliarnent, and I 'cannot
find in the record a single request froni any
Province in 'Canada for legisiation of this kind.
References have been made here to-day to the
requests that went out to the varicius Provinces
for an expression of their opinion as to the
requirements of hegisiation of this sort, and
you have heard generalhy what the replies
were.
I wihl speak only for three or four
provinces. New Brunswick said, "No, we do
not want it;" Nova Scotia said, "No, we do
not want it;" Prince Edward Island saïd, "No,
we do not want it;" Quebec said, "No, we
do not want it;" and so on. You wilh not flnd
a demand, either in writing or by word, frorn
any Province of Canada for legishation of this
kind.
Furthermore, so far as the Maritime Provinces are concerned, whether as a result of
wise legisiation or unwise, or whatever may.
bave been the conditions that brought it
about, in not one of those Provinces does
the revenue to-day meet the expenditure,
though in Prince Edward Island they are
nearhy even. Those governments which have
recently corne into power in the Maritime
Provinces are doing their utmost to break
even by imposing on the people an increase
of taxation in every direction. That is a
most unpopular task, and those governments
are taking their politicaIl ives in their hands
in the effort to balance their budgets, for
once in a period of twenty-flve years, and
by these increased taxes to raise enough

tu remtrnvber that each of thcse Provinces
has aiready machinery which was begun before Confedieration and has been built up

the Dominion Treasury. The Provinces have
their machinery for taking care of their poor,
and thev are fairiy weii protected. There

bouses for the shieiter of those whom you now
propose to hielp in another way. The Provinces have their investments in municipal
homes, in municipal farms, in homes for orphans and needy chiidren. Ail the machinery
for the care of the various dependent people
is now under their control and is working

went into this schcme, it wouid have to
increase the revenue requircd, a.t least for the

than $200,000, which wouid have to ha

Hon. Mr. BLACX: They went West because it was a good place, and they wanted
to rernain Canadian citizens. It is an excellent
place to go to and I only wish that all the
men who migrated from the Maritime provinces had gone west. Unfortunately many
have gone across the Uine to the south. But
the time will corne when, as the country
builds up, you will have to meet the same
condition as that which confronts -the Maritime provinces at present. Then you will not
be reaping the benefit of receiving money
that the rest of Canada is contributing, but
you will be bearing your fair share. However,
it will be rnany years before that cornes
about.
Another feature of this Bill is that, as regards the Maritime provinces, you are putting
on them. a burden which they cannot bear
if this measure goes into effect. You will be
doing a real injustice to the Maritime provinces if you pit such legisiation. as this on

stated by a former speaker. Although the
Premiers and the Governments of those Provinces were in sympathy wiîth the Government
of the day, the Federal Govemmrent wus told
that.the -Maritime provinces could not do it.
Everybody who cornes from the Maritime
Provinces knows that they cannot take advantage of this scherne. Is tihe Federal Government to say to those provinces: "You
cannot take advantage of the sceme, but
though you cannet do so yon must pay." Is
that f air? Is that ressonable? Is it proper
to say ta them, "You mnust contribute your
share of the money which t~he Dominion
Government gives to other parts of *Canada,
notwithstanding the fact that you cannot take
advantage of the scheme?" That is one injustice that is done under this Bill if passed.
I will -mention another injustice which te
my mind is still greater. You put those
Provinces in this position: "Here is a scheme
of old age pensions of which. some parts of
Canada, belonging to a Confederation of
which you f orm. a part, are able to take advantage because of their different conditions;
but you, because of your poverty, or because
of the unfortunate effeets of Confederation
upon your provinces, are unable to enter into
it." Thus you put a stigma upon thoe
Provinces, and I cannot sec how Maritime
members of this House, or of another place,
after knowing the facto, can go back and
look their constituents and friends in the
Why did they go? face if this legislation is passed.

Prince Edward Island is an agricultural province, and to the fact that with improved
f acilities for agriculture and the amount of
work done by machinery which a few years
ago was done by manual labour, it is
impossible for the* young people to obtain
sufficient ernployment.
The sarne applieo also to Nova Scotia,
though not to the saine extent. I arn not
going to weary you with the figures regarding
Nova Scotia, because I want to occupy only
a few moments of your time, but if the Province of Nova Scotia takes advantage of
this scherne it will have to increase its present
direct taxation by more than 20 per cent, and
in addition to that it must bear its share of
the hurden which will be imposed upon the
whole Dominion if the seheme goes into effect.
In other words, Nova Seotia must pay its
share of the fifteen or twenty million dollars*
which will be the Dominion Governmnent's
contribution to the scherne.
New Brunswick cornes next, and the
effect there would be almost as bad: New
Brunswick would have to increase its direct
taxation by 18 per cent. At the last Session
of the Legislature of the Province of New
Brunswick it imposed direct tax after direct
tax. It has now had recourse to the income
tax-a thing that province neyer had before.
Why? Because, as I have already said, a new
governrent ceming into power and taking
hold of the reins has said: "Rather than go
behind in this Province another year, we will
run the risk of the popular feeling being
against us, but we mnust at least break even in
our annual expenditure." It would be necessary to add another 18 per cent to the amount
of money that we already had to raise in that
Province. Eighteen per cent of practically
54,000,000 iz nearly $700,000, and this additional amount would have to be raised in
New Brunswick by direct taxation if the Province took advantage of this acheme.
The Province of Quebec is in the saine
category, but not quite so badly situated:
there would have to be 14 per cent increase
in the annual budget of that Province. In
the Province of Ontario the increase would
be 10 per cent. In the Western Provinces, it
is truc, it would inake very little difference.
Why? Everybody knows that, because the
Western Provinces are new, young mnen go
there. They have npt yet been there long
enough to have grown old. 0f the young men
who have lef t Prince Edward Island, New
Brunswick or Nova Scotia, many have gone
West, and they are there to-day.

Hon. J. S. MeLENNAIN: Ilonourable gentlemen, I woffld like to occupy a few minutes on a point which 1 think is of particular
interest in this Iouse, in view of the attitude
tha~t people outside take in reference to this
Chamiber, namely, the laick of public demand
for this nieasure.
The Committee of the other House, which
was continued for two years, and which deserves a great deal of credit for the excellent
work thcy did and thse information they got
.together, took thse opportunity of sending a
circuilar letter te 13,5 mayors throughout
Canada.
They received only 30 answvers,
and thouigi it bas been stated that it is very
rare for .,,nybody te refuse money from outside, tht-i reiulies were by no means
unani mous.
The rcstult of that circular wasq that 17
aoswers gave aiscnt to thse seheme, on thse
,whole; two were doubtfil
and 1l were
against it, on thse ground that they wanted
a contributory schemne, if any, or for other
reýasns. Thse question sent eut wvas: "Your
opinion, brieflv given, regarding tise desirability of establishing old age pensions
in Cinu.da."
In these letters, with thse exception of one from a city in Manitoba,
1here is no hint that people were flot being
properly cared for. That letter was sent in
1924, and says that the Provincial homes for

inadequate to nucet tise demands on them
for accommodation; otherwise there is no
statement that tise indigents of ail kinds
are flot properly looked after.
The replies
are from Nova Scotia right out out to
British Columbia. One of the strongest statements against this measure xvas from Portage
la Prairie, w'here the question was discussed
at tise City Counceil, whose members were
of opinion that the eare of the aged and indigent could be better administered by tise
imuinicipality itself, where ail local conditions
were known, and where there was less chance
of abusing tise system.
Anuther puint that struck me was thse cornparatively few people wiso were charges on
the towns or charitable institutions of tise
towns, from one end of Canada to tise other.
Stili another was the almost universal fact
that the indigent were iseing maintained for
distinctly less money tisan tisis sciseme would
cost in the end.
For example, Brandon is
spending now $1.500, while the cost under
tisis sciseme woul'd be $3,000.
At Calgary
they are spending $6.800, but und)er this

number of unfortunates, and 1 believe there
bas neyer been any real desire for it on the
part of people of Canada, or of those who
give most attention to the very many phases
of philanthropie work which. form one of
the glories of this cou*ntry in every one of its
Provinces.
Hon. JOHN MecORMICK: Honourable
gentlemen, this meas'ure is not one of the
subjects with which thiýs Parliament bas power
to deal. It is a matter that should be provided for by the Provincial Legislatures of
the country. TIhat being the case, together
with the fact that accordmng to the report of
the Commission the scheme would involve
an expenditure of $23,000,000, 1 arn opposed
to the Bill. Are the revenues of this country
in such a condition, an'd is the taxation to-day
so arranged, az; to warrant an expenditure of
that kinci?
What is the reason that this nmtter is
brought before this Parliament, in view of
the facts I have just stated? The Provinces
have neyer asked for it. The parties who
have jurisdiction are now providing for the
needs of their own Provinces, and there is
no caîl for this measure froin any of the
legislatures. Why is it that this Government
brings in this measure, involving such a large
expenditure froin the Dominion, and also
calling for an expenditure of the Provinces
at 'least 20 per cent in advance of what is
required now to maintain their poor? 1 think
that some attention should be given, by the
leader of the Government in this Bouse and
by those who support this measure, to the
question why it bas been brought in at sîl.
I do not think there is any doubt in the
nunds of those who have been following the
aftairs of this country for somne years that
this measure was proposed simply in order to
secure the support of two men who caîl themselves labour men in the other Bouse. To be
plain, that is the whol-e thing-men who cal
themnselves labour 'men, 'but who are not in
the full sense labour men, who do not represent any considerable portion of labour
in th.9 country.
In view of these facts, those who are chargcdi
with the responsibilities should explain why
they are looking for places to put money
when they are net givi.ng sufficient relief
fromn taxation such as the country demands,
and yet are proposing a measure involving
an expenditure of at least $20,000,000. In
our own part of the country a few months
ago, when we had unemployment, when people
were crying for bread, there were no 'millions
of dollars, or even thousands of dollars, or
any dollars at al. that went down fromn here.

167

Even at the terminal of this 22,000 miles of
railway that this Government owns and
operates there is nlot a wharf at which a
Thes

matters should receive attention before money
is thruwn away in such a mneasure as this,
when the Goverrnent, bas no eall or obligation to do it. Sorne attempt ehould be made
to relieve the excessive taxation on the people
of this country.
I intend to vote against this measure
because it is not called for; there is no part
of the country demanding it; there is no Province asking for it; and therefore the purpose
for which. it is brought in is unworthy of
support, at least in this Bouse.
Hon. L. MoMEANS: H1onourable gentlemen this mat ter has heen pretty well thraqshed
out, and I do not know that 1 can add anything to -the debate; but 1 would like to
assure the honoursble gentleman on my left
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) that in the Province
of Manitoba the aged and înfirma are as tcarefully looked after as they are in the Province
of Quebec.
I think it was rather unfortunate that this
measiire should have been introduced into
Parliament. I arn sure that nobody who
listened to the address of the leader of the
in graphie
Government, who -described
language, of which he is master, the great
benefits to be derived froin this Bill, could
help feeling that we were under a great debt
to the old and the infirm. But after reading
the Bill the old phrase occurred to me that
they asIc for bread and you give them a stone.
The Bill wsis introduced into the other
House, as stated by the honourable gentleman who bas just taken his seat, at the
request of two members of the Bouse of
Commons. I do not make that statement
myself, but I understand that after the last
election we had what was known in this
country as a Group Government, and the
majýority was very close-exceedingly so; at
one time it was only two votes, and if those
two memabers of the Labour party haci changed
their minds or had nlot received the consideration to which they thought, they were
entitled, the position of the Governm.-ent
would have been very uncertain. That is
one of the reasons why this Bill bas been
introdud'ed in this very peculiar form.
I believe
I believe in old age pensions.
I think we owe a debt to
in the principle.
theold. We pension our judges and, aur civil
servants, and there is no reason why the old
men who froin unfortunate circumstances are
thrown upon the publie at the age of 70 should

that principla, but such a Bill as the present
couid flot possibly afford any benefit to them.
Supposing some provinces were under the
provisions of this Act and other provinces
were flot, you would have a migration of
people who wera aproaching the age of 70
into the provinces w2ich were under the
Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDTJRAND:
doubtful.

That is very

H-on. Mr. McEN:I
do nlot think it
is doubtful at ail. I believe the Bill provides
that a person must ha in a province for five
years, but if he is approaching 65 in Ontario,
or near the boundary of it, or in Saskatchewan,
hie would say: "I arn getting on; I will go into
Saskatchewan or Manitoba."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: To obtain, after
five years, only one-fourth of the pension if
hie is there five years.
Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: Well, it would have
that effect, anyway, and, as pointed out by
severai speakers, the provinces that do not
go in wvould have to pay for the provinces
that do, in increased taxation; there is no question about that.
Now, I would like to point out that in Manitoba we have a pension sc-heme, though it may
not ýbe properiy called by that name.
Wa
have a M1others' Allowance which to my mmnd
is on exactly the samne basis.
A pension is
granted to mothers and to the children of
widows. Just to point out how littie dependance can be placed upon figures that were
quoted here in the very eloquent speech of
the leader, the province of Manitoba started
mnto this Mothers' Ailowance plan by voting
$52,000 a year, saying that that would ha
sufficient to take care of the mothers and
the children.
Last year, if the provisions of
the Act had been carried out, it wouid have
amounted to, $750,M00 a year.
They had to
eut the grant down, in the face of the protests of what are termed the labour members,
who very urgently insisted on tham carryîng
out the Act in its entirety. But they had to,
cut it down, and they grantad the widows and
children the sum of $450,000, which is no smail
sum for a province situatad as Manitoba is.
As you know, the population is not very axtensive, beîng something over 600,000, and wa
have much difficulty in financing, though
probably conditions ara not quite so bad as
those pictured in a certain Province down by
the sea.
I arn one of those whu believe that there is
too much of this comning to the Dominion
Government and asking for things, and too

Mr. MeMEANS.

much inclination on the part oyf the Dominion
Government to make the Provinces ra]y upon
It.
Inducements are baing heid out every
year to the Provinces to corne here and make
raids on the Faderai Treasury. The Province of Ontario, and tha Province of Quabac,
of which my honourabla friand to the left
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) is so proud, are rich
Provinces: thair bonds sali on the market at
as high a figure as do thosa of the Dominion.
What is the result? It does not much matter
which party is in power; one sees huge sums
granted for the building of roads or for
technical education.
I think it is about tirna
the poiicy of making the Provinces reiy upon
thcmseives and upon their own efforts was
inaugurated.
At six o'clock the Sanate took racess.
The Senate rasumed at 8 p.m.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS (continuing): Honourable gentlemen, when the House rose at
six o'clock I was referring to the fact that tha
Provinces of the Dominion had bean ancouraged to a very large extent to coma to
the Dominion authorities for large sums of
money on various occasions, and 1 was about
to read a statement from the New York
Harald containing an opinion of President
Coolidge on the question of giving aid to
the statas. With the permission of the Senata
I wiil read this article, which is not vary
long. It says:
RccaOîing ;n his Will.'am and Mary Colloge addresa
the orig.n of ihe nation, President Coollidge again emnphas sol hi-, conception of the responsibilitc.s of the
stat-es as weIl as of the sovercign nccossity of the
Union.
In Washington's timne and for several generat;ons later national unity and authority had to be
strewed because there was, a very powerful elerrient
ssh ch con tendcd that the Union was mcrely a dissoluble
te-lcratoa, alway s ubject to the threat of secession.
That enntroversy was s&ttlcd sidy years ago.
The
states nosv admit the truc roIe of the nation. They are
d.spo.cd even t0 exaggcrate it by refusing to occupy
the exclusive field of state action and by runn:ng to
Washîngton for assistance in doing th.ngs which thcy
them..is!vs ought to do.
Presclciit Coolidge is a sound nationalist. He said
yesterda.v: 'It

The doctrine of state rights iuvolves duties even
more than privileges. The states must-practice selfheIl>, economny, efficiency in local administration and
friendly co-operation with one Bnot.ber if they are ta
avoid. Federal encroachmente. The President'a ideaone wbich he bas expressed many tiines--is condensed
in this sentence: "I want to sc the policy ad<spted
by tbe states of discharging tbeir puablie f unotions ao
faitbfully that instead of an extension on the part of
the Federal goveroment there can be a contraction."
The states througb their Senators a!nd Representatives continue to ask for ton *much assistance from the
Federal gevernment-,asistance in building state roeds,
in education and in other undertakings which are
with.in the state demnain. If the President has bis way

If we consider the enormous debt that we
are staggering under in this Dominion, and
the tremendous taxation that the people of
Canada have to pay, we must realize that
there does flot seema to ha a very briglit
prospect. There does flot seem to be any
retrenchrnent in either provincial or federal
matters, and I do flot see how we can expect
any prosperity in this country so long as this
tremendous burden of taxa tion continues to
'bear upon us. Surely anyone intending to
invest capital would hesitate when hie found
out what conditions were. In passing, I
would like to say that if the policy of the
Government continues we will have nothing
but old mon. Most of the young men have
gone already. We spend irnense surns of
money in educating and training them, but as
soon as they arrive at the age of maturity
they are cornpelled to leave this country and
t.o seek employment in the neighbouring
republic. They have gone over there by
thousands. They are welcomed there and
get into good positions, and the chances of
their returning are very slim indeed. I do
flot need to dwell on that at length, because
it bas been frequently rernarked upon and
brought to the attention of the Government;
but if there is not some change in the policy
of the Government so that our young men,

iui

who are the most valuable asset we have in
this country, will be kept at home, the outlook for the future is not very bright.
I think the article which I have just read
is rather to the point in that respet-that
the Provinces of this Dominion should. be
told.that they cannot expect to corne to the
Federal Government and receive aid. As I
said before. I arn thoroughly in favour of
the principle of old age pensions, and I would
not go into the question of cost at all if the
Bill brought hefore us were one that could
be worked out and made of practical use.
The people of the Dominion have been looking forward to something of the kind, but
when they sec the provisions of this Bill I
arn afraid it wîll be a keen disappointment
to them. I do not know of any pràctical
man who for a moment would say that it
could be worked out practically. It provides
that if one Province cornes in and thereby
benefits to a certain extent, all the other
Provinces will have to heip to pay for it.
The Bill is utterly futile. It looks to me
like a piece of camouflage. It has been said
that it was introduced at the behest of
Labour. Any Bill, no matter by whom it
has been introduced, mnust depend upon its
merits. Whether it was introduced by one
party or another would not make any difference to me. I would like to ask rny honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) if hie
would not consider that a Bill passed hy the
Manitoba.Legisiature and giving.pensions to
mothers and children was just as meritorious,
or perhaps a little more so, than this? And
whether the Government of Manitoba would
be justified in coming to the Dominion
Government and saying: "We are spending
$450,000 a year, and want to spend $700,000
in giving aid to the widow and lier children."
Would not that b e just as fair a dlaim as in
the case of pensions? I cannot see any difference. Manitoba has passed that Bill, and
she bears the burden of it and does not ask
for any aid.
I arn one of those -who sincerely believe
that this is purely a question for the Provinoes, andI that each k'rovince should have
its own measure of old age pensions. In the
neighbouring Republic each separate state
wotild have to deal with a matter of this
kind on its own responsibilîty. It would not
go to the Federal Governuient and ýask for
aid from Congress if the State Legislatures
were inauguring a systern of pensions; nor
would the Federal Governient atternpt to
establish a Federýal pension systemn for the
United States, because it would be recognized
that this is a matter purely witýhîn the rights
of the state.

170

SENATE

Even if ail the Provinces were to agree on
the principle of thia Bill, it wou]d stilil be
objectionaible, for the reason that the ýgranting
of rnoney by the Federal Government would
bie sirnply giving with one hand and taking
back with the other. It would be like a cow
consuming her own rnilk. There would lie na
advantage to any of the Provinces if by
joining in the scheme tbey received a grant
from the Federal Government, because the
Provinces would have to pay it back in the
way of taxation. It is on them that you have
to depend for the taxes, and if they have
to pay back the grant, what is the use of
saying t'hat the Dominion Government is
going to pay haîf of the cost of this pensions
seheme? The Provinces would have to bear
the burden.
I do not think 1 oeed detain the flouse any
longer. For my part I concur in the opinion
expressed by the honourable leader on this
side of the flouse and intend votin-g agaiost
the Bill.
Hon. C. E. TANNER: Ilonourable gentlemen, there are very few rernarks that I wish
to make in regard to this Bill, and I intervene
only for the purpose of mentioning one or
two matters which I thiok are new in the
discussion. I would prefer to have h-eard
someone give what reamons miglit be given
to show why this flouse should .pass the
proposed legislation, but there seems to be a
diffideoce on the part of ýhonourable niembers
to take up the task of convincing the flouse
of the rea.sons for adopting the Bill. I presumne
that the honcurable leader of the House ixill
give us ail the reasons that can lie given,
and one purpose for whicb I corne into the
discuss~ion is to mention the matters I have
referred to. in order that lie may deal with
them in his discussion of the subject.
Generally speaking, I rnay say that I am
ennvinced that this Bill should not lie adopted,
principally for the reason which has been
alreq-Iv stated, narnely. that the subj ectmfttter is one xvhich should lie primarily dealt

with by the Provincial Legisiattîres. I admit
of course, that this Bill is sa framed as to get
around the constitutional questions, putting
on the. Provincial Legisiatures the onus of
dealing flrst with the subject-matter, and then
proferring
to
thnse Legisiatures
certain
assistance which, according ta the opinion of
the Justice Departnient, is quite constitutional;

but I am firmly of the opinion, hýonourable
gentlemen, that it is nt scund policy for
this Parhiarnent to intervene in a matter of
this kînd, and, by inducernents, or by coaxing,
or by aoy other effort made to prevail upon
the Legfislatures, to persuade them to deal
Hon.

Mr.

MeMEANS.

wit'h matters which they are reluctant to
toucli.
I think the field of the Provincial
Legislature shoulýd be lef t to the Provincial

Legislature, -and that the Dominion Parliament
should content itself with dealing with matters
that corne within the purview of this Parliament.
I am sure that every honourable

member will agree with me that we have
problems enough of our own-Dominion
problems, great and perplexing problems, which
have ot been dealt with and which ought
to lie. Therefore I arn convinced that we
should lie far better employed in this Parliament in ýdealing wit'h such subjeet-matters

and leaving it to the Legisiatures to deal with
their own matters when they ohoose and in
the manner they ehoose.
One of the matters to which I desire to
refer is this. I want 'to make a protest against
wrong impressions being given by officiai docu-

ments being issued, like the one I have in rny
hand, under the name or with the imprimatur
of a Minister of the Crown. This one is
issued under the authority of the Minister of

Labour, and purports to lie a correct statement of fact in regard to a public matter.
This is a supplement, issued some time ago
by the Department of Labour, entitled "Old

Age Pension System Existing in Various
coun.tries," and is intended, 1 pre-sume, for
the purpose of giving to the uninformed accurate and relinlile information. It does contain a great deal of information that is
accurate and reliable, but rny citicisma of it is
that the situation in the Parliament of Canada
with respect to this matter is not fairly, fully
and correetly stated. I do not wishi to take
up time in reading, but this pamphlet goes on
to mention the fact that old age pensions were
diseusscd !in the Ganadian Parliament at
various times, beginn-ing in 1906. Then, coming down 'to 1924, it says:
The rccornmendations of -the Par'iamentary
mnittee cf 1924 are as follows:

0Cor-

And it sets out four paragraplis taken from

the 1924 Committee's recommenda-tions. Now,
to a person who bas access t.o Parliamentary
records, or who is informed on a subjeet like
this,' the document might lie quite harmless;
but, put into the hands of the public, it was.
I feel. intended to impress upon the unioformed public mmnd the helief that the Parliament of Canada in 1924 delibecately commitfed itself to the establishment of n system
of old age pensions.
The Parliament of
Canada, or the flouse of Commons, or this
Chamber, did flot do that; in 1924. For some
reason or another, the vital paragraph of the
report of 1924 is omitted from. this officiai
do( ument; it is the paragraph which recom-

JUNE 8, 1926
mends thaît the Provincial Governments be
commun.icated with in order that it may be
ascertained whether or not they are disposed
to adopt the system. If the knowledge of that
were contained here, it would give the uninformed person, and the public generally, an
accurate idea of the situation. As it ..a, it
conveys an inaccurate impression.
Furthermore, in 1924, as has been statedI arn repeating here-the House of Commons
did not approve of the report. Ail thst House
did in 1924, on July 9th, was to pass a
resolution to the effect that the report and the
evidence should be printed in the Journals of
the House. It did flot commit itself, as
this officiaI report sugge*ts, in any manner or
form, to an old age pension systern. Obj ection was taken to that motion and one
honourable member desired to move an amnendment that the report be concurred in, but he
was not allowed to do so; he was ruled out of
order.
On July 16th, 1924, in response to one of the
advocates of an old age pension systern, the
Prime Minister of the Dominion made the
statement:
The report ai the Commîittee to which my honourable friand refers, I think, contenmplated that any
action by this Parliamant would be contingent upon
co-eperative action on the part oi the Provinces. The
Governinent intende, during the recess, to cornmunie
te the Provincial Governiments ithe report which the
Com.:ttee has brought clown and a.acertain for the
irâformation of Parliament what action, if any, they
are prepared to take with refarence to those recoinmandations.

That was the stand taken by the Goverument throuýgh the Prime Minister on July
16th, 1924. All. therefore, that wes done in
that year was to decide to communicate with
the Provincial Governments.
Then we come to 1925. The facto in that
respect have been related and I do not need
to repeat them. On June l7th of that year it
was moved by the Chairman of the Committee:
That the recommandations contained in the report
of the Old Âge Pensions Cosnmittee be conceurred in.

That motion carried, and, as honourab'e
members have been told, the report thu-s
adopted in 1925 simply recommended that
there should be a conference of the Provincial
Premiers on the subjeot. So, first, we have
a decision by the other House to communicate
with the Provincial Premiers; secondly. a decision to have a conference of the Provincial
Premiers. It has been etated that there was
no conference or no communication. I think
it is just as well to nail down that fa.ct, and
honourable members will find. if they refer
to the Debates of another place, that on May
28-

171

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
0f what year?
0f thi.s year-the
Hlon. Mr. TANNER:
Minister who was in charge of the Bill in
that Chamber was asked directly the question:
If in the interim, since this Bill was before the
Rlouge last there has been any attenapt macde by the
Goverrinent te interyiew anby of the Provincial Premiers
in regpect te co-oyperation in this measure.

The distinct and po.situive answer of the
Minister, Hon. Mr. King, is contained in one
word: "No." He was interrogated a littie
later, and on the ame page of the Debates
of the other place it will be found that when
lie wau told that the Provincial Premiers were
th-en coming to the city of Ottawa, he made
the rernark that the Provinces did not need
to avail themselves of the Bii-"2it is opitional
with thern." Then he said:
There would be nothing to bc gained at this time by
chasing arcund, trying te interview Provincial Premiers.

1 will not discuse what seemis to me to be
the rather undignified statement about "cha.sing
around" after Provincial Premiers. It seems
particularly undignified in view of the fact
that this proposed legisiation depends body
and soul upon the concurrence and co-operation of the Provincial Premiers. Yet the honourable Minister of the Crown who was
piloting this Bill through the other place
speaks ini that rather flippant mann-er in respect cf the Provincial Premiers, and say there
is nothîng to be gained by "chasing around"
after them. The only conclusion I arn ab'e
to come to-and I hope my honourable friend
the leader of the House may be able to
disabuse me of it-is that. while this Bill is
being presented, the honourable members of
the Government in the other House do not
care a button whether it passes or does not
pase; that, while they say they muet look
to the Provincial Governments and Leg:8latures to approve of it and adopt it, they
are quite indifferent, whether or not the Provincial Premiers, representing the bodies I
have mentioned, take the matter into consideration.
Those are ail the inatters, honourable gentlemen, that I have any intention of suggesting to the House. In conclusion, I 'have only
to say that the reasons which have already
been stated, and to which I have added. a few
remarks, make it very desirahle that arguments of a convincing character, if they are
available, should be addressed to this House
to show us why the Government have suddenly turned back fromn the policy of communicating with and consulting the Provincial
Governments--why they have abandcened the
policy definitely laid down by the Prime Min-

SENATE
ister himself a very short time ago, and why
there is now so much haste 10 bring iii and
pass, a Bill which invades the legisiative territory of the Provinces, and which 10 me
looks on]y like a hait to those Provincial
Legisiatures t0 draw themn into activities in
which they are very reluctant to take any part.
Hon. JOHN LEWIS: Honourable gentlemen, I do nol intend to touch upon the question of a possible conflict between the Dominion and the Provinces. I leave that to the
gentlemen who are learned in the law and
the Constitution.
A suggestion was made hy a member of this
honourable House that this Bill was the
resuit of a bargain between Labour members
,and the Government. If so, a large number
of that honourable gentleman*s political associates must have been party to tlie bargain,
for in iooking over the records I can find no
reference 10 any division in which the Labour
members and other supporters of the Goveroment wvere solidly arrayed on one side and the
Conservative members on the other; and two
at least of the strongest speeches in favour
of the Pensions Bill were made by Conservative members from my o'vn Province.
At ail events, so far as I am concerned,
my motive is net to please the Labour party
or any other party, ner any political motive;
my destire is s;impiy te advocate what I regard
as absoilute -social justice to the poorer, the
iess fortunate people of this country. I do
not regard the Bill at ail as a secialistic
nieaýzure or as a measure of charity. I put
il on preciseiy the samne basis as I wouid
put the pension to a jedge or a soldier, hecause I regardi a mechanie, .a factory worker,

My honourabie friend fromn Montarvîlie
(Hon. Mr. Beaubieni) raised the argument
that we shouid flot do this because we wouid
be interfering with t ho dutv of the family:
hoe said the son should provide for his father
and mother.
But he fairly answered that
argument himself wvben hie said that in many
cases sons xvere not able to provide for their
oid people, no malter how wiiling, but that
there were institution,,, in which those parents
couid be cared for.
The defect of ail those institutions, at ieast
those wit.h which I am acquainted, is that
they separate the famiiy, which is a cruel liardship, especiaily in the case of an old; man or
woman.

I jusc want te ask, how wouid you like to
be separated fromn your famiiy and put in an
Old Men's Home?
The benefit of those pensions, just as of
the mothers' pensions which are in vogue
in some Provinces, is that they keep the
family toge'ther. They aiiow the oid man 10
live bis iast days and close bis eyes in the
midst of the familiar scenes and faces about
him; and ne institution, ne malter how
kindiy conducted, cao take the place of a
man's ewn home in fliaî respect.
The objection was raised that this logisiatien wouid be unfair le seme Provinces as
against others, because the burd)en of the
bonefit wou*id be unequ-aily divided.
I do
net know of any legisiation that c.ouid be
passed by Ibis Parliainont which granted absolute]y equal benefits, or inposed equal
burdens upon ail the provinces.

this te be said, I think, in reforence te the
W/est and the East. Il is aiieged that this
is a western measure, and that the East is
opposed te it. At the samne lime il is said
by honourabie gentlemen on the other side,
and I have ne doubot il is substantiaiiy correct, thiat the newer Provinces centain a
larger proportion of young mon, and theoleder
Prov1inces a larger proportion of old mien and
%teomen. The effeet of that wouid be. if ail

is truc that each of tbem wouid have te pay

dees net go eut; it is simpiy a malter of
lransferring mýoney from the better-off peopie
te the poorer people. [Se far as the Federal
gra-nt is cencernied, the eastern Provinces are
likeiy te get the larger proportion of il than
the western.
It has been said that the Provinces eught
le have been censuited more fuiiy than lhey
have been, and Ihat their consent shoîîid have
been ebtained before théLs legisiation was Proposed.
Weii, that might have been a very
difficuit thing te do se long as the matter
was in the formo of a more abstract propositien. I lhink that the legisiation wiii have
a far better chance of being generalily adopted
whcn we have the actual statute te present

For these reasons, whiie I do net say that

The Commiittee went inte the matter very
fully; it hiad a good many witnenses, and a
grea,t xcany discuý,-ions; and on the l6th of
June it brotght clown its final report te the
Hou-e of Commons. In that report, it rocorumendod:

Right lion. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
And that report was brought befere the

Hon. Mr. CALDER: That report was
brougbt before the House, and unanimously
agreed te by the lieuse, as far as the record
is concerned. But what bas taken place? lins
any such conferonce been beld? None at al].
Has there been any reference sine that tirne
te the Provinces?
Net se far as we are
aware. In aIl the discu6sion wc have had
bore I have heard nothing said about any
further reference te the Provinces. Well, it
is rather odd te me, it is very strange indeed,
that, after ail those people considered this
qtuestion, and satv ahl the difficulties i11 connection with it, they could net. agree upon a
system at al; they saw aIl the perplexities
and cliffletîltipe chat wotîli arise on accounit of
varying conditions, various viewts as te what
should be done in this cennection, and they
said in effeet: "This, essentially, is a Provincial matter; tve should net proceed with
this, we sh*ould bring nothing into the lieuse
of Commons uintil these Premiers get together
and debate this matter, and corne to a coniclusion as te what should be donc with it.'
Tlîat. haýs nover been done, and hore we arc
confronted with a piece of legislation that I
dare say will net satisfy any two Provinces
in Canada.
Lot me say. further. that, while we are
discussing this Bill new, there is a conferenco
of Provincial Premiers in thiis citx- at the
preseut tinte. Those mon surely should be
willing te stay over bore for two or three
days anyway. Why in the world is net thi-s
legislation put before thcm, right now? Thoy
have net been callod together: they are bore.
I mnean that they sbould be cailed before txe
are asked te pass this legislation or put our
stamp cf approval on it. It is a matter that
affects the Provinces essentially. XVhy should
not this opportunity ho taken right now te
put this question before the Provincial
Premiers, and a,ýk for their appreval? I think
it should ho done. We should net ho forced
te decide this question without consideration
of that kind being given.
Now I wish te read the attitude taken by
the present Primo Minister cf my own Province cf Saskatchewan when this matter was
refcrred te hinu.
The statoment bas been
made that this is a western queostion. Well,
it is net as much a weistern as an easýterl
question. In the province of Saskatchewan
we are net troubled with the old age problem
as much as the big centres cf Eastern Canada
are. W 0 have practically ne old age pension
question on our hands in Saskatchewan, aud

175

JUNE 8, 1926
have neyer had. I have ilived in that province for 20 or 30 years, and we have neyer
had any difficuity with that question at ail;
there has been no agitation over it, no demand
for it; it was neyer even broached in our
legislature when I was -there. Memibers who
corne fromi Sss-katchewan know thEat what I
îsay is perfectly true. When you speak of
this as a western problemn, I would say, get
that idea out of your head, hecause we are
freer frorn the necessity of action in this
regard in Western Canada than you are in
Eastern Canada. So that in that sense it is
nlot a western problem at ail. It is a western
problem in the sense that certain people out
West agitate for this sort of thing, but as
for being a problem in which the great mas
of our people are interested I simply say it
is not.
Now let me read the reply that was sent
to the Committee by Mr. Gardiner, who at
that tirne, I think, was Minister of Municipal
Affairs, and who is at present Prime Minister
of the Province of Saskatchewan. And 1 have
nlot any hesitation in saying that when ho
sent this reply ta the Committee it was only
after the matter had been thoroughly thrashed
out in Council and had the approval of the
present Minister of Railways, who, 1 understand, piloted this Bill through in another
place. You will remember that the 1924
report suggested that communication should
be had with ail the Provinces. This came out
in 1925, and I presui*me there was no further
communication from the Province. of Saskatchewan, as there was none drom the other
Provinces who gave evasive answers. Let
us see what Mr. Gardiner said. On November
19, 1924, the Minister of Labour and Industries, as hie was at that tirne, writes:
The Goveruiment of Saskatchewan is of opinion that
an oid age pension achemfne for Canada cao bast be
adopted by the Faderai Governanent alone.

"One scheme ta apply ta ail those Provinces
is practically impossible," which means, if it
means anything, that sueh a acheme must be
Provincial.
AÇnd it will be readily understood that if any tomber of the Provinces were to remain out, it would ha
almost impossible to adopt any acharne that would
not atibject t>hose Provinces within the arrangement
to considerable expense that should rightfully be
borne by those outside the acherna.

In other words, the Province ai Saskatchewan raised exactly the objections that have
been raised in this debate.
Wbile we are diapnsed to th.ink thât an nid age pans:on schemne sbould be undertaken, the difficulties in
the way of the suggested soheme appear almoat, if
ot entirely insurenountable.

Now lot uis see what the Province of Aiberta, another western Province, says-I will
quote only part of it:
We are ot prepared, however, to accept the reconmendat ions of tbe Committee.

This is Mr. Hoadley, spoaking for the Province of Alberta.
The three main objections are:
(1) We believe that tbe Faderai Governmant should
assume a larger share in the financing of an nid age
pension scbeme, as it is more a Faderai obl:gation
than s Provincial on.

I do not agree with him on that. At any
rate, hie says the Federal Governmant should
more largoly finance the acharne.
(2) We are not satisfied

In othor words, hie says we should vory
carefully consider the question of whether or
not those who are ta benefit should during
their lifetime contribute. That is the point
raised by the Leader oi this aide of the House.
(3) There l o guarantee that the Faderai Gnvarnment would continua for a definite tume to carry out
the «nutual arrangements witli respect to financing tha
scheme.

That means that there is na flnality in
connoction with it.
There is no co-oyperation there. Ho says
Now, honourable gentlemen, I arn not going

trespasses upon Provincial jurisdiction. The
Senate, as I understand it, is specially charged
with the protection of minorities and with
the responsibility of seeing that the Constitution is fairly carried out as between the
Federal power and the Provincial authorities.
Therefore anything that even indirectly entrenches upon the political field should, and
will no doubt, receive the careful consideration of this House.
I think that at the present time this is illadvised legislation. My reason for thinking
that has been already stated, but I will state
it in my own words. This is to be a partnership between the Federal authority and
the Provincial authorities, if it is to be anything at all. It is either a gift to the Provinces, or is it a responsibility, a burden, upon
them. One thing is certain: the Provinces
have not asked for it. I doubt the wisdom of
offering a gift to a man if he has not asked
for it, does not want it, and may not thank
you for it. If it is to be a partnership, then
I think the other parties should be consulted.
If I decided to ask a man to come into business with me, I do not think it would be
reasonable for me to lay down all the conditions, to arrange everything, and when I
had all arranged to ask him to sign on the
dotted line. A Committee appointed by the
Commons recommended that the Provincial
Premiers be consulted, and the Committee's
recommendation was unanimously adopted by
the House of Commons. I think Parliament
should be careful, and should even consider
the susceptibilities of the Provinces before
passing legislation that in large measure, if
not altogether, entrenches on their jurisdiction.
There is another reason why I cannot support this legislation. The Maritime Provinces

financial position to enable them to do it.
Apparently Quebec does not want it. I do not

that the West does not want it.
Hon. Mr. COPP: They need not take it,

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: My honourable friend
to my left says they need not take it. Why,

sue, and this body at least, the Senate of
Canada, should not, in my judgment, concur in such legislation, under all the circumstances.
Some of the honourable gentlemen who
have spoken this evening have expressed themselves in favour of the principle of old age
pensions. They have not, however, said
whether they would favour any legislation by
the Federal Government. I infer that they
would not-that they would oppose any legislation on that subject by the Federal
authorities; that they consider it belongs entirely to the Provinces and that the Provinces
should deal with it. If that is the attitude of
these honourable gentlemen, they are quite
consistent. If it is not the attitude they take
-if they think that it is a proper subject for
the Parliament of Canada to legislate upon,
then in my opinion the honourable member
who has just spoken has taken the most
logical position, that this Bill should get the
second reading and then be referred to Committee, and any objectionable features in it
there eliminated.
For my own part, I oppose it. I intend
voting against the second reading, for the
reasons that I have given. I think that a
matter of this kind should be entirely under
the jurisdiction of the Provinces, and that
after a conference with the Provinces, if the
Parliament of Canada thought well to implement whatever the Provinces might do in the
matter, then that would be another feature
of the case that might well be considered on
its merits. As the Bill stands now, I intend
voting against the second reading.
Hon. GEORGE GORDON: Honourable
gentlemen, to-day Canada is staggering under
an immense liability, created mostly by the
war and by the railways, and for this reason
the Government cannot afford to be extremely
generous, but should run the business affairs
of the country on business principles. I believe
that until the time comes when Canada can
afford to abolish or make a radical eut in the
income tax, it is not in a position to be very
generous. I am going to vote against the
second reading of this Bill because, in the
first place, I believe that Canada cannot afford
it, and, in the second place, because there is
no demand from the Provinces for iuch a
measure. Having said this much, I think that
I have said enough to justify me in voting
against the Bill, particularly when I believe
that practically all the reasons which have
been given here to-day by members opposing
it are sound and well-advised.

JUNE 8, 1926
Hon. JOHN McdLEAN: Honourable gentlemen, I agree with what My honourable
friend on the other side of the House (Hon.
Mr. Hughes) said a few moments ago with
reference to Prince Edward Island. When
that province came into Confederation it had
a population of 106,000. That population has
decreascd from year to year until at the
present time it has only about 86,000. You
can understand, honourable gentlemen, that
it is flot the old that have been moving out;
it is the young and vigourous that have gone
to the West, to the United States, and to
other places. On Prince Edward Island. A
hospital for the insane was bulit at a cost of
something like $200,000. An infirmary for
the old and infirm was huilt alongside of it,
on a beautiful site. There are about 100
patients in that institution now. In the case
of everyone who has applied, or for whom
application fias been made, up to the present
time, and who has been considered eligible
by the clergymen or others who knew the
situation best, it has been found quite satisfactory to put him into, that institution. No one
has been refused. Now that Prince Edward
Island bas this infirmary, I would ask what
the Federal Government would do. Would
they buy that and take it off the hands of
the Provincial authorities, or would they
make the people of Prince Edward Island
contribute perhaps three times as much as
they are contributing now? They are contributing for about 320 in the asylum and
about 108 in the infirmary; they are contributîng to tlhe institution for the blind at
Halifax; and they are contributing for the
deaf and dumb. They are carrying along
these undertakings with their limited income.
It would take at least one-haif of the revenue
of the Island to keep up this scheme if they
came into it. I do not think it would satisfy
any person on Prince Edward Island, whatever
his polities might be. For this reason I intend
voting against the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Honourable gentlemen, 1 have listenedRight Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: Is
my honourable friend closing the debate?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

Right Hon. Sir GE~ORGE E. FOSTER:
Then, if he wiIl allow me, I shaîl take but
a short time. I intend saying a word or two
with regard to the reason why I am giving
my vote.
The ground has been travelled
over moat thoroughly, and nearly all the
points, I think, have been taken up; but it
is probably very true, as has been stated by
14015-12J

179

one speaker here, that there will be criticism,
and if one give-s a silent vote he may be
placed by publie opinion in a category to
which he does not belong. That does not
trouble me now as muoh as it used to many
years ago. But I have general objections to
this rneasure. In the first pla.ce, I do not see
how the Goverument can with any decency
crawl out of the position in which it voluntarily placed itself by the appointment of
the Comxnittee, by the approval of its
report., by the statement in perfectly plain
English of the Prime Minister that it was
the purpose of the Government to have a conference, obtain a report from that conference
and bring it before Parliament, before legislatiosi was introduced. Surely the Government must respect its preceding actions and
the statements of is head, and the combined
statement which was made by the action
taken in the House of Commons itself. How
is the Government going to recondile itself
to that position?
So I say that, in the first place, I arn
apposed Wo this Bill, as it is introduced,
because it is not based upon the best and
most thorough investigation that could
possibly be given the matter. The Goviernment having made is statement with reference Wothe legîsiation, comes now, without
any advance upon or inerease in that information, and preeents a Bill which it asks us
to enact into law.
I am opposed to it, in the second place,
because I do not think it is just or fair. The
constitution-al question ie, I think, as clear as
can be. If this Parliament, under the tuition
of the Government, chooses to maie a gift
to one Province, or to all Provinces, I think
that, if it legislates so as not to impose an
obligation on the Province Wo
which it makes
the gif t, the legislation is within its power.
But is it expedient or wise Wopass such legislation? My chief objection in this instance
is that it follows out what is a growing and
vicious tendency in our polities, namely, the
invasion by one Govermnent of the territory
of another, or the duplication of what has
been done, by the other for a series of years.
Seem.ingly the purpose is none other than to
make party capital. That has been donc over
and over again in the Dominion of Canada.
Provinces have duplicated what the Dominion
Govern-nent was doing well-why? In order
to make credit and gain support for themselves. And Dominion Governments have
invaded the territory and duplicated the work
that Provinces have been doing well, and for
no other reason that can be given than that
they desired to have the glory, the honour

180

SENATE

and the support which came from that kind
of legislation.
If one is allowed to speak of a neighbouring legislature, I do not think that there is
a more interesting piece of work going on at
the present time than what is taking place in
the neighbouring country, the Republic to
the south of us. At Washington, in these
very months, it is as plainly apparent as it
can be that consideration of the public weal
and benefit are thrown to the background, if
not entirely submerged, under the desire to
construct the platform which will put the
party properly and most strongly before the
country in the coming elections. That same
political tendency is shown in democratic
countries everywhere, and so long as that is
not curbed, and in proportion as it grows
and the strife and duplication continue, you
will have confusion and you will be marching every day closer and closer to the failure
of democratic institutions. I think that safety
is to be found only in each parliamentary
power confining itself as closely as possible to
the limits of its own constitutional territory
and respecting the constitutional territory and
limits of the provincial or state powers which
are under it.
Therefore I ask myself the question: in
Heaven's name, why has the present Government displayed such hectic haste in bringing
this legislation before Parliament in order to
fasten upon this country an initial expense of
$25000,000 which, once started. will grow until

a contribution from the ultimate recipient of

it runs into hundreds of millions of dollars?
Are we so flush with money to-day that the
Government will go out of its way in order to
introduce and carry legislation which will add
to rather than subtract something from the
burdens which this country is carrying? It
makes very little difference whether that $25,000,000 and more is entirely met by the
Federal Government, or whether it is partly
met by the Provincial Governments. It is
something abstracted from the earnings of the
people, and from the broad national point of
view and the economic standpoint it makes
very little difference from which treasury it
comes. It will come out of the earnings of
the people of this country, and surely the
present is a time when we ought to be thinking of easing those burdens rather than
adding to them. So I think that it is inopportune, inexpedient and absolutely unwise
to undertake this legislation in this manner
to-day.
I am just touching point after point. I am
opposed to any system of pensions, old age or
otherwise, unless you can add the element of

remuneration for the work which he does that
he shall get annually so much from the
country which employs him, and that at the

the pension. I think that is healthy and wise.
In this Bill there is not the least suspicion of
going back, or of placing the Bill upon that
principle.

My honourable friend avowed his

preference for a principle of that kind, but
has not embodied it in the Bill. Search that
Bill through from beginning to end, and you
find nothing which gives a guarantee that a
pension is paid to a recipient who has carned
it by an industrious life, a moral life, a life
which has respected law and order. The man
who gets $20 a month under this Bill may be
one who bas graduated in every criminal profession in the country, who has paid his penalties or escaped them, and if he has lived to be
70 years of age and has fulfilled the conditions
as to residence, he gets his pension exactly

the same as does the man who has been
industrious and moral, who has respected the

law, who has done his part zealously and
honestly to make the country better. That is
the only claim on which he ought to get a
pension.
I do not quite agree with my honourable

friend from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Lewis) who
says that the labouring man, the man who
labours with his head or hands in any way,

has just as good a right to a pension from the
country as has a judge. I think there is a
difference. We appoint a jiidge to do certain

work for the publ-ic.

He undertakes

that

work; he takes the salary, not always of
the highest, and does that work for the public
for 10, 20 or 30 years. It is a part of his

end, when he is out of duty, he shall have a
moderate pension. The same applies to the

civil servants.

The banks also do that for

their employees, but they do not go out and
give a pension to a man who is not their
employee.

So there is a difference in the basis, and I
think we must recognize that difference. One
often hears it said: " Why not give a pension

to the labouring man, who comes to a certain
age and cannot work any more, the same as
you give to a judge or a civil servant?" But
the bases are absolutely different. These have
been employed by the Government and have
done the work for the Government, representing the public, and in their salary and
pension they are getting remuneration for it.
But the other man bas not been employed by
the public; he has been employed by himself
for his own purposes, his own gain, his own
living; and while he may have made a very
valuable contribution te the country in the

182

SENATE

all men who reached 70 years of age, and
who were in need of a pension-those men
who had not been able to save such a capital
as would give them $365 a year.
The right honourable gentleman saw quite
well that the state should take care of the
civil servants. He realized that there was
a relation existing between the Civil Service
and the state, represented by Parliament;
also that the banks and other large corporations provide for their employees, because
there was a contact between the employees
and the patron or employer. But lie could
not sec the same relation between the man
who works down below, at the basis of the
triangle which forms society, and his employers, as he secs in men who come into
more personal contract with their employers.
I desire to stress a little this expression of
opinion, and to labour it somewhat and
sec where we divide.
Yes, we members of Parliament feel that
we must do something for the man who
works for the state, throughout the departments, and under this roof, because there is
that human element and personal contact.
Yes, the corporations who employ officials
feel, through that personal contact, that they
must do the fair thing by them when they
are in illness, and when they reach old age.
It is just because between the masses, the
men who labour, the men who are in the
rain, yet who may be in sheer want and
starvation by reason of lack or delay of
employment, and their employers there is
not that personal contact, that there is the
greater need for such provision as is made
in this Bill.
Think, I say, of the difference between
these masses of workers and those men whom
the right honourable gentleman has mentioned as being entitled to that measure of
sympathy from the employer-those who are
not in the rain; who from day to day attend to their duties from nine o'clock until
five; who may ýbe sick or may feel ill at case,
or somewhat under the weather, but who are
allowed a holiday; who know that to-morrow they will have their salary, and that
they will always have it. They are employees of the state or of a bank. They
know what that human contact means. They
know that the employer is a human being
with a heart in his breast who will do the
right thing by them.
Think of the difference between the masses
and those men whom the right honourable
gentleman has declared to be entitled to
a pension in their old age because of that
personal contact; who have been all their
lifetime every morning walking to their
offices, who have donc their day's work, and
Ion. Mr. DANDURAND.

who feel that they can return in the evening
to their homes, convinced that on the morrow they will go back to ýthat employment.
Yes, they are safe in their employment. They
realize the continuity of their employment.
They are not threatened by the thought that
next week or next month they may receive
notice that their work has ceased.
My right honourable friend says that all
those men are justly entitled to fair consideration from the employer, but the masses,
the men on the farms and in the shops, the
men who build this country, have not that
personal contact. Before mechanism came
into this world, work was done by little
groups under the eye of the employer, or in
small shops under the eye of the patron.
There was then that human feeling between
them. But now thousands of men are brought
within four walls; the Board of Directors is
far distant, the manager is far away from
then, and yet they do their toiling; they
work for the wbole country. These are the
men working in various construction works,
and in various directions building up this
country, and aIso working on the land as
farn hands. These are the men who build
up the cities, but they have not that personal
human contact of the employer by their side.
To-day democracy feels that it must do
something for them and take the place of the
employer of those men who have not the
benefit of that personal contact. That is why
various Parliaments have been prompted to
do something for them. We have it in Great
Britain; we have it in Australia and in New
Zealand, new countries like our own. We are
told there is no demand. No, there is no
demand from those who have no need; but,
as the ex-Minister of Labour knows, the trade
and labour unions, who have tiat personal
contact with the man who works in the street
and in all kinds of weather, have for a number of years clamoured for that help.
Now, I should like to refer to a Royal
Commission which was appointed by my
right honourable friend (Sir George E.
Foster) and bis colleagues in 1919.
That
Commission, which was composed of Hon.
Mr. Justice Mathers, as Chairman, Mr. Carl
Riordon, Charles R. Harrison, Tom Moore
and John W. Bruce, made the following
recommendation:
We recommend inimediate inquiry by expert board
into the following subjects, with a view to early
legislation:
'State insurance against unemployment, sickness, invalidity and old age.

Then, following that report, there was a
National Industrial Conference which was
presided over by my honourable friend the

JUNE 8, 1926

in the very halïs of Parliament, in the Senate
of Canada, where, ini addition to the Minister of Labour, there were the following
representatives of the Government of Canada.

Arthur L. Sifton, Minister of Public Works.
There were also present the followimg rerpreentativoe

The Provincial Governments were there,
also employers and employees, and a recommendation was adopted unanimously and
signed by W. R. Rollo, Henry Bertram, W. E.
Segsworth, Kathleen Derry, J. S. McLean,
R. C. McCutcheon, F. H. Whitton, G. Frank
Beer, as follows:

The House of Commons bas for many years
examined into thip question. Committees
have been appointed which worked for weeks
upon this problem. Surely there must be a
cause for ail this urging, ail these appeals.
When we see other countries moving in the
samne direction, is it flot natural that the
Government of this country should interest
itself in the question? Now we are told:
"But last year there was a report which suggested that the Prime Ministers of the Provinces should be called in conference, and the
Prime Minister of the Dominion said that he
would have that conference during the reces
and would corne beffore thifi Parliament with
the results of their deliberations." But there
was no conference; there was a dissolution of
Parliament. We are now a new Parl-iament.
My right honourable friend (Right Hon.
Sir George E. Foster) says, "We have not had
a square deal." But what is the function of
the Senate if it is not to examine into the
measures that corne before it from the House
of Commons? The Prime Minister and the
leaders of tihe other parties in this country
had no promises to make to the Senate of
Canada. They 'had to try to satisfy publie

183

opinion. So the C4ovemnment decided that it
would bring a concrete Bill before Parliament
in order to submit to it the will of the people
of Canada crystallized into an Act. And why
does the Government dispense with the confirmatiion of the Prime Ministers of the Provincesq? It is because various answers have
been received from tlye various Provinces
which inake it apparent that it is impossible
for the Provincial Premiers to agree upon a
formula which would combine ail their views.
The <3overnment now says: "This is wh&t
Parliament is remdy to, do to help the various
Provinces." It does noV coerce them, but
simply states what it is ready Vo do; knowing
that there could be no uniformity otherwise,
it has brought down tVMs MI. It may have
been wrong, but there is a presumption that
it is right.
This Bill bas behind it the unanimous man'date of the House of Commons, and I was
sAurprised Vo hear one or two honoursible
gentlemen say that it was the conception, the
'wîll and the work of two members of Parliament w'hose support the Oovernmnent needed.
We ail recogn-ize that it is dangerous to attribute motives. As the hionourable gentle1man £rom Prince Edward Island who sits
behind me (Hon. Mr. Hughes) says, how is
it that those two memnbers would hiavesuch
an influence not only upon the Goverrinent
but upon the whole of their colleagues in tjhe
House of Commons? I take it for granted
that those who are not supporter of the
Government in the other House acted in al
sincerity. If that is so, does not this Bill
corne here with a formidable endorsationa Governmnent Bill supported by ail the opponents of the Goverament in the other
House? If anyone dared suspect the sincerity
of those gentlemen, would not the fact that
they voted for VMis legislation be an evidence
that there was a very strong feeling in support
of the measure, inasmuch as in doing so they
did not express «heir own views?
I take it for granýted that members of the
House of Gommons without any exception
feel that there should be a movement of
sympathy made towards the Voiler. Men have
been rich and have corne down; men have
been thrifty for years, and have deposited
their money in te Home Bank, or with men
in whom Vthey had confidence, and have lost
their all; men have been unlucky. But these
men have brought up families of five or teli
children; and, as I said when I opened the
'discussion, we have tens of thousands of meni
'Of seventy years of age Who feel that they
are dependent upon their relatives or otjbes,
and that they are a Iburden, and they sometimes wonder if there is not in the minds of

SENATE

those who support them the hope that their
lives will soon end. This is what we see
all around us. But I will not stress the point.
The Senate is here to examine all measures
that come from the House of Commons;
but I say that when there is a movement
throughout the world in favour of those men
who have not had t4ie opportunities enjoyed
by honourable gentlemen within the sound
of my voice, such a movement must be commended. A majority of this Chamber may
believe that the time is not opportune for
the presentation of this measure, or they may
not approve of the form of it; but I believe
that the fact that it is presented here with
the unanimous endorsation of the other House
merits for it a fair measure of consideration
frorn the members in this House.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand for the
second reading of the Bill was negatived on
the following division:

SOLDIER SETTLEMENT BILL
REFERRED

BILL

READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 148, an Act for the purpose
of establishing in Canada a system of Long
Term Mortgage Credits to Farmers. He said:
Honourable gentlemen, the passage of this
Bill will bring Canada into line with a movement, almost world-wide, to provide cheaper
mortgage credit for the agricultural industry
than is available through the ordinary loaning
agencies.
1. Mortgage Credit in Europe.
In Europe, loaning institutions operated or
encouraged by the State have existed for
many years.
Germany.
In Germany, a system of co-operative farm
mortgage associations dates back to the latter
half of the eighteenth century and has developed in'to a system of great strength
having loans outstanding in 1920 of nearly
$1,000,000.000 (at par).
The associations are composed solely of
borrowers whose mortgages are collectively
held as security for farm mortgage bonds
sold to the public.
There is joint, and
practically unlimited, liability on the part
of borrowers for the payment of interest and
redemption of principal of the bonds so that
the bonds are marketable at low rates of
interest. In addition to these co-operative
associations there are in Germany Mortgage

JUNE 8,1926
Credit Banks established under State or Provincial authority and issuing bonds guaranteed
by such authority. The proceeds of the sale
of bonds are loaned on farm mortgage or to
municipalities.
There are also Savings Banks managed by
public authorities which loan their funds
received as savings deposits on farm and other
mortgages.
France.
In France, we have the Crédit Foncier, a
joint stock company, but subject to strict
control, especially as to interest rates, by the
Government of France. This institution
issues its bonds to the public and loans on
mortgage at a rate not exceeding 6/10 of one
per cent in excess of the bond rate. The
borrowings by way of bonds cannot exceed
twenty times the capital of the company. The
mortgage rate is about 5 per cent. The capital
is 250,000,000 francs.
Great Britain.
Until recent years long term mortgage
credit has been regarded as a field for private
enterprise, but in the Agricultural Credits
Act of 1923, there is provision for long termi
loans to farmers purchasing farm lands at
rates of interest fixed by the Treasury. This
Act has however been largely inoperative.
Since the passage of the 1923 Act, further
inquiry and investigation into the question
has been made and a Report on the inveetigation by Mr. R. R. Enfield has been issued
by the Ministry of Agriculture a few months
ago. This report contains the following:
Great Britain occupies an aimost unique position
in having no standard machinery of long terni agricultural credit based on farm mortgages-with the
exception of the restricted machinery provided un-ler
Section 1 olf the Agricultural Creite Act, 1923.
Farmers in the past have obtained mortgages on their
ferme from solicitom, banks and others, but have
always felt some uncertainty as to period such loans
will be allowed to run, and there has been no uniform
method of redenption, which has proved in many
cases to have acted detrimentally upon farming
practice.
To provide credit for the purchase of farma or the
execution of "permanent" improvements, it is proposed to apply the principle of the Mortgage Credit
institutions in Gemany or of the Federal Land Banka
or Joint Stock Land Banka in Ainerica.
It is proposed that a Central Land Bank should be
established, the object of which would be to make
long termi nortgage loans through the joint stock
banks and their branches, and to raise money for the
purpose by the issue of ddbentures to the public.
The Bank should be governed by a Board of Directors and should be empowered to lend money up te a
prescribed period, secured upon a firet mortgage upon
agricultural land and buildings. It should be empowered to issue debentures to the pdblic based upon
these mortgages, up te a fixed multiple of its capital

185

and surplus funds, thus creating a recognired means
through which capital might be invested in agri-

culture. .. ...

The chneme cf tha Central Land Bank should have
the following advantages:
(a) It would establish for the firat time in this
country a uniform standard system of long tern mortgage credit for agriculture.
(b) It would give new facilities to farners who wish
to purchase their holdings, by providing mortgage
credit et a reasonable rate of interest, in a standard
and universally applicable form, and free from the
risk of unexpected foreclosure.
(c) It would create a standard agricultural investment, thus opening up a new channel through which
capital could enter agriculture.
(d) It would be administered through the joint stock
aanks and would have the benefit of their knowledge
and experience; it would be simple and secret.

Other European Countries.
Mortgage systems in other countries in
Europe are for the most part modelled after
the German or French systems so that it is
unnecessary to describe them in detail. The
significant fact is that some such system has
been found necessary and advantageous for
the farming industry in practically every
modern country.
2. Mortgage Credit in Other British
Colonies.
Australian Commonwealth.
In Australia, most of the farm mortgage
systems are operated by the State Governments although assistance is given by the
Commonwealth to the States in connection
with the Returned Soldiers Settlement Act.
Western Australia has had a farm loan
bank since 1895. Mortgages are limited to
£2,000 and run for 30 years.
Queensland makes loans to farmers as
individuals and also to co-operative associamanufacturing farm
in
tions engaged
machinery, and other equipment. Interest
is payable at a rate of 5 per cent and mortgages run for 20 years.
South Australia has passed five or six
different Acts providing for farm mortgages,
the maximum amount of advances authorized
varying from £50 to £5,000.
Victoria has a State Savings Bank with a
farm mortgage department making loans up
to a maximum of £2,000 and authorized to
sell farm loan bonds to the public. The
interest rate is 5 per cent and mortgages run
for 40 years.
New South Wales has a similar bank with
similar power&
New Zealand.
State loans to farmers in New Zealand
date back over thirty years under various
Acts, but in 1923 the "State Advances Act"
combined them all in one. Loans under this
Act are made on the security of farm first

mortgages, the maximum Joan being £2,000
bu~t flot exceeding sixty per cent of the value
of the property. The interest rate is 5 per
cent and the amortization payTnent 1 per cent.
making the gross rate 6 per cent to repay the
loan with ipterest in 361 years. Partial repayments in advance of instalments are permitted without penalty. Loaning- funds are
obtained direct fromn the State whýicb is
authorized to borrow for the purpose, withi
limitations, at a rate flot exceeding 5 per cent.
As the loaning rate is also 5 per cent it is
apparent that the cost of administration falis
upon the State. Loans outstanding exceed
£7,000,000.
Union of South Africa.
Since 1912 the Union bas had a Federal
System of farm. mortgages under a Central
Board but with branches in eacb of the constituent former states making up the Union.
As the conditions under this system are probably more like the proposed Canadian syste'm
than those of the other colonies, the results
of the operation of the sy.ýtem may be looked
at in some detail.
The system is operated by the Land and
Ag-ricultural Bank of South Af rica, established
in 1912 and taking over from somewhat
similar state banks a capital of about
£2.700,000.
Since thon its capital has inereased by contributions from the Union until
at December 31, 1924 it stood at about
£7,700,000 or $38,000,000.
In addition it bias
deposits and outstanding bills amounting to
about £300,000.
The average rate paid by the Bank to, the'
State on its funds is about 4ý' per cent. The
rate of interest on loaw. is 6 per cent. Prior
to 1921 the rate ivas 5 per cent. Tbe average
rate for tbe year 1924 wa. approximately 5-ý
per cent.
Outstanding boans to individuals at December 31, 1924 amounted to £7,900,000 and to
co-operative societies and companies £700.000
making a total of £8,600.000 or say $41,000,000.
The Bank started in 19,12 witb a reserve of
£76.000 whieb bas been added to every year
until it now stands at £620,»0 or over 8 per
cent of the capital.
Hon. Mr. BrELCOURT: Would the rates
include both capital and interest? 1 refer to

0f the interest earned in the year £52,945
was past due at December 31, 'but of these
arrears it is stated that £22,462 was collected
before Feb. 19, 1925, leaving £32,116 in armaurs or approximately 7 per cent of tbe
interest earned. Interest overdue more tban
one year is apparent'ly not oarried into the
aceounits. As to this tbe report states:
A statement of all amounts that were overdue more
than a year aL December 31, 1924 bas been laid before
Parliament. Thse amount is adanittedly large, but in
view of ail the circumstamees, tise board regards
tise pSition as satisfactory.

Real estate on hand at December 31, 1924,
appears at £8,240.
Sales proceedings were
taken diîring the year in fifty-four cases. In
forty of these tbe properties sold for more
thqn the Bank's cdaim, and' of the balance
taken over, nine were sold at a profit and
five beld for sale.
The total' number of
properties sold since 1912 is 2,53. The average
amount of ba«n is about £600.

Tbe Bank is managed by a Managing
Director and a Central Board composed of a
Chairman and five other members alI appointed by the Governor General. The Head
Office is in Pretoria, but local boards for advisory purposes are establisbed in areas as
follows:

JUNE 8, 1926
For the Cape-Western Area, at Cape
Town.
For the *Cape-Eastern Ares, at, Port

For the Orange Free State Area, at Bloemfontein, and
For the Natal Area, at Pietermaritzburg.
Each local board is nomýinated by the Govcrnor General. At December 31, 1923, the
tota;l staff of the Bank numbered 79.
, IMortgage Credit ini the Uniited States.
A number of States of the United States
have for some years operated mortgage boan
departments or Boards, but as the operations
of these have been somewhat overshadowed
by the Fedieral Farm Loan system, upon
which. our Bill is to some extent modýelled,
it is necessary to consider miainly the Federal
Act !and the results attained up to date.
The Federal Farm. Loan Act of the United
States wu. passed on July 17, 1916 as a resuit of reports made in 1913 by two Coinmissions, one appointed by Congrew and
one representilng the Southern Commercial
Congress, which, investigated rural credit sysLoaning
teins in Europe and elsewhere.
undier the Act commenced in 1917 so that the
system is now in its tenth year of operation.
The Act authorizes the appointment of the
Federal Elarmn Loan Board composedi of the
Secretary of the Treasury as chairman and
ex-officio member, and, six other members al
appointed by the Preaidý-nt. This Board is
supervisory only. The detailed. administration of the Act is vested in twelve Federal
Farm Loan Banks each opriating ia prescribed states and together covering the entire
nation. These banks are located in Springfield, Mass., Baltimore, Columbia, S. C. Louisville, New Orleans, St. Louis, Wichita, Kan.,
Omaha, St. Paul, Spokane, Berkeley, and
Houston.
The Banks are managed by boards of
directors of seven memibers, three of whom
are* appointed by representatives of the borrowers, three by the Farm Loan Board and
a seventh by the Farm Loan Board -on the
nominlation: of representatives of the borrowers.
Each bank received at the outset from the
$750,000) of
approximately
Governîment
capital or about 89,000,000 in ail free of interest and repayable from time too time out
of earnings.
This capital is increased, as
loans are made by 5 per cent of the boans,
deducted from the advances and repaid when
the loan is finally discharged, in the meantime credited with such dividendîs as may
be declared by the directors. The hank is
authorized to seli its -bonds to the public to
the maximum amount of twenty times its
paid capital.

187

Loans are flot macle by the Bank direct to
individuai borrowers. Prospective -borrowers
are required to associate themselves to the
numiber of 10 or more in National Farm Loan
Associations of which. nearly 5,000 have been
incorporated. Borrowers must subecribe and
pay 5 per cent of their boans to the capital
stock of their association and becomne contingently liable for an assessment of another
5 per cent. Before the Bankc will grant a
loan to any borrower, is application must
be guaranteed by his Association and the
Association must subseribe and, pay 5 per cent
of the loan to the capital stock of the Bank.
In practice the Bank after approving the
application of the borrower endorsed by his
Association, adivances 95 per cent of the boan
authorized to the Association, the other 5
per cent being credited to the Association as
capital of the Bank. The Association thereupon advances to the borrower the amount
received by it from the Bank and at the
some time credits the borrower with 5 per
cent of boan as capital of the Association.
The resuît is that while individual borrowers
are not shareholders of the Bank, their Associations are, and they, as shareholders of the
Associations will receive through the Association such dividends as are declared .by the
banks upon the 5 per cent of their boans, less
any portion of such dividends as may ba
absorbed by the Association for expenses.
It will be seen that the principle on which
these banks are formed is that of co-operation with, and to a limited extent collective
liability on the part of the borrowers. It
therefore partakes somewhat of the nature
of German land banks.
It was realized,
however, that, muny borrowers would not
participate in such a system and the Act
therefore authorizes the incorporation of
Joint Stock Land Banks with a -minimum
capital of $250,000, operating largely free
from the restriction of 'the Board and authorized to issue bonds to the extent of fifteen
times tiheir paid capital. These Banks boan
direct to borrowers with any capital subscription or contingent liabiýlity by the 'borrow 'ers.
They charge somew'hat h.igher rates of interest and make larger boans than. the Land
Bankcs and profits go to the shareholders. They
resemble more nearly thxe Crédit Foncier in
France.
The foregoing organizations deal with longterni mortgage teredit.
The Act also deals
with shorter term credit, and authorizes the
formation of Intermediate Credit Banks. As
our Bill deals only with long term credit, it le
unneeessary to deal with the Intermediate
Credit section of the United States system.

Farmi lan bonds are is.sued at a nominal 4à
per cent rate but at prosýent tbey command a
market price ta bring the yield rate to 41
per cent or less. Ail the bonds are exempt
from Foderal iState and Municipal taxation.
This feature no doubt is largely responsible for
the favourablo intorest rate on farm. mortgages
under the system.
The reports of tbe Board indicate that the
National Farmn Loan Associations tend ta become inactive once the carlier membe-rs bave
ohtained thoir loans and that a very large
proportion do nlot bold even thoir annual
meetings. It bas also been cbargcd that some
of the Associations made excessive inroads
for expenses upon the dividends ro'coived fromn
the Banks before passing on the dividends ta
their members as dividends upon their own
capital sftock.
The band-boak issued by one
of the Banks for the use of associations tributary ta it contains a warning that the
dividends receivod by the -associations fromn
the batik should be usod only ta a limited
degree, if at ýaIl, for the aperating expenses
of the associations, and draws attention ta
the fact that tbe Farmn Loan Board bas given
notice that if it found an association using
more than a nc-qu-arter of its dividends ta
meet operating expen-ses, it will require sîîcb
association ta finance all of its expenses from
dividends, and deny it the privilege of charging application and loan fees.
These fees
are lîmited ta 1 per cent of the amount of the
boan at tbe outset; transfer focs in connectian

2. Joint Stock Land Banks.
Eighty joint stock land banks have been
chartered of which fifty-three were in active
operation. on December 31, 1925. The balance
have been cither liquidated, or merged with
other banks.
The total boans in force amounted to $545,559,200, and the farm loan bonds outstanding
to $516,143,700.
The total paid-up 'capital amounted to 341,595,626.
The rate of interest charged to borrowers
varies f rom âý per cent to 6 per cent and the
rate payable on farmn lan bonds from. 4J per
cent to 5 iper cent.
The maximum boan is 850,000 as compared
with $25,000 ini the Fedeaal Land Banks.
0f course, these boans are made direct to
the individuels.
It wilil thus be seen that the two branches
of the Federal systern account for about Si,500,000,000 of long term farm loais. Lt has
been estimated that the farm mortgages in
force in the United States total $6,000,000,000
so that the Land Banks have approximately
25 per cent of the total farra mortgages in the
country.
The effect on the rate of interest on farm
mortgages in the greater part of the country
would appear to be very marked. Competent
authoirities who have investigated. the question
o(f interest eates state that in several of the
States rates of intereslt on farmn bans averaged
8, 9, and 10 per cent. These rates have, by
the operation of the Federal system, been reduced te not more than 6 per cent on Federal
loans, and the competition induced by the operation of the system has depressed interest
rates charged 'by private leaders te almost a
similar extent. In other parts of the country
such as the Eastern States the effect on interest rates has probably been negligible sa the
prevailiag rates on farm mortgages bof ore the
establishment of the;systen ýdid not exceed the
rate now charged.
The introduction of the long-term feature
has also been of value to the farmer in relieving him from the- danger of being unexpectedly called upon te repay his boan. While
short term. bans are as a rule renewed wit.hout question where the security is atWactory,
there is a contingent iiability of which tJhe
farmer is glad te be irelieved.
In view of the results attained under the
American systern and of the sixnibarity to a
certain degree of the conditions prevailing in
Canadian agriculture, it was considered advisable te avajil ourselves of the experience of
that system in framing the Bill now before
the House, to keep what seemed good and
liad stood the test of tirne and to eliminate
what had proved to be impracticable of unsatisfactory.

189

The Bill before us in its general lines is
framed upon the principles embodied in the
Federal Farin Loan Act. There are, however,
important exceptions~
1. The Ganadian Farm Loan Board, authorized by the Act, is composed of the Minister
of Finance as Chairman; one Member, the
Ch!ief Administrative Officer, designated the
Canadian Farm Loan Commissioner; and two
other Memibers, ail appointed by the Governor
in Council. This body is made a body corpora>te and politie and will of itself make loans
to farmers and seil farmn lan bonds. It therefore combines the functions of the Federal
Farm Loan Board in the Un.ited States a.nd
the twedve banks of the systemn. This was
deemed desirabie in view of the probably
small proportion of loans under the Canadian
system. as compared with the American system.
The greater concentration will, it is believed,
inake possible a minimum operating expense.
2. The question as to wheVher loans shall
be made on the co-operative system as in the
Federa:l Land Banks,, or on the individual system as in the Joint Stock Land Banks, is lef t
to the determination of the province in which
the boans are made. Before operations are
commenced in any province, the province is
required to decIare by legisiation whether
loans ehall be nmade -on the one systeni or on
the other, or both together. The duty of devising machinery for the organization of Cooperative associations, if that plan of loaning
is decided upon, will feul on the province, subject, however, to tihe approval of the Board.
It was felt that to impose a hard and fast
systern along ei'ther line might be unduly
hampering to the Board, especialby as it is
evident that there are strong views held in
favour cf both loaning systems.
3. Co-operation on the part of the provinces
in w#ich loans are made is required in order,
first of aId, that the system shabi not duplicate
or donflict wlth any provincial loaning scheme
that may be in existence, and secondly, that
the Federal system may have the advantage
of provincial co-operation in proceedings under
the moitgage, inicluding the transfer of land,
It is reccgnized as desirable that if possible
anme simple and inexpensive means of dealing
with deélinquent borrowers may be devised,
relieving the lender of unnecessary expense,
and at, the sanie time, giving the necessary
protection to the borrower.
4. In the United States the rate of interest
on the boan to the farmer must not exceed by
more than 1 per cent the rate paid on farm
boan bonds, In this Bill the rate cbarged to
the borrower is not limited except that the
operatiug expense is required not to exceed
1 per cent of the amount of the boan. Discretion is left to the Board, however, to make
such provision as seems to it neceesary for

190

SENATE

prospective losses. Section 7 sub-section (5)
therefore provides that the rate of interest
on the loans shall be made up of(a) the rate of interest payable on the
bonds;
(b) an expense allowance not exceeding
1% of the loan, and
(c) such provision for loss reserve as the
Board may deem adequate.
What this rate will be can probably be
determined only after the Act has been passed,
the extent and nature of the field of operation
of the system ascertained, the judgment of
investors as to the security offered by the
farm loan bonds obtained, and the probable
volume of loans and rate of expense of
operation estimated. It is realized that much
will depend upon the probable volume of
loans as the expense of operation has been
shown to depend very largely on the amount
of business transacted. For instance some of
the Federal Land Banks in the United States
with $100,000,000 of loans or over are operating
to-day at an expense rate of less than i of
1 per cent, and in some cases, after adding
provision for all the foreclosures and reserves.
the total charge does not exceed î of 1 per
cent.
Whether or not these reserves will
ultimately prove to be adequate to take care
of all losses remains to be seen, but so far it
must be admitted that there is no evidence to
the contrary.
5. The Bill provides for two types of capital
for the Board(a) An initial capital not exceeding $5,000,000 to be supplied by the Dominion Government. It is not expected that this capital
will be required in full. It may be that it will
not go beyond one or two millions. Whatever
amount is advanced will be free of interest
charges for three years, thereafter it will
bear interest at 5 per cent and will be repayable from time to time out of profits of
the Board;
(b) 15 per cent of the amount of loans as
they are made, 5 per cent of all loans made
being contributed by the Dominion Government; 5 per cent on all loans made within
the province by the Provincial Government,
and 5 per cent deducted from the loans to the
borrowers. This capital will be credited with
such dividends as may be declared by the
Board, the dividends on the borrower's stock
being retained by the Board to acumulate to
his credit at the rate of 5 per cent per annum,
compounded annually. These
accumulated
dividends will be used to hasten the maturity
of the loan by applying them to the payment
of the final instalments.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

The loan will be repayable over a period
of aproximately 20 or 30 years depending
upon the rate of interest payable on the loan.
If for instance the farm loan bonds are
found to be marketable at a 5 per cent rate,
the expense rate assumed to be 1 per cent and
the necessary addition for prospective losses
i of 1 per cent, the rate to be charged the
borrower would be the sum of these three
percentages, or 6 per cent. The borrower
would then be required to pay annually, in
addition to this rate, either 1 per cent or 2
per cent of the amount of the loan as provision for repayment of principal. If the
1 per cent is chosen and payments made
annual'ly, the loan will be matured in exactly
32 years, or if payments are made in semiannual instalments, in 31J years. If the 2
per cent amortization is chosen, the loan will
be entirely repaid in exactly 23 years with
annual payments, or in 22.6 years with semiannual payments.
Loans will be made only to farmers
occupying and cultivating their farms. The
loans are not intended for the absentee
landlord or speculators in farm lands.
The maximum loan to any one person will
be $10,000. The uses to which the proceeds
of the loan may be put are set forth in
subsection (2) of section 7. Briefly the money
is required to be used for the permanent
improvement of the land or the relief of the
farmer from other debts.
The legislation required to be passed by
the province is set forth in section 8 of the
Bill. The Legislature must authorize the
Provincial Government to subscribe to the
stock of the Board an amount equal to 5 per
cent of the total loans in the province; the
establishment of a provincial board of 5
members to be nominated by the Provincial
Government and approved and appointed by
the Board; the appointment of provincial
officials as members of an advisory council;
the ma.king of farm loan bonds issued by
the Board legal investments for trust funds
in the province. It is made clear that the
Provincial Board shall be subject to the
directions of the central board.
The net earnings of the Board will be
ascertained by deducting from the interest
earned(a) the interest payable;
(b) the expenses of operation;
(c) the reserve for anticipated losses,
and of the net earnings so ascertained 25
per oent shall be carried to a general reserve
until such geneial reserve amounts to 25 per
cent of the entire capital of the Board. After
that time 10 per cent of the net earnings will
be carried to reserve. The balance of the
net earnings may be used to pay dividends

JUNE 8, 1926

loi

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have a statement of the expe'nse of operation of the f arm
loan scheme.
The Farma Loan Bill makes no express provision for the alUowance to be made in the
interest rate on loans for expense of operation beyond fixing a maximum of 1 per cent
or for reserve for losses. The view taken in
drafting the Bill was ùhat the rate could best
be left to the judgment of the Farm Loan
Board operating with the Minister of Finance
as Ohairman.
There are many good reasons why the
judgment of the 'Board 9hould net be fettered
by statutory provisions regarding matters
which cannot be accurateily appraised or controlled by Parliament or by thie Governinent.
Information has been obtained during the
last few weeks from public losining bodies in
-the United States and Canada as to the expense of operation of the4r systeins, and the
on.Iy conclusion which can be safely drawn
froin the communications received is that the.
rate of expense is closely related to(a) the volume of ioans, and
(b) the density of the farming population.
For instance the Federal Land Bank of
Houston, Texas, one of the largeet of the
Federal Land Banks in the United States farm
loan system is operating and has operated for
some years at a rate of expense of 3/10 of
1%. The volume of boans is over $113,000,000. The expense rate the first year when
loans totalled $2,117,000 was 4.9%.
The Federal Land Bank of St. Paul, Minnesota is operating at an expense of à of 1%.
The volume of loans ie approximately $123,000,000. The Loans made the first year
amounted to $7,023,000 and the expensc rate
was 2.1%.
Against this we have the experience of the
Agricultural Credit Commission Loans in thec
Province of British Columbia, the rate of
expense of which is approximately 9%. The
amount of boans ie about $500,000.
The farm. Joan scheme o.f the Province of
Saskatchewan according to the report of the
former Premier of the province, can operate
at an expense of from 11% to 2% if the
fariners "play the game". The volume of
boans is about $10,000,000.
The boan compamnes operating under Dominion charter and making returns to this
Departinent have total assets, including mortgages, bonds and debentures and other assets
of approximatery 3100,000,000 of which. about
Hlon. Sir EDWARD KEMP: Could net my 870,000,000 consist of mortgages. The rate of
hione urable friend put it on Hansard, with the expense exclusive of commissions and taxes
is 1.7% of the amount of mortgages, or 1.2%,/
consent of the House?

on thec capital stock, not however, including
the initial capital provided by the Government, but such dividende are limnited to 5 per
cent unltil the reserve fund ainounts to 25 per
cent of the said capital. Dividende beyond
the 5 per cent may 'be declared only upon
the stock subscribed by borrowers. The
stocks held by the Dominion and the province
is therefore limited to a 5 per cent dividend.
Provision is miade for the (boverniment
purchýasing farm boan bonds to, an amounit not
exceediing $15,000,000.
It is recognized that the success or faïlure
of the sysem will depend upon the management provided by the Board. No system can
su'cceed without the most competent management, and 'the greatest importance therefore
attaches to the capacity of the members of
the Board, particularly the Farin Loan Comnmissioner. With a capable Board and with
trained assistants in the Provincial Boards
and on the staff, there does not appear to be
any reason why the systein should not be
of advantage to the farming community,
particularly in those provinces where the rates
of interest *are now very high. It is realized
that these higli rates are te some extent
accounted for by adverse legiélation on the
part of the provinces, and it is not too much
to hope that the operation of the systema
may bring about a botter feeling between
legisiators -and loaning ý,gencies of ahl kinds,
private as well 'as public, se that anything
savouring of confiscation or undermining of
mortgage rights will be discouraged for the
future and the existing legislation of that
character cither modified or wholly repealed.
If this can be brought about, it is safe to
say that an 8 per cent fanm mortgage loan
will soon be nothing but a memnory, and that
rates approximating those payable on business
and commercial property will ýbe possible, to
the adivantage, net only of the farmer, but
of a'lî classes inthe community.
Lt is hoped thfat the rate charged. the
fariner including amortàzation, wii be beow
8 per cent, wbiich. is the minimum rate of interest at piresenit charged throughout the
West, and that at the end of 32 years his
capital will be completely amertized.*
I have given a fairly long statement of the
Bill wi'fil the idea that it may be of some
benefit when th.e Bil gees te Committee.l
have seme other data, but will await the Ceinmittee stage te give it te tie members of the
Senate.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: May 1 make a
suggestion? I think possibly there is one
feature of the Bill which will require some
explanation, and which might possibly stand
in the way of its securing unanimous support.
In the Provinces

of

the West,

where this

Bill will probably find a wider scope than in
any other part of the community, there are
numerous. prior claims owing to this Government and to several public bodies.
For
instance, there are dlaims for balances duo
for seed and for other things. 1 was
very much surprised to find that thcy
amount to a very large sum. Now, if foreclosure proceedings have to be taken and the
mortgage realized upon, there will be a large
sum in aIl these Provinces which wiIl have
to be taken care of before the capital or interest can be recovered. I mention this because it is a very marked feature in the West,
where conditionsl are different from those in
the East, where there is not anything like the
same number of prior dlaims. I do not know
what the solution is, and I have no suggestion ito offer at present, but in the interest of
the Bill I think it is very important that the
matter should be considered. Personally I
arn very strongly in favour of the Bill, and
I mention this not because I want to embarrass my honourable friend, but because I
think it is a matter that should receive some
attention before the Bill is taken up in Committee.
Hon. Mr, DANDURAND:
ourable friend to clause 12.

I refer my hon-

Hon. Mr. BE LCOURT: That is for the
future only.
Hon. Mr. DANDURLAND:
Yes.
It has
not been deemed opportune to do anything
which would tend to put pressure on the
various legislatures to alter Provincial legislation. However, there is a moral pressure
or a material pressure that can be exercised.

The Board in fixing the rates will take very
good care to differentiate between a Province
where a boan is absolutely safe and a Province where a loan is Ioaded with priorities
such as those mentioned by my honourable
friend. Gradually the Province where those
exceptional priorities exist will feel like adopting standard legislation which will put it on
a parity with other Provinces.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Possibly the Government of Canada might consider the propriety of waiving its priority on seed, for instance. That is a priority created in favoui
of the Dominion, and I believe there is a
consi « erable sum still owing, of which there
is not much hope of collection. There might
be advantages in getting rid of that one
priority.
Hon. Mr. DANDTJRAND: My honourable
friend must not forget that Providence sometimes smiles for a number of years on our
country. Frorn 1000 to 1912 or 1913 without
a break there were good crops in the West.
We have now had two good crops, and if
we have further goo>d crops, we stand a good
chance of being reimbursed for seed.
Hon. MY. CALDER: The point raised by
the honourable gentleman frorn Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Belcourt) is a very important one, and
one we had great difficulty in dealing with in
Saskatchewan. The amount of money loaned
to farmers who lied mortgages on their propertics was very large indeed, and when the
Federal Goverament advanced seed to homesteaders, they insisted that they should have
a prior dlaim. On the other hand, when men
were on land that had passed beyond the
homestead stage, and the Provincial Government had to advance seed, and after many
conferences with the representatives of the
loan companies it was finally agreed that the
claim for seed should corne first.
Those
dlaims are not wiped out by any means, and
there must be large surns still outstanding.

that it is going to cost them quite a sum of

CUSTOMS TARIFE BILL
SEOOND

READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURANID moved the second
reading of Bill 114, an Act bo amend the
Customs Tariff, 1907.
He said: The title of this Bill, honourable
gentlemen, indicates its purpose. It i.s an
amendment to the Cu.stoms Tairif! o! 1907,
and deals with niany matters. It affects the
preference given to certain countries, which
will only accrue to those goods which after
the lst of January, 1927, are shipped directly
into a sea or river port -of Canada. Honourable gentlemen will remember that th-at policy
was applied two years ago when the British
preference was increased, and that the increase could not be earned except by direct
shipment to, a port of Canada. The pr.esent
amendment covers ail goods that will benceforth be shipped to Canada and, which wili
dlaim the preference.
There are considerable changes of a consequential nature with reference to the West
Indies agreement. Tin plates of a class or
kind not made in Canada are, under the
Preferential arrangement, admitted free; under
the Intermediate and General Tariffa they will
bc charged 5 'per cent. Heretofore those tin
plates paid 7-ý per cent under -the Preferential
Tariff, and 12J per cent under the Intermediate
and General Tariffa. This transfer to the fe
Iist under the Preferential Tarif!, and the
reduction under the Intermedia;te and General
Tarif!s, is for the purpose of helping the
canning industry.
A certain number of changes affect the importation of1 automobiles. The rediuction in
duties on ýcars vatued at more than $1,200 is
7ý per cent on the General Tarif!. I mention
the (leneral Tarif! especiially, because those
importations come mainly fi'om the United
States. The duty on automobiles valuod at
$1,200 and under wil1 be reduced 15 per cent
on the Generai, Tarif!. Certain articles of a
class or kind not made in Canada, and for the
making and finishing of automobiles, are put
on the free Esat. There ie a drawback of 25
per cent on materialis used. in the manufacture
of autjomobiles, provided tihat at least 40 per
cent o! the .cost of producing the finished
article s been incurred ini Canada. This 40
per cent will remain in force tili the let of
April, 1927, after which time the proportion
of cost to ho incurred in Canada will be
raised to 50 per cent.
The motion was agreed to, and the BifLl was

of tihis clause is wor'ded so that Norwegian
vessels would be allowed to take goodi right
through to Port Arthur an~d back again. I
suppose the Government had not considered
the question raised yesterday by one of the
mombers o! this House.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The purp ose of
this clause is 'ta allow tho transhipment of
goods at ports which. are not enj oying the
Preferential Tarif!, such, for instance, as the
port of Hong Kong. There are goods shipped
to Canada from lochia which go to Hong
Kong and are transhipped upon the vessels
o! the Canadian Pacifie Railway. Without
this clause those goods would not be entitkd
to the preferen-ce.
Hon. Mr. REID: That is ahl right, but
does it not go further? It also permits goods
t.o be brouglit from England or any British
port right past Montreal and up to Port
Arthur. I merely raise the point because
yesterday the general opinion of the Senate
was that if possible we should keep for our
Canadian vessels the traffie from Montreal to
Port Arthur. 0f course, there would be no
objection to Norwegian vessels bringing a
cargo from a British port to Montreal and
then having it transferred ta a Canadian
bottom. The clause, as I understand it, gives
them that right. 1 am flot going to object
to it further than to draw the attention o!
the Government to the point I have raised,
and, if there is anything in it, and the Government wish ta give the Canadian Merchant
Marine that protection, it should bc done
now. Otherwise the Government must assume the responsibility of continuing the
privilege to the Norwegian vessels.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not think
the point o! my honourable friend is Well
taken. When, in 1923, the Customs tariff was
amended in order to allow of an increased
preference to British goods it was decreed
that the further 10 per cent could only be enJoyed if goods came direct to Canadian ports,
and the clause that we passed thon reads
exactly as this one. I read it from the
Customs Tariff, clause 5:
Providéd that goods entitled to the benefits of the
British Preferentiel Tariff skiall be en.titled to tlhe

196

SENATE

discount authorized by this section, when such goods
are shIpped on a through bill of lading consigned
to a consignee in a specified port in Canada, when
such goods are transferred at a port of a British
Colony or possession not en-joying the benefits of the
British Preferential Tariff, and conveyed without further transhipment into a sea or river port of Canada.

My honourable friend will sec that those
words-seaport or river port of Canada-are
of very general import. My honourable friend
now finds this very same clause in the present
Bill to cover the whole preference while the
clause in the Act as it stands to-day covers
only the increased 10 per cent preference of
three years ago. This clause will now cover,
under the very same terrns, the shipping of
goods to a Canadian port, sea port or river
port which desires to enjoy the full preference.
Hon. Mr. REID: As I understood. if a
change was made a few years ago, the British preference was saved by that clause which
required all goods that were to enjoy the
British preference to be shipped direct. Before that they could be shipped and come to
Canada even through New York or some
other port in bond.
This clause, or the clause as it was then,
would of course allow Norwegian ships to go
right up to Port Arthur. That could be
remedied if the words were added: "not to
include rivers or anywhere west of Montreal." Those ships fron Hong Kong, for instance, could then go up the river to Quebec

or Montreal. without affecting the West. The
trouble that was discussed yesterday arose
from traffic coming from England. Now, instead of coming to the United States, it must
come direct to Montreal; but by this clause
you are allowing it to go to Port Arthur, just
as has been donc.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Do I understand my honourable friend to say that we
could arrange that all our Asiatic trade should
not go farther up the St. Lawrence than
Montreal?
Hon. Mr. REID: No, I did not say that at
all. I was speaking about the question raised
yesterday regarding Norwegian vessels, not
British vessels at all. If British vessels bring
British goods across the Atlantic, they have
the right to go to Port Arthur; but the complaint was about Norwegian vessels. It was
complained and brougbt to the attention of
the Government yesterday that it was not
fair to the Canadian Merchant Marine to
allow Norwegian vessels to compete. I am
not going to suggest anything, and if the
Government wish, after that discussion, to
allow a law to be passed here to-day permitting Norwegian vessels to continue the

Mr.

DANDURAND.

coasting trade, or if the Government are not
willing to remedy that state of affairs, they
must take the responsibility.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The question
my honourable friend raises surely does not
come within the purview of this Bill. It
is a very large question, about which I would
need personal information, as I am not precisely familiar with the rights of foreign ships
coming up the St. Lawrence. I know that
by arrangement with the United States our
canais can be freely used by American ships
going and coming, but at this moment I
could not give an opinion as to the right of
Canada to stop ships other than American
ships from coming up the St. Lawrence to
deliver goods to an American port, or to a
Canadian port, for that matter.
Hon. Mr. REID: The honourable gentleman does not think that the point I raised bas
anything to do with the Customs Act.
I hold
that it bas, because in that Act, which is being
amended, those rights aire given to which
objection was made in the discussion yesterday.
The United States bas the right to the free use
of our canals under a Treaty made with
Great Britain, and that right would not be
interfered with if foreign ships were prevented
from using our ports as the Norwegian vessels
do, as stated. yesterday.
The impression left
on my mind was that in the discussion yesterday the Senate was strongly of the opinion
that Norwegian vessels should not be permitted to constinue to deprive our Canadian
Merchant Marine of trade.
Yet the very
next day after that discussion this Bill is
brought in, which continues that right, so inconsistent with our own interests, and no doubt
it was granted by this very Customs Act in
ý1923.
If it bas existed under that Act this
Bill should not continue what was considered
so objectionable yesterday.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Well, I will
oniy say this to my honourable friend, that
I do not believe that the Act of 1923 or this
one bas anything to do with the question he
raises.
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN:
I know that 40
years ago certain vessels, mostly Norwegian,
had the right to coast in Canada.
If my recollection is correct, it was by arrangement
with Great Britain that Norway had reciprocal
coasting privileges.
So it is nothing new.
Section 1 was agreed to.
On section 2-schedule A amended:
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I would like to inquire as to the general policy of the Government in respect to some of these changes.

What I would like to find out is whether
the policy is one which will encourage the
importation. of products into Canada by a low
tariff, and after thcy are in Canada will give
a protection worth while to those who use
those products for manufacturing?
Hon. Mr. DANDUTRAND: My honourable
friend will notice that there is no change in
tihe first column of 22J per cent on preparations of cocoa or chocolate in powder form,
27ý per cent intermediate, and 35 per cent

West Indies agreement.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: So much for that.
Cocoa or chocolate in powder .form is imported,
and the manufacturer makes it into candy or
other goods. What 1 am interested in is to
kno-w whether the protection which the manufacturer gets then is as great or greater ini
proportion than the first importer receives?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In item 23 there
is an increased figure for articles manufactured
in order to allow a protection to the Canadian
manufacturer.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Does flot My honourable friend thindk that the manufacturer is
entitled to more protection than what is here
given?
On item 23,
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
he gets 35 per cent and 21 cents under thé
general tariff, which is quite a large figure.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: With the idea, of
finding out further the policy which the Government has adopted, let us corne clown to
item 90-fruits:
Tariff Item 90.-Fruits, viz. :-Plantains, Pine&ipple,
pomnegranates, guavas, mialiges, wild blueberiea, wild
strawberries and wild raspberries; Bri"s Preferential
Tariff, Free; Intermnediate Tariff, Free; General Tariff,

My impression is that in Canada there are
millions of tons of blueberries going to waste
every year, as we have an overabundance of
Vhem; therefore why allow them. on the free
liat?
There is no
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
change undèr that clause 90, except that -bananas are taken out, and are put under a special
number, 93.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: But I need soarcely
point out that whether there is a change or
not, it will not affect wvhat I amn driving at. I
would like to find out what policy the Government is pursuing, or are they just taking
the old tariff as it was and following it up
blinffly? What reason is there for admitting
blueberrie-s into this country free'
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I arn informed
that there are no wild blueberries im-ported
inito Canada.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Then why have the
item there? It is mentioned very specifically.
Hon. Mr. HAYDON: Does my* honourable
friend think that if a duty of 35 per cent were
put on blueberries the people in the locality
would go up on the mountains and pick ýthern?
Hon. Mr. GORDON: 1 do not thînk they
would, because, I think there are more bluebernies in the country than they could use.
But it seems to me, that in making a tariff
some policy should be pursued frorn the outset, and I want to -find out what that policy is.
I would like to see high import duties put on
articles which we can grow or manufacture,
and on articles which, we cannot grow or
manufacture I would like to see littîn or none.
But if the Oovernment have no .policy at
all, but are just jumping at it in a careless
way, I want to find that out.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But my honourable friend takes a very extraordinary
example to test the .policy of the Government
%vhen he speaks of wild blueberries. Wild
blueberries are a product of nature which does
not nieed any great nursing. No one will extend the area of wild blueberry production.
As none are corning frorn abroad, my honourable friend wonders why we leave the item
there free. When we are threatened with the
importation of wild blueberries then it will be
tirne enough to see if that is affecting very
much the prices of our own wild blueberries.
If it is not, they would perhaps be welcorne. I
arn told that poasibly some may corne from
Newfoundland.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Why have the item
there?

198

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
There are a
number of respectable things that have come
down from Confederation. I do not know but
what it was there in 1867.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Turning to page 5, item
438d, in respect to automobile accessories, I
notice a great many things now coming in
free:
Horns,
distr butors,
ammeters,
instrument board
lamps, gasoline gauges, thermostats, oit filters...

I would like to ask, this question: is the
Government convinced, when it proposes to
allow automobile parts to come in free, that
we cannot manufacture goods of this description in Canada? It seems to me that a number of these small things should be manufactured in Canada.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Whenever they

are manufactured in Canada, they will become
dutiable. If my honourable friend will read
the whole item he will sec that, after describing the various things that are admitted free
under item 438d, it says:
al of a class or kind not made in Canada, whet
imaported by manufacturers of goods enumerated in
tatiff items 43Sa. 438b and 438c for use only as original
ertuipment in the manufacture of motor vehieles enumierated in tariff items 438a and 438b.

lon. Mr. GORDON: Oh, I see. Then the
idea is that none of these things are being
manufactured in Canada now?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

If

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May we pursue
this point just a step further? My honourable
friend did net read quite aIl of that clause.
The items enumerated under head are entitled
to admission free "when imported by manufacturers of goods enumerated" in other items.
namely, automobile manufacturers.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: "For use only"Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: "for use only as
original equipment in the manufacture of
motor vehicules." I should understand that
the Government proposes there a discriminatien as between the manufacturer and an
ordinary citizen. It has been pointed out that
these goods are not manufactured in Canada.
Is it to be understood that if, for example, I
as a user of an automobile want to purchase
a horn, or a distributor, or an ammeter, or
any of these things mentioned, in order to
equip a car which I own, I have to pay
duty. whereas if a manufacture wants to import the same article he may import it free?
Is that the understanding?
Non.

Mr.

GORDON.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I do not follow
mi honourable friend yet. It is specifically
nsentioned that these things are free because
they are not manufactured in Canada. Now,
if the private -citizen owning an automobile
desires to have a new horn on it, that is no
affair of the manufacturer of automobiles in
Canada; it makes no difference to him; it does
net affect the sae of a new car. I doubt very
much the wisdom of this provision, and can
scarcely understand the policy that would
d:scrinminate between the manufacturer in
Canada and the private citizen with regard
to the purchase of an article that in no way
affects the interests of the manufacturer.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I can well sec
the difference. The effect of this item is to
encourage the manufacturing of motor cars
in Canada.
When my honourable friend
wishes to buy a new horn for his car, that
lias nothing to do with the manufacture of
cars in Canada.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. BELAND: They may be.
tley are, they are dutiable.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My honourable friend reads that clause rightly. These
are advantages given te the manufacturer of
automobiles in Canada; but the public at
large, in buying some of these articles separately after they have purchased a motor
car. will have to pay duty. That is simply
for the purpose of revenue.

Quite se.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Then he must
realize that that is an article which should
carry a little duty, in order that the Governnient may have some revenue It is, in a
certain sense. largely a luxury.
And as a
matter of fact we are raising revenue on very
nany things that are not yet being made in
Canada.
Hon. Mr. GORDON:
1t appears to me
that if there is any way to discourage the
nianufacture of these articles in Canada, this
will acoomplish it. Take, for instance, rims
for steering wheels, and lock washers. Is there
any reason why these should not be manufactured in Canada? And do you not think
that by having a duty on these some manufacturer is likely to be induced to start manufacturing them in Canada, if we are not
manufacturing them now?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But my honourable friend knows very weil that when any
individual or corporation
is prepared
to
engage in the manufacturing of an article
which is on the free list, he applies to the
Government to have it removed from the free
list. These are articles which will come in

JUNE 9, 1926
free because they are flot made in Canada,
and they will help the manufacturer to turn
out the flnisbed product. This item will be
a belp to him and hie will- be encouraged to
continue developing hîs industry if we make
it easier for him to do so. This is, I think,
good Canadlian policy.
HFon. Mr. GORDON: I arn sorry to have
to disagree with my honourable friend ira that.
Suppose a manufacturer on the other side
who makes isome of these things that I have
just ment.ioned finds that under the Canadian
tariff goods of this sort corne in free, and he
does not know that it is possible, by corning
here and interceding with the Governrnenti to
get the tariff changed. Is he likeýly to 1tart
a factory in Canada? Do you not think that
that man would be more apt 10 corne over
here if he knew that we had an effective duty
on such articles now?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My answer is
that these articles were ail dutiable untii the
Budget -carne down, and for a number of
years.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This fact did
not induce the manufacturer in the United
States to corne over to Ibis side to manufactuTe. Now we are utilizing our Customs
Tariff 10 belp our own Canadian industry, but
we leave the duty as against the general public, and wherever the article is made in Caniada the importation of such article becornes
dlutiable.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: But, after ali, the
automobile industry is a comparatively new
one, and I tbink that if reasonable protection
were piaced not only on the automobile itself, but on the parts, the time would -corne
when ýmany of these things would be manuLactured in Canada. I think that by reducing
the duty on these things you are going to
discouýrage any person fromn coming over lier,to. manufacture. W.hy would anyone who hs
estab'ished and equipped a f actory in the
United States and is manufacturing these
articles there now, come over here to Canada
10 manufacture themi when, they can corne in
free?
They do flot
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ocane in free, except when they are not manufaietured. in Canada, and even then they re.
main dutiable against the public.

ail, and who has a factory in the United
States for making those things, would flot
corne over here and manufacture ini Canada.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should think
the contrary.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Why would he corne
over 9?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If we develop
our own Canadian automobile manufacturing
industry we enlarge the clientele to such an
extent that thoýse people niay be disposed to
corne oveT, for they know that as soon as they
do, ail -the articles they produce will become
dutiable-will be transferred from the free
class.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: Honouraible gentlemen, I would like to get a littie information with regard to the' point that was raised
by the Ex-Minister of Labour (Hon. Mr.
Robertson). He referred to automobile parts
that are permitted to corne in free because
they are not manufactured in Canada, and he
pointed out that a private individual would
not be allowed to bring in such articles duty
free. 1 understood the honourable Minister
(Hon. Mr. 'Dandurand) to say that the manufacturer could import, sudh parts, to be put
int new cars, witbhout paying duty, but that
for the purpose of revenue the private individual would have to pay duty.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Would it not
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY:
rather be that instead of purehasing parts
acroas the line the private individual would
have to purdhase them fromn the manufacturer,
who would br-ing them in duty free and sel]
themn retail for the refitting of old cars?

He could not
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
do that.
Hon. Mr. ROIBERTSON: Honourable gentlemen, I have listened witb a great deal of
nterest to tbis discussion, and I confess that
the Minister's explanation is to me really a
surprise. It is a reversai of what I understood to be the Government's general policy
respecting tariffs. It has been heralded abroad,
and undeTstood and believed by many people
in tbis country, that the Government was the
champion of the great unwashed common
people, whose rights were being trampled upon
and those interests were neglectedT1hat includes

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
my honourable friend says.

That is what

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
And now we
find that the tariff is being amended to give
special privileges to the manufacturers of
automobiles and to collect additional taxes
from the common people. J think that is a
discovery worth remembering. We have been
misunderstanding this Government's attitude
towards the tariff all along.
But to my mind the serious feature is this.
Here it is proposed not to increase the manufacture of automobiles in Canada, but to increase the assembling of them and to increase
the number of parts manufactured in another
country by foreign labour, these parts to come
in to be assembled into automobiles in Canada.
Surely, honourable gentlemen, in the
light of the experience of this country.during
the past three or four years, when as many
as 200,000 a year of our citizens, nearly all
of them skilled artisans, have been exiled
and have had to seek employment in another
country, it is time to point out to the publie
that this is the effect of the policy pursued,
and it is a condition that we may expect to
continue if such a policy is persisted in.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Can the
honourable leader of the Government tell me
what was the duty on these things before?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hon. Mr. DAN'DURAND: They are free

go into the manufacture of automobiles.
Hon. Mr. GORDON:
There are a great
numiber of these things that are manufactured
in Canada, are there not?
Hon. Mr. DANDTRAND: If they are
manufactured in Canada, they are not free;
this does not affect them.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: How is the Department going to ascertain, as to many of these
Jittle things, whether they are manufactured
in Canada or not? For instance, take lock
washers.
Hon. Mr. DANDURANU: The Department
has a complete list of what is being manufactured in Canada.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: There are
things that are being manufactured
and the Depart.ment would never

of smuggling going on, although the Department woulid not tolerate it for a minute if
it knew what was going on.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
manufacturing.

That

is not

Hon. Mr. GORDON: Take a small article
like a lock washer: it cannot be of a very
mysterious nature; it must be something that
can be made in most manufacturing plants.
Yet we have that included here. It is stated
bere that if that is not manufactured in
Canada it may be brought in free. This item
appears to me to be an incentive to manufacturens on the American side of the line, but on
the other hand it is a discouragement to our
own manufacturers. It drives labour out of
this country by providing work in the United
States. It cannot do anything else.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Whenever these
articles are manufactured in Canada they cease
to come in free.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: But that is the weakness of the thing. I claim there are many
articles in this list that may be manufactured
in Canada and that the Department will never
know anything about.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend could take the whole list of articles and
find hundreds of articles that are free of
duty
because they are not manufactured in
Canada. Would my honourable friend appiy
the same principle and say, "We shail take
them off the free list, because to permit them
to come in free of duty would encourage
people outside to manufacture them and prevent our own people from doing so?
Hon. Mr. GORDON: When the honourable
gentleman puts that question to me I must
reply to it frankly and say that, as I
intimated a while ago, what I would like to
see done would be to have the duties
increased on nearly every articile which we
can manufacture or grow in Canada, but I
would like to see the duties decreased ou a
good many things which we cannot produce
in Canada.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would like
to answer my honourable friend who has jusýt
contended that the policy pursued in this
case is detrimental to the generail interests of
the country. I would reminid him that hte
used probably the very same arguments when
we discussed and settled the policy with
respe'ct to the manufacture of agricultural
implements. There was a material reduction made, and at the same time there was a
reduction on the raw materials entering into
those agricultural implements. The very next

JUNE 9, 1926
day the consumer got the advantage. The
list of reductions was published. So it is in
this case, because the policy whieh is now
before the Senate went into effect on the very
day next day after the Minister of Finance
made his speech announcing the change. So
the people got the advantage of the change,
and it is hoped that, as in the case of agricultural implements the industry will flourish.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: But my honourable
is
fricnd knows i that Çancada to-day
suffering because we are not employing our
labour as wel as it should be employed. For
that reason our mechanies are going over to
the United States. They have gone over in
thousands and are going over yet. Under
such legiaiation as this they will continue to
leave. What I arn endeavouring to do is to
show iny honourable friend that in place of
driving labour over to the United States wc
need to retain it and provide more work here
by having these parts manufactured in this
country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend is a capitalist. Why does lie not start
that business and receive the protection?
Hon. Mr. GORDON: "My honourable
friend" is not a capitalist. If lie were, I can
assure the honourable gentleman that under
conditions as they are to-day, lie would flot
attempt to go into any kind of manufacturing,
because lie rnight have the ground eut from
under his feet almost any timie.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Where are we
going to get these parts that are so necessary?
Hon. Mr. GORDON: From the United
States. And you are going to continueý to
get them frorn there if the present policy
is persisted in.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: May I ask the hionourable gentleman a question? Would lie
sooner import an automobile or the parts?
If you do not facilitate the, manufacture, the
automobile will not be manufactured, and
instead of importing the parts you will import
the whole automobile.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: If you have the duty
high enough on the automobile, the parts
and everything else wîll lie manufactured in
Canada, and you will drive industry after
industry from the United States over here.
It is a question of having your duty higli
enougli.
Hon. Mr. MacARTHUR: There would be
something in the honourable gentlemnan's contention if we had to deal with an ordinary
situation; but we know that there are very

201

many large manufacturing concerns in the
United States whidh specialize in what are
known as accessories, and that no Canadian
manufacturer will be able for rnany years
to compete with those American manufacturers. After all, these are immaterial items
on the equipment of a car. They are called
standard equipment in the United States,
and they are manufactured so cheaply that
no Canadian manufacturer or assembler of
automobiles wants to be bothered considering
their manufacture in Canada.
Now, the moment that representations are
made to this Government that an industry
wants to start making those parts in Canada
it will get 25 per cent or 35 per cent protection. If the Canadian capitalists do not
want to put their money into a business of
that kind, what is the use of protecting it?
What do they want? The manufacturers
have neyer asked that these little accessories
should lie dutiable when they corne into
Canada for the original equipment.
Thc ex-Minister of Laýbour raised the point
that there is discrimination as between the
ordinary consumer and the manufacturer.
Who that buys a 25-cent bell or horn wants
to be bothered with the tariff? He can get
one in the States and put it on his car. As
a matter of fact, that is what many people
do. These are alI cheap items that make
what in the United States is called standard
equipment, and many people in Canada like
to have the samne equipmnent on their cars.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Some of the greatest
businesses in the United States, as well as
in other countries, have 'been built up by
thc manufacturer of articles that my honourable friend would consider of a minor nature.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Chewing
gum, for instance.
.Hon. Mr. GORDON: The honourable the
Chairman suggests chewing gum.

instead of decreased. I believe an increase
would be beneficial to the country as a
whole from every standpoint-not only from
the standpoint of employment, which every
person knows is so badly needed. If automobiles were increased in price, it would have
the effect in many instances of preventing
people driving them who should not, and
who are mortgaging their homes and doing
other things of that kind in order to do so.

Ir. BLACK: The argument of the
honourable gentleman fron Prince Edward
Island (Hon. Mr. MacArthur) is a very excelient one for protection. One makes a very
great mistake in citing the Unitrd States in
an argument of this kind. 150 years ago
every nail used in the United States was
made in Great Britain, and every small article
in the way of hardware was made in Great
Britain or on the Continent. That condition
continued until the United States became a
huigh tzariff country; and it is only because it
ias becone a high tariff country-the higliest
tariff countrv in the world-that it is able to
ship its products into this country.
I am quire in accord with the argument of
the honourable gentleman who lias just taken
lus seat (Hon. Mr. Gordon), that the only
way to get these articles made in Canada is
to put a high protective tariff on them.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: The honourable Leader
of the House says that when the duty on
farii iiplerients was reduced the price was
reduced in proportion. That is entirely wrong.
There was no reduction in price because of
the reducrion in duty; the only reduction to
the consumer was in the sales tax.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
To whatever
cause the reduction may be attributed, the
consumer, through the policy of the Government, obtained a reduction in the price. My
honourable friend says the reduction was due
to the withdrawal of the sales tax, but a few
days after the new policy came into effect I
saw a list from the Massey-Harris Company
which showed side by side the prices the day
before and the day after the reduction, and
tiere was quite a perceptible difference.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: That may be, but I
know whereof I speak. I live in the West,
and know what conditions were and the

changes that took place. The only reduction
made to the consumer was the amount of the
sales tax taken off at that time.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: A minor matter
was spoken of by one of our colleagues to
which I think it might be well for the Leader
of the Government to draw the attention of
the Customs Department, namely, the question of whether there is adequate and full
supervision of all the articles that come in
free, and whether or not they are made in
Canada. Presumably the manuffacturers make
it known that suci an article is made in Canada. On the other hand, in the Custonms Act
of last year the duty that had been taken off
a certain article the year before, on the representations of the users of the article that it
was not made in Canada, was restored, and
very properly so, it having been foiind out
in the interval that it was made in Canada.
Hon. Mr. REID: I would like to discuss a
nubnlier of the items which appear in this
Bill if we were in a position to ma:ke any
changes; but, as we are not. I amn content
to wait until the people affected see the results, which may not be wiat the Government expects.
I rose particularly to say tîat J think saething should b doe at once to strengthlien the
administration of the Customs. J believe that
up to this time the Customs staff as a whole
is as good as that of any other Department.
Of course. wlien you employ a large number
of men you soimietimes get some who are
not as good as yon think they are Here is
the difticulty. I have never been able to
understand how we could expect to get the
men actually required to carry out the work
at the salaries paid. There are men in the
service doing what is practically inspection
work for fronm S1,000 to $2,000 a year. They
are sent out to adjust drawbacks and to do
other work of that kind, and it is absurd to
expect to get competent men at the salaries
they receive. Of course, I realize that if you
commence naking changes in one Department vou will probably have to do it in
others; but I do not believe that the Customs Act will ever be properly administered
by competent men unless they are paid adequately. I would not like to state the amount
of money that I think this country is losing
in duties by reason of this condition.
There lias been sent to me, as I suppose
to every other member, a copy of certain recommendations.
A great many of those recommendaitions are sourd and should be carried out; but I am satisfied that they will

if possible, where the pressure has come from.
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, $200,000.
My honourable friend has had much more
experience than I have had in this 'matter;
but my experience leads me to believe that
there never is any pressure from the railways.
It is public, through associations or munîcipalities or private inidividuals, that clamours
for that protection, and I have never seen the
railways sympatheticaly disposed. On the
contrary, they have always tried, by all kinds
of devices, to postpone the doing of what was
being asked, even with the advantage of the
grant provided for in the Act. I have not the
record before me; but I stated that the Good
Roads Association has been particularly
urgent in its representations. All those who
follow the newspapers know the formidable
increase in aiccidents at these crossings, through
the use of the motor car, and I am not surprised that the public is clamouring for more
safety.

whether I have before me the text of the
Railway Board's recommendations. All I can
say is that this subject was referred to the
Board of Railway Commissioners for report,
and the Bill is based on the recommendations
of the Board, and contains practically the two
suggestions that it made.
We might take the second reading of this
Bill now, and if any honourable member has
any further question te put, which I cannot

answer it when we go into Committee.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: I understand that if
we grant this increase it will save the Railway
Companies just se much.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No, I do net
say that. If the municipalities are contributing under this Act, as I think they are, it will
stir them into action. The maximum amount
is increased from $15,000 te $25,000. But I
believe that the Railway Companies themselves, on account of the higher cost of construction, will have te pay as much, in spite
cf the increase in the contribution te be had

Hon Mr. TANNER: Can the honourable
leader of the Government tell me whether the
principal Act defines the word "municipality'?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
"Municipality"
means an incorporated city, town,
village, county, township, parish, or rural esunicipalitv.

Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: The Act limits
the application te six crossings in any one
"municipality." I understood the Minister to
say that 'municipality" is defined as a county
or a township. Is the limit applied te the
county or te the township?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Perhaps the
answer is te be found in this section 262 of
the Railway Act of 1919.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: "Municipality" is defined in the Railway Act as an incorporated

or whether or not the apportionment of money
might apply to six crossings within a township and twenty or more within a county; the
reason being that such a situation has not
arisen. It is not very often that the grade
crossing situation has come before the courts
or before the Railway Commission for consideration, as is quite evident by the statement given by the honourable leader of the
Government, setting out the amounts of money
that have been paid annually out of the fund.
It is only once in a while that a railway grade
crossing becomes dangerous, and it would be
nearly inconceivable that there might be six
such crossings in a town or in a parish such
as the 'honourable member for Pictou (Hon.
Mr. Tanner) has mentioned. However, there
might be; and there might be six in the next;
and one reasonable interpretation of the
statute, as I take it, would be that in some
municipality or township there might be six
such crossings, and in the county if there were
twenty townships, there might be 120 such
crossings. The question as to how the division
should be made, or what this clause would
mean, bas not, I think, been determined by
the courts, and until it is so determined I -do
not think an answer could be given in this
House.

CANADIAN RED CROSS SOCIETY BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second

Canadian Red Cross Society Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, when this
Society was incorporated it was given the right
to purehase, take, have, hold, possess, retain
and enjoy any property, real or personal.
During the war it did purchase a few pieces
of property here and there in Canada, but
afterwards, when it wanted to di.spose of any
property, it found that it had not obtained
the right to seli. It is now intended to amend
subsection 1 of section 5 by adding thereto
the following clause:
Hon. Mr. HAYDON.

The Society may from time to time dispose of any
euch property in such manner and upon such termas as
it may deem advisable.

I think it should meet with no objection.

YUKON QUARTZ MININ'G BILL
SECOND READING

Ho.n. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second reading of Bill 154, an Act to amend
the Yukon Quartz Mining Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the regulations for the disposal of quartz mining claims
on Dominion lands in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, the Northwest Territories
and the Yukon Territory were approved by
Order in Council dated the 25th May, 1917.
In the year 1924 the request was made
that these regulations be confirmed by Act of
Parliament, insofar as they applied to the
Yukon Territory, and by an Act respecting
quartz mining in the Yukon Territory, assented to on the 19th July, 1924, the Quartz
Mining Regulations, insofar as the Yukon
Territory was concerned, were established.
All quartz mining claims acquired prier to
that date were held under the Quartz Mining
Regulations, which, at the time, were identical
with the Quartz Mining Act, assented to on
the 19th July, 1924.
By an Act to amend the Yukon Quartz
Mining Act, assented to on the 27th July,
1925, a number of amendments were made to
the said Act, so that the Quartz Mining Regulations under which mineral claim were
previously acquired and the Act in force in
the Territory were no longer identical.
Subsection (q) of section two of the said
Act provided that "mineral claim" or "location" shall mean a plot of ground staked out
and acquired under the provisions of the said
Act.
The Department of Justice therefore decided
that the Quartz Mining Act, assented to on
the 19th July, 1924, was not retroactive in
force, and that the very large number of
mineral claims acquired under the regulations
prier to that date are still held and administered under the provisions of the late regulations.
As it seemed most desirable that all mineral
claims in the Yukon Territory should be held

JUNE 9, 192620
under the same terms and conditions, and as
the Quartz Mining Act now in force contains
provisions that are beneficial to the recorded
owners of minerai dlaims, it has been considered advisable to amend the Yukon Quartz
Mining Act so that it may operate rçtroactively, and apply flot oniy to minerai dlaims
acquired since the 19th Juiy, 1924, but to al
minerai dlaims acquired prior to that date.
With that end in view, it is recommended that
subsection (q) of section two of the said Act be
amended to provide -that a minerai dlaim
shail mean a plot of ground staked out and
acquired under the provisions of the Act or
under the reguiations or Orders in Councii in
force prior to the passing of the eaid Act.
This amendment is in full accord with the
wishes of the mine operators, the chief executive officer and the Member of Pariiament
for the Yukon Territory.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. REID inquired of the Government:
1. Was a return ns required by clause 10 of Act,
ehapter 45, 15-16 George V, for the relief of certain
of The Home Bank of Canada, laid on the
tile
during the lrsenit ses.on? If so, on what

elitors

date?

2. If it has ont been laid on the Table, whien wiil it
be done?
3. How many claims have still been unsettled?
4. What amount is still claimed by the unsettled
cla sis?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I have an
alswer for the honourable gentleman. As to
questions 1 and 2:
An interim return, based upon data received up to
that time from the Iliquidators, was presented by the
Minster of Finance on January 11, 1926.

I ar under the impression that that statement is true as far as the other branch of
Parliament is concerned. I have just inquired, and am informed that the return was
not laid on the Table of this Chamber, but
I will see that that is done.
As to questions 3 and 4:
Claims over $500 in amount,
Commissioner, numiber 1,787,
739.01. These, it is stated,
which, undoubtedly, are not
the terms of the statute.
Hon. W. B. ROSS.

not disposed of by the
and amount to $2,778,include a large nusnt-er
entitled to relief under

Hon. Mr. REID: I might say to the
leader of the Government that section 10 of
the Act reads as follows:
The Minister of Finance shall annually submit ta
Parliament, within 14 days of the opening thereof
a detailed statement showing the names an<1 addresses
of all persons who have received aid under this Act,
the amount of their respective claims, and the amount
paid to each.

If I understand the statement of the honourable leader, that return, in accordance with
the Act, was laid on the Table of the House
of Commons on January 11, 1926.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes. When I
get a copy of that return, we will see how it

conforms with the Act.
Hon. Mr. REID: I am glad to hear that,
because I have not found it in any place in
the House where I have inquired.
AUTOMOBiES IN PARLIAMENT
GROUNDS
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I desire to call the
attention of the leader of the Government
to the dangerous and reckless speed at which
motor cars are allowed to travel in enterineg
the Parliament grounds, and passing over the
roads. The principal danger-point to which
I wish te direct attention is the entrance
through the east gate. Not many evenings
ago, had it not been for the intervention of
Providence, the Premier's prayer for the
reformation of this House might have been
one step nearer to accomplishment.

To-day,

in coming through the same gate, I walked
over to where a policeman was on duty, and
asked him if part of his duty was to check
drivers who were coming through the gate
at a high speed. He replied that perhaps it
was, but that necessarily he had to be so
mueh away from that point that he could not
watch the gate all the time for that purpose.
So far, I have not known of any accidents,
and possibly there have been none, but I am
quite satisfied that unless stricter regulations
are made and some watch is kept, particularly
on that gate, a serions accident will occur.
I would therefore ask the leader of the Government to look into the matter, and perhaps
publish some kind of regulations to guard
people who have to come into the grounds
on foot, and particularly to sec that some
person looks after the matter.
Hon. Mr. McCORMICK:
I would like
to endorse the suggestion of my honourable
friend. A little over a year ago, on my going
down the walk from the building towards the
gate. a car came up Wellington Street and
made a sharp turn in front of the building
without blowing a horn or having a light.

JtJNE 10, 1926
WVhile I was crossing the roadway the car
struck mie and broke the bones of my wrist.
That has had the effect of rnaking me very
nervous about the traffie, sa that flow, inistead of looking two ways, I look four ways.
I tbink that, without causing inconvenience
ta people using automobiles, increased safety
ta the public might be secured by having
that gate closed. If the entrances on the west
and in the centre only were used, a persan
going down f-rom this building would have
some measure af protection; but in a foggy
nig.bt, wîth reckless people driving, t-here is
no protection whatever. It is particularly
dangerous ta go through the east gate, because
there is a short turn. I therefore suggest that
without incouvenience ta those who drive
automobiles that gate might be closed entirely.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I wish to raise my
voice in reference ta this matter. A f ew
evenings aga I was comdng through that gate,
and I had raised my umbrella, when a car
came through the gate and made a sharp turn
ta go around by the south end af the est
block, and I thought I .had a narrow escape.
I heard no horn, and I do nlot know whether
or nlot one was sounded. I think an accident
will occur there if som*ething ýis nlot donc.
Whether the gate should be, closed, or a
policeman specielly inst.ructed ta see that
automobile drivers observe the rule, I t.hink
special care might be taken with cars corning
through that gate. The turne are very short,
and it is very difficuit ta avoid ea car in that
particular locality.

Police, end let tbem take charge of those three
gates and mount a guard there, as 'they do at
St. James palace.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER. I
wauld like ýto add my testimony to the others.
Only two or tbree days ago I came withia.
three or four inches of being absolutely runa
over. A youngseter whom I do not know,.
who was driving a car, pedd no attention ta
the fact thst there wee any other human
being in the wide -unîverse besides himieif and
hie car-for I think the car wes just about
ne human as he wais. Hie was goi.ng at full
speed, and I was just witbin a few inehee af
being run aver. Every kilnd ai car runs in
and out ai these gates, from every quarter of
the world, and rny hair rises almost every
time I eattempt a passage. I arn quite
ta go when my time cames, buit I willing'
would
awfully hate to go out srneehed up by a car,
run in that k.ind of way.
I Vbînk that the situation requires more
than siniply that attention be celled ta the
matter. We would alI feed thet we bad been
a little lax if one af or number, or somebody

CHICOUTIMI

HAýRBOUR BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DAXDTJR.AND mnoved the
second reading of Bill 1,50, an Act respecting
4
the Chicoutimi Har bour Commissioners. He
ýsaid:
This Bi-l has for its objeet tihe creation
of a corporation called the Chicoutimi Harbour Commission. As honourable gentlemen
know, there are a certain number of ports
that are managed by Commissions, and others
that are managed directly by tlie Public
Works Departmnent.
The people interestc'd in the Saguenay
River have ýbeen pressing for the organization of a Harbour Commission which will take
charge of the waters running past the city
of Chicoutimi and down as far as and including Ha-Ha Bay wlhere Port Albert is
situated.
ilonourable gentlemen are aware that
considerable development is taking place in
the neighibourhood, that, large works are being bujît, and that extensive industries wil
be added to those already there; su there
wvill be need for an intelligent and experienced management of that port. In fact'
the port already does considerable business
with Europe, because pulp is taken from the
wharves at Chicoutimi and carried across
the ocean. Port Albert, at Ha-Ha, Bay, is
designed also for considerable activities 'because of the aluminium company which wilt
ho in control of that port and of the port of
Chicoutimi.
1 t'hink that it is quite reasonable that we
should rcspond to the demand of the people
of that region for a Harbour Commission.
It rapresents no outlay or charge upon the
Federal treasury. If ýand when a scheme of
4levelopment. is proposeýd which. would cal]
for the borrowing of money, it wil1 not be
,donc except througha and with the consent of
iParliament.
lion. Mr. REID: Honourable gentlemen,
with reference to this Bill I feel that at least
wc should give it our very serious attention.
I know the locality, having been there sevcral times. This Biii1 is to gov~ern to distinct, localities, Chicoutimi and Ha-Ha Bay,
which must be 25 or 30 miles &.part. At both
of those points the Goverrnment has spent
very large amounts. It hias done a great deal
of work, and good work; and I understand
tliat these works-wharves and storehouses,
and aIl that-are, under this Bill, to be
handed over to the Harbour Commission.
The Commissioners are to have power to
borrow aIl the money they like ms the works
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD.

rcs;ulting from the millions of dollars that
have already been expended by the Government.
When the Bill is in Committee I would
like the leader of the Government to tell us
how much money the Government has expended at Ha-Ha Day and -also at ýChicout:mi. 0f course, there is drodging 'between
those two point, on which large amounts
have been expended; 'but I am not so anxious
to know about tihat as to know how mucha
property wve are handing over to the Harbour Commission. I understood the leader
of the Government to say that th;s did not
involve any money from the treasury.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes.
Hon. Mr. REID: But the Governiment
practica'lly guarantees the bonds for the
amount that the Harbour Commission may
horrow on the properties on which they have
already expended millions of dollars.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would draw
attention to the fact that the Harbour Commission can borrow its money outside for
any development; but I suppose it would
require the sanction of the Department of
If the Commission
Marine and Fisheries.
came to the Federal authorities for a boan
or an endorsation of its bonds, that could
not be done except by an Act of Parliament.
Hon. Mr. REID: The position I take is
that if the Commission go outside to borrow
the money. the Government practically endorses the bonds, and if there is default, I
cannot see how we can get out of paying,
because bof ore the ýCommissioners are allowed
to issue the bonds tbey must get an Order
in Council authorizing themn to borrow the
moncy. Although they have not really put
their stamp on the bonds, I think I am right
in saying that when that Order ini Council
is issued, they will ho responsible. 0f course,
the leader of the Government is right in
saying that if the Harbour -Commissioners
want money from the Government they
must come hore to get it by Act of Parliament; but if the Bill goes through, it will
ho a great surprise to me if that is not done,
and if we are not confronted next year with
an item in the Estimates 4 for two or three
million dollars for this hai bour.
I am in favour of Chicoutimi Harbour and
Ha-Ha Bay being developed, but I amn opposed to pubting a small harbour like this
into the hands of a Harbour Commission. The
Government have carried on the work there
very welli through the Department, and I do
not think a great deal more is necessary to
make these two harbours equal to any others

JUNE 10, 1926
in the Dominion. At the same time I feel
that it would 'be much better to let the Government complete the work and collect the
revenue than to mortgage the praperties and
put themn in the bands of a Commission that
may no>t do the work as well or at as reasonable an expenditure as would the Publie
Works Department. Before the Leader of
the Govemnment asks to have the Bilil go
through, if he is going to press it, 1 hope he
will be able to give us the information that
I have asked for so that the -Snate may be
seized -of the facts and familiar with the whole
situation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If I understand
my honourable friend, the information he
desires is the amount of money that has aiready 'heen spent by the Federal authorities
on these two ports which, henceforth, will form
one port.
Hon. Mr. REID: Also I would like to know
how operations are carried~ on, and what
revenues are received atf the6e ports; and, further, I would Iike to know the reason why the
work shoulcb be carried on by a Board of Harbour Commissioners instead of by the, Government. The Leader of the Government
knows that we have several Harbour Commissions -in different parts of the countr-y, and
that the only one that has paid any return is
that at Montreal. G'iowing accounts have been
given of what was goin-g to be done, but outside of one or two cases I have neyer heard
of these Boards paying even the interest.
Hon. 'Mr. BEIQUE: Honours.ble gentlemein, I happen to know something about the
situation at Ha-Has Bay and Chicoutimi. For
the past six years, although I have had no
personal intetrest, I have been lookcing after
the interests of others at Chicoutimi and HaHa Bay. The Ha-Ha Bay harbour is a very
important one. The work theire bas not been
done by the Goverament but by the Chicoutimi Port Company, which bas expended
over $700,000 in building a wharf at whicb
two large vessels may load or unload at the
same time. At Chicoutimi, which is also a
veiry important port, there is no deep water,
as there is at Ha-Ha Bay, some twelve, mdls
away, but it is known to honourabie gentlemen, I think, that there is a very large development going on in that place. The!re is
being spent, principally, by the Aluminium
Company, but also by other companies, some

$75,000,000 or $100,000,000, -and there is no
doubt that within three or four years therc
wîil be an additional population theTe of some
30,000 or 40,000 people. Land has been purchased, and one or two hundred houses will

213

be buiit within a very short time. As I understand it, the obj ect of this Bill is to create
a corporation which may act as an intermediary between the Government and the different large intereste there so as to save time;
but that corporation, of course, will 'be under
the control and direction of the Government,
and cannot do anything except with its approval. Il this work were not done by the
Harbour Commission which is to bei created,
it would be done by the Government. I think
the Bill sbould commend itsell to this honourable House, and that it is in the, interest
of the development of that part of the country that it shouid pass.
Hon. Mr. REID: The: honourable gentleman bas just said that there, bas been an expenditure -of somne $75,000,000.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: No. I eay that there
bas been an expenditure of over 3700,000 on
wbarves at Ha-Ha Bay, -and that some $75;000,000 is in the course of 'being expended.
Hon. Mr. REID: But the expenditure is
taking place a great many miles from both
Chicoutimi and Ha-Ha Bay.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Six miles froua Chicoutimi.
Hon. Mr. REID: At Ha-Ha Bay there is a
puip mill across froua St. Alphonse. The
honourable gentleman states that wharves
have been built on which about $700,000 bas
beien expended. The company that owns that
mill, as the honourable gentleman knows, bas
been in very serious difficulties for some time.
Is there eny possibility that this Bill would
give the ilarbour Commission power to expropriate that wharf and pay the company
3700,000 for it? There are also other private
wharves at Chicoutimi that really do not
affect the harbour at ail. Is the Harbour
Commission going to expropriate them anct
-issue bonds to get money to pay for them?'
These are matters that I think we shoul4t
understand, because, for the life of me, I cannot see *why we should take over a wharf at
$700,000 from a pirivate corporation. If other
wvharves have to be built, or if the present
wharf bas ito be extended, this Harbour Commission could go ahead and do it. The
builders of those wharves expected to pay for
them, and 1 think they should be allowect
to keep them and do so.
Apart fromn all that, at St. Alphonse the
Government bas splendid w1harves on which
enormous sums bave been spent, to which
large boats requiring considerable water can
go.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: No.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. REID: That is what I understand. At all events, it would not take a
very large expenditure to make that possible.
I am not objecting to these harbours being
put in commission to do all the work that is
necessary; but after the Government has
expended large sums in practically completing
the work, a very small additional expenditure would complete it. I feel that the Government should control and should not let
the works be mortgaged. If you establish this
Harbour Commission, it will probably have
a large staff at Ha-Ha Bay and another at
Chicoutiini, and it will ,cost more to carry on
the work in that way than if it were carried
on in accordance with the suggestions that
I have made.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: If I may be allowed
to answer the question, I would say that the
company that built the wharf at Ha-Ha Bay
was not in difficulties. It was the Chicoutimi Port Company; and the stock of that
company, as well as the Roberval-Saguenay
Railway, which is in that locality, was purchased by the Aluminium interests. I have
no interest in the matter at al], and I am not
aware of any intention to load the Harbour
Commission with any part of the expense
already incurred.
As I have already stated, the wharf at
Ha-Ha Bay is a very important one, and
all the traffic is handled there; the Government wharf does not amount to anything.
At Chicoutimi the water is not deep enough
for large vesels, and a big expenditure would
be required to make a port there. Most of
the produce of the Chicoutimi Pulp Mill is
transported by railway to Ha-Ha Bay, and
the other mill is built close to the wharf
there. I do not think the honourable gentleman need apprehend that what is proposed
will entail an expenditure that should not
be made, or that it will not be in the interest
of the country at large.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Would
the honourable gentleman tell us why this
corporation should have any power to expropriate?
The Public Works Department
has power to do that if it is desired. There
are two clauses in the Bill, 8 and 10, which
deal with expropriation and which to my
mind are quite different. Clause 8 says:
The Corporation may, with the approval of the
Governor in Couneil, acquire, expropriate, sel, lease
or otherwse dispose of such real estate. . .

Then clause 10 says:
Wienever the Corporation desires to acrqure eny
lands for any .f the purposes of this Act, should the
Corporation be unable to agree with the owner of
such lands as ta the price to be paid therefor, t'he
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE.

Corporation shall have the right to acquire such lands
w.thout the consent of the owner.

Under one clause power is given to
expropriate with the consent of the Government, and under the other without that
consent.
I am opposed to the Harbour Commission
on principle. I think the Government can
do the work to better advantage.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My honourable friend bas premised his remarks by stating that the Public Works Department has
the right to expropriate.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The Public
Works Department has delegated its power
to the Commission.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
I do not
think it should.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
All Harbour
Commissions are clothed with the same
powers, and, if I did not do so before, I
state now that this is a standard Bill with
practically the same clauses that are to be
found in the Vancouver Harbour Commissioners Bill or the Montreal Harbour Commissioners Bill. Here is a Commission constituted of men to whom no honorarium is to
be paid. I do not know whether they may
not be given something when the Harbour
Commission is on easy street; but to-day they
are men of substance who are interested in
that vicinity and who will advise the Government. They are but an advisory board; they
can do nothing in the way of expropriation
without the sanction of the Governor in
Council. They cannot borrow money without
the sanction of the 'Governor in Council.
They are the creatures of this Parliament,
and are under the superintendence and control
of the Governor in Council. They are taking
hold of a certain area, and through the necessities arising from development may need to
expropriate some lands. If my honourable
friend will go to Vancouver or Montreal, he
will sec that a similar power was exercised
under the control of the Federal authorities.
When we go into Committee, I am convinced
that by comparing this Bill with what we
already have done my honourable friend will
see that these are standard clauses.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
I draw
the honourable gentleman's attention to
clause 10. He may be quite right. but it
does not appear to mne that where the corporation can agree with the purchaser there
is any necessity to have the consent of the
Covernment. It may be so, but it does not
appear so to me.

JUNE 10, 1926
Hon Mr. CROWE:, Honourable gentlemen, a few minutesago an honourable mcmber stated that as far as hie was aware the
Harbour Commissioners of the Port of Montreal were the only Harbour Commissioners
in Canada who paid to the Dominion Government, the interest and sinking fund on the
money that they borrowed. I ought to inform him that the Harbour Commission of
the Port of Vancouver have made ail their
payments up to date. I do not want to see
'the statement go abroad that tho Commissioners of the Port of Montreal are the only
cues who have donc so.
The motion uvas agreed to, and the Bill
wvas read the second time.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved that the
Sonate go into ýCommittee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. REID: There is considerable information that we ought to have, and I think
that we could get it, and prohably time would
ho sayed, by referring this Bill to some Coinmittee. Therefore I would ask the honourable leader of the Government. if hie would
not agree to having this Bill referred to a
Standing Commi'ttee, rather than have it considered in Committee of the Whole.
Inasmuch as
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
this Bill is similar to those Bis that have
been adopted, I do not believe it ought to
be taken from Cornmittoe of the Whole for
the purpose of obtaining special information.
My honourable friend is one of the few
members of this Chamber who know about
Chicoutimi and that district; so I would rely
upon him to give us ail the information hie
bias as 'to the topography. He hias heen there
and knows what lias taken place.
The honourable gentleman wishes to ascertain what the Federal Government hias spont
already. Weii, wbatever the Government bias
spent on works, those works will go under the
management of the new Board.
As to the dues that have been collected at
Chicoutimi, I have a statement of these hoIn
fore me. They hover around $8,000.
1922,23 they were $S,343; in 1923-24, $7,818;
in 1924-25, $7,192; in 14925-26, $7,463.
The aim in estabiishing this Commission is
the preparation of that Port for the immense developments that are proceeding al
around there. These wili cali for considerable transportation facilities. I believe this
is a case that should commend itself to the
Sonate. There is certainly $100,000,000 to be
expended within the next five years on important industries. ýSeven or eight hundred
thousand horse-power is being developed. Al
this will eall for a considerable amount of
trade, and it seems reasonable that the men

215

there who know what is coming should propare to advise thue Government. The Government must be advised in some way. It
May be ýadvised by certain of its own engineers; but the men on the spot who are
connected with those industries and those developments are surely the men whose advice
is worLh something to the Govornment, and
I do flot see why there should be any difficulty about granting- tbem the riglit to form
a Board which will study the conditions of
to-day and thoso of the morrow and will advAse the Government.
Hon. Mr. REID. I have visited that locality
,severai times, but 1 would point out to, the
honourable leader of the Government that
there is a great deal of information that we
.ought to have. I!f-the honourable leader of
tihe Government wishes to raAlroad this Bill
through, without givinýg us the necessary information, or putting us ini a position to, get
it, then I suppose it must go; 'but I fe11 the
bonourable gentlemen that we need more than
the answears to tihe few questions I asked.
And I will tell the honourable gentlemen why
I wish to, have the Bill referred to a Coinmittee. The officiais would hoe there present.
We could, have, for instance, an officiai of the
Departmenýt of Public Works, and could ask
him huow mu!eh lias been spent; how much
more it would take to put these harbours
into proper condition; bow mudh hoe expected
the Harbour Commission would raise on bonds;
whether it would cover ail the works that the
Government 'have built; ïs it the intention to
take over any of these wharves, or will they
continue to be owned by private parties. How

tc> a Comîmittee would ho that when it had
obtained ail this information, it would report
the Bill, and the Flouse, I think, would be

opposition to the measure, or that the Huse

dealt with in Committee of the Whole, they
may do so.
Hon. Mr. BEICOOURT: Honourable gentlemen, I know a great deal about the development that hias 'heen going on for several years,
and I know the country very wehl. I (have
had sevoral occasions to spend months there,
especially since the year 1913. I should not

m1o

SENATE

have thought it necessary, after the honourable gentleman who sits next to me (Hon. Mr.
Béique) had given 'his explanation, that I or
any other member should corroborate what he
has told us. I should have thought that his
word would be found sufficient. But apparently it is not. Some opposition to this Bill
is developing; I cannot understand why. What
light would a Special Committee give us which
would help us to decide whether the Bill ought
to be passed or not?
It is not a case of submitting to a Committee some projected works
there, or some projected -improvements to the
harbour, or of considering a plan for a harbour.
Nothing of that kind is contemplated at present.
Certainly there are no plans, no data
of any kind, that could be submitted to a
Committee, except what information bas been
given by my honourable friend with regard
to the construction of this wharf.
Now, I know from personal experience, which
has been rather intimate, that tihere are works
in progress there which will cost, as my honourable friend stated, between $75,000,000 and

$100,000,000, and that in the near

future.

Tbere are to be two very large developnents:
in one instance there will be developed about
600,000 horse-power, and in a development
lower down there will be produced probably
twice that ýquantity. Surely the people who are
spending the tremendous sums of money involved in these works have a plan; they are
net going te develop all this water-power without knowing what is going to be done with it.
If we stop for one moment te think what can
be done with that quantity of water-power, we
must realize the great necessity there must be
in that immediate neighbourhood for wharves,
rail transportation, etc.
Now, what is going
to happen?
The people who are spending all
that money may find it necessary to spend in
addition a large sum of money in preparing a
harbour te provide necessary facilities at
Chicoutimi and Ha-Ha Bay. Either they will
do that, or they will seek the assistance of the
Government for the purpose of obtaining those
facilities.
If they themselves are going to
spend the money 'to make a real harbour there,
why should we worry?
It will be an allyear harbour, the only one we have.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
On the St.
Lawrence.
Hon. Mr. BELCCURT:
except Vancouver.
Hon. iMr. DANDURAND:

Or anywhere else,
And Halifax-

Hon. Mr. BELOURT: That is true. Well,
à is the only due on the St. Lawrence at ail
'events. If they are going to spend the money,
I repent, why should we worry? Why should
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

we net let them go on, and why net give them
every facility te spend the necessary money?
The other thing that may happen is that the
Government may be asked for assistance.
Parliament is certainly not going to give any
assistance unless plans are prepared by the
Government and submitted to both Houses.
Se there is no risk; we are net incurring any
liability; we are doing nothing te prejudice
the public interest. On the contrary, we are
simply enabling men who are willing to invest $100,000,000 to proceed, and giving them
all the facilities which they need in order te
carry on their development.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question? If this Harbour Commission is created, will it have power
te get money or guarantees from the Government without coming te Parliament?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
eue cent.

They cannot get

Hon. Mr. CALDER: That is as I understood.
Hon. Mr. REID: I would like te ask a
question of the honourable member who has
just spoken. Do I understand that this Bill
and the development provided for are necessary on account of the output of those plants
that are being established there? My understanding is that the development that is going
on is a number of miles away from Chicoutimi
or Ha-Ha Bay, and the outputHon. Mr. BELCOURT:
May I answer
that question? It is net settled what portion
of the power devedloped is going to be used at
Ile Maligne, where the first development is
now, or whether the power development will
be wholly or partly at Chicoutimi. A great
deal of that power-I believe 75 'per eent-will
be used for through transmission lines. Remember. honourable gentlemen, that there will
be 600,000 horse-power at one place and 1.200,000 at another. It is inconceivable that all
that power can be utilized immediately on the
spot. A great deal of it will have to be transmitted; and net only that, but seme outside
industries, which are net native-if I may use
that expression-will have to be brought there.
Othervise it would be impossible to use a
fifth or a tenth part of that power. Everyone who bas been connected with the development has always realized that in order to
utilize that immense water-power it is necessary to bring in some outside industries. If
honourable gentlemen will consider what will
be the result of using that tremendous power,

JUNE 10, 1926
they will at once admit the absolute necessity
of providing these people with harbour and
railway facilities, and with transportation
facilities of ail sorts.
Hon. Mr. REID- The 'honourable gentleman asked leave to answer my question, but
he lias made a good, long speech. All 1 want
to say is this, that the whole output of those
paper milîs will go by rail. It will not go
through this harbour. The industries are al
several miles away. The harbour will be
used only for the products that may corne
in. except for those going to England. There
may lie some going to England.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: 'May I tell my
lionourable friend this, that it was contemplated at one time--and 1 do not know
that the idea lias been given up-that an immense quantity of fertilizers woul&i be manufactured there and wou~ldi e exported, not

Did I understand my honourable friend tn

Hon. MT. DANDURAND: Yes.~
Riglit Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Sim-i}ar to other Bills? Are there any exceptions to the standardized plan? *My honoura'e friend miglit point those out as we go

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, except that
there is no salary provided for the Commissioners.
Right. Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
That will be deait with in good time.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: That will be acceptable?
Section 1 was agreed ta.

Hon. Mr. BELAND: All the river.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It includes all the
works.
Section 4 was -agreed to.
Section 5 was agreed to.
On section 6-officers and employees:
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
There seem to lie some salaries there. I
thou-glt it was a strange thing for the Bill
to be going through without salaries.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I said that there
was only one modification of the standard
Bill, namely, that there is no honorarium for
the Harbour Commissioners. This provides
for the payment of salaries to "the haribour
master and such other officers, assistants, engineers, clerks and servants as it may consider necessary to carry out the abjects and
provisions of this Act."~ Welà, that is also a
standard clause.
Right Hon. Sir- GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Just one point there. I noticed, when the
honourable leader was giving us a statement
of the revenues, that they ran fromn $8,000 to
17,000, and that they ran downwards rather
than upwards.
They ran
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
downwards, but came up again.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
What is my honourable friend's opinion with
reference to the resources, in the matter of
business there, for the upkeep of the harbour-not only the salaries of employees, but
the maintenance of the works and equipment
as well? If we are going to give to this
Commission privileges and facilities, we ouglit
to have some idea that the proposition is
l)ased upon a sufficient amount of business to
pay its way. What is the opinion of my

honourahle friend about that?
heard a good deal about the millions to lie

218

SENATE

idea of the particular kinds of business that
were to be developed in that region.
The making of fertilizers vas mentioned;
but what do they propose to make fertilizers
from? Are there beds of phosphates there,
or are they going to make nitrogen from the
air? What is the idea about that? It would
be interesting if we knew the purpose of
these expenditures, or what they would really
contribute to the business which would flow
into the harbour, with its docks and aill its
appurtenances. The project sounds well, if
Ithey get $100,000,000 or $200000,000 expended
there; but as regards the business that would
corne to the Harbour Commission, how is
that going to eventuate?
Hou. Mr. BEIQUE: The aluminum company which is making that development is
known to be one of the largest companies
in the world. They commenced by purchasing the railway, for which they paid about
a million dollars in cash.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
point te wbat point?

From

what

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It rues from Chicoutimi to Ha-Ha Bay, and covers 30 or 40
miles. They have purchased the railway, and
paid cash for it; they have bought the wharf;
they have paid about a million dollars in
caïsh for those works; they have bought some
500 or 600 acres of land, and have made
plans for the building of some 200 houses;
thev have built a railway of 15 miles; and
there is no question that in two or three
years they will create there a town with a
population of from 40,000 to 50,000 people.
It is one of the greatest developments that
we can hope for or imagine.
Of course, all this will very much increase
the traffic there. Actually the main traffic is
that of the Price Company, which is some
six miles from Chicoutimi. The Port Alfred
miiil, which is a sulphite pulp mill, now
controlled by Sir Herbert Holt and several
other men of very high standing, who are
greatly increasing the operation of the mill.
Besides that, there is the Chicoutimi pulp
mill, which is the largest pulp mill in the
world, its production being over 500 tons a
day. These are the main industries, but with
the alumimîm industry there will be a very
active centre that will, I have no doubt, produce very large revenues.
Hon. Mr. REID: If this Bill passes, will
all the officials-Public Works, Marine, and
others-be relieved of their positions, and no
more expenditure made by the Government
at Ha-Ha Bay or Chicoutimi or Port Alfred,
or will there be officials at those points?
Hon. Sir GEO'TGE FOSTER.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: All the officials
that are there will be under the Harbour
Commission, except that instead of two barbour masters at those two ports there will be
but one.
Hon. Mr. REID: You mean one for both?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.
Hon. Mr. REID: But there will be one
called harbour master at Chicoutimi, and
there will be another at Ha-Ha Bay, who
may net be called harbour master. I would
also like to ask how much is expected to be
spent to build the works that are te be undertaken by the Harbour Commission. There
must have been an estimate made.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
There is no
plan just now before the Government.
Hon. Mr. REID: Were net some plans
or estimates made by the Government as to
the work necessary to be done?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No. The Government is facing the development that is
going on, and this Harbour Commission will
have to examine what are the needs of the
near future.
Hon. Mr. REID: Isthere any estimate at
all of the amont of money they will expend
within the next year?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, no project
se far. There may be such in the minds of
those parties who are interested in that large
development; they may visualize what will be
needed at the port of Chicoutimi or Port Alfred within the next five years; but they have
not yet made public their project, plans or
schemes for development.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I do net think there is
any expectation of any development within the
next year. As I said, the wharf at Ha-Ha Bay
is first-class, and able to accommodate two
large vessels at the sane time; it is 600 or
700 feet long, and as far as I ame aware I do
nlot think there is any immediate intention
Df incurring any expense.
Hon. Mr. REID: If there is no such intention, I would say that the creation of this
ommission would certainly make a necessary
increase in carrying on the harbour, anyway.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Why?

Hon. Mr. REID: For this reason: as I
understand. the leader of the Government
has stated that all of the staff will be kept
there, but under the Harbour Commission.
Hon. Mr. -DANDURAND:
hardly any staff there.

But there is

Hon. Mr. REID: There must be, at botb
places.

JUNE 10, 1926
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There is only the
harbour master and wharfinger in each. There
are four men who are paid out of the income.
Hon. Mr. REID: There must be a harbour
master and staff appointed to carry on, which
will be in addition to the present staff.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No; there are
four men just now who are supervising, two
in each place, the wharfinger and the harbour master, and they are being paid 25
per cent of the dues collected.
Hon. Mr. REID: But according to this
Bill there will be a new harbour master appointed, and his deputy, and his staff. Then
there will be certain Commissioners who will
receive salaries as such.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No.
Hon. Mr. REID: If they do not, will they
net have another harbour master, or are they
going to use the present staff?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: They will appoint their own staff. They may take one
of these harbour masters. The idea is that
that port, being now one port, will have but
one harbour master.
Hon. Mr. REID: What I cannot understand is this: if there is to be no development during the next year, and the staff are
carrying on, there will be only a few dollars
revenue; then why the necessity of urging
the Bill on now?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Bill does
not create any expenditure. It empowers the
Board to proceed and develop whenever there
is any necessity for it. Surely my honourable friend will not say: "Why do you not limit
them to two men, and put that in the Act?"
They may need ten men in five years, or
they may need four in two years. That is
a matter that is left to the common sense of
the Board.
Hon. Mr. REID: I have no objection to
that; but the point I raised was- that if no
development is going on, and yet you are
going to appoint Commissioners, a harbour
master, and all that, this would involve extra expense.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. REID: But even if there is not
going to be any money expended this year,
I think this matter should be kept under
the control of the Government; and if any
money is to be expended we shall know exactly what expenditures are being made, for
we shall have to foot the bills in any case.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My idea is that
the country is getting simply an Advisory

219

Board there, that will be under a special Act,
that will know the developments that are
called for, and will advise the Government.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Is this harbour open
all the year round, or is it only a summer
harbour?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It is not open all the
year round.
Section 6 was agreed to.
Sections 7, 8 and 9 were agreed to.
On section 10-expropriation of lands:
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I think it
would be quite proper to make this section
conform to section 8, which states that the
corporation may, with the approval of the
Governor in Council, acquire, expropriate, sell,
lease or otherwise dispose of real estate and
personal property. Now, for some reason that
I do not follow, it appears necessary nearly to
re-enact that provision in section 10. I think
it should, as far as possible, conform to section 8, and I therefore move that we insert, iii
the fifth Une of section 10, the words "with
the approval of the Governor in Council','
so that it will read:
Whenever the Corporation desires to acquire any lands
for any of the purposes of this Act, should the Corporation be unable to agree with the owner of such
lands as to the price to be paid therefor, the Corporaton shall have the right, with the approval of
the Governor in Counci, to acquire such lands, etc.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not think
there is any necessity for thaýt addition, for
I think section 10 is governed by section 8:
The Corporation may, with the approval
Governor in Council, acquire, etc.

These powers are not restricted in section
10. It only prôceeds to say that they may
proceed by way of expropriation.
Hon. Mr. LYNCHSTAUNTON: If the
honourable gentleman is of that opinion I
will not press the motion.
Section 10 was agreed to.
Sections 11, 12 and 13 were agreed to.
On section 14-borrowing powers:
Hon. Mr. CALIDER: I asked the question
as to whether the Harbour Commissioners
would be able to get and expend money
without coming to Parliament. and if I understood the answer I got it was to the
effect that they would not; that is, that they
could not get money ,or spend money without coming to Parliament for authority.
Now, in reading section 14, it seems to me
that that answer was scarcely correct, because here they are given borrowing powers,
which are exercised on the approval of the

22U

SENATE

Government alone, and not on the approvai
of Parliament. If I remember, in. the case
of the Montreal and Victoria Harbours, and
others, which we have repeatedly put through,
in which the Commissions were authorized
to raise certain moneys for certain work, the
consent of Parliament was required; but
here there is no such limitation. These Commissioners may borrow millions of dollars,
if they like, merely with the approval of
the Governor in Council, not that of Parliament. Why should we pass a special Bill
authorizing the Quebec Harbour Commissioners to raise $5,000,000, and not put the
same condition on this Commission?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:
Because in those
cases there was a guarantee by the Government of the country. As far as I am concerned, I think this Bill should confer on
the proposed Commission no more powers
than other Harbour Commissions have, but
the same powers. This Commission should
be treated as others are treated.
I think
that all Harbour Commissioners have the
powers stated in section 14.
Under the
authority of the Governor in Council they
have power. to borrow money, but net to
engage the responsibility of the Government.
The Harbour Commission of Quebec has
two classes of security: there are bonds
which are sefiling much below par value because they do not carry the responsibility
of the Government, and there are other
bonds, issued by virtue of the legislation of
last year, which are first class security.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: It seems to me that
there is a danger in legislation of this kind
which gives a Harbour Commission power to
borrow any sums of money it may choose for
harbour development, merely with the sanction of the Governor in Council and without
reference to Parliament. Even though that
provision may be in other similar laws, I
say it is very dangerous.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If my honourable friend cares to look at my statement,
I think he will find that I made a distinction
between the Iborrowing with a guarantee and
the borrowing without a guarantee. All the
Harbour Commissions that have been established have had the power of borrowing provided they obtained the consent of the
Governor in Council. They can borrow practically to the extent of their credit. Of
course, another factor enters there, namely,
the lender; and the lender will take very
good care to lend his money to a solvent
institution. I suppose the Montreal Harbour
Commission could borrow without a Federal
guarantee, but it would have to pay a someHon. Mr. CALDER.

what higher rate of interest. That power has
been utilized by some Harbour Commissions.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: But to a very small
extent.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
To a small extent. If they want a first-class bond, they
will come to Parliament.
Hon. Mr. REID: The reason I raised the
question was because the clause as it reads
gives the impression that the Government are
not responsible for the bonds. The Harbour
Commissioners raise the money on the bonds,
and it is only the Harbour Commission that
vould be responsible.
I remember a case-I think it was the St.
John dry dock Bill in which there was a
clause exactly like this, and some person
frorn my county came to me and said that
the person selling the bonds said they carried
the guarantee of the Governmen't. Of course,
I was quite satisfied that they did not. However, I asked the Deputy Minister of Publie
Works if the statement as advertised in the
papers was correct. I said: "Can they advertise in that way?" and he said that the bonds
did not carry the guarantee of the Government, but that as an Order in Council gave
thern authority to issue bonds, it really meant
the same thing. I inquired from able lawyers
in regard to it, and they all agreed that the
bonds carried the Government guarantee. The
result was that people believed they got a
Government guaranteed bond. In this case,
while Parliament is not guaranteeing the
bonds, it is putting in the hands of the Governor in Council the power to pass an Order
in Council which, so far as the public is
concerned, is really a guarantee of the bonds.
If this is the same clause that was in the
St. John Dry Dock Bill, I am satisfied that
the Department of Justice would give a certificate to this House stating that the
Government,
and
virtually
Parliament,
guarantees the bond.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: Not Parliament.
Hon. Mr. REID: Yes. Under this Bill
Parliament gives the Governor in Council
authority to do certain things; so Parliament
is delegating certain powers, and therefore
is really responsible.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:
I have a case
which is in point. Quebec issued bonds years
ago with the approval of the Governor in
Council, as in this case, and those bonds are
selling at 72 or 73 per cent of their face
value. They are depreciated bonds, because
the revenues of the Harbour are not sufficient
to guarantee their payment. Bonds of that

221

JTJNE 10, 1926
kind may be issued in two ways: they may
be issued as incarne bonds, guaranteed hy
the receipts of the Harbour, or they may be
issued otherwise. We are creating a corporation whiceh is under the control ai the Govcrnment, and being under the contraI ai the
Governrnent it is provided that it rnay issue
bonds; but, hefore borrawing, the Commission
bas ta have the approval of the Government.
Thc municipabities in the province of Quebec,
and 1 think in other Provinces as webl, sometirnes have to obtain the authorization of
the Government in order to borrow; but that
does flot involve the responsibili.ty af the
Province.
Why is the honourable gentleman so
anxious ta differentiate between this corporaI repeat that 1 have
tion an(l others?
neither any connection with this enterprise
nor one cent of interest in it. Why shauld
we differentiate between this corporation and
the Harbour Commission of the City of
Toronto or any ather place?
Hon. Mr. REkID: I do nat think we are.
The honourable gentleman has said that the
bonds of the Harbour Comnmission of Quebec
are sold at 72 because they do not carry the
guarantee of the Gavernrnt. I arn not
surprised at that. But I would a8k: bas there
ever been a default of blase bonds? I do
nat think so, although they have earned only
a vcry small arnount-not enough to pay the
interest. Will the honourable gentleman deny
that?
Hon. Mr. BEIQIJE: 1 do flot know.
Hon. Mr. REID: The honourable gentleman neyer heard of the interest nat being
paid, and I will tell hira why. When we
vote a certain amaunt of money for the
Quebec Harbour, sufficient is taken out of
that vote to pay the interest, so we are reallY
paying; but because there is no guarantee the
bonds are sold for less.
Let me give another instance. We awn the
Canadian National R.ailways. Bonds af the
Grand Trunk Pacifie Railway guaranteed by
the Grand Trunk Railway are not sald for
as much as those guaranteed directly by the
Gavernment; nevertheless the Gavernment is
really responsible for thezn.
The point Il raise is that the public shauld
understand, because when these bonds are
issued we will see the same advcrtisemente

that have appeared bel ore, stating that the
Government are really guaranteeing the bonds
and giving the Harbour Commissioners power
to issue as many as they like. .I do flot
think the people should be deceived.
Section 14 was agreed to.
On section 13 (reconsidered):
Hlon. Mr. DANIEL: Io it not somewhat
unusual to put the Collector of Custorns under
the control of the Harbour Commrissioners,
and for the Harbour Cornmissioners to have
power to compel. lira o colleet dues for them?
1 understand t-hat it is his duty ta, colleet
dues owing to the Government, but not dues
owring ta the Harbour Commiasioners.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I arn informed
ihat this is the customary clause. It operates,
but not arbitrarily. The Department asks the
Departrnent of Customas to allow the collectar
to do this work. It is by arrangement between the two Departrnents.
Section 13 was agreed ta.
Sections 15 ta 24, both inclusive,, were

In 1928 there is a further amount maturing
-$53,000 000. We are asking, in round figures,
for $150,000,000 to cover the loans maturing
in 1926 and 1927. It is not anticipated that
any portion of these borrowing powers will be
required for other purposes unless when the
time cornes for issuing the refunding bonds,
the market rate would be sufficiently unfavourable to warrant the utilization temporarily of our then cash resources for redemption purposes. It may be that under
such circumstances we would require to borrow
to that extent moneys to recoup the Treasury
to meet our heavy half-yearly interest payments.
There is no departure in the wording of our
present Bill from the wording of the previous
borrowing Bill.

that only $43,000000 will mature in 1926?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
There are no
public works for which this sum would be

This is a general authorization

There are already borrowing

I could

This is a

OPIUM AND

DRUG BILL

NARICOTIC

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DAMYURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 152, an Act to amend the
Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1923.
Hle said: Honourable gentlemen, there was
a slight error made when the lest amendment to the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act
was passed, in 1923, and the error affects section 5 of that amendment. Section 5 as it
stood prior to 1923 made no distinction
between licemsed persons and others dealing
in narcotics. The amendments of that year
made it necessary to divide the section. The
first part dealt with wholesalers, and the
second part with the retail druggist, and it
simply requireýd an order or prescription in
ahl cases. When section 5 was so, divided
the words "other than any such physician,
veterinary surgeon, dentist or druggist" should
have been dropped from the second part. As
they were not, they allowed the druggist to
supply narcotics to a physician, veterinary
surgeon, dentist or druggist who had not given
a prescription. The prescription or written
order was required that it might bc entered
in the register. I1t bas been discovered that
someone found the loophole aud without a
certificate obtained narcotics from a druggist,
disposing of them without leaving any trace
of the quantity he had purchased. It is
suggcsted that this error be corrected and that
those words be struck out of section 5, so
that such persons shahl be obliged, as Iormerly,
Vo give a prescription to the druggist when
they purchase from him. It was simply
through a clerical error that those words were
Ieft in the Act.
Hon. Mr. WI.LLOUGHBY: How will it

it has been law'ful to refill a prescription? It
says here that it shall be unlawful to reflul a

it unlawful to refill?

part; I am only striking out those words

Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Then it has already been unlawful?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is unlawful
without a written order or prescription of a

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Does this legislatico
mean that the physician, veterinary surgeon
or dentist must himself obtain an order of a
druggist before he can get a narcotic?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No; they must
themselves give the order; they must themselves sign an order; that is, they must give
themselves, for themselves, a certificate.

WEST INDIES TRADE AGREEMENT
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDTRAND moved the second
reading of Bill 15, an Act respecting trade
relations with British West Indies, Bermuda,
British Guiana, and British Honduras.
He said. Honourable gentlemen all know
the efforts that have been made from year to
year for closer trade relations with the West
Indies, the coming of an important trade
delegation last winter from the West Indies,
and the making of a Treaty which seems to
have given considerable satisfaction te the
people of the v'arious colonies of the West
Indies as weD as to Canada. It is one of
those commercial arrangements which present
no very great difficulty, and will meet with
less resistance than sorne treaties that I have
had the honour to present to this Chamber.
In most of the treaties that have come before
us there were exchanges of goods and advantages given to the country with which we
were dealing, which seemed to a certain extent to bring competition in certain lines to
our own manufaeturers, sometimes to a small
degree; but I know that the complaint was
often made that in our treaties we were
lowering the tariff in some directions, whether
appreciably or not.

JUNE 10, 1926
In this instance we are making a Treaty
with countries that do neot produce our goods,
and whose goods are not produced in our own
country, so that it is a most agrecable arrangement. The trade with which this
Treaty is concerned has gone on increasing,
yet we are doing 'but a smnali share of the
business which the West Indies are carrying
on with thbe outside world. We hope to double
and treble, within some years, our exports to
that country.
If you will allow me, I wilI put on Hansard
the advantages which wiil accrue to Canada
by this new British West Indies Trade, Agreement. The only difficulty, which is of some
importance, is as to the carrying out of the
obligation to procure ocean transportation.
We have obligated, ourselves, as we did by
tbe arrangement of 1920, to furnish a certain
amount of steamship facilities. The Goveriment could not see its way Vo furnisbing up
to 100 per cent, or ýperbaps up to 90 per cent,
.what it had obli.gated itself to do in the way
of ocean transportation. We have 15 rnontbs
in whi'ch to comply with the obligations which
Canada bas assumed in that line. There have
been tenders received for the service whicb
we, obligated ourselves to estabiieh, but they
have 'been deemed too hiýgh and quite unsatisfactory. On the other hand, through the
fact that there will be greater buoyancy in
our exchanges two or three, companies have
expressed a desire to, enter that trade, and
within the next 12 months there may appear
such advantages that would accrue to the
company that would furnish services called
for by this Bill, that we may obtain a more
satisfactory tender. At present we simply
stand wit.b the hcope that the market will develop there, and that the importations from
the West Indies wB!l increase to such a point
that they will enable us to negotiate under
better conditins with steamsbip companies
in order to 'carry out our obligations under
that Treaty.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Is this Treaty in force
now?
No; it wil
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
come into force by proclamation of the Gov,ernor General, under Article xix:
In reqpect ta Canada this agreemnent shall be sxubjeot to the approvai of dts par1Eament and in respeet

respective legisiatures and of the Secretary of State
for the Colonies.
Upon approvai being given by eacis of said Colonies
reapectiveily the agreement &hall be brough't into force
thereupon or so soon theresfter as may bp agreed
upon between thse Dominion of Canada and any Colony
by ,proclamnation ta be publishêd in thse Canada Gazette
and in thse Official Gazette of each of thse said Colonies.

REVISED

225

On the present agreement being bronght into effeet
it shadh take the place of and 'be substituted in ai!
respects for the trade agreement dated thse eighteenth
day of June, nineteen hundred and twenty, between thse
Dominion of Canada and thse oionies aforesaid.

Honourable gentlemen know that a number of business men in the country in addition to public authorities, have interested
themselves in the making of this Treaty.
There was an association called tbe Canadian-West Indian League, which, was presided over by Mr. T. B. Macauley. That
organization was most arduous in its labours
to bring about this arrangement, and I may
add that Mr. Macauley devoted considerable
time to the project, and went once a year
to the West Indies simply to try to promote
better commercial relations between the West
Indies and Canada. Our public men have
neyer failed in their efforts. 1 think the one
who initiated this movement was the right
honourable the junior member for Ottawa
(Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster), and I
think bis first trip was in 1890. I arn sure
that he must be happy to see that the Government of Canada bas not laboured in vain.
I only hope that before the 15 months expire we will be in a position to give satisfaction to the West Indies in procuning for
them. transportation facilities, with their
financial co-operation as set out in the Agreement.
Witb these f ew rernarks I move the second
reading of this Bill.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen, I suppose we will bave to let tbis >Bill
pass. 1V bas passed the other Hlouse, and
the Government is committed to this Treaty.
So f ar ns I know anything about the Treaty,
and the way in wbicb it bas been received in
our section of the country, tbat part of it
wbicb refers to what is called the Western
Group is the part of the Treaty that is regarded as tbe most improvident, and the one
wbich we tbink most likely to incur the
largest expenditure witb tbe least return.
The idea that we can build costly steamsbips simply Vo carry bananas from. Jamaica
to Canada is a rather ývisionary business
proposition, I tbink. I hope tbat the Government will be careful about the expenditurc tbey indulge in, because several million
dollars will bave to be put up by -a comnpany to build steamers of the class that will
be required to carry the trade, and also to
be fitted up as passenger steamers.
With regard to the otber part of the
Treaty, that relates to Barbadoes, Trinidad
and British Guiana, I know fairly well that
part of the country, having spent some weeks
in nearly all those islands. They are smail;
there is not much room for great de-velopEDITION

ment there; they are not like the islands of
Porto Rico and Cuba, that had tremendous
sections of undeveloped country when Porto
Rico was taken over by the United States,
and Cuba was put under the tutelage of that
country. Our islands have not a background
for great development such as Porto Rico
and Cuba had, besides having free access to
the markets of the United States.
Another thing in which I am afraid we
are going to be somewhat disappointed is
the volume of trade, although the honourable
gentleman expressed a very optimistic hope
that our exports to those countries would be
two or three times as much as they are now.
We have to meet goods from Great Britain,
that go into these islands under a favourable
tariff, just as ours do, and I do not know
that we are going to capture very much of
the trade in manufactured goods, for the competition will be pretty severe, and drive us
fairly well out of that market. Of course,
there are certain of our natural products
that will go there.
There has been a good deal of criticism
of the Treaty in Nova Scotia, and I think
some in New Brunswick, and I believe representations have been sent here. Those are all
a matter of record, and I do not think it is
necessary for me to go over all that ground,
because, after all, I do not see that we will
be justified in interfering with this Treaty;
so we will lot it pass.

I hope that some of the people who are
pessimistic about it may be disappointed, and
that the honourable gentleman's expectations
may be fulfilled, though I ave serious doubt
of it.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL:
I understand the
offer of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, which has been carrying on business
between Canada and the West Indies, was
not accepted, as it was considered too high.
I presume that was one of the tenders referred to by the honourable leader. But I
observe that they have stated that they
will put on a monthly trade service without
any subsidy whatever.
Has the Minister
any special information with regard to what
can be done by Canada towards carrying
out her obligations under the Treaty in so
far as sea communication is concerned? We
are required to furnish a fortnightly passenger
and mail and freight service-I suppose that
is package freight-and in addition a monthly
freight service.
I saw some reference to
one or more of our own Government Marine
vessels undertaking it, and I also saw some
reports in the Press that that service would
not be regarded as satisfactory by the West
Hon. W. B. ROSS.

Indies parties to the Treaty. Can the Minister tell us whether it is the intention to
put on our Government Marine vessels?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I cannot give
my honourable friend any information on
that point, but I may tell him that lately
one group in the East and another on the
Pacific coast expressed a desire ta enter the
lists. They first wanted to be sure that the
Treaty would go into force, and one of the
parties that approached the Minister of
Finance said that they were trying to arrange
to give a service without any subsidy, that
they did not want to be entangled by any
conditions. Of course, then they would give
a service that suited themselves. With the
awakening interest of the shipping community in that trade, there may develop
within a few months conditions which will
permit of the Minister of Finance to discuss with some company the opportunity of
monopolizing that trade if the company is
ready to come up to the proper level of
service under a subsidy.
The amount of
the subsidy is a matter which is left entirely in the hands of the Government just
now; but they will try to see that it is not
so heavy as to entail the risk of its not
being approved by Parliament-that there is
no money voted except the usual sum voted
in years past.
lon. Mr. DANIEL: I suppose the Minister is not prepared to state what the tender
of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company
;s?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I cannot even
say that there was one. I saw the statement
that there were tenders, but from whom they
come I do not know.
In order to indicate the development of
this trade, I wil1 give a few figures as to
exports and imports.
Our imports in 1913
amounted to $9,864,017; in 1921, to $24,130,552; in 1925, to $25,016,182. Our exports in
1913 a'mounted to $4,967,312; in 1921, to
$18,187,118; in 1925 there was a slight falling
off, and they amounted to $15,432,455.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: What were our
chief exports?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Flour, meats,
lard and substitutes, butter, cheese, condensed milk.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: How is it that there
was a decrease?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I cannot say.
There was a decrease between 1921 and 1925,
but I could not say in what year it occurred. It is hoped, inasmuch as the total

227

JIJNE 10, 1926
imports of those colonies are over $90,000,000, that under the favourable conditions
off ered by these Treaties, we may export
considerably more. We have, as I said, 15
months to implemnexit our obligation as to
ocean facilities, and it is hoped that within.
a few months the shipping interests will be
tempted to accept a reasonaible subsidy for
a better service than we have haid heretof ore.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: May I ask if this
agreement can go into operation with any
of the islands individually, or only with al
of them?
Hon, W. B. ROSS: There are two groups.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: AIL their legislatures have approved, so we are the last to
act.

RAILWAY BELT WATER BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 171, an Act to amend the Railway Belt Water Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the objects
of the Bill are briefly as follows:
To make applicable to the Railway Belt
of British Columbia the Water Acts at present
in force in the rest of the province in the
same way in which The Railway Belt Water
Act, 1913, made the Provincial Water Acts
then in force applicable to the Railway Belt.
Those earlier Acts made applicable by the
Act of 1913 having been repealed by the coming into force of the Revised Statutes of
British Columbia, 1924, the province is at
the present time without legislative authority
to administer the waters of the Railway Belt.
To enable the Governor in Council to make
new or amending Water Acts passed by the
provincial Legislature applicable to the Railway Belt by Order in Council. A similar
provision is contained in the Act of 1913, but
the amending Bill proposes that such Orders
in Council are to be deemed to take effect

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on the Bill.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I hope that the
British Columbia members will help me in
carrying through this Bill. If there is any
clause which calls for special knowledge, I

and the Bill was reported, without amendment.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: I

CANADA EVIDENCE BILL (BANK
BOOKS AND RECORDS)
FIRST READING

Bill X6, an Act to amend the Canada Evidence Act.-Hon. Mr. Dandurand.
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND, by leave of the
Senate, moved the second reading of the
Bill. He said:

229

JUNE 11, 1926
This Bill is substantially the English Bankers' Books Evidence Act of 1879, and the purpos-e is to make,_the administration of justice
more convenient both for crown attorneys and
for the banks.
It will be observed that opportunity is
given, on the application of any party to a
legal proceeding, to have inspection of the
original books or records of a bank, should
there be any reason for making such inspection. In the great mai ority of cases, however, a copy of any entry in a banker's books,
duly authenicated, will be received in cvidence.
Mr. Eric Armour, X.C., Crown Attorney
for the City of Toronto, originated the demand for this legisiation, and has been urging
its enactment for two years past.
Honourable gentlemen may be reminded
that it means that it will be sufficient for an
officiai of the bank to bring to the court
simply copies of entries from ledgers and
other books of the bank. The Bill is not
printed, but it is very short. I would briefly
explain that its object is to obviate the necessity, under the law as it now stands, of bringing bankers to the courts with books of the
bank which are needed every day for the
regular business of the bank. As I have said,
this enactment would be substantially the
English Bankers' Books Evidence Act of 1879,
so, that Great Britain has been abead of us
for the last fifty years. Through experience
gradually gatbered in the administration of
court procedure, it bas been deemed desirable
to embody this legisiation in our own Act. I
give this explanation ini order that when we
take up the Bill i Committee the members
of the Senate may be familiar with its objects.
I move the second reading of the Bill, but
if any honourable gentleman wishes to express an opinion on the second reading he may
move to adjourn the debate.
Hlon, W. B. ROSS: I think it will be better
for the Bill to go to Committee. When ini
Committee I will have an amendment to
move, but not an important one.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Then we will
take the second reading now, and put it down
for Committee next week.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
SITTINOS 0F THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I move that
when the Senate adjourns this afternoon it
do stand adjourned until Monday next at 8
o'clock in the evening.,
I propose that the following procedure be
carried through on Monday evening. There

will be very littie on the Order Paper that
evening, and we could just do justice to the
business, and then suspend the sitting until
ten o'clock, meantime permitting the Banking
and Commerce Committee to meet. 1 say
ten o'clock, because there may be some legislation coming from the Commons, and we
may be able to advance it.
0f course, t1his is not added to my motion,
which is simply that when we adjourn we
stand adjourned until Monday evening at 8
o'clock.
The motion was agreed to.

EXCISE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill No. 188, an Act to amend the
Excise Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the amendment to Section 68 of the Excise Act is proposed as the result of representations made
by the tobacco manufacturing industry in
Canada, to the effect that, at present, the
Excise Act discriminates in favour of imported tobacco and cigars, since such imported
goods may, under the provisions of the Customs Act, be delivered for "Ships' Stores," in
bond, under Customs supervision, and upon
the production of a receipt from the master
of the vessel that such tobacco and cigars
will be used only on the high seas, and not
re-landed in Canada.
Similar regulations have been provided under the Excise Aot, but the difficulty'is that
while there are Customs bonded warehouses
at practically all important maritime ports,
there are very few Excise bonded warehouses,
and the merchants object ta the duplication
of work and the increase of expense which
would be necessary in establishing Excise
bonded warehouses at the same points.
The result is that a demand for imported
goods bas been created, to the detriment of
the Canadian product.
The proposed legislation will, therefore,
rectify the situation without endangering the
protection of the revenue, and by removing
the inconvenience, loss of time, and expense,
due to existing conditions.
With reference to the repeal of paragraph
(f) of Subsection 1, Section 279 of the Excise
Act, it may be stated that the demand for
cigars in packages containing less than ten

234

SENATE

cigars each has grown in popular favour during recent years, although the total production of cigars has seriously decreased. For
example, the number of cigars of domestic
manufacture entered for duty during the fiscal
year ended 31st March, 1920, was 270,089,000;
whereas, during the year ended 31st March,
1925, the number had decreased to 168,097,000.
although for the fiscal year ended 31st March
last a slight increase is observed, the quantity
being 174,059,000.
With regard to cigars contained in small
packages, however, the quantity entered for
consumption during the year ended March
31st, 1925, was 6,666,000, whereas during the
year ended 31st March last, the quantity had
incrcased to 10,888.000. If all of the cigars
in packages containing less than ton cigars
each had been entered for duty at $3 per
thousand, instead of $4, the rate provided by
the Act at present, the loss in revenue for the
fiscal year ended 31st March, 1925, would
have been $6,666, and for the year ended 31st
March last, $10,888. The loss in revenue is
therefore comparatively unimportant, and the
proposed legislation will, no doubt, enable
the cigar manufacturers throughout the Dominion to recover some of the serious loss
in business which has been experienced of
late years.
Hon. Mr. REID: I would like to ask the
honourable leader of the Government if this
request has been made by our Canadian manufacturers. If so, I suppose it is with the
de-ire of helping their export business.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
From the explanatory notes that are before us, I would
infer that the Canadian manufacturers have
complained of this discrimination, and the
proposed amendment will have the effect of
placing bonded domestic and foreign tobacco
and cigars and cigarettes on an equal footing.
Hon. Mr. REID: I would also like to ask,
now that Excise and Customs are united in
one department, whether any Act has been
passed making the regulations as to bond
houses apply to both, so that an amendment
of this kind would not be required.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No, there has
not been such legislation. Although I have
not given any attention to this matter, there
might be some advantage in drawing the attention of the Minister to the question raised
by my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. REID: There were two Departments before, so that manufacturers required
those bonded warehouses, and I was wondering if there had been any Act passed bringing them under the joint Department.
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is quite apparent there bas not been legislation to bring
those two classes of warehouses together,
since we are now proceeding with this amendment to authorize the transfer of goods from
one to the other; but I will draw the attention of the Minister to the question my bonourable friend has raised.
Hon. Mr. REID: I cannot see any reason
why the Minister should not have the right
to deal with these warehouses as though they
were under one Department.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Bill was read the third time and passed.
INCOME WAR TAX BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND
moved the
second reading of Bill 116, an Act to amend
the Income War Tax Act, 1917.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, I have received no memorandum regarding this Bill,
but I may perhaps content myself with saying that the Bill has for its object the reduction of the amount of the income tax on
a graduated scale, and also the creating of
some exemptions. I do not suppose that I
need go very much into a detailed statement
of what the Bill contains.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Bill was read the third time and passed.
POSSESSION OF WEAPONS BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT moved the third
reading of Bill Q3, an Act to amend certain
provisions of the Criminal Code respecting
the Possession of Weapons.
Hon. Mr. MeCORMICK: I have not seen
a copy of this Bill, but might I ask whether
there is any provision in the Bill that the
manufacturer or importer has to take a record
of revolvers that are held by people in the
country, and whether they are obliged by
his Bill to register them.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes, the importer has to keep a register and send a copy t,
the Attorney General of the Province.

JUNE 14, 1926
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time.
On the question, that the Bill do now pass:
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: 1 was going to
suggest to the author of this Bill that he
might include automatie guns and automatic
rifles in the list of weapons included in this
Bill.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: 1 arn quite agreeable to adopting that suggestion.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: If that addition is
to be made, the Bill should be sent back to
the Committee, so that we mnight get sorte

information on the subj oct. .There
a great deal of time spent on this Bill, and
we have had experts giving evidence before
the Committee. I have no objection to automatic shot-guns being included, whether they
are used for sporting purposes or not, but 1
suggest that the Bill be referred back for
further information.
Hon. Mr, GRI]l1SBACH: I would like to
point out that I wrote to the Chairman of
the Committee asking to be heard before the
Committee, but did not receive a reply. It
is a pity that the automatic rifle and shotgun were not included, as they have been forbidden by the gamte laws of most of the
Provinces. The automatie rifle is a dangerous
weapon, and should have been deait with by
the experts who went before the Committee
This is the first opportunity I have had of
discussing the report.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The difficultY
seems to be that on the third reading of a
Bill it is only by unanimous consent of the
House that we can go back and introduce
anything new into the Bill. Under the circumastances, while my honourable friend's
suggestion is a reasonable one, and I would
have agreed to it if it had been made in
Committee, it seems to, me that if this suggestion were taken up at this stage, it wouid
involve the disappearance of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Under the circumstances I will not press the matter, thougb
I think it is an important one.
The motion was agreed to and the Bill
passed.
I move that

SENATE

PRINTING AND DISTRIBUTION OF
PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS
INQUIRY AND DISCUSSION

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR rose in accordance with
the following notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate te
evidences of decay in the service of printing and
distributing parliamentary papers and will inquire:1. What period was covered by the reports contained
in the bound volumes last distributed to Members of
Parliament and to libraries and other institutions
accustomed ,to receive the same; and at Nyahat
date
were these volumes ready for distribution?
2. Are the bound volumes for 1924-25 now available? If not, when are they expected to be ready,
and what has been the cause of any unusual dellay?

He said: Honourable gentlemen, the matter
to which I desire to call attention indicates a
return to the primitive condition when there
was no king in Israel and every subject did
what was right in his own eyes. I refer to
the non-distribution of what are known as
Sessional Papers, those yellow backed bound
volumes that from time immemorial have
been distributed to members of Parliament
and also to universities and libraries throughout the country. I have not got complete information, although I think I know 'the
answer to the questions. I put this matter in
the form of questions in -the hope that in
obtaining the answers to them the representative of the Government in this Chamber
would be seized of information with which he
might work upon his colleagues to secure
resu;ts that others have found it impossible
to secure.
So far as I can ascertain, this distribution
of bound volumes bas been suspended solely
because of a difference of opinion be.tween a
couple of officials of the Government, and
even the influence of the member of the Government supposed to be responsible for the
business under reference has proved unavailing in renoving the deadlock. The inconvenience, of course, is felt by every person who
bas occasion to use these bound volumes.
Under a recent rude and practice of the Distribution Department, members of Parliament
do not get all the blue-books-that is, the
unbound volumes- but only such as they request upon receipt of a card from the Distribution Office. Many members, myself amongst
the number, have not been in the habit of
asking for blue-books, because we knew that
we would get the complete set of departmental
reports bound later on, and it is idle to
duplicate the service. Now we find that since
1923-24 there are no more bound Sessional
Papers available; that we cannot get them,
that universities and libraries cannot get them.
Hon. Mr. POPE.

I am not authorized to speak for the Joint
Committee on Printing of both Houses, of
which I am a member; but I may be permitted to say just this much about it: that that
Committee, supposed to have authority in the
premises, bas on more than one occasion endeavoured to get at the bottom of ýthis deadlock, and without avail has attempted to have
a special meeting to deai with the subject;
but for some reason or other the meeting cannot be brought off, and it is in the hope that
the attention of the 'Government may be
brought to it, and that they will exercise the
autýhority which used to go with the office of
Government to have the distribution renewed,
that I ask the questions now on the paper.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I confess that I
have not been made aware of the difficulty
which the honourable gentleman brings to the
attention of the Senate, and probably the
answer which I am about to give will not
cover the matter that is contained in his remarks. I have here a reply with respect to
the Department of Public Printing and Stationery, which is as follows:
It is .understood that the "bound volumes" in questien are the volumes of Sessional Papers, and the reply
is as follows:
1. (a) (a) Departnnta
repqrts April 1, 1923, to
Marci 31, 1924.
(ii) Departmental reports January 1, 1924, to December 31, 1924.
(iii) Miseellaneous,
February 2, 1925.
(b) Decenmber, 1925.
2. (a) No.
(b) No order for printing has been yet received.

That explains that the order should

have

come from the Joint Committee on Printing; but that Committee not having met, no
order has gone out to the Printing Department. I am somewhat in the dark, and do not
know exactly what the difficulty is; but perhaps, if I draw it to the attention of the Minister-whose name my honourable friend will
kindly give me-I may obtain further information on the subject.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: If I may be permitted
to add a word of explanation. The Minister
is the Minister of Labour: he has to do with
the Printing Department. The service has
been authorized by the Joint Committee on
Printing from time immemorial. I had occasion to look up that matter, and I find that
that procedure was formally authorized 60
years ago, and it has been supplemented over
and over again, and until now there bas never
been any question about it. Some personwhom I do not care to indicate in the absence
of full information-l-as intervened recently
and refused to give the executive order without which the Printing Departmeot ecmnot go

237

JUNE 15, 1926
ahead with the binding of these volumes. The
matter is already printed, because these volumes are simply extra copies of the departmental reports. There is no question of cost
entering into it, the cost being very immaterial. It is simply, as I see 'it, a matter Q£
stubborness on the part of an officiael.
If the Joint
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Committee on iPrinting gave such an order,
would it not be carried out?
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: They do not give tihe
executive order; they authorize distribution
to libraries, universities, and memibers of Parliament.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My honourable
friend will perhaps recail that onlyr a few
years ago some question arose over the distribution of the expense of printing the departmental reports, and I think I 'have heard
that there is some question as to whether the
expense entailed in the binding of these volumes should be charged to the Departments,
any or àlI of them, or whether it should be
charged to the account of Parliament, and
that therefore no executive order has been
issued for the work. This is a matter that I
think should easily be adjusted, and I am sure
the Leader of the Government will he glad
to look into it.
I would infer
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
that if there is some friction between two or
more Departments, Council could perhaps
intervene.

He said: Honourable gentlemen, there are
on the Order Paper two Buis wlhîch have some
relation to each other. I may have occasion
in the course of my remarks to refer to both
Bis, nainely, an Act to amend the Immigration Act, andI an Act to amend the Criminal
Code. I may say at the outiset that, although
some relation exists between them, they can
be treated separateîy, and one may be
adopted without the other being approved.
They are not so linked tihat their fate must
be the same.
The Bill which is now under review i.s a
very short one:
Section forty-one of the Immnigration Act Obepter
twenty-seven of the Statutoe of 1910, as enacted bY
Chapter twenty-six of the ýStatutes Of 1919, is repeaied.

In order that honourable gentlemen many
have a fuller grasp of the matter, I will read
section forty, whioh is not repealed. It comes

under the heading of "Deportation of prohibited andI undesirable classes." Section 40,
which will remain in force, is not affected by
this amendment. It reads as follows:
Wlsenever any person, other than a Canadian citizen
or person liaving Canadian domicile-

I revert to the interpretation clause, which
says that "Canadian domicile can only be
acquired, for the purposes of this Act, by a
person having his domicile for five years in
Canada after having been landed therein
within the meaning of this Act."
Whenever any person, other than a Canadian citizen
or person hav.ing Canadian domicile, shall be found.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The clause
which it is desired to repeal reads as follows:
41. Every person who by word or act in Canada
seeks to overthrow by force or violence the government
of or constituted law and authority in the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland or Canada, or
any of the provinces of Canada, or the government
of any other of His Majesty's dominions, colonies,
possessions or deipendencies, or advocates .the assassination of any official of any of the said govermments or
of any foreign government, or who in Canada defends
or suggests the unlawful destruction of property or by
word or aet creates or attemipts to croate any riot or
public disorders in Canada, or who without lawful
authority assuines any powers of government in Canada
or in any part thereof, or who by common repute
belongs to or is suspected of belonging te any secret
society or organization wlich extorts imoney from or
in any way attempts to control any resident of Canada,
by force or by threat of bodily harm, or by blackmail,
or who is a mnenber of or affiliated with any organization entertaining or teaching disbelief in or opposition
to organized government sihall, for the punposes of this
Act, be deemed to belong to tise prohibited or undesirable classes, and shall be liable te deportation in the
manner provided by this Act, and it shall be the duty
of any officer becoming cognizant thereof and of the
clerk, secretary or other official of any municipality in
Canada wherein any such person may be, forthwith to
send a written complaint to the Minister, giving full
particulars:
Provided-

I would draw the attention of lonourable
gentlemen to this provisoProvidied, that this section shall net apply to any
person who is a British subject, either by reason of
birth in Canada., or by reason of naturalization in
Canada.

This proviso does not include the Britisher
who has acquired Canadian domicile. "Any
person who is a British subject either by
reason of birth in Canada" means any Canadian born here, as most of us have been.
Any person who is a British subject "by
reason of naturalization in Canada" means
any alien, not a Britisher, who bas come to
Canada and become a naturalized subject.
The British-born coming from other parts
of the British Empire are thus excluded.
They can gain Canadian domicile by five
years' residence, under clause 40, but they
shall not be excepted from the operation of
clause 41.
An alien coming from any part
of the globe who obtains his letters of
naturalization in Canada cannot be deported
without a trial. He cannot be deported at
all under this clause, for the simple reason
that the acquisition of his Canadian nationality has deprived him of any country to
which he might be deported.
But the
Britisher who comes from the British Isles,
who is net a British subject by reason of
birth in Canada or naturalization in Canada,
can be deported even if he has been here
thirty or thirty-five years. A certain number
of honourable members of this Chamber, and
Hon. Mr. McMEANS.

certainly His Honour the Speaker, could be
deported without a trial if a Board of Inquiry so decided.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: If he were guilty of
any of these offences, it would be a good
thing to' deport him.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The explanatory
note on the page accompanying Bill 91 gives
the following explanation, among others, for
the withdrawal of this clause:
This Bill is designed:-(a) To niake deportation ,for certain causes dependent
upon a conviction in Canada, under Part Il of the
Criminal Code, relating to offences against public order,
rather thon upon a hearing before a Board of Inquiry,
concerning certain offences under section 41 of the Immigration Act:
(b) To remove the discrimination-

And I refer to this proviso(b) To remove the discrimination against the British
born as it stands in the eîsting section, by recognizing
his Canadian citizenship as in the case of the alien
bon who bas been naturalized in Canada.

I believe that the declaration contained in
that note is absolutely true, and I will stand
by it until some honourable mem'ber of this
Chamber succeeds in convincing me that a
different interpretation should be placed upon
those two clauses.
There is one of the reasons why section 41
should be repealed. But there is one more
important Bill, or at least as important. We
all remember how this clause 41 came to be
enacted in its present terms. The situation
which gave rise to this legislation has passed,
and it is no longer necessary to retain this
provision in the Immigration Act.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Would
the honourable gentleman say why it is not
necessary now, but was then?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My honourable friend wi:ll remember how it came to be
placed on the Statute Book in 1919. There
had been a formidable revolution in one of
the largest countries of the world, Russia, and
it was feared that the ideas that were current
in that country would be disseminated in
Canada, and there had been throughout this
country an agitation which caused Parliament
to fear that there might be some men acting
for the same purposes as those who had
succeeded in bringing about the revolution in
Russia. Therefore the clause was enacted as
it now stands.
The view that the clause bas accomplished
its purpose has been concurred in by the
House of Commons. The section, as the
House of Commons believe, puts altogether
too much power into the hands of the Board
of Inquiry, which, according to section 22 of

JUNE 15, 1926
the Immigration Act, may be composed of
but one officer, who in the very nature of
things may be a man largely if not wholly
without legal training. I would call attention
to section 13 of the Act which says:
The Minister niay nominate at any port of entry
any number of officers not exceeding five, any three
of whom may act as a Board of Inquiry for the
summary determination of all cases of immigrants,
passengers or other persons, seeking to enter or land
in Canada or detained for any cause under this Act.

Section 22 says that when there is no Board
of Inquiry at a port of entry, then the officer
in charge shaH exercise the powers and discharge the duties of a Board of Inquiry and
shal. follow as nearly as may be the procedure
of such Board as regards hearing and appeal
and ail other matters over which it has
jurisdiction.
The Minister niay authorize any immigration officer
to exercise the powers and discharge the duties of a
Board of Inquiry and such officer so authorized rnay
exercise such powers and discharge sudh duties et
any place in Canada other than a port of entry.

Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
from that decision?

Is there no appeal

There is an
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
appeal to the Minister. The section, as I have
stated, puts altogether too much power into
the hands of the Board of Inquiry which may
be composed, as I have just said, of one
immigration officer, who in the very nature of
the case will be a man largely if not wholly
without Jegal training.
It is in the public interest and more in
accord with British methods of justice that
determination of undesirability as defined by
section 41 of the Immigration Act shah be
left to our regular courts of justice rather
than to the decision of an Immigration Board.
Canada is amply protected when provision
is made for deportation of a person convicted
of a criminal offence in Canada. I have read
clause 40, which is to remain in the Act, and
which declares that anyone may be deported
who has been convicted of a criminal offence
in Canada. The deportation of such person is
provided for in section 40 of -the Immigration
Aet. The undesirable classes of section 41,
to be repealed, are included in Part II of the
Criminal Code, and therefore the repeal of
section 41 does not remove the power of
deportation. It merely makes it dependent
upon a court conviction rather than on the
order of an Immigration Board.
Labour also considers it a discrimination
against the British-born to make him liable
to deportation regardless of his length of
residence in Canada, when aliens naturalized
in Canada are placed beyond the power of

239

deportation the moment they become
No person bas yet been
naturalized.
deported under the authority of section 41
of the Act of 1919; there is therefore no
ground for believing that the repeal of
section 41 will remove any power or authority
now exercised for the protection of Canada.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: Do
I understand my honourable friend to say
that every offence which is indicated in section
41 as it now stands is provided for as to
trial and conviction in the Criminal Code?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Every one of
those offences. I have the dictum of the
Department of Justice and the Minister of
Justice himself on the floor of the House.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Does not the British
subject become a naturalized Canadian or a
Canadian citizen after five years' residence?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: He does not
become naturalized: he is a British subject.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: He becomes a Canadian citizen, does he not, after five years'
residence?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: He acquires
Canadian domicile after five years; but under
clause 41 he is excluded from the class of
Britishers having their naturalization by being
Canadianborn or by reason of naturalization
in Canada. A Canadian citizen means a person born in Canada who has not become an
alien, or a British subject who has Canadian
domicile, or a person naturalized under the
laws of Canada who has not subsequently
become an alien or lost his Oanadian domicile.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Then a Britisher
obtains Canadian domicile after being here
five years. Does not that put him in that
class?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAÑD: I will read the
proviso of clause 41, and my honourable
friend will see that the Britisher born outside
of Canada does not fall under that class.
Provided that this seotion shaH not apply to any
person who is a British subject, either by reason of
lirth in Canada, or by reson of naturalization.

All the others fall under the operation of
clause 41. So that the Britisher who was not
born in Canada, or the alien who was not
naturalized in Canada, can always be deported
from the country.
Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: Is there no way
by which British subjects can become
Canadian citizens by residence in Canada?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: A British subject can acquire Canadian domicile after
five years.

2-10

SENATE

Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: That makes hirn a
Canadian citizen?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, but that
does flot free him from the operation of
clause 41, because hie -has been excluded.
Hon. Mr. MüMEANS: I always understood
that a man born in England, for instance,
and coming to Canada and living here for
five years, obtained Canadian citizeniship.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable gentlemen, I think we are confusing two t-hings.
When you speak of Canadian citizenship,
you rnay speak .of it so far as our elections
are eoncernedHon. Mr. MoMEANS:

No.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: These expressions are
used in this law and put there for the carrying
out of this law only. When the Immigration
Act was framed you had to make provi8ion
for deportation, and you had to limit the
conditions under which it might take place.
For that reason the words Canadian citizenship, domicile, and other expressions of that
character had to be defined. A Britishier cornes
to Canada and resides here for a year, and
for three months in the district, and lio bas
ail the rights -of a Canadian citizen so far as
the elections are concerned, but lie has riot
the rights of a Canadian citizen under the
Immigration law. A man comes tu Candah
and in the course of two years becomes insane.
You will not say that he has reached the stage
where we in this country should care for him
and maintain him. Consequently the provisions as laid down in the law. that if a man
who cornes frorn another part of the British
Empire bas any of the disqualifications that
make him deportable, we have the right to
deport him. After lie has been here five
years and acquired domicile or become a
Canadian citizen, then we cannot deport him.
Hon. Mr. DAN-'DURAND:
clause 41.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
under clause 41.

Quite

Except under
right-except

,Hon. Mr. DAINDURAND: I draw the attention of honourable gentlemen tii the very
clear distinction made in the description of
the people who are deportable under clause
40 and under clause 41. What does clause 40
Say?
Whcnever env pereqon, other than a Canadien citizen
or person having Canadian domicile, ahall be found
an iniîate of or coîinected with the mianaement ofetc.

Tiiere the termis are much wider. It is a
Canadian citizen or a citizen having acHon. Mr. DANDURAND.

quired Canadian domicile, and I draw the
attention of the Senate to the fact that
under the definition of ýCanadian donmicile an
alien can get Canadian domicile.
He may
flot have bis letters of naturalization, but he
will have acquired Canadian dumicile just as
a Britisher coming frorn some other part of
the Empire.

'So, under clause 40, which remains, ail
Canadian citizens and ail persons having
Canadian domicile will be deportable if they
comnmit any of the offenses set out in clause
40, or if they are convicted of a criminal
offence in 'Canada. Now, if clause 41 disappears,

thon ail the offences

contained

in

that clause will be tried before our courts,
and all those convicted of such offences before our courts will be deportable undeýr
clause 40.
Hon. *Mr. CASGRAIN:
take them to?

Where will you

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Thev will be

deportable to the countries froým which they
have corne.
I statedc that there was some relation

between Bill 91 and Bill 153.

If honouraýble

gentlemen will look at Bill 153, they wil
sec that it seeks tii repeal sections 97A and
97B of the Crirninal Code, and that those
sections contain, in practically the same
words, aIl the offences that are ment mmcd in
section 41.
You will be asked to repeal
those clauses, and tii restore the clauses that
they replaced, in order to rcturn tii the terrnis
of the ýCriminal Code, w'hich allowed the
courts to deal with ahl these cases.
Now. if a, majority of the Senate feels
some doubt as to the detailcd offences falling
clearly under the law as it was hefore 1919,
they wilI be at liberty to retain them. We
wvill discuss the Bill on its merits whien it
cornes before us; but 'the present ternis, or
the ternis which will be expressed in the
Criminal Code after Bill 153 bas been
adopted, are suffictient tii brtng before the
courts all the parties that have committed
offences which are dieflnýed under clause 41.
I ay that in order thaýt honourable mcmbers of the Senate may free their minds fnom
the idea that the rejection of clause 41 can

have any important effeet on the Crimin-al
Code. The Criminal Code as it îs, or as it
will be after we have passed Bihl 153, will
give ail the necessary powers tii the courts
tii demI. with ail the offences contained in
clause 41.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: Has there been any
person subjected tii injustice under the Act
Of 1919?

JUNE 15, 1926
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
There has
not been one single case dealt with under
that clause.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Then why should
we worry about it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am not worrying about it, but there are trades and
labour unions that have repeatedly, if not
annually, asked that clause 41 be repealed.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: They do not need
to worry. They are very law-abiding citizens.
Hon. Mr. DANIDURAND: We have given
them some rights: we recognize certain
rights.
We have recognized the right to
strike and the right of picketing. There are
numerous rights which they can exercise for
their protection.
Hon. Mr. TANNER:
I thought the
Supreme Court stated the other day that
picketing was unlawful.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I do not re-member what has taken place with regard to
some clauses of the Criminal Code which
allow of picketing and define it; but I know
that I had occasion some forty years ago to
sit as a magistrate during a holiday, and to
decide a most important case as to the right
of employees in the port of Montreal to
picket and notify the public coming to the
steamers that a strike was on. I remember
deciding that the employees had gone beyond
the exercise of their right of picketing. I
camiot say what amendments have been
made in this connection, but the labour
people say that Parliament is giving immigration agents a power which should belong
to the courts. Immigration agents have considerable discretion in refusing to receive an
immigrant; but when an immigrant has been
allowed to come into the country and has
been here for a few years, I believe it is
very imprudent to allow an immigration agent
who has no legal training or experience to
decide upon the merits or actions of that
immigrant or of a Britisher who has been
here for twenty years. I ask honourable
gentlemen to think of an immigration agent
having to decide whether a person is a member of or affiliated with any organization
"entertaining or teaching disbelief in or opposition to organized government." I contend, honourable gentlemen, that such matters would be most difficult to ascertain. There
may be newspaper articles, or pamphlets, or
articles written, which will require the best
trained legal mind to make a proper distinction between a fair right to criticize and
something that is not fair. Surely all this

241

appertains to the tribunals of this country,
and not to an immigration agent. A man
who has come here with his family and who
has been here for a few years, or, in the
case of the British-born, who has been here
twenty years, and who falls under this clause,
can be ordered out of the country.
It is true, as honourable gentlemen may
say, that there is an appeal to the Minister.
I am convinced that the Minister would
exercise his best judgment; but in times of
stress and difficulty you could possibly project into this matter the political action of
the Minister. At all events, whatever may be
the reasons for fear on the part of the labour
unions, they say that these are, under the
British conmtitution, matters which are all too
important to be treated so lightly as to be
confided to an immigration agent, or three
immigration agents, forming a Board of Inquiry; that these matters should go before
the tribunals of the country; that it is the
right of any Britisher to appeal to the courts
for his protection; that under clause 40 anyone who is convicted of any of these offences
can then be deported.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
The
honourable gentlemen stated, I think, in the
course of his speech, that everything covered
by section 41 of the Immigration Act as it
now stands is covered by the Criminal Code.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Would
the honourable gentleman be kind enough to
tell me where I may find that? Is he willing to have this clause transferred to the
Criminal Code and the matter left to the
judges?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I am asking a
similar question.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Wait a
moment.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I referred a
moment ago to sections 97A and 97B of the
Criminal Code; but they are in Bill 153,
which seeks to repeal those clauses.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: But Bill
153 seems to me to wash out all the merit
there is in the Criminal Code.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The, Iepartment of Justice and the Minister of Justice
claim that these are useless, becaùse under
the Criminal Code, sections 132 and l 'iwill
suffice to bring all persons guilty of sedition
before the Criminal Courts
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Yes, but not to
convict them.

14015-16
REVISED EDITION

SENATE

242

Section 132
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
defines sedition. The Act declares sedition
to be an offence. But my honourable friend
will sec that, after declaring sedition to be
an offence, and before 1919, when we enacted
sections 97A and 97B, there was this saving
clause, section 133, which it is desired to reinstate in-the Code. My honourable friend
will find it printed in Bill 153, at page 2.
After declaring that "sedition" is an offence,
section 133 says:

the representatives of the Department, that
there have been deportations under clause 40,
but none under 41.
New, in order to draw the attention of
honourable members of the Senate more
closely to the danger of section 41 remaining
to be interpreted by an ordinary immigration
agent, I would point out the exception which
is contained in the British Act, and which
until 1919 was always in our own legislation,
but was replaced by 97A:

No one shall be deened to have a seditious intentien only because he intends in good faith,(a) te show that His Mojesty has been misled or
mistaken in his measures; or,
(b) to point out errors or defents in the governent
or constitution of the United Kingdon, or of any part
of it, or of Canada or any province thereof, or in
either House of Parlianient of the United Kingdom or
of Canada, or in any legislature, or in the administration of justice; or to excite His Majesty'a subjects
te attempt to procure, by lawful means, the alteration
of any natter in tihe state; or,
(c) to point out, in order to their removal, matters
which are producing or have a tendency to preduce
feelings of hatred or il-will between different classes
of His Majesty's subjects.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Section 133 was repealed by the Act of 1919.

But
Hon. Mr. LYNClH-STAUNTON:
would the honourable gentleman permit me?
New Section 133 declâres thait certain acts
shall not be considered seditious now, and on
the face of them they look very innocent.
If this is not passed, may I ask the honourable gentleman, could a man be convicted of
sedition for any one of the acts mentioned
there?

Yes, section
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
133 was repealed by the Act of 1919, which
enacted sections 97A and 97B. The purpose
of Bill 153 is to restore the old law by repealing sections 97A and 97B.
Of course, it will be for the Senate to decide whether or not it is advisable to repeal
these sections. The Senate may decide net
to repeal them; that, although superfluous
they may well remain. However, that in no
wise affects clause 41 of the Immigration Act,
which it is now desired to repeal. When we
come to discuss the amendment of the
Criminal Code it will be for the Senate to
sec that there is retained in the Code all
the necessary machinery to bring offenders
for trial before the Criminal Courts.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBAOH: I would like to
ask this question, which I have been trying
to put for some time: how many deportations
have there been under this clause in the
different years?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is a very
broad question, and, although these clauses
were dropped, I would say that I could carry
my point if I had such a defence as is allowed
me under section 133; that I could carry my
case to the highest tribunal before accepting
conviction. For I know of indictments that
are made against the Government by His
Majesty's loyal Opposition in most virulent
speeches ýboth in the House of Commons
and outside.

14015-161

Hon. Mr. DANDLTRAND: My honourable
friend is in error. I do not say they shall not
be deported: 1 say they should have a trial.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Why would you
not give the others a trial?
Hon. Mr. DANDUIIAND: Because when
you are axamining into the very dellicate question of what constitutes a seditious article in
a newspaper or a book, you. meet with difficulties that you do not meet with in the
case of a police oficer going into a hoeuse of
ili-fame and finding a womnan living there, because in this case tlhe facts are easily ascertained, whereas an important part of the
offences described in section 41 faîl into the
class of matters that are very hard to decide.
With this explanation, I submit that we ean
safely repeal section 41 and leava it to the
courts to decide who are desirabla citizens and

we free the British.'born who have -been in
this country for years fromn the odium of baing
hiable to deportation without trial.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen, I have only a few words to say about
Bill 91. Some nine years ago this Parliament
passed the law which it is now proposed to
repeal. At that time the concensus of opinion
in Parliamant was that the measure was
necessary. It has been on the Statute Book
ever since, and I uiiderstand thera has neyer
been any injustice or wrong done' to anyone
under it, though the administration of it has
heen in the hands of the immigration authorities all the time. This is the fourth, or at
least the third, turne it has been proposed to
repeal section 41.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 would point
out to my honourable friand that the amendment is not in the samne form. I trust hae
will not ha prajudiced against it.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: It is practically the saine.
IJndar the law as it stands now a man may
ha daalt with by a Board if thare is a strong
suspicion of his being an undesirable citizen.
Having been dealt with by the Board, if hie
is ordered to be deported, hie has an appeal

to the Ministar.

Now,

I arn not ready to-day

to go back upon the decision that this Housa
has taken fromn the tima it gave its sanction
to section 41 of the Immigration Act until
the present tima. Thera are, I supposa, diffarances of opinion in tha House, but I sea no
necassity for this amendment being made now.
The time may corne when this House may
prepare a Bill dealing with both the Immigration Act and the criminal law of this country.
But thse thing is very inuch znixed uzp, and

244

SENATE

when the time comes to deal with it--which
I think has not yet arrived-it will have to
be dealt with with a great deal of care and
at a juncture when the House has abundance
of time to study every word and every clause
in the Bills which are presented. The position
I take is that this Bill is entirely premature.
This matter can very well stand over for the
future, because there is not the slightest
chance of any honest, law-abiding man who
comes into this country being in any way
molested under this provision.
As to the amendment to the Criminal Code
to which my honourable friend has referred,
we can deal with that when we come to it.
It is p-radticalily a new law and will have to be
very carefully considered. However, I need
not express an opinion as to that now.

IHon. Mr. MeMEANS: Honouvaible gentlemen, I have one or two renarks to make in
regard to the Bill now before the House.
Perhaps the Leader -of the Government can
give me some further information 'that will
rermove the idoubts in my mind as to the proposai to repeal section 41. I find that section
41 wias primarily enacted in 1910, land was
re-enacted in 1919. In 1910 there was no
trouble arising either from the war or from
strikes, but that was the law of this country,
and under it any person guilty of sedition
could be deported without trial. The effec't
of this Bill, as I read it, it to repeal the clause
enacted in 1910 so far as it relates to certain
classes of people guility of sedition, and
nothing is substituted fer it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend is right in saying that the elements of
clause 41 were enacted prior to 1919. Those
powers were never utilized, and the law did
not apply, as it does now, to the Britishborn who has been in the country for a number of years.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
If 'this Bill is
passed, we will have no law under which a
person could be deported for sedition.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
We wil!l have
:section 40, which deals with anyone who is
convicted of a criminal offence.
Hon. M. McMEANS:
I want to draw a
distinction. If a man is accused of a crime,
he has to be tried, and if found guilty he
has to be punished; but we do not accuse a
man who comes in iere and attempts to
disturb the country; we simply say: "From
what we know about you, you are an undesirable citizen." We do not want that man

Hon. Mr. MdMEANS:
If people come
across the boundary who should not have
come across, there should be some right to
deport them. My honourable friend has laid
a great deal of stress on the BritishJborn. I
am British-born, and have the highest
respect for those people; but may I point
out that at the time of the revolutionary
strike in the city of Winnipeg, which had
such a bad effect upon that city and upon
Canada as a whole, the men who organized
that incipient revolution were a'! Britishborn. It is not the foreigner who gives the
trouble.
The leaders of these people are
from the British Islands, chiefly from England and Scotland. They preach their doctrines to the uneducated, to the foreigners,
and consequently I claim they are more
dangerous to the peace and wel'fare of this
country than are the men from any other
country.
At the time of the Winnipeg strike men
flocked in from the United States, members
of the I.W.W. and other organizations that
were inimical to the peace of this country,
and who had for their purpose the overthrow of the Government. They wanted to
take a handi in the affair. Doas my honourable friend say that that is the time to
charge them with a crime, and to try them,
when you have not any evidence to convict
them?
Is not the proper time to act the
moment you know that they are there for
that purpose? Was it not a good thing that
this Act was in force so that they could
be deported? Do you think any man of a
good character would be accused of sedition
and deported? I venture to say that there
never has been such a case. But the man who
makes his living by preaching these doctrines
says, "You cannot stop me from coming into
Canada, and before you can put me out you
have- to lay an information against me and
prove it." How are you going to prove it if

he is a member of a secret society, the members of which are all under oath?

country is honeycombed with people who, are
preaching these doctrines, even in the Sunday
schools. Are we going to open the doors and
let them corne in, and provicle that we canneot deport thern unless we charge thern with
a crime and convict thern? If some of the
terms of the Act are too, strong, let us redraft the clause but leave the principle untoudhed-a principle that, las been in f orce
since 1910O-so that men of that class may
be deported.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourable gentlemen, I have been trying
to reconcile sorne of the answers that have
been given with sorne of the refutations of
thern by other speakers, and my mind is
nlot clear with reference to this matter. I
find that you propose to strike out the old
clause 41, which states, so Vhat lie who runs
may read, just what those practices are wqiich
are crîminal. The law lias the purpose of
teaching as well as of restricting and punishing, and the plainer the definitions of erimmnal offenef so that the cominon man can
understand them the 'better, for then yon
are flot only rnaking the law clear, but yeu
are teaching every person who reads it
exactly what it means.
As I understood my honourable friend,
every one of the speci fic offences mentioned
in clause 41 would be retained in the Crimmnal code. That lias been refuted on this
side of the House, and frorn what my honourable friend said a littie later in reply to
the honourable gentleman from Hamilton
(Hon. Mr. Lyncli-Staunton) ,- I got the imnpression that although they were in the
Crifmnal Code they were down under the
surfa ce-tha-t th-ey are included in one or two
words the purport of which is that they are
seditious practices. Arn I riglit or wrong in
that? Show me the place in the Criminal
Code where every one of thoise acte which
are alleged ta lie crirninal are defined- in
exactly the same language. Or do you say
they are in the Criminal Code liecause it
deals with seditious practices, and the interpretation of legal men is so and so? If my
impression is correct, the argument lias not
been tresaed to a point where it commenda
itself to the attention of people who want
the law made clear. Maybe rny impression
is wrong.
Hon. Mr. DANDTJRAND: When it cornes
to a repetition of the words whiéh are in section 41, I believe they are to lie found in the

245

law as it is; 'but the Bill which follows this
one seeks to withdraw the repetition -of words
bm'ause the Departuient of Justice believes
that ail those repetitions corne under the
clauses which define sedition, seditious libel,
seditious words, libel on foreign sovereigns,
etc. The statement of the Dc'partment of
Justice is that praeticsilly a repetition of the
words in section 41 are to lie found in 97B of
the Criminal Code--that all those words fail
under a general clause which wiâl bring before the courts anyone who is guilty of a-ny
of the offences named in section 41.
I have state-d that it will be for the Senate
te decide whether it is opportune to retain al]
those words detailing the offences in 97A and
97B. The Senate may, in its judgrnt, accept or reject the second Bill. If the Senate
prefers to have the whole liet of offences in
clause 41 iternized and detailed in the Crimmnai Code, it will only have te reject the Bill
which is to follow, which seeks to withdraw
thern. I do not know whether I have made
myself clear.

again to the Criminai Code. The second tbing
wbicb is equally important, maybe more so,
is this. When Parliament bas once defined
in plain English what these people should not

that anything which makes it easy for a badactor to get into our country and stay here
to carry on bis bad conduct is flot for the

the argument that when you give him locus,
you give hjm a place to stand, you give bim

Do you know that in the United States of

along with an organized systemn of villainy,
extending in a hundrcd different directions,
there exists a system of legal defence for that
villainy, and it is the business of some of the
acutest and subtlest minds in the legal profession in that country to defend people of
that class. Tbey have ample funds-funds
by the thousands-by the bundreds of thousands--by the millions, and there are companies organized to bail out those people. Se
this legal combination can go on fighting
conviction until witncsses die or vaniýsb, and
only a small proportion of persons accused
can be brought to absolute punishmcnt. That
is the condition in the United States of
America. It is filtering into Canada. Thcre
is no customs barrier that can keep eut sucli
tbings, and that same sort of disloyalty to law
and order and the conventions of socictv is
creeping over into our country and is showing itself cvery year more and more. We
must be on our guard against that. There
must be a summary method by which a bad
man may be prcvcntcd from action until you
can bring evidence to show that he bas cornmitted an overt act and can punish him
according to the regular code and the regular
procecdings. I think that these are matters
which ought to be very seriously considered.
Why can we not allow this amendiment to
stand? It costs little to pnint it and kenei it
in the air. If there is nced for a better

court by judge or jury, or by the appropriate
tribunal. 1 think so stili. By the statute as
passed in 1910 you said to t!his mnan, whoever hie might lie: "You have no longer a
right to apply and obtain a writ of habeas
corpus and to have your custody inquired
into by a court." Every other British suliWet, every other man who sets foot upon
Canadian soil, if restrained of 'his liberty,
has an undoubted right upon application to
the court to have his case inquired into, the
causes of his detention sho,*n, and the judge
or court satisfied that at least there was a
eiiarge, against himn which muet lie tried by
the- judicial tribunals of the country.
As
long as the present enactmnent, stands you
take away from. qnyone who is cbarged under
it the right to the ordinary trial by the ordinary tribunals of the country. Looking at
it from the standpoint of the mnan who rnay
be innocent, that seerns to me a moet grievous wrong, and unhesitatingly I support the
prespnt measure for repeal.
Hon. F. F. PARDEB : I have a very few
words to say on this matter. The présent
Act was passed in 1910, and since that time
there have been very few, if any, deportations under it. It seerns to have worked no
hardship wbatever.
The clas of persons aimed at in the Act
are the most dangerous class for many reasons, that can corne into a community. We
have had examples in this country, and we
have examples in other countries, where such
people have stirred up the unwelf are, if 1
may sQ express it, of the people, more than
any other class of whidh I know.
It m-ay he that the provisions of the Act
are not ail that, they should be, but I agre
with iny hionourable friend from Regina
<Hon. Mr. Calder) when he says that no
single immigration officer, no two immigration officers, would ever dare to take into
their own hands the déportation of a man unleas
t'he facts absolutely -called for it. It would
not. be done unless practically the wbole
Governmnent was consulted about it. Undex
those circumstances it appears to me that
if you take this class of men befôre thie
courtsR, you do one thing that has flot been
xnentioned this afternoon-a tbing that in
the United States is a source of greiat lawleseness: you place thern before what you
eal a, proper txïlbunal; that means a trial ýby
jury, because under Vlie Criminal Code they
are entitled to it; if you once put this lais
of case before a jury-and I tlhink in this I
will be borne out by every lawyer ûnd Iayman in this House-the present combination
of crinjinals, and etinal lawyens wilI result
in a disagreement on the part of -the jury

249

nineteen times out of twenty. This class of
case is more serious to, a country than almost
any other that you can naine. It disrupts
labour as a class, and every other walk of
ife.
Sorne lionourable gentlemen seem to think
that the present statute is not sufficient as
to finding out whetber or not a man is
guilty. As I said a moment ago, it has not
been shown that since 1910 any hardiship or
any injustice lias been worked upon anybody; so I say that bef ore we change this
who>le Act, and change the mode of trial,
there should be sorne discussion beyond the
two hours' considération that we have given
to it as to what tribunal should he formed
to conduct these trials. As this'provision lhas
stood. since 1910, 1 do not think very much
harni will be dune by leaving it over to
another Session.
Hon. Mr. BEIjCOURT: May I add two
words. IJ wish to show that in cases which
might arise, and probably would arise, there
would be a very grievous injustice done if a
trial were refused. I arn not for one moment
quies.tioning the right of any nation to say
wbo shall be allowed to cornte into its country
to stay. I admit that as a principle; that
I do not think ils susceptible of contradiction.
Unquestionably Canada lias every right to say
who shail corne into Canada. Meantirne, you
rnay have this case. Take one who has acquired a C-anadian domicile, one who lias 'bée
allowed 4,o corne in and is qualifying for full
Canadian citizenship. There bas been a sort
of agreernent, a sort of contract between the
Canadian state and that person. H1e bas been
adrnitted into the country after bis record
elsewhere bas heen inquired into. It is the
Iaw of ail nations.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Wherc'
does the honourable gentleman get authority
for the staternent that it i s international law
that there is an irnplied contract once a man
cornes in?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: 1 arn speaking of
the jus gentiurn, not of strict international law.
A rnan cornes to Canada and says: "I want to
enter your country; here is my record." That
is go-ne into, and lié is allowed to corne in
and to put in the period whioh is necessary in
order to give hirn full Canadian citizenship.
Now, whilst hie is qualifying to become a real
Canadien subjeot lie is accused of cornmitting
a seditiouk. art, a seditious libel or.,overt act
of sorne kind. I say that man is èntitled
to a trial. H1e bas not acquired full citdzenship, but is on the way. But hie is refused
a trial'and is deported. That, 1 say,7is art
injustice. I agrée absolutely witb those wbo

"No, you cannot come in," but if. aîter

lie is entitlýed to a trial.
Riglit Hon. Sir GEOReGE E. FOSTER:
Has my bonourable friend taken account ni
the fact that lie cornes in under a la.w wliicb
is existent and whici lie is supposed to know.
If one of the provisions of ýthat law clearly
states that if within a certain period after lie
bas corne in certain develnprnents take place
-say that he is sliown to lic of a weak mind
or to have a trace of insanity, or any other
ni hall a dozen things whicli may be sbownis it not irnplied in our contract tibat he rnay

Tbe cases arc
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
different. He bais corne in, not under f alse
pretences, but niter lie lias onfor.med to thle requirpments to whicb the right honourable
gentleman has referred; and if it is found
afterwvards that wben lie came in lie was not
within the requirements -of the law, I quite
understand that lie can be deported. But the
other case is entîrely different. It is a case ni
accusing a man nf a crime, an overt act, ni ter
bis admission, and you are going to deport
himi.
Does
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUJNTON:
not the honourable gentleman know that there
are innumerable cases ni that, nnd that men
are extradited witbout trial?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I quite agren witli
my honourable friend. That is by agreernent
under treaty. My lionourable friend knows
that extradition is always a matter of treaty.
I arn not dealing witb this matter as a question ni international law. but rathler as an
invitaxtion that wc cxt.end to people outside
to corne and live witb us and qualify for
Canadian eitizenship, and wbo. wbile qualifying, are accused ni a crime.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: We say: "ilere is
a man we do ot want in this country 'because we bave reason to believýe tiat lie wil
distutlb the peace of the country." If lie were
accuscd of a crime, I would agree witb my
bonourable friend.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I amrn ot speaking ni a man wbo cornes to Canada and asks
to be admitted. I have dealt with that. I
arn trying to make a distinction between that
man and the man who lias been allowed to
corne in to qualify in order te, become a
Canadian citizen. If this Bill passes lie rnay

quired sorne rights, the extent of which 1 do
flot wish to deterinine. Everynne must admit that if lie lias spent two or three years in
qualifying to become a Canadian citizen lie
lias acquired a status of somne kind. He is
deprived of that and is deported without
having a cliance of explaining or defending
hirnself. Wlien tliis legisiation was passed,

Would you also
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
repeal section 40?
Hon. Mr. BELGOURT: Certainly, and I
think on stronger grounds that 41.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Honourable gentlemen,
I arn not ready at this moment to express
a definite opinion on the merits of the
present Bill, but I must confess that I was
very mucli impressed by the words whicli
were pronounced by tlie lionourable member
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. McMeans), and by
the right honourable thc junior member from
Ottawa (Riglit Hon. Sir George E. Foeter),
and I would hesitate to remove fromn our
statutes the safeguard that is to be found in
section 41. But I eall the attention nf the
bonourable Leader of the Government to this
fact. There are two opinions. One, as far
as I can sec, is tliat that provision sliould
be preservcd, and the other, tending towards
the belief that it is cnvered by tlie Criminal
Code. We are at present confronted with
two Bis, one asking for the rernoval of tlie
safeguard to be fnund in section 41, and the
otbèr, under whîcli sections 97A and 97B of
tbe Crinîinal Code will be removed. I think
it would be mucli better to reverse the order
of tliese Bis, and to take up Bill No. 153
first, and see wliether the House could be
satisfied as to the wording of the Criminal
Code in that respect. I think in tliat event
tlie position nf tlie honourable gentleman
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) would be mucli
stronger. But if we deal witli this Bill first,
we may flnd. if we pass it, that we are unable
to secure tlie rejection of the otlier Bill.
Tlierefore, I think it would be much better
to clarify tlie situation so far as the Criminal
Code is concerned, and theni to take up the
Immigration Act.

JUNE 15, 1926
I would like
Hon. Mr. DANDURLAND:
to say a few words on this matter in closing,
and I will refer to the suggestion cf my honourable frîend from. De Salaberry (Hon. Mr.
Béique). If my honourable friend believes
that I have made a fair case in faveur cf
transferring the offences mentioned in clause
41 cf this Bill from, the jurisdiction cf the
immigration officers te the courte cf this

There is a wbole batch of offences, much

IMMIGRATION BILL
MOTION

FOR SECOND READ>ING

NWEATIVED

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If the discussion is over, as I think it is, we could perhaps
put the question and then adjourn untîl tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. ]ROBERTSON: Although it is
out of order, I would like to make one observation in connection with the closing remarks of my honourable friend. He referred
ta the late Sir James Lougheed as having
introduced a Bill similar to this in 1921. I
beg to recail to bis memory the fact t hat I
-was the offender on that occcasion. It was
1, as Minister of Labour, who introduced a
iBil-not this Bill-proposing to repeal the
Act of 1919 and to restore the Act of 1910.
Now it is praposed to eliminate the Act of
1910 as well as the substitute of 1919. That
was flot the Bill of 1921. The late Sir James
Lougheed voted according to his conviction;
and he stated in the buse that he had reiserved the right to vote as he pleased. I say
that in explanation of the remark of the hon,ourable gentleman from Trois-Rivières (Hon.
Mr. Bureau).
Hon. Mr. DANDURAIND:
I stand corrected in that regard.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: If this Bill gets the
second reading now, is it understood that it

ýCANADA GRAIN BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY moved the
second reading of Bill 8, an Act to amend the
Canada Grain Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the important if wholly unsought privilege and duty
of presenting this proposed Bill to the House
has fallen to me. I am sa interested in the
success of it that I wish that the task of presenting it to this House had fallen on more
competent shoulders. 'I can only crave your
indulgence in my discussion of it, which wilI
not be long. You reahize that I am not a
grain expert; but, in a long residence in the
province of Saskatchewan and with same practical experience in the growing of grain, I
have been in touch, I think, with the prob-

lems of the farmers out there and can, to
some extent at any rate, justify to this House
the introduction of the Bill now on the Order
Paper.
This is another step forward, honourable
gentlemen, in the process of co-operation.
Let me read to you an extract on what has
been taking place in a kindred nation with
regard to the movement in favour of cooperation, particularly co-operation in marketing, among farmers and agriculturists of all
kinds who are not grain-growers; for much
more rapid progress has been made in the
United States than we have made in Canada,
and the attention of the Government at
Washington, during the present Session and
at every Session in recent years, has been
directed Io very important agricultural legislation. This short extract, dealing with the
question of co-operation, will show the view
of the American iSecretary of Agriculture in
1925:
The most distinct and signilicant movement in
American agriculture in thi:s decade is the almost
universal trend towaA co-operation in the marketing
and distribution of farm iproducts. It is ln no sense
a regional or sectional movement, for it exists in all
sections and is participated in te some extent by
producers of practically all kinds of fann products.
There has been some co-operation by farmers in the
United States for many years, but within the last two
decades, and particularly duning the last decade, the
movement has assumed .proportions which indicate
that dt is a response to a ýfundamental and universal
need of present-day American agriculture. It is bighly
significanit from all points of view that the best minds
in agriculture, without regard to regien or commodity,
are unanimous in the opinion tihat group action in
marketing must 1ie added to individual efficienc1y in
production if the high standards of American farm life
are to be preserved and agriculture is te maintacn
its proper place in our national life.

Here is another short extract:
Although co-operative marketing is a fa.rmers' movement, It is not in any proper sense a selfish class
movement and holds no menace eithser to consumers
or other business in-terests. Agricultura. production is
essential to national weffare, and the cnly guaranty
of an adequate and dependeable supply of agricultural
products is a prosperous and contented agrieultural
population. It is obvious to any thoughtful mind that
this happy result cannot be obtained by agriculture
unless it avails itslf of the efficiencies and aconomies
of organization and speeialization which characterize
other industries in this day. Censideration alike of
intelligent self-interest and public welfare must prompt
other classes to support wise and intelligent efforts of
fairmers to place ýtheir important industry upon a
bass of stabillity and prosperity.

Let me give you a most striking illustration, from the Province of Saskatchewan, of
the desire for co-operation on the part of the
farmers of to-day. There was founded in
the year 1911, or in 1912-I am not sure of
the exact date-in Saskatchewan, a systemn of

investigate the elevator problem. The Province of Manitoba had established GovernThe Government of Sasment elevators.
katchewan, not being sure that the system of
Government elevators was the most judicious
one, thereupon appointed a Commission, and
the Commission reported in favour of the
establishment of a system of farm elevators
which was in some phases on a co-operative
principle. There evolved eventually the Saskatchewan Co-operative Elevator Company,
a company which was comparatively small in
its beginnings, but has grown to very large
proportions. The Government originally contributed 85 per cent of the cost of building
the elevators. The other 15 per cent was contributed by the farmers. The Government
was properly secured in the interval, and the
indebtedness for the Government advances on
account of the building of these elevators was
repayable out of the earnings from time to
time. Indeed, the Government of Saskatchewan went very much further. During the
time I had the honour of being a member of
the Legislature of ýthat Province we made
trading advances to that same company. In
one year they aggregated four, five, or six
millions of dollars. So it is apparent that
the Province of Saskatchewan regarded the cooperative elevator enterprise as a wise one,
to be aided by public funds, or in any event
by the credit of the Province.
iowever, that company was, like the United
Grain Growers Company, in Manitoba, established on the principle of share capital. The
shareholders in both Provinces were to be
limited, and were in practice limited, to actual farmers. In the Province of Saskatchewan I think that requirement was very strictly
adhered to. Farmers' locals were in existence
throughout the Province, and the farmers
agreed among themselves, after a certain

acreage
promised, to establish a local and build an
elevator on the spot, and they did so. The
enterprise has proceeded from smaller to
bigger things, and that company in this
present year has at the head of the Lakes

terminal facilities for about 15,000,000 bush-

It has built at Buffalo an elevator
els.
with a capacity of 1,100,000 bushels, and is
naking an addition to it this year of 900,000
bushels. I am illustrating the fact of the
very rapid growth of the business. The members of the company all are farmers. You
were required to be a grower of grain before
you could join, and that requirement has
remained, until now and it is in the hands
of the farmers themselves. But it was founded
and operated on the principle of company ownership of shares. You became a

JIJNE 16, 1926
subseriber for a ahare or shares,' the number
being limited, and, if the enterprise were
profitable, as it has turned out to be, you
were to receive dividends on your shares,
which would be credited to your stock. The
Manitoba organization, the United Grain
Growers, is operated on a similar principle.
Now what do we find? This company,
succesafuily operated over a period of years,
and composed of farmers, have by their own
act committed hari-kairi. Negotiations were
in progress for a considerable time between
the pool in Saskatchewan and the Saskatchewan Co-operative Elevator Company,
and they finally reaehed the stage where the
Saskatchewan Co-,operative Elevator Company convened its shareholders and by a
majority of about 85 per cent of the shareholders of that company voted to, go out
of existence and seil their undertaking to the
Wheat Pool.
Why did they do that? Not beoeuse they
had not been suceasful, for they were at al
times successful; and I think that on the
whole they had given reasonable satisfaction
to the farmers of Saskatchewan. But most
of the members held that that was not true
co-operation among formera; that the principie of individual shareholders, as we find
it in joint-stock organizations, shou!ld not
prevail in a tiruly co-operative system of
marketing. 'Mat would best illustrate the
movément of the Grain Growers of Saskatchewan in dealing with the marketing of
their grain.
The pools, as you know, have been formed.
In Alberta, I think in 1923, the pools came
rnto limited operation. In Saskatchewan and
Manitoba they have been in aperation in
1924 and 1925. At first they were confined
to the marketing of wheat, the great staple.
Now, I know there is a pool in Saskatchewan, 1 think there is one in Alberta,
and I think, wit.hout knowing for sure, there
is one in Maitoba, dealing with the coarse
grains. The pool system is based on the
lines that I have mentioned in reading the
quotatioa from -the report of the American
Secretary of Agriculture, recommending that
the>re should be the true spirit of co-operation and that one ghould not gain at the
expense of another, and that joint earnings
should be pooled and distributed according
to the grain supplied. ta the pool.
I have heard it said on the outside that
the Saskatchewan Elevator Company, now
out of existence, es I haïve men-tioned, was
not loyal ta the best interests of Oanad in
building a terminal at Buffalo, which is being extended this preàent year from a
capacity of 1,100,000 buahels to a capacity

255

of 2,000,000 bushels. 1 confess, lionourable
gentlemen, thaît when 1 read first of the Saskatchewan Co-operative Company building
that terminal at Buffalo, it gave me a considerable shock, as it might give to, any
honourable memnber on hearing of it. It cdd
look as if we were trying to build up the
marketing of our grain through American
channels.
Not merely since this Bill came before the
House, but many mont'hs ago, 1 began to
investigate the mnatter a little for my own
satisfaction. 1 found, as the fact is, that a
very large quantity of our Canadian grain
is every year ahipped through Buffalo. It
has been so shipped, and will continue to be,
notwithstand-ing pooîs or any other system.
We have neyer been able to ship all our
Canadian grain through our own channels. I1
wilsh the tim.e would arrive when it would
b? possible to ship by Canadian routes, but
it is not in the immediate future in any
event. AIl we can hope for in that connection is that from year to year a greater
quantity of Canadian grain may find ita
outlet through Canadian ports.
The elevatar built at Buffalo is virtue.lly
a transhipment. It cau be used-for the purpose of shipping grain to, New York, or to
Philadýeiphia, or to Baltimore or to any
other American port, but its primary use is
in feeding the vessels going down the Welland Canal and on down to Montreal. There
is an immense amount of transhipment, as
we know, at Port Coîborne, of grain goîng
by our own routes, and there has always
been a considerable amount, of grain transhipped at Buffalo to go by Canadian channels.
I amn advised, and I have no reason to
doubt, that the quantity of pool grain leaving
Canada for export purposes bears quite as
large a pereentage to the whole as does that
shipped by the private elevator companies,
so, there is no discrimination against Canada
in this business. 1 am also advised, with what
correctness I do not know, that ail of the
grain shipped from our two Maritime terminals
has been pool grain. As a matter of fact, in
practical operation, the pool is freer to ship
its grain in any direction than is the private
terminal. The pool does not buy the -grain
from the farmers; it is .merely their agent for
the selling of the grain. The ordinary elevator
company is a purchaser of grain, and of
necessity is a very extensive borrower from
banke; it has very large banking operations
every year on behaîf of the grain trade, to
finance the purchase of grain; and we know
that the banks, as a commercial necessity,
require hedging-a term. which I need not

explain to the honourable gentlemen of this
House-in order to make the very
large
advances, and that bedging is a neccssity at
the head of the Lakes.
Hon. Mr. *CASGRAIN: The honourable
gentleman had better state what bedging is.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: It is simply a
protection against loss by the bank. The pool
is an agent, flot a buyer, and therefore does
not neýed to hedge, because it bas flot to
borrow money. the only money it needs is
for the payment of railway charges and that
kind of thing on the road to terminals, and
initial advances, so that it is perfectly free
to ship its grain out, unrestricted or unrelated
to hedges. The grain company, having bedges
which call for shipment to the bead of the
Lakes, bas its grain delivered at a point where
there are American competition and American
vessels, as well as ýCanadian competition and
Canadian vessels.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Where do they get the
money?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: They have to
borrow it, but they do not need to borrow
100 per cent, and they do not need to hedge.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My bonourable
friend had botter explain the word "hedge,"
as that word seems to play an important role,
and it is the first time I have 'heard the
expresion.

Hon. Mr. WILLOU'GHBY: It is the selling
of a quantity of grain against what you
buy, so that there is only the spread of the
market between, if it goes up or down. It is
a mnethod of protection wbich is absolutely
recognized in the grain trade, and required
by the banks. My bonourable friend 'from
Stadacona (Hon. L. C. Webster) rcminds me
that it is not confined to the grain trade, but
the custom is followed in other great staýples
like sugar and other commodities.
The growth -of the wheat industry in tÀhe
Northwest, that is, in the th'ree prairie Provinces, bas been wonderfui, so much so that
I am flot going to pretend to 'tell the story,
because I think every member of this House
knows it. Suffice it to say that the rath-er
buoyan't exports from Can«ada during this
daut ye-ar, 1924-25. owe their round figures. to
a very large degree, to the grain crop of the
Northwest, and we have by no means reached,
the limit of development. There are enormous areas in the three Prairie Provinces,
speaking of them only, that are capable of
growing grain, as well as other po>rtions

go on, if the world .markets warrant the

expansion of the grain-growing area, there -is
no reason why the pro.duction in those Provinces should not be three times whaît àt is now,
in the course of the next 10 or 20 years, or
even less time than that. 0f course, t)hat will
be det-erminpd to a very large extent by
world ;prices; but I venture to predict that
those pnices wi1l -continue on the same scale
as they wem in 1924, and again in 1025. there
will be a very lange extension, because in the
îast two years grain-growing bas heen a
profitable business.
Away back in 1900, when the amount. of
grain grown was a mere bagatelile in .quantity
conipared with what it is at present, the
country recognized, the desirabi]ity of regu'ating thi.9 indtxstry by an Act of this buse
which went into force, called the Manitoba
Grain Act, wvhich is a very extensive code,
dealing with the whole business of *marketing
grain. TPhýat Act remained on the Statu'te
book u.ntit 1912, with certain alterations in the
interval; and the last.'mentioned Act remained
until our Act of 1925, again with some modifications. It is under the Act of 1925 that
it is necessary, in my opinion, týo introduce
the ameodmerit which I propose to read to
the House later.
In 1900 there were no private terminails ut
ail at the head of the Lakes.
At their
inception ýterminais were furnished by the
raillways. In 1904 the flrst public terminal
was established. and in 1907 the first private
terminal.
Then. in 1912 we had the Act
brought up to date. -and we provided for the
establishment of sample markets, an absolutedy new development in Canada. Those
famitliar with the grain trade know that the
sample market is the usual mode of selling
in -the Nort.hwestern States. Grain is sold for
what it is worth on inspection, presumnably for
what it is worth 'on its mîlling value. It wus
hoped in 1912 that the Act providing for
sample markets wourld go into force,' but it did
not become operative for the main reasun that
there was not enough com'peti.tion between
buyers to make the sample market a great
success. At Minneapolis, St. Paul, and many
other grain centres in Minnesota, and through
the middle Northwestern States, tbere is the
niost active competition by a qarge number
of buyers, so that selling by sarople bas proved
very lucrative to the farmer.
Everyone who is familiar with the grain
trade knows that the actual -grade, 1, 2 or 3,
or whatever it may be, dues not always represent the milling value; tbat it bas another
intrinsic value added to that, often up to 10
or 15 per cent more than tbe actual grace

JUNE 16, 1M6
value would indicate, due ta dlimatie conditions, soiT, and other eiemente. With the
advent of the eampie market came the estahldshment of the mixing house. Under the oid
Act the inixing of grain ini terminais was
strictly forbidden.
Then we get a new deveiopment which, in
the long course, bas brought about the necessity of this praposed legisiation. Many
private companies estabiished mixing houseg
at the head of the Lakes, and also at Van-'
couver and other places, 1 think. In mixing
bouses, as the name impiies, there is the right
ta mix grades of wheat, wbich mixing was
absoiutely probibited previously. AIL the
grades ma.y be advanced; a mnan might have
a very poor No. 1 and a very good No. 2,
according ta the grade, and -by judicious
mixing there would reioilt a very considerahly
intcreaeed quantity of No. 1, tbougb perbaps
oyf low grade, but by that systein of promotion, or raising the grade by mixing, there
would be realized a spread of 3 ta 6 cents in
the price.

Honouimble gentlemen, ini the face of etbat,

Company in connection with the overages
that were founid, in the trminais at the 'head
of the Lakes, and other terminaILs, what enormousq profits the grain trade did miake out of
the hanidling of the farmers' grain for which
tbhey were not ohligated under th£- law to a.ccount at ail. They feil heir to that legall]y.
There was no frau>d or impropriety about it;
they fol]owed out the Act, and it resulited in
enorm-ous gains to them. In the Grain Act
we have attempted to depriýve the compaaies
od 'the overages at the terminal points. An
overage is an excess of grain corning out of
an elev-ator of a grade 'higher than 1)he quiantity taken in of dust grade. Also an excess in
bushels of grain. If a greater amount came
out than had gone in, presumably it woujId
be because of thbe ýpromotion of Iower grades.
In t.he year 1912-13 there were overages valued
at $815,135; in 1913-14, $728,175; in 1914-15,
$526,294; in 1915-16, $1,187,604;
in 1916-17,
$2,047,159. That money ought to, have been
the money of the farmers.
Now there is another way that the grain
comrpanies can get a benefit at the present
time beyond any shadow"of doubt.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Before the honourable
gentleman takes up that point, 1 would like
to ask for my own, information whether there
was any legisiation to prevent the farmers
gettiing the benefit of this overage?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGCHBY: I woulcl fot say
that, there was not, but they neyer got it.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: There was no legislation passed?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I am glad the
honourabie gentleman bas called my attention
to that. Legisiation was subsequently passed
providing that the overage s.hould not exceed
one-quarter of one per -cent. That legisiation
was attacked in the Province of Manitoba as
dealing with property and civil rights. There
was a surplus in the elevator, and the commission took a. percentage of that grain and
used it for the purpose of operating the Act.
I have the section heme if the bonourable
gentleman cares te, sec it. The grain coinpany said, and the court uphcld their view.
that the, legisiation- aflected property fand
civil rights, and the court decided that grain
belonging to the grain companies could not
be appropriated by a Dominion Act, and held
the law to be inývalid, and, so far as I know,
there is no Dominion law against overages,
i.e. depriving the owners of the grain of the
overages-but they wcre and are ail credited
to the farmeos.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Is theoe any Provincial l-aw?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I think not. I
do not tbink any bas beeni enacted, since the
Dominion legisiation was held to be ultra
vires.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: When was the judgment rendered on that question?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: It mulst lie
about thre-e or four years ago. I am not sure,
but I think the case went to the Privy Council.
My attention was drawn to it, flot by read-ing
the legal report. which I bave not done, but
by reading tbe newspaper reports.
Any grain company handling grain at Winnipeg or Vaucouver or at otber points, is
only obligated to account to the fariner for
the grade of grain taken in at the country
elevator. It can be graded wben it gocs in,
subject to dockage, and wben it gets down tû
Winniipeg it is inspected.
Now, wbat tbe
farmer wants is to get tbe saine grain delivered
at Winnipeg or at other points tbat is taken
in in the country. Ali be can do is to take
his receipt froi the country clevator and
compare it with tbe receipt from tbe elevator
at Winnipeg, and if he gets an equivalent
grade, tbe elevator company says: "Our
duty is discharged.'
I
say
the
fact
is tbat large quantities of that grain
reaching Winnipeg are sold and divertcd
before they reach the head of the Lakes.
Millers--and I happen to have some clients
among them-can go and sec the grain at
Winnipeg, and they are experts, and can judgc
by the eye, and tbey flnd tbat certain carloads
of grain coining in are very superior No. 1,
or very superior No. 2 or No. 3, and they
buy it and pay a premium for it. Grain is
constantly being sold between Winnipeg and
the bead of the Lakes for a preinium. I thinle
tbe ordinary premium is about one cent for
sale to millers. I say that is the farmer's
money, and tbat be should get it.
Tbere is anotber perfectly legitimate method
of making money under tbe Act, and tbat is
by means of what is called cash wbeat. Everybody in the West, at least, knows that there,
is always a 'premium on cash wbcat--wbeat
tbat is readýy for lake sbipment, wheat that
is available to fill up a boat that perhaps basdifficulty in finding a eargo. We ail know tbe
higb cost of keeping a vessel unduly -long in
any harbour. The charterer wants to get his
vessel filled and eut of the harbour as quickly
as possible.
Finding tbat lie is short a
certain quantity in bis cargo, lie pays the,
elevator company a premnium for the purpose
of getting grain to fill bis vesse! so, that she
may get away, and very large Sums are
realized in that way, which, again, should
belong to the farmerg.

JUNE 16, 1926
The elevator companies should be conllned
Vo a reasonable charge for handling the grain,
for the services performed as warehousemen.
They should be paid what it is worth, and if
what they receive is not enough, the charge
shuuld he increased; but they should account
for every cent realized by the product when
it is sold.
Now, I amn going a littie further. It is
said that if you restore the law according to
the suggestion of Judge Turgeon, and say
that only the fermer can direct where the
grain is Vo be shipped, he will ship it ail to

in the world Vo prevent the companies having
their agents at the head of the Lakes go Vo

that il any private country elevator consigus grain Vo a pooî elevator at the head
of the Lakes and marks on the shipping bill

That is a complete answer Vo the argument
that those engaged iu the grain trade wil

aud therefore should noV be held responsible.

alfter the grain la unloaded and weighed, and
over w.hich. they have no control?
Hon. 'Mr. WILLOUGHBY: The grain la
weighed into a;il those terminals by a Governiment weighnaater, whose weight -mue be
accepted as correct.
14015--17J

Righ't Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
As far as the weight is coneerned that is
correct; but when the grain gets into the
pool elevator, what about the things that may
happen before it is weighed out again?
It might
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
deteriorate ini quality, or it 'might heat, or -a
number of .things; but it goes in under Government weighing. That is ail they have to
account for. 1 arn only deailing now with
what niight have 'happened the car in transit
from say Winnipeg to the head of the Lakes.
I say the private company is absolutely in a
position to protect itself.
IV is sa.id that by this Bill we aire confiscating the proiperty of the -private comnpany. To me "confiscation" is an ugly word,
and I wiltl vote for nothing in this Huse
tha-t 1 t'hink smells in the remotest degree of
confiscation. If I were satisfied that this Bill
meant confiscation, I wou'ld flot be the
spoke.sman for it.
Honourable gentlemen wil* realize that
there are three different kinds of elevators,
three different ways of hnndling grain. There
are the track pliatforms provided for undèer
the Grain Act, which are scattered about ail
over the West, and which have been in
existence fromn the very begin-ning. They
offer only a very limited capacity, a couple
of cars at most at one time, because of the
shortnes of the track. The 1track plaîtform
was demanded in the first instance because
the farmers were noV whol'ly satisfied with
the honesty of the operation of the elevators.
1 maike no écharge of that kind. I arn not
dealing with that phase of the question. Thoe
point was raised that the grain placed in a
car should go Vo, a Government elevator and
be inspected there without being ixed.
These loading platforms take care of but a
very small fraction of the grain, .perhaps ten
per cent of the grain of the Prairie Provinces.
Then that ten

farmer, and he eau direct it wherever he
pleases.

average of the grain in special bina?

260
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:

SENATE
Oh, it is a

simaîl proportion, quite a small proportion. I
have flot got the figures.
The pool elevators at the very least have
got fifty per cent or sixty per cent of ail
the grain of the Prairie Provinces. By some
people the proportion is put higlier than
that. On the other hand, they have a surplus of wheat and a shortage of elÈvators.
The result is that they cannot ship their own
wheat through their own elevators. Eeonomnically, perbaps, that is fortunate, because it is
a recognized fact in the grain trade that there
is an excess of elevator capacity in the West
which bas been built up by the competition
of grain men anxious ýta buy grain in the
country Sa as to have an opportunity of
handling it in Winnipeg and at other points
before it is sold.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I take it that
grain that goes into the pool elevators can
be directed 'by the Pool ta the terminal
elevator.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
Ahsolutely.
Speaking from memory, 825 elevatars belong
to the pool, and 4,22 ta the companies.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: May I ask if under
the pool the special binning and loading platforma are dispensed with or are available?
Are the loading platforma and the special
binning available ta the farmer who deals
with and through the pool?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
Oh, yes, I
sbould think so. I do flot know why he would
use the loading platform, yet I do flot know
why hie might flot use it. If he ships his grain
ta the pool, that is aIl we care about. On
principle I think the loading platform is for
ail farmers.
Hon. Mr. BELGOURT: I was under the
impression that the farmer who dealt with
the pool had ta agree that his grain would be
mixed with everybody cisc's grain and the
whole quantity would be shipped together.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

In the pool?

lion. Mr. BELCOURT: In the pool. That
hie would flot have the advantage of having
a special bin for bimscîf so as ta keep his
grain separate and apart, for would he have
the advaotagc of the loading platform.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: The special
bins relate only ta the country elevatar. There
is fia special binning at the head of the Lakes.
Undoubtedly the pool farmer could ahip his
grain through the country clevator ta the
pool. and ail tbey care about is ta, get the
handling at the terminal.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
make myscîf plain.

Perhaps 1 did flot

I may be wrong, for I do

flot know very much about this matter, but
1 understood that the farmers who deait
through the pool, who dclivered their grain
ta the pool for trans sghipmcnt ta the terminaIs,
were deprived of the advantage of the loading
platfarm or of the special bin, because tbe
operations of the pool did flot permit the
resort ta cither anc or the other.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I do flot think
that therc is anything in either of those statements.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER:

No.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Ail tbat the
pool are concerned about is ta get the grain
shipped ta them. It is a matter of indifference ta the pool wbether the grain goes ta
special bin or over the Ioading platform. The
pool want ta get, if possible, tbe handling of
the grain at the terminaIs.

Hon. Mr. BEÂIQUE:

The capacity, then.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHIBY: Belonging ta the
pool there is a capacity of about 15,000,000
bushels at the hcad of the Lakes, or about
20,000,000 in tbe aggrcgate, including Buffalo,
Vancouver, Prince Rupert, etc. There is a
capacity of about 62 or 64 millions in other
terminal elevators.
Hon. Mr. SCHIAFFNER:
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGýHBY:

No; the total

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: At the head of the

Hon. Mr. WILLOU'GHBY:
As a matter
of fact, I have the figures in percentages.
The pool dlaim ta have 28 per cent of the
total terminal space, and their terminal facilitics ail told,, at the various points, accomodate about 20,000,000 bushels. Thcy got a
capacity of 15,000,000 bushels from the Saskatchewan Co-operative alone.

Hon. Mr. WILLO UGHBY:
doubt that Mr. Campbell's statements are
quite correct. N you figure out the percentage, you will find that about 28 per cent
of ail the terminal facilitiez are the property
of the pool.
When the honourable gentleman aaked me
a question, I was intending to deal with this
other phase, the extent to whieh the private
elevators would lose in the handling of prain.
The pool, having only 28 per cent of the
terminal facilities, and having at least 50 to
60 per cent of the wheat, are of necessity
unable to handie it ail through our own

grain to the pool through company elevators,
beesuse there are innuinerable point. tiiroughout the West at which there is no pool
elevator at ail. Il is necessary therefore to
ship to the company elevator, and they pay
that eompany elevator very well.
I wiil te41 you what the figures are, but
1 arn going to work out another problem
for you, if 1 may, in the meantime.
Before answering those questions I had said
that 90 per cent of the total quantity of whet,
went through country elevators, and that 10
per cent was shipped over loading platforms.
Let us suppose that the pool prain represents
45 per cent of ail the grain i the country eievators. Thnt is putting il at the. minimum,
for the pool dlaim they have more than that.
(X the 90 per cent one-fiftb, or 18 per cent,

it woul'd be for the Board to reduce tihe rate.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: In answer to
the býonourable ýgen-t1tman I may eay tihat
under the Act, the Board lias the right to fix
the rates cbarge'd for elevating, for taking
ca-re of tihe grain, and for sfhipping it out, and
àt bas fixed the rate at 114 cents 'per busbdl.
But the pool, in order to get the benefit of

it is operated jointly witb sonie terminal

Hon. Mr. WILLOUTGHBY: I doubt very
much, from wbat I bave learned, that the
country elevator, if it is bonestly run, makes
very inuch out of the 114 cents; perhaps it
costs that or 'more to bandie the grain; but
I think it is rarely that the country elevator
at the end of 'the year *bas a sh-ortage. Such
marvels happen, I suppose, but in any event
I bave not beard of tbem. I the rate of
li cents on the 'bushel be flot an adequate
rate to compensate the private elevator coinp'iny for the services of the country elevator,
ihie righit to incroase that rate and make it

and, as I understand, tlîey have signified,
though not perbaps in a formel way, that
if it'is inadequate thev are pci-fectly ready

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Not that I am

ln feet, speaking fromn my personal
observation, I do not think the 'big grain
companies desire an inecase in tbe country

There are too many of them now.
.If you did increase the rate you would bave
an ermy of small mercbants, retired fermers
and persans of tbat cless going into the elevator

but the impression in the rninds of those acquainted
with the grain trade is that the two are necessary in order to function properly. So I can
say that the -pool men did adivocate it.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Let us understand:
there are how many inspection points in the

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: There are Calgary, Edmonton, th*erewill be Prince Rupert,

Hon. 'Mr. BEIQUE: My other question,
for my own information, is this: there is a

for the other inspection points?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Yes. The section I have read specifically provides that
w1hen the word to Winnipeg is used, it wil
be applicable to Edmonton and Calgary in

Moose Jaw was not included, at tIat time, but it will be if this

It is only the importance of the subjeet
that gives any wairrant for my detaining the
House so long. I have no doubt there are
other gentlemen more competent than myself to present this subjeet, who will do us
the pleasure of speaking, and 1 thank the
House for iLs courtesy in listening f0 me
with the great patience that has been shown.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen,
this Bill deals with a eubject that I think
is very intricate in itiself, and I believe it is
also strange to a good many merobers of this
House. Of course, the honourable gentlemen from the West know this legislation
very muel as they know the alphabet and
the multiplication table. But it is not so,
with me. I have given a good dea! of attention to this BilI. I made iL my business to
hear aIl the witneaees thaL were examined
before the Committee on Agriculture in the
other House, and while I have arrived at a
fairly flrm opinion on the merits of the Bill,
I am stil! open to conviction in the matter.
This subject is new to a great many of us,
and I think there is considerable difference
of opinion in LIe House; but we have received a great des! of assistance towards
understanding tIe Bill f.rom the honourable
member who his introduced it, and for myself I am much obliged. for what he las
donc in explaining LIe provisions of the Bill.
I think iL is undesirable, however, that we
should have two discussions on this Bill, and
I think it will le better La send iL to the
Committee on Banking and Commerce. We
cannot de-al with this Bill withouýt giving a
heering to parties who are interest-ed. in iL, if
ehey so desire. The line elevators claim that
tîey have probably W8,00,00O invo!ved in
the su-bjeet-matter of the Bill, so that iL is
of vcry great importance t them, if they
feel that theïr property is being jeopardized
in any way. On thc other hand, of course
the pool is a very powcrful bodLy, having
enormous interests also, and; I think it
would le ýbetter if we heard those people, or
any experts Who may choose to come before
the Committee on Banking and Commerce;
t.hen. wîen the Bill cames back from the
Committee we, oan have a fu.!! discussion. IL
is perfeetly certain that -if we began to discuss the Bil! to-day there would be interminable difference of opinion as Lo the terms,
and LIe methods in which business la being
done in the grain tirade. I Lhink aIl such
matters should be settled, and can only le
properly settled, in Committee, where ahI
questions can le tîre-shed out.
In the other House we had speeches, from
two men, one on each side, in regar-A fi tIi'

rights of the fariner wbo pute grain in.to thécountry elevator, aa to getting his grain to
market; but there was flat 'contradiction
batween those speakers,, although the>' are
both experte. For myseif, 1 do not believe 1
shaîl ever arrive a.t a complote uaderst4lndlng
of the Bill. If I ever reach tirat point It
wil only be in a meeting of the Committee,
where I can ask mnen engaged in the grain
bu-siness juat how that busines s being done.
1 do not know whether my honourable
friend la willing to move reference of this
Bill to the Banking and Commerce Coinmittee.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I think we might
deal with it as we did laat year, b>' a smeller
Special Com.mittee, rather than by the Ba.nking and Commerce Cbmmittee, which la pret.ty
well loaded down with work, as we are getting
near to the endi of the Session.
Hon, W. B. ROSS- I do not know that that
la tlie case. The Banking and Commerce Coinmittee ie a Standing Commîttee of the House,
and I think it la botter in ever>' way that thia
Bill ehould go to one of our Standing Coinmitteas rather than to a Special Committee,
as there might be some heartburning about
the appointinent of auch a Committee.
Hon. Mr. WIL~LOUGHBY. I do not know;
it went before a, Committee last year, and the
Coimmittee turned the Bill down. 1 ain a
member of the Banking and Commerce Coinmittee, and probs.bly nobody bas a higher
regard than myseîf for the intelligence of the
members of that Com.mittee; but we have the
question of Rural Credits to be dealt with
there, for one thing, and there la another
phase to that Committee work in connection
wlth the 8oldier Settlement Bill!. I would
prefer that the Bill should go to a Special
Committee, aelected b>' the two leaders; I do
not want to dictate as to the memberahip.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: The work 'of the Banking and, Commerce Committee la pretty well
over now; there wi.ll be only one or two days'
work more. My choice of the Banking and
Commerce Committee la flot because it la the
strongeat Committee, but becas it la a ver>'
large one; that la why I would like it to go to
them.
Hon. Mr- DANDURAND: The samne question arose in 1925 when the Grain Bill was
beflore us; if I am not mistaken it was a
consolidation of the Grain Acte. When the
question arose as. te the best Committee to
deal with it, the argument was made that the
matters covered by the Grain Act nffieted
more especially the West, and that theref ors

on that CommiUtee there should be a larger
repreeentation fromn the West than would be
found on the Banking and Commerce Coinmittee. We appointed a Special Committee,
composed to a large degree of men intereated
not ont>' on accouat of coming from the West,
but also beeaute of having a greater knowledge
thon. most of the members froin the Eaat.
For my part, 1 arn disposed to aeeept the
suggestion of the mover of this Bill (Hon.
Mr. Willoughby), if my honourable friend
wlll accept the proposai that a Special Coinmittee be struck, and that the names be lef t
to my hoxiourable friend who leads the other
side (Hon. W. B. Rosa), the honourable
gentleman froin Mooae Jaw (Hon. Mr.
Willoughby) and myseif. We will try to
secure ail the best knowledge in the Chamber.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I think I would prefer
neot to have anythmng to do with the selection
of a Committee on thie subject. It is a big
subi ect, and one that la hotly conteated,
involving great differencea of opinion. I
would sooner take one of our Committees,
and move the Bill etraight to that Committee, than leave it to a Special Committee.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may say that
I have been given the naines of the Speciaî
Committee which waa appointed. We would
not need to aceept that Committee in toto;
we could add to it. The members of that
Committee were Hon. Measieura Beique, Belcourt, Black, Boyer-we had two members
named Boyer at the turne; one has gone, and
the other one is nlot attending regulari>'Crowe, Foster (Sir George E.), Gillis, Laird,
McCoig, Ross (Middleton), Rosa (Mooae
Jaw), Sharpe, Smith, Turriff, Watson, Willoughby and myself. It will be seen that there
was a fairi>' large representation from the
Weat of men who would furniah us with
information which we could not get se coinpletely in the Banking and Commerce
committee.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: The honourable gentle-.
man muat remember that there ia educationat
value to a man who is going on that Committee. Now, the Banking and Commerce
Cornmittee is a large one, and I think it is
of great importance that a large number
should be on the Cornmittee that deals with
this subjeet. I do nlot think there would ha'
an>' objection te adding oe or two -profeasional. men te the Committea; we lied a
couple of names suggeàted the other day;
and of course there is nothing to prevent anyman frora the West froan attending this
Comrnittee and taking part in ita proceedfings.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 simply throw
out the idea. I would flot like to substitute
my own will for that of the mover of the
Bill. I would leave hlm to make the proposit.ion. He has suggested that the honourable
gentleman and myself make the selection,
but he might move substantially the Iist of
names that hie p]eases, if he thinks it preferable to sending the Bill to the Banking and
Commerce ComTnittee.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Two considerations present themseives to my
mind in connection with this Bill. In the
first place, if your Committee is small you
do not get the amount of general information
to members of the Senate who afterwards
have to make the decision; therefore it is
advisable that you have as large a Committee
as possible to hear ail this information. 1
have had a good deal to do with the Grain
Act, but I do. not pretend to know it ail. I
know probably a good deal more than some
,other members, but I take it for granted that
the mai ority of the members of the Senate
would not be adepts in the question involved,
and would have to carefully learn.
The other consideraýtion is this. You know
that the Senate is under criticism-whetheî'
fair or unfair we are not stating at the presetit
moment-ind this question assumed this year
a different phase from, what it bas ever assumed before when it has come to this Chamber. There are two vast interests at stakep.
There is the pool side, and there is the side
of the line elevator, or private elevator. An
immense amount of capital is invested in
the line elevators,-some $85,000,000, it is
statr'd. That is the amount of capital from
diffrrent sources which bas been invested in
a lîwful business tnder certain condition.s.
The intercsts are large, and they oug 4ht not
to be sacrificed. In view of a large interest
such as th.at. pitted in this rivalry, and espeicially ii view of t.he conrtrary statements
that will corne before the ýCommittee. the
matters involved are of great importance.
The pool interest has not a great amount in
elevators, but it bas the hulk of the farmers
of the West in it. Now, we have neyer had
just that position before, and above alI
things I think we ought to avoid a possible
charge by any indiscreet person that the
Com'mittee had been framed for the purpose
of favouring either one side or the other. If
you take the Standing Committee on BankJng and Commerce, you get a large Comnmittee, and, 1 think, a very go.od Committee,
and y-ou avoid entirely any chance of criticism, or of a feeling. which may 'be right or
wbich may be wrong, that the Committee
Hon, W. B. ROSS.

was proposed with the underlying idea of
favouring one side or the other. These two
considex'ations, I thýink, mnake it preferable
that the Bill should go to the Committee on
Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
Ivas read the second time.
Hon. Mr'. WILLOUGHBY: This Bill is
rather unique in that it is a Private Bill to
amend a Public Act. I do not want to, oppose the position taken by my honourable
Leader, becauýse we have confidence in bis
discretion; that' is why hie is where he is.
Nevertheless, speaking with great deference to
the Committee on Banking and Commere,
I still think a Comrnittee could be chosen
without there being any thought that it was
packed.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
The public is diff'erently inclined from my
honouraibie friend, and crities of this 'Chamber are not over-nice in the suggestions that
they sometimes make. I do not think that
there is the lerast possibility of a ýCommittee
of this Huse heing packed.
I think the
Committee would be absolutely fair. I stand
up for that characteristic of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Last year the
Bill was killed in our Committee, and I do
nt think anybody ever suggested that the
Committee was packed. I am not gning to
take the respomsibility of suggesting that it
go to a standing Committee-and this is no
reflection on flie Committee on Banking and
Commerce. I think that is the most coinpetenit Committee in Canada to deal with a
great many things; but this is a Bull dewling
entirelv with a western problem, and I think
the Committee ýshould be icomposed -largely
of western miemibers representing ail shades of
opinion. I also think tfhat we shouki have
representatives before us of all tihose interested.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The honourable gentleman might suggest that certain members
he added to the Committee on Banking and
Commerce.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: If the Bill were now
referred to a Special Committee suich lais the
honourable gentÉeman bas suggested,
the
Senat-e would be following a, precedent set
some years ago when a similar BilI was Teferred to a Special Coramittee.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: This Bill was considered
in the other Housee by the Commnit.tee on
Agriculture, cornposed of 100 members, and
whi'Ie the West is largely interested in the
Bill, nevertheless -the fact remains tihat it

JUNE 16, 1926M
muet be passed upon by the Houc3e, which is
composed of menibers from botèi the East
and the West.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Rt might be referred to the Committee on Agriculture, which
might be given the right to add VO its members.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Thât will do
me.
Ion, W. B. RCOS: I mnove that the Bill
H
be referred to the Committee on Bankin-g and
Commerce.
The motion was agreedi to.
Hon. Mr.- WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
gentlemen, -as this Bill could -nbV reach the
Banking and Commerce Commite without
24 houis- notice, I would ask that the rule be
suspended in otidler to permit of tihe Committee dealing with it. at once.
The motion was agreed to.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND

READING

Bibi 12, an Act respecting Joliette and
Nonther Raiiway Company.-H-on. Mr. Gor,don.
CRIMINAI CODE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND mo'ved the second
reading of Bili 153,- an Act to amenid tihe
Crisninal Code.
.He said: Honourable gentlemen, we discmssed this Bill pretty fully yesterday when
we had under review an amendment to the
Immigration Act. The two sections which
4re repealed by this Bull were added Vo the
Criminal Code in 1919. It was explained at
that time that, owing to the. period of unrest
through which the world was passing, it was
important to place sections in the Act which,
if they did noV enlarge the powers already
given under the clauses relating to sedition,
would at least make them more definite in
certain ways. IV was further explained that
they 'were intended to replace to a large
extent certain provisions which. had been made
under the War Measures Act by way of
Orders in Council.
Since that time organized labour associa-fions have continually and strongly oomplained.
about these two sections. Every year representatives of the Trades and Labour Congre
when they made their annuai pilgrimage ta
the Government have asked that these two
sections might be repealed, so as to leave the
situation as it was prier to 1919. They have

always expressed a fear that the sections in
question would be directed against the activities of labour unions, although. those responsible for the insertion of thoee sections
always claimed that such was nlot the intention. At ail events,, we have already in the
Code sufficient protection in the mnatter of
sedition. We have the precautions embodied
in section 87, and also provisions concerning.
unlawful assemblies. In section 130.we find
provisions rcgarding sedition, oaths or engagements in societies, and in section 132 against
seditious words, seditious libel and seditious
conspiracy. Section 135 deals with libels on
a foreign sovereign, and section 136 with the
publishing of false news.
Under the British law sedition is an old
offense, but there has neyer been a strict
definition of the terni. In 1880, 1 think it was,
the British Commissioners entrusted with the
work of drafting the English Code inserted
a clause defining seditious intention as
follows:
An intenrLion ta brimg itta batred or oontenipt or
"iffection agaînet the persan of Her
ta excite
Majesty, or the government and oonetttution of the
L'nited Kingadim or of &ny Part of it e by Iaw
estabLished, or eitherHouse of Pailiiaimeut, or thie
administration of justic.è; or
Ta excite Her Maesoty's subjets ta attempt ta
procure, otherwise tban by aawful meansi tAie aheration of nye ntatter in chuioh or "tate -by law
established; or
To raise diaoonteuit or disaffection angst Her
MJajesty's subject.s; oir ta pronwte feelinigs of iii
wilI and haetûiity ibetiween different clames of such
subjects.

This was not made part of the British
let
Code. Paillianent, preferred rather Voe the
tribunuls decide as te sedition under the
common law, es the practice al'ways had been
in the puat. The saine thing happened in
Canada. When 1?he Griminal Code was introduced into our Parliament there was in it a
similar clause to the one contained hn the
English Code. After a' good deal of discussion and criticism, both in Committee and
hn the House, the clause wus not acoepted,
anid we were lef.t with the old Brtish law
concerning sedition, and were governed by
the common qaw of England.
Thtis law has aiiways worked well in Canada,
as wel'l as in Great Britain, and I amn firmly
of the opinion that the sections added in
1910 on aecount of 'the unrest which was said
ta prevail at the tirne, are nlot now at al
necessary. The olBers of the Departmnent of
Justice bave stated that there have been no
proeecutions before our courts anywhere in
the, country under these sections.
Section 4 of the BIb is the saine as the
subsection. at present in force, except that .the

SENATE
words "of previotia chaste character" are
deleted. The words, "No person accused of
any offience under this subs.etion shaill be
convicted upon the evidence of one witneaa
unless suich witness is corroborated in some
material psrticul-ar by evidence irnplicating
the accused." are struck out, as this provision
is now conta.ined in section 1002 of the Code.
Subseotion 1 of section 301 providoe punishment for cases of girls under the age of 14.
Hon, W. B. ROSS.- I cannot find that
section 1002 -covers that.
HNon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Section 11002
reads as follows:
No peraon accused of any offence under an& of ithe
hereunder mentiened sections isail be onvicted upon
thse evidence of one witness, unjiess suchi witifeas is
corroborated ini sonne moterial pexticular by evidence
iîmpfcating the accuised:(a) Treason, Part Il., section 74;
(b) Perjury, Part IV., se tire 174;
(c) Offencea under Part V., sections 211 io 220
inclusive.

Hon. W. B. ROSS:

T-hat does flot cover

it.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
I think you will.
Eind it je under section 103 instead of section
1003.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Yes, the explication of this clause contains an eror.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I think ît is a slipthat the man who drafted it did not check
it back.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: At aIl events, if
the Bill goes to, Committee, I wil verify the
reference. We wi1I not take the Cominittee
stage this afternoon. I realize that I -arn
presenting to the Senate an aimendmnent whioh
al.ready on more than one occasion has been

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: A number of times.
Hon. 'Mr. DANDURAND:
I would not
ilike to naine -the number of times that the
Senate has exprressed an opinion upon it. As
this is an omnibus Bill, very iikely the Senate
wiIil desire te, examine it in Committee.
The next amendment cornes under clause 5
of the Bill, the purpose of which is to restore
to the Crown the right to appeal to the Court
of Appeal on any ground of appeal whîch
involves a question of law alone. Section
1013, as enacted by chapter 41 of the statutes
of 1923, gives a right of appeal i such cases
to a person convicted on indictmnent, but not
to the Attorney General.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: I think there will be a
discussion on that point, but the second reading miglit be given now.
lion.

Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There is another
clause covering the question of script frauds:
(1) Subpamraspis (iv) of pairagraps (a) of saetion
one 4thousand, one hundred end forty of the said Act,
as ezteci by section itwenty o>f chapter tjwenty-five
of ýthe statutoe of 1921, is isereby repeaied.
(2) Any one w4so commaits or bas ikt any tmne boretofore commnitted any offence relating tes or azising out
of tise location of lancd whâoh was; paid foc in who0e
or in part by script or was granted upon certificatea
issued to, half-breeds in conýnection seith thse extinguisisment of Indian titie, "Ial, wjt-h respect tisereto, be
liable to prosecution or to en action for penalties
or 'forfeikure in tise samne manner and to tise saine
extent as if said aubparagraph (iv) qiad nover been
enacted.

The suhparagraph to he repealed was added
to section 1140 of the Criminal Code by
chapter 25 of the statutes of 1921, and the part
of the section hereby affected now reads as
follows:
No prosecution for an offence againat tisis Act, or
action for penalties or forfeiture, sall be comsnenced:
(a) after tise expiration of three ya
f rom rbhs turne
of its consisjon if sncb offence be
(iv) any offence relating f0 or ariaing out of the
location of land wich waa paid for ins whole or in
part tsy script or waa granted upon certificates issued
to isaff-breeds in connection wits tise oxtinguishinent
of Indian title.
Thse object of Visis anenent is to strike out the
tirne lirait of three years witisin wh'ich an action msmet
be cosnrnenced for aucis an offenc.

This relates more especially to transactions
that have taken place in the West. The
matter was reviewed by this Chamber beflore
and met with some opposition. The Bill was
not pressed, or the amendmtint was rejected.
However, I understand there wa.s a general
consensus of opinion in the other Chamber
in favour of striking out this tiine limit. The
amendmnent passed the other Chamber unanlmously, without any criticismn. So I submit it
tio the wisdom of this honourable House.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: There wilI he a discussion at Least about the first line of the
new subsection 2:
Anyone who commoits or bas at an~y tine isoretofore
conniitted-

That would carry a man back fifty years.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In what clause
is that?
Hon. Mr. ROSS: That îs subsection 2 of
section 6, the very last clause of the Bill.
It is retroacetive legislation, and there will be
at least a discussion of that. I do not know
the mind -of the House with regard to it, but
it will be challenged.
Hon. Mr. BELCOlURT: Are there any
speciai reasons why those wordÉ should be
there? One would imagine that the necessity
for a provision of that sort would disappear
rather than increase.

269

JUNE 16, 1926
Hon. Mr. DAN'DURAIND: 1 have .no special
note or memorandum on thia question, but I
éhiould suppose that by striking out the time
lirait the effect of this arnendment would he
the bringing hefore the trihunais of off ences
committed before the three years mentioned.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No; since the
expiration of the three years. That is
evidently what is meant. It would cover
cases that werc not prosecuted within. the thre
years, or, in other words, the cases that have
arisen since the expiration of the pcriod.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I suppose it
wou*ld mean cases which were covered by the
time Iimit, but which can be rcached now if
the time limait is struck out. However, 1 arn
simply surmising. I will get proper information on this matter and have it when we go
into Comrnit'tee.
Hon. Mr. MoM BANS: I may say for the
information of the honourable gentleman that
that particular clause received very careful
consideration at the hands of a Special Comxnittec of which Sir James Lougheed was
Chairman. At that time we brought over frorn
the House of Commons the gentleman who
had introduccd it there, and we had a very
long discussion. The gentleman who introduced the measure in another place was convinced that it was a very unwisc thing te
make a new crime of sornething that had
heen comrnitted in the past. That is the
effeet of it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is, to revise
it?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: It is no crime at
present. If you pass this amendrnent you
provide punishment for something that was
donc before the Act came into force. There
wcre other considerations deait with. We
went fully into the matter. It was thoroughly
discussed, and it was shown that the old scrip
matters dealt with in this clause would not be
of any benefit ta anyone.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Let us think of
this, for instance. If this section cairnes, a
man may be prosecuted on a matter concerning scrip, in which there may have been a
great deal of correspondence between him and
the Department. The threc years have expired. He says: "This matter is finished
now." He tears up all his correspondence,
whieh might be sufficient to estahlish a defence. It seems to me it .would be the
casiest thing to do.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: Oh, yes. Many persons
may have dicd.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Or they may have
destroyed the evidence upon which their
defence is hased.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: I understand the honounable gentleman has just moved the second
reading, and that we may take the Bill section
by section when we corne to deal with it in
Committee of the Whole.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

SPECIAL WAR REVENUE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
rcading of Bill 115, an Act to arnend the
Special War Revenue Act, 1915.
Ho said: Some of the principal arnendments to this Act are as follows:
1. Reduction of postage on letters for
transmission by post for any distance within
Canada. There will be no reduction on drop
letters and post cards. This section cornes
into force on July 1.
2. The starnp tax on receipts is rernovcd.
This tax was found to be vexatious and was
evaded in many cases. It was considered
advisable to repeal it. This section came into
force on April 16.
3. The tax on playing cards, which was
formrncly eight cents a pack and fifteen cents
a pack, is now made a tax of ten cents on al
packs. This change is for the purpose of
making administration casier. There has been
difficulty in ascertaining the value of carde
imported frorn the United Kingdom, whcre
thcy have a large excise tax which brought
the value up to over $24 a grass. The change
will give practically the same revenue.
4. There is a section in the Bill to rernove
doubt as ta whether goads are hiable to the
consumaption or sales tax when sold under
process of law or under a lien. A decision

270

SENATE

was given in the courts that a bank which sold
lumber was not liable to the tax, as it was not
a manufacturer or producer.
The change
does away with the advantage which such
bank or other seller would have over the
legitimate dealer.
5. One of the principal additions to the list
of articles which are exempt from the consumption or sales tax is articles and materials,
not to include permanent equipment, which
enter into the cost of the manufacture or
production of goods manufactured or produced
by a licensed manufacturer or producer. This
removes an objectionable feature.
6. The sales tax on canned fish has been reduced by one-half.
7. Another important feature of the Bill is
the removal of the excise tax, not the consumption or sales tax, on passenger automobiles valued at not more than $1,200, when
such cars are imported under the British preferential tariff, or from countries enjoying most
favoured nation treatment, or are made in
Canada; provided that in the case of cars
imported before the 1st day of April, 1927,
at least forty per cent of the cost of producing the finished automobile has been incurred
in the country of production, and provided
that in the case of cars imported on and
after the lst day of April, 1927, at least fifty
per cent, of the cost of producing the finished
automobile has been incurred in the country
of production. This change went into operation on June 8.

CRIMINAL CODE BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 153, an
Act to amend the Criminal Code.
Hon. Mr. Stanfield in the Chair.
On section 1-unlawful associations; publishing, etc., seditious books, etc.:
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen,
in dealing with the Immigration Bill the
Leader of the Government made mention' of
this Bill. Historically at least there is a
connection between the two Bills, they having arisen out of the state of the country
in the year 1919. This is a companion Bill
to the one amending the Immigration Act
which we dealt with the other day, and which
gave power to deport persons under certain
circumstances. The object of the law of 1919
was to guide judges and courts and magistrates and all other officers in dealing with
cases of sedition, and the crimes of seditious
words or unlawful assemblies, which are somewhat of the same nature, were dealt with in
the Criminal Code under sections 133 and 134.
You will see section 133 printed on the second
page of this Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is prefaced
by 132, which remains in the Act.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Yes, but section 133
was repealed in 1919. Then you had these
two sections 97A and 97B enacted, and anyone who has looked over them will see that
they only give in detail what, perhaps with
a new section in the Code supplementary te
section 133, might when the time comes be
deleted. I would suggest to the honourable
gentleman that the repeal of these two sections is premature, on the same ground that
we suggested that it was premature to repeal
the clauses amending the Immigration Act. I
think this House of its own motion could
take up both these Acts and deal with them,
and consult the law officers, and have the law
amended in an intelligent manner. It is just
possible that conditions are quieting down,
but from what we read of Europe in the press
and of the conduct both of the Russian Government and certain Russian organizations, I
am not sure that it is just wise to repeal
these two sections. That is why I think this
Bill is inopportune, and I would suggest to
the honourable gentleman that he drop the
repeal of these two sections and just leave
the law as it stands for the present.
I

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think perhaps
can throw a little more light upon the

JUNE 17, 1926
reason for this legisiation than I did in maving the second reading of the Bill yesterday.
We ail realize that, after the war and follawing -the revolution ini Russia, there was somnewhat of a commotion. This commotion
extended to our own country, and perhaps
explains the legislation which is now upon
the Statute Book.
I draw the attention of the Senate to the
fact that this is very exceptional legisiation,
such as appeared under somewhat similar
form while the French Revolution was
smouldering and developing on the other
sideocf the Channel. In 1792 there was consid.-rable fear throughout England of those
ideas which in divers ways found vent in
a desire. within a certain limited group of
people, for more advanced legisiat ion; and
it was in the endeavour to curb that movement that legisiation was introduced somewhat on these lines, treating of treason and
sedition.
I might cite an extract from May's Constitutional History of England, page 33,
wh ere he says:

It vas a criais of unexsnspled difficulty, needing the
utmoat v1gilance and firinnesa. Ministera, charged with
the main-tenance of order, could not neglect siny security whieh the peril of t.he tire demanded. They were
sectcre of support in punishing sedition and treason:
the guilty f ew would meet with no sycnpsthy amnong
a loyal people. But, conselied by thieir new Chancellor
and convert, Lord Loughborough, and the law officers
of the Crowr, the Government gave too ready a credence to the reports of their agents; acnd inve.sted
the doings of a simail knot of democrata--chiefly working inen-with thse dignity of a wide-spread conipiracy
to overturn the constitution. Ruhing over afree State,
they learned to dresd the people, in ls spirit of
tyrants. Inatead of relying upon the soaer judgsnent
of thse country, they appealed te ils fears; and in
repressing seditious praetces, they were prepaared ta
sacrifice liberty of opinion. Their policy, dictated by
the circurntances of a time of strange and untried
danger, was approved by the prevailing sentimnent of
their eontesnporaries; but bas not been justified i an
age of greater freedom, by the maturer judgment of
poeterity.

If honourable gentlemen will look at the
legisiation which we put on the Statute
Book in 1909, they will find that throughout
there is an eff ort to curb, the freedom oi the
subjent, and to limit the expression of
Those clauses would mostly' fall
opinion.
under the generic term of sedition, or conspirncy to commit a felanjous act; and not
only did we go ta the extent af bringing in
legisiation which would reach beyond the
ordinary interpretation of sedition, but we
withdrew the safeguard which everyoiie wil!
admit is the pride of the British subjeet. The
chapter is replete with provisions covering
sedition and its mnanifetations in. various
ways. I wilI read section 132:

el 1

132. Seditious words are worda expressive of a aeditîous intention.
2.«A: seditious libel is a libel exprsive of a seditioua
intention.
3. A seditious conspiracy is ans agreemuent between
two or more persona ta carry itt execution a seditious
intention.

Following these statements as to what is
seditious . or ta be understood as seditiaus,
cornes section 133, which at one fell blow we
wiped off aur Code; and what does it say?
Lt reads as follows:
133. No one shail ba deemesi to have a seditioua intion only because he intends in gond faith,(a) to show that Hia Majeaty bas been misled or

Honourable gentlemen will see that the
safeguard that the British subj ect had, and
that he bas under the system of Iaws in
Great Britain, disappeared.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Is it not a fact
that within the last six months legislatian bas
been introduoed in Great Britain designed ta
deal with that very same subi ect with which
the legislatibn of 1919 was intended ta deal
in this country, and that that legisiation is
quite as stringent as what is found here?
Hon. Mr. DANDUIIAND: I do not know
of that. I always understoad, and stili lielieve, that the legisiation which we had liefore 1910 prevails in Great Britain ta this
day, and bas been deesçied sufficient ta cape
with any such offences as are mentioned in
sections 97A and 97B. I would lie surprised
ta hear that the British Parliament lias passed
such legisiation.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I arn almoat certain that some such legisiatian has been
passed, and that the Iaw as we had it in section 133 is nat now the law af Great Britain.
They have actually taken steps ta pravide
themselves with powers that are ta lie found,
mare or less, in these sections which it is
now proposed ta repeal.

Hlon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I understand
the warrant had been issued under the law
of sedition.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I understand the
trial ivas conducted under new legisiation
passed at the instance of the present Government. 1 tbink it would be well to make
sure of that before we corne to a final conclusion, if we are to, base our legislation on
what tliey have in England.
Hon. Mr. DANIDURAND: I cited special
legisiation which Ivas passed at the time of
the French Bevolution, which was afterwards
withdrawn. 1 wish to draw the conclusion
that since wc have returned to what I regard as normal times we should withdraw the
exceptional
legisiation contained
in the
amending Act of 1919, because that legislation undoubtedly smacks of tyranny, and
would be verx' difficult of application. No
one would be safe; the simple fact of import.ing a book would make bim liable.
lion, W. B. ROSS: Would the honourable
gentleman excuse an interruption, if I point
out what I meant to mention, but perhiaps
did not stress very strongly-the difference
between the French revolution and the Russian revolutions? The French nation, as a
nation, and even private organizations in
France, did not attempt te attack organized
society in another country. They were gentlemen, compared with the revolutionists in
11ussia, who have an organized propaganda
in foreign countries. They make no secret
c)f Ihat; and, until there is some change in
the conduct of the Russian Governrnent and
the Red societies there, I think it is prernature te take down any of these barriers. I
admit the provisions are high-handed,' and if
the Governmient 'of Russia were acting as that
of an ordinary civilized country would act, 1
think we might remove tho;se barriers; but
iîntil they show some signs of doing that, I
think it would be a mistake.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Wcll, of course
everyone is entitled te bis own opinion; but
I have such confidence in the common sense
of our population, and of its desire for eider
and peace, that I would net hesitate for one
instant te withdraw the special legisiation,
and allow the country te develup under our
ordinary criminal law as it was before the
Act of 1919, simply declaring that sedition is
a crime, and that censpiracy te commit seditien is a crime. I would then sleep in peace,
feeling that anyene wbo bas designs of violence
a.gainst our constitution, our authorities, or
our laws, coul be brought before the tribunals
and condemned.
lon. Mr. GRIESBACI.

It is because I feel tihat this ie such a free
country, one that has enjoyed such good order
and freedorn, that I an flot afraid to, trust
the people with the instruments that *e have
at handl to repress any Inovement which would
smack of revolution; and it is sornewhat repellant tio my naiture te think that the safeguards rnentioned in section 133 are necessary.
That section allows of citizens meeting in
public squares to, condernn even the good
Government that we -have at present at the
head of the Dominion, and aise Provincial
Governments-to condernn thern for supposed
acts of omission or commission. We knowv
that it is very difficult to discern between just
and unjust criticisrn. We know what extravagant language is used on the platform, and
in the press-even in newspapers, tbat bear
a n appearance of respeotability. Extravagant
language is used to express ideas, and there is
ne question (bat if anyone wanted te invoke
the present law -he ýcould have accusations
brought against the editors of newspapers for
their very extravagant language towards the
constituted authorities of this country in every
town and city almost every merning. I arn
net speakinýg of election tirnes, wben we bear
things t'hat seem teo be the produet of injsanity
from the lips of many people, although they
are addressing free Canadian eleotors.
Now, when one examines this legislation it
smacks of aii'tecracy, and it is se vague in its
definitien of seditieus offences that we owe it
te ourselves te show the world that we have
returned te normalcy. 1 will net go through
these varieus cnactments; but one will find,
especially one who has sorne legal training,
that they contain accusations which it would
be mest difficult to establish, and which would
lead te charges and trials that would be quite
uni ustifled. iFor example, take the last clause
of 97B:
(3) Any person who Importa into Canada from uny
other country, or atternpts to import by or through
aniy ineans whatsoever. any book, newspaper, periodicai
pamphlet, picture, paper, circoflar, card, letter, writing,
print, publication or document of any kind as described
in tis section, shall be guilty of an offence and shali
be lia.ble to imprisoriment for not more thon twenty
yeBrs.

The simple fact of ordering a book which
bas bee-n mentioned by a friend as containing
an interesting opinion on a suibject may bring
one wit'bin the terrns ýof this Act; and yet the
persen may possibdy be unaware thit there
were in the book teachings; variously expressed
that could be judged by a jury te be treasenable or seditieus.
Hon. WT.B. ROSS: I would suggest te the
benourable gentleman tbat it is noit fair te

JUNE 17, 1926

1, because these books have to be books that
"teach, advocate, or ad'vise or defend the urne,
without au.thori'ty of Iaw, of force, violence,
terrorisai," etc. When you talk of keeping
a book out you have to say what is the nature
of the book.
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN: I do flot kaow of
any cases in which prosecutians under this Act
have been even begun where it was not obvious
that it was necessary to prosecute. After the
French Revolution, for a period of fifteen or
tweaty years, there were undoubtedly prosecutions in England whieh were no credit ta
British justice; but 1 have flot heard of
anything since 1919 that one could consider
even remotely as a straining of the Islanguage
of this Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
0f course, 1
did flot go to the definition of the offence,
but I amn ready to take it as contained in
section 97B:
(1) Any person who prints, publishes, edits,
iBues,
circulates, sella, OT offers for mûe or distriLutin any
book, newspaper, periodical, peamphlet, picture, ps<er,
circuler, card, latter, writing, print, pubbiction or

advised or defended, or who @hall in any mnanner teach,
sdvocate, or advise or defend the use, without autAicwity of law, of force, violence, terrorisrn, or VJIy.I
injury Io peraon or property, or threats of snob injury, as a means of eccomplishing any goverieenta],
ixwlustrial or economic change or o'therwise, sha] lie
guilty of en offence and liable to imprisonment for
not mocre than twenty years.

1 contend that ail these offenices, if sufficiently marked ta be described ia an indictmcnt, may corne under the clauses respecting sediition that are already in the Act.
I stated on the second reading ithat the Parliament ai Great Britain and the Parliament
of Canada had ref used .ta adopt a definition
af "sedition," in order ta leave it ta, the
judge and jury to estimate the act of which
a citizen might be accused; and this has
been deemed sufficient.
The, termes are
elastie enough ta caver ai! cases in which the
State, or peace and good order within the
State, are threatened.
I should ithink, considering the opinion of ail the legal gentemen
who sit in the other chamber, that ail the
offences enumerated in the clauses repealed by
Bill 153 are broadly but sufficiently covered
by the Act as ît stood before 1919; and, if they
are eufflcienly cavered, the suheequent enactment being exceptional, legislation, made because ai the exceptional times through which
wc were passing, it seems ta me that we owe
it ta ourselves and Vo, the community ait large
ta revert ta the general principles with the
application af which we were content for the
fifty years preceding 1919.

For these reasoas I suggest thaot we repeal
sections 97A and 97-B, and thait we restore ta
the Statute Book the clauses that were Withdrawn i 1919, and re'tura Vo the statue quo
ante.
Han. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honouratile gentlemen, I would like ta lay before the House a
f ew facto which ay largely dctermine whether
or not it is really time for us to repeal the
provisions in question, which were inserted
in aur Criminel Code in 1919.
1 shail be
brief.
These sections deal with 'associations
organized in Canada for the purpase of, diffusing here the ideso of the Soviet Government.
They are umly provisions enabling us to, deai
proniptly and swiftly with assoiciations wihose
purpoee is the overthrow of authority.
Section 97A demIs with unlawful associations
whose purpase is:
To bring about any govemnmental, indusa"
or
econoil chnge within C0amda, by use of force,
violence, or physical imjury to pemine or prcperty, or
by threse.

The section goes on ta say that the property ai such associations may be coaflscated;
that the members of the association aisa are
subject ta the penalty provided by 1mw; and
then Vhere 18 a presumption created by the
clause, which describea those who are members
of such associations, or who rnay be presumed
ta be such merahers within the memning ai
the Iaw. Provision is also made for search
warrants, mnd agaiast propaganda by the dissemînation of printed matter.
I take it, honoura:ble gentlemen, that these
sections are the only provisions in the
Criminal Code that enable us to demi swiftly
andi radicalýly with people in this country
simply for the purpose ai overtbrowing
order.
Now let us sec whether, in the flrst place,
the sections are useful, and, secondly, whether
any harm bas resulted from the enactmnat of
these sections and retaining them, in the
Criminal Code. Olten during the year there
are held in the city ai Montreal open meetings at which socialistic principles are upheld.
Have these powers af the law ever -been
mhused? I might go so, far as toamsk, have
Lbey been used when thcy should have been?
But I will tura from the large industrial
centres ai the East, because, forsooth, they
are supposed ta cantain many undesirables
who have entered this country with the inflow
of immigration and are stranded there. Of

Just one word in conclusion, honourable
-gentlemen. In 1919 there was no such propa-ganda; that is quite evident; but since then
the 'Soviets have gained a foothold on the
land, and with the enormous resources at
their disposai they have sedulously spread
their faith.
At bte conclusion of a meeting

Province are less open to socialism. than the
Province of Quebec; kbut there je no doubt
that in tihat Province to-day efforts are heing
made to win over the workers from the legiti,mate labour uniions to te Internationale. I
cann-ot understand how it is that when legis-.
lation such as this je brought to the Government it so oftien has the endorsation of the
honest, fair and sober-minded labour unions
of Canada?
I ;cannot understand it.

Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: Honourable
gentlemen, I had not intended to participate
in thie debate, assuming that it would net
become general; but observations have been
made by my honourable friend who has just
spoken (Hon. Mr. Beaubien), and statemnents
quoted from reliable newspapere, that I feel
ehould for a little wiile, receive the attention
of tbe Houee, and I shail very briefly diseuse
what, in my humble opinion, is a very
serious and important question to Canada.
My honourable friend who has just taken
hie seat expressed the view that Communist
propaganda was not general in 1919. 1 can
assure him from some knowledge of the facte
that in Eastern Canada that was largely true,
but that ini Western Canada the reverse wae
the fact. 1 can tell him that in 1910, in
Calgary, at a convention of Communiste calling
tbcmselves One Big Union advocatee, wbose
headquarters were with the I.W.W. in Chicago,
it was propoeed to bring about a very effective
and general strike in bte faîl of that year.
Ib was propoeed to cut off communication
with the East. The evidence ini the records
of the Labour ' Department indicates the
extent to which preparations were made at
titat time to disrupt organized government,
and to seize the reine of power in Western
Canada. If the Govemment should sec fit
to, look up that evidence, 1 thi.nk it would
open their eyes. At that time an am-

SENATE
bitious young man in the city of Winnipeg
who was anxious to become head of the One
Big Union movement in Western Canada saw
fit to bring about a general strike in that
city. He acted prematurely, and in advance
of the general movement. He was rebuked
by one of his colleagues from Vancouver for
his indiscretion in having brought about the
Winnipeg strike ahead of schedule time-an
indiscretion that probably prevented a very
much more serious situation.
I have always felt that it was not wise
unnecessarily to alarm the people of Canada
in regard to the propaganda that was then
prevalent or the serious advances that it had
then made. After the Winnipeg incident was
closed-and I may say in passing, that had
it not been handled with fairness and firmness
the results would have been very different,
and it might have become a catastrophe-it
looked as though conditions were improving,
and within twelve months the popularity of
the One Big Union revolutionary movement
in Western Canada-because that is what it
was and is to-day-was substantially waning,
and continued to wane for probably two and
a half years until about the beginning of 1924,
since when it has been again in the ascendant.
Hon. Mr. HAYDON: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question? I have been
informed that there is practically no One
Big Union movernent to-day anywhere in
Canada except in the city oif Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I am very glad
my bonourable friend has raised that question. I will attempt to give a little information on that point in a few minutes.
From 1919 down to 1923, I think it is
true ta say that the prospect of the gradua!
elimination of that sentiment in Canada was
growing brighter; but since that time there
has been a turn in the tide, just as there
has been in the United States, to which I
may refer briefly in passing. This struggle
between the Communist element within the
labour world, which is now penetrating into
the agricultural world, as my honourable
friend has just said, is becoming somewhat
of a menace in the United States because of
the fact that its principle and its programme
is to disregard the validity and sanctity of
agreements and contracts, to break them
at will, and to disrupt society and business
wherever and whenever opportunity presents

itself. In the Ottawa Journal of June 15th
I read a statement of Mr. Green, President
of the American Federation of Labour, made

na Denver, Colorado.

He was dealing with

the subject of labour problems in the United

States, and was referring ta general strikes,
their causes and effects.

The despatch says:

General strikes which would involve the violation of
wage agreements were condemned to-day by William
Green, preaident of the American Federation of Labor,
in an address before the convention of the Rotary
International. A general strike, he said, means that
the line of industriel confliot is immediately changed,
so that it seema to become a conteet between employees and Government rather than between employees and employers.

Whenever men in large numbers retire
from all work activities, as they did recently
in England, and as they did in Winn.ipeg to
a somewhat lesser degree in 1919, the whole
community becomes disorganized and distressed, and, as Mr. Green properly says,

the contest then is between the employees
or the workmen who have taken such action
and the Government, be it Provincial, municipal, or Federal. It is no longer a dispute
between employees and employers.

industry and owning it, and having no regard
whatever for the capital invested or the
owners of the capital, began to penetrate the
ranks of the trades unions. And those doctrines are growing: they are being taught in
the schools. Only a few weeks ago a minister of the gospel told me that in a substantial town in my own county there was

a Soviet school of instruction, and that two
churches had found it utterly impossible to
establish a mission in that place because of
the prevailing antipathy toward and opposition to religious teaching of any sort.
It is not true ta say that the time bas
passed when Canada needs no legislative safe-

guards ta enable her ta deal with these matters
should occasion arise. I do nat feel inclined
directly to criticize the Government of the
day, but I do feel disposed and impelled to
draw tihe attention of my honourable friend
the Leader of the Government ta a few facts
that I t'hink .the Government might well contemplate. *My honourable friend yesterday,
in deabing with a Bill ta amend the ImmigraIcaled attention ta the fact that in
tion Act,
the years 1920 and 1921 I supported the withdrawal of the amendments passed in 1919.
I said to the House tîwo years ago, and again
last year, and I say it again now, .that a year
after the Winnipeg difficulty 'I felt just as he
feels now-that the criais was past and that
it was bet.ter ta remove any cause for
criticism, or complaint, or dissatisfaction. or

fear on the part of any citizen sa far as tie
law was concerned. But since the turn of the
tide ta whioh I have referred-and tihere is
a rising tide of Comimuiern not on:ly -in
Canada, but ail over North America to-dayI feel as ma.ny other honouralyle gentlemen do,
and as thousands of members of trade unions,
gaod loyal citizens of this country feeL, that
this -protection ought ta be maint&ined. I
speak witi knowledge concerning tihis matter,
and I cali the attention of the Govemament
ta tihe information contained in certain documents that came into, tahe possession of the
Government at Winnipeg in 1919, siowing
that, these peoiple urged delay until the fal
of that year before strilcing the blow. because
tic railway employece of Canada were not
yet sufficiently edur-ated. I cal attention ta
the faet tiat there were tans of literature
scatitered abroad that summer, especialy
among railway men in Western 'Canada, looking ta the consummation of tihat necessary
education. In the city of Winnipeg, wvhen the
general Êtrike was called, a substantiai number of ra~iway men part-icipated. There was
a sprinkling of mien from every branci of the
service exoept one, the Railroad Telegrapiers,
whom, 1 arn proud ta say, I -have had' tie
honour of representing -for twenty years, and
froin whose ranks there was not a single defection in that trouble. But, gentlemen t, e
is
labour organization in Canada ta-a ta
principally, and in many instances the oniy
anc onsulted by the Government, is Led by
a man who sat in a hotel i the city of
Winnipeg in 1919 and encauraged the mcmbers to get out and strike .in 'violation of an
agreement which was then intact and concer.ning which tihey had no grievance. Is it
any wondcr when the Government accept
advioe and cou-nsel from men assumning ta
represent labour, who came inta Parliament
with a Bill of this sort at this time?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I draw the attention of my honaurable friend ta the statement which I think 1 made more than once,
that the Minister of Justice claimed that
every year there are petitians from. the
Trades and Labour Unions to, withdraw these
clauses.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes, I arn quite
sure that tic Minister of Justice spoke ionestly and correctly; but just as the' House
of Commons lias for four years passed these
amendments year'~after year as a matter of
course, just s0 the Trades and Labour Congress of Canada, meeting year after ycar, bas
a lot of resolutions thrown upon the tableone for the abolition of. thc Senate,, on§e for

277

Old Age Pensions, and one for these amendments to, the Criminal Code-and these are
passed through as a matter of course- But
I arn expressing flot only my personal views,
but the views that I think are entertained
by thousands of Labour men in Canada taday, who find the policies and prineiples in
.which thcy believe-namely, collective bargaining with their employers, and responsibility to respect and fulfil agreements on
their part as well as on the part of their
employers--being attacked, in some cases being endangered, and in a f ew cases destroyed,
hy reason of this very propaganda and the
men bhind it.
It is flot possible that ail men who cal
themselves Labour men, or wha rnay pose as
representing the views of workmen in Canada, should think alike. Differences of opinion
will be found among them, just as among
men in any other walk of life. In the Manufacturers Aseociation many men will be
found who . advocate co-operation and consultation, saying: "Let us work together with
our employees,"1 while others, who are just
as honest in their belief, think they should
run their business without consulting anybody, and that it is flot the concern of ethers
how they conduet their affairs. Thus necessarily there are differences of opinion on
both sides.
But I state ta my honourable friend that
this penetration is going on to-day. The socalled One Big Union movement penetrated
first into the shop trades of the railways in
Canada. It did flot succeed in penetrating
the other branches of railway service, but it
b as gone out under other names, changing its
coat and looking like somnetbing else, and is
doing the same thixïg. This very day there
is an application before the Department of
Labour for a Board of Conciliation, made by
two men who were expelled last, December
from a bona fide Trade Union with whom
one of our railways has an agreement that is
stiII in force, and satisfactory to both parties, neither of whom has asked that it be
chaniged. Those men are now seeking the
establisihment of a Board of Conciliation to determine w-hat? To determine whethei, or not
this new radical revolutionary movement within that brandi of railway service is going ta
be recognized by the railway; the railway company diaving refused ta deal with them or
recognize them. 3aying: "Wie have an agreement with our men in Vhis branch of serce

application. Ilere would flot ýhave been any
doubt a few years ago as to what wouild have
happened to that application. Similar ones
have been before the Department of Labour,
to my knowledge, at varîous times since 1915.
1 hope the Governmcnt will realize the
importance of this whole situation, of the
varlous and wide ramifications of this movement, and that, instead of continuing to encourage that sort of thing. they will stand
behjnd the bundreds of thousands of Labour
mnen in this country who belong to trade
unions that have established principles such
as Mr. Green announccd in bis Denver
speech. Instead of attempting to discourage
the work that thc unions are endeavouring to
do, the Governmcnt should bclp tbcrn, as weIl
as those who cmploy capital, to dcvelop and
improve this country. I trust the Government will ]end their energies to assist in that
direction instead of Iending an car, howcvcr

My old friend from Montarville (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien) uses the words Socialisai and Couimunism as interchaougeable terais. 1 mugt
differ with himi, because as a 'matter of fact
they are net interchangeable. Socialism is
sometimee defined -as the common owner@iip
of things used in comnion, or some words to
that effeet. Thera the eioeialist stops: he advocatas 'bis views by ordinarydiscussion, by
propagande, and so on. But the Communist
cornas along and carrnes t.hat formula to its
logical conclusion, saying that what ha SAvocates shai be brought about by force. eo
he ad~Vocates the destruction of ordered Gov'erament by force. Tha people who framed
this clause had no knowledge of that proposai,
but in 1919 this country beca'me acquainted
for the first time with the systema of Communism and what it means. I venture to
assert that only by the clauses which we voted
upon a mioment ago can Communsm be deait

nullify the other -clauses, or softan them io

vists; that is the strong point. They are controlling the education of other minds. They
are actually instructing our young people,
and are thus becoming a menace.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourable gentlemen, I voted againt the
first clause on exactly the same grounds on
which I based my opposition to section 41 of
the Bill which we had under 'consideration
the other day. If this clause stood by itself,
I would consider it a clause which in normal
times ought to be supported and might well
be put on the Statute Book. I have been
trying in my own mind to see what would
be the effect if, after two assertions by this
body, on section 41 of the preceding Bill
and on the first clause of this, we took the
opportunity of passing this section. I have
been trying to determine whether such action would not essentially weaken the stand
that the majority of the Senate took on the
two preceding clauses. As I have said, this
clause involves a proposition which, standing
by itself, could hardly be objected ta by any
person in normal times. But would it be
wise ta insert it after abstracting the other
two clauses? Further, is such an affirmation
necessary? It is imp'lied and inherent in our
constitution.
I differ absolutely from the opinion of my
honourable friend who leads this House, that in
this respect that we in Canada are in an
easier position to-day than we were in 1917.
Looking abroad, and taking into consideration
the whole field-and that is what we must do
nowadays, because no country stands by itself-I do not find that the moving spirit
which is at the heart and kernel of this great
drive against constituted authority has at all
slackened in its propaganda or the vigour
with which it is spreading and applying it.
We had very good proof to the contrary only
the other day. Taking a broad view, you cannot look at any quarter of the wide wofld in
which there is trouble which threatens existing institutions without finding underneath it
the spirit and genius of the Russian Soviet.
When trouble arose at Shanghai a year ago,
you found the Bolsheviks and the Soviets
there. Canton has been in a state of armed
confliet amongst factions for the last year
or more, and there again the Soviet Government, by their money, their agents and official
representatives, were heart and soul in and
under that trouble. And to-day the fight is
waged along the sanie lines. Now we get news
that the Russian element is being made ta recede; then we get news that it has come to the
front again. The strife is on. At Pekin we
find a similar situation. Take the disastrous
internal wars that have been occurring in
Hon.

Mr. GRIESBACH.

China during the past two years, and underneath the movements of the Tuchuns or the
great military governors you find Soviet Russia active-not only active in propaganda,
but active with its cash.
What had you the other day in Great
Britain? The tenet of the organization in
Russia is: "Wherever trouble shows its head
in an organized, well-governed country and
you can profit by it, there put your propagandists in, there put in your money." First
occerred the strike of the miners, and there
was sympathy from Russia. A general strike
was ordered by the Trades and Labour
Council in Great Britain.
There was a
splendid oportunity.
And what happened?
Not only were there propagandists in Great
Britain, but millions of money were sent out
of Moscow to Great Britain-for what purpose?
Ostensibly to assist the labour men
in carrying on their strike, but primarily to
make trouble for an organized government in
Great Britain. The British Government is
not given ta impulsive and fanatical outbreaks in its foreign policy, and yet within
two weeks a strongly worded note went
from the British Government, reminding the
Russian Soviets in Moscow that not only
were they committing a breach of international courtesy and custom, but they were
violating the arrangement that they themselves had made in treaty with Great Britain
by sending money to the country for the
purpose of making it diflicult for constitutional government in Great Britain ta be
carried on.
These are facts and you cannot escape from
them.
Compare the situation in Moscow
to-day with what it vas two, three or four
years ago. In the circle which commands influence and directs affairs there is now a more
thoroughly organized and stronger determination to make trouble everywhere in the world
until the present conditions of society and
government are overturned. Canada will not
be left out of that effort. Canada is not
being left out. My honourable friend may
stand upon the higli principle of trust in the
Canadian people; he may be confident that
they will be equal to all events; at the same
time I think it is well that we should lock
our doors to keep out the burglars, and should
keep in our own hands the instrumentalities
for the protection of the family, of church
and religious life, of social life as we understand it. of our municipal and our national
life. The Bolshevik is opposed to every one
of these. If he had his way there would be
no family; there would be no religion; there
would be no government except the govern-

JUNE 17, 1926
ment of force, the principle. "Take ail; give
nothing." That spirit is abroad. Although
wc have at this very moment probably the
strongest peace influences that ever were had
mn the world, no man with a head on his
shaulders can, in looking over the world, be
satisfied that we are flot in for even more
and deeper trouble than we have experienced.
It is only because of these new influences for
peace that society has 'been enabled so far
to, strive successfullly against the spirit of
discontent which is at work everywhere. It
is working in Canada. We have in this
country flot only honest Canadians, flot only
people who have been born under our institutions, who have grown up under them and
are loyal to them, but we are every year
taking into our country a certain number of
people who, while good in theinselves, have
flot heen born in the atmosphere of British
institutions, and whose views are in many
respects antagonistic to ours. It is upon
these péople that the propaganda is working
to-day. It is the teaching amongst the
children of these people that is preparimg the
citizenship of the future for operations which,
are adverse to the moral health, the progreus
and the permanence of our country.
Therefore I repeat what I stated th other
le
day: the present does not seem to me ta, 'e
the time ta retreat. Every move we make
to, soften our opposition to this wrong propaganda is an encouragement ta the propagandist himself and weakens the position of law
and order in this country. Now, as a mere
matter of voting, 1 do flot like ta vote down
a proposition like that, and I have feit ohliged ta give my views on it, ta show that,
whilst 1 agree that it is perf-ectly riglit and
just, I question whelther the present is juqt
the time when we should put the proposed
isection upon aur &tatute Book, or whether
in any case it is necemary to affirm what is
already inherent in aur system.
Hon. N. A. BELOOURT:
Honourable
gentlemen, I can quite understand the cagency af same af the arguments that have
been advanced by the last three speakers
as applied ta the section which has just been
deýfeated, but iI cannat at ail see the applicab-ility of what bas been said ta the proposed
section 133. 1 am afraid that hanouraible
gentlemen have been so carried away by their
desire ta prevent the propaganda which is
being carried on that they have failed, t.o
recognize the basic princîple embodied in
section 133. If hanoura:ble gentlemen wii
read that section carefully they wiIl see that
it concerns not the propaganda af Bolshevism but the strangest and plainest rights

af Canadians as a wbole. What is the resuit
af denying this proposition? I take but one
illustration, it means that newspapers *may
not do what it is nat merely the right but
the duty of us ail ta do, that is, ta criticize
Government measures. The thing is so plain
ta me that II cannot understand how it could
escape the attention of anyone who would
serutinize it:
133. No
intention
(a) to
mistaken

one aiali be deemned to have a eeditiouis
only because he intenda in good faith,show that Hie Majeàty hàw been miiied or
in hie measures.

That appiies ta the Government of the
United Kingdom; it applies ta the Government of Canada; it applies to, the Government af any one af aur Provinces. No one
would be allowed to criticize publicly the
Acts whieî have been passed during this
Sm'sion-you could not discuss some of the
measures which the Senate has refused ta
adopt, for ta discuss them would be sedition
-if the princi-ple contrary ta that enunciated
in the proposed section 133 is admitted.
Let us follow it up:
To point out errors or defects -in the government or
eonstitution of the United Kinplomn.

Why, you could nat criticize the Constitution af Canada; you could nojt suggest any
amendments ta it. The mere suggestion, for
instance, of the abolition af this House could
nat be advocated or urged in any way. You

be a Canadian.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: We do not want ta
urge that.
Hon. Mr. BEIJCURT: You do not want

Hopi, Mr. BEWLOURT: ]But wbqt is put

.wîth the subject-n#tter invoived in etione
97A &nd 071B, I amn tryiPg to point out Uiat
tWe regsop advnwed against section 133 ujgiit
well be advanced (though I do Dot apee
with it and 1 voted the other way) Dgainst
sections 97A and '97B; but to apply thet
argument to, section 133 is somnething which
seem>q to me to be wholly iliagical. It seems
ta me that a.ny honoura-bie member, though
he. had voted against. thle first section of t) is
'Bill, might very well support this section* 2.
The two sections are flot bound' together.
They deal with different subi ects, and to vote
.against anc and in favour of the other wou]d
flot be at al inconsistent.
1 say that the
proposed section 133 contain8 a principle
.which, as f understa.nd, my right honourable
friend (Rig-ht Hon. Sir George E. Foster)
wauld flot deny. I understood hiin to say
that he was quite wilîing to admit its reasonaibleneses; that in ardinary times he wouid
vot e for it, and he disliked to, vote agaînst
it inow. That position I quite understand.
1 say that if you vote agninst the subjctmatter of section 133 yon are voting against
a principle or a doctrine which is ta be
faund ail thriough aur law, and in accordance
with which we have al'ways acted. That is
the position I take. I repeat that if some
honourabie gentlemen wish ta, vote against
section lW~ on the ground that it is already
in the law and that it is unnecessary ta put
it in again, I can understand the argument.
Hou. Mr. GRIESBMJH: Is it not a faet
that everybody admits that what is contained
in this section ie, shall I say, the omrmon
Iaw; that it is a matter of common knowiedge and cammon acceptance, ta suah an
extent that 'it is unnecessary ta, put it in the
Iaw; and that what is proposed is dangerous
in that it might quaiify and weaken. the other
section?
Hop. Mr. BELOOURT: Nobody has presented thgt argument before. 1 cannot understand the argument appiied ta 133 being
appiied ta 97A and 97B.
Hon. Mr. DANIDURAND:
Now we are
just at the point af disagreement. It is just
possible. that it may weaken 97À and 97B3: it
may sof ten the whoie texture of tha Act.

Honourabie
gentlemen, 1 do nat know the state of mind
of the Senate as ta section 4. 1 suppose I
n eed not give any further explanation. than
J gave on the second reading. I move the
adoption ai this clause.
Hlon. W. B. ROSS: I have ta appose this
section. Section 301 of the Code deals first
with offenées againet girls beiow the age of
14 on the principle that they are not natural
offences. Parliament has iegisiated on the
assumption that such a crime can be attnibuted oniy ta ane person, nameiy, ta, the
man. There has neyer been any quarrel with
that principie in this House; we have aiways
necognized that if a man assaults a girl below
the age af 14 he is outside the pale and shauld
be severely punished. As ta girls between the
age of 14 and 16, it is different. The offence
there is treated as a sexual offence. We have
always taken the stand that the section
shouid not operate unless it is proven the girl
was af previaus chaste character. In cannection with that, you muet remember that the
law is careful ta say that she je presumed ta
be af previous chaste character unless there
is positive evidence ta the contrary.
Then there is the portion of the clause
requiring corroboration. I cannot find that
you provide for that.
Han. Mr. DANDURAND:
The expianatory note is not complete. The iaw was
amended iast year hy chapter 38 of 1025.
Hon. W. B. ROSSf: If that je correct, my
ahbjection would go. There je no use having
it in two places in the law. If the honourable gentleman is certain that it je in the
Act of 1925, I arn content, but 1 could nat
find that feûture covered by foliawing the
marginal notes and explanationE.

Hon. W. :B. ROSS: The words "previous

that very thing. I am perfectly willing that
severe laws should be passed against criminals
of this class, but in endeavouring to do right
we must be careful that we do not do wrong.
I am not sure
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
that all members understand the purport of
Section 301 now reads:
this amendment.
Everyone is guilty of an indictable offense and liable
to imprisonment for five years who carnally knows
any girl of previous chaste character under the age
of sixteen and above the age of fourteen, not being
his wife, and whether he bel eves her to be above the
age of sixteen years or not.

The words "of previous chaste character" are
to bc dropped.
If this Bill passes, there can
be no question raised against her character if
the connection is established.
Hon. iMr. BELCOURT:
about this amendment?

What brought

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
We have discussed it more than once in the Senate.
It
is primarily brouglt forward at the demand
of many societies who are interesting themselves in young girls, and who believe that
they should have that additional protection.
It is in order to make the offence more serious,
and to prevent the allegation that the girl was
not of previous chaste character.

Hon. Mr. B'EAUBIEN: In the course of

A young man who came from Europe
was enticed by a girl of less than fourteen
but who appeared to lie very much older than
she was.
He followed lier, with the result
that an accusation was laid, and although it
was proved that this girl looked like a woman,
and tfiat she had been in a house of ill fame,
the man had to be condemned and was sent to
the St. Vincent -de Paul penitentiary.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:

That is not this

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Yes.
Then the
law was changed so that between the ages of
fourteen and sixteen the girl had to be of
previous chaste character.
Now what do you
want to do?
You want to render more
rigorous a clause which can lbe applied with
terrible rigour.
If a young man should have
the miefortune to be led astray by a girl of
sixteen who might look eighteen or twenty,
and who had for two or three years been
in a louse of ill fame, there would be no

seems to me that we must be very careful
lest we forge some of these articles of the
criminal law into instruments for blackmail,
and with the intention of protecting society
infliot a scourge upon it.
Section 4 was negatived: yeas, 13; nays,

On section 5-right of appeal of Attorney
General:
HonourabIe
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
gentlemen, when the criminal appeal amendments were put into the Code in 1923, the right
which the Crown theretofore had of going to the
Court of Appeal in proper cases upon questions of law was taken away, and the purpose
of the proposed amendment is te restore to the
Crown the same right of appeal which it formerly had.
I recognize that this matter has already
been examined into by the Senate, and that
it did not feel like giving the Crown that
right. The Committee, to which was referred
the Bill, took the ground that once an accused person has appeared before a court of
competent jurisdiction and has been found
not guilty, whether by mistake of law or
otherwise, the Crown should not be at liberty
to drag him before another court. It seems
to me, however, that in adopting this view
the Committee did not have due regard to
the proper administration of justice. It appears to me incredible that we should proceed upon the view that questions of law
arising in the administration of justice are to
be left to justices of the peace, magistrates
and other courts of first instance, thus adopting the principle that the rights of the publie are to be left to the lowest courts, although by the saine law the criminal classes
are permitted to carry their appeals to the
highest court of the province, and in some
cases to the Supreme Court of Canada. The
majority of the questions which arise on the
prosecuting side are of general application,
and it should be possible for the Crown to
obtain the decision of the Court of Appeal in
proper cases for the guidance of the lower
courts, thus ensuring uniformity in the administration of the law.
The Department of Justice has felt like
insisting on obtaining the right for the
Crown of an appeal upon the law because there
have been decisions rendered in different
Provinces which are in absolute contradiction.
I urge the Senate to give to the Crown such
right of appeal to a higher court for a just
interpretation when there is a conflict in the

JUNE 17, 1926
decisions given throughout the land. I remember that laist year we had a case where,
there had been two contradictory decisions,
one ini Alberta and one in Saskatchewan, and
it was sought to obtain the riglit of appeal
te the Court of Appeal lu order to secure a
juat and binding interpretation that would
govern the inferior courts.
For that purpose I «sk that we pa9s thiB
amendment.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: As a member of
the Committee that deait with this matter
last Session, I desire to explain why the
Committee threw out that provision. It i8
an old principle of British law that a man
shal nlot he placed in jeopardy twice, and
the view taken by the Oommittee at that time
was this. The Government is a huge machine:
it can prosecute with vigor, and bring officiais
from ail over the country. A trial takes place
before a judge, and the accused is found not
guilty. The Crown Prosecutor is sometimes
very anxious for a conviction, so he raises a
dispute with the judge, who rules agairiat
him. Then he determines to appeal. That
procedure cosa hlm nothing; the Government la behind hlm; he has this huge machine
at his back, and he can spend ail the money
he needa. But what about the unfortunate
accuaed man? Re has already perhaps been
ruined by the expenses of hia trial; his
witnesses are dispersed, and he may nlot be
able to get them again.
When the appeal goes on, perbaps the
Appeal Court holds that the judge was wrong
on some trivial matter, and a new trial la
ordered. The trial la held before another
judge, who may also rule wrongly, with the
11
consequence that there wi be a second appeal
and another trial. What will become of the
unfortunate defendant? It would have been
better for him te have pleaded guilty and
taken his punishment than to be crushed
under the tremendous expense of the legal
procedure that la set in motion by the Crown
Prosecutor.
I have received a letter from the Crown
Prosecutor in Winnipeg urging me very
strongly to support this measure. He tells
of a case that came up in connection with
the celebrated Bingo mine. A couple of
gentlemen in Winnipeg had eoue into a
stock speculation, whlch proved disastrous, and
they sent over to England and had a man
named Myers arrested. The trial was carrîed
on for three or f our weeks in Winnipeg at
great expense, witnesses being brought from
ail over the country; but the accused was
f ound nlot guilty. They then charged him

285

with another offence in the same transaction,
and had another trial before a Superior Court
judge, laating three weeks, with the result that
he was found not guilty on the second trial.
On that occasion the Crown Prosecutor had
some pretty strong arguments with the judge.
He complained bitterly that the judge had
ruled againat hlm, and he wanted an appeal,
and wrote me this letter saying that the judge
d.4d not treat him fairly; ana that I could see
the position he waïe placed in.
Now, what would be the result ef an sqpeal? The Court of Appeal might or .might
not -agree with the trial judge, but the accused would have to be represented in the
Court of Appeal, and he would have heavy
expeneseV pay. Perhaps the Court of Appetal would rule that the trial judge erred in
adinitting or rejecting evidence, and they
would order another trial1. This woul came
before another judge, with the same prosecutor; and, possibly that jucdge would rule
against hkm in regard to the recejYtion or rejeetion of evidence; so there would be stili
another trial. Now, what position would that
accused man be in? He would have had Vhree
or four tri-als wlch have cost the country a
great deal of money, but did not cost the
Crown Prose<cutor anything, while the accused
man is ruined.
I prefer that the old principle of British
law, whieh we have enjoyed for many years,
shouýld prevail-that if you place a man once
in jeopardy, you shall not place hlm in jeopardy enother time. The Senate Committee
lest Session was composed of most of the
3awyers in tihis House, and they were unanimous in deeidâng that that clause shouild not
; ,
be paoeed.
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH: Honourable gentlemen, I look with very littIe
favour on changes in the criminali law, because
I think the exiperience of centuries has produced a code of criminal lýaw, now in force in
thia country, which is probably as good as we
ca make it. I have the feeling that it was
a mistake ever to have conferred a right of
appeal in criminal cases upon an laccused, or
on anybody. But that change in our 1'aw hs
recent]y been madj,,and-we have now a Court
of Criminal Appeal in euch Province, and any
accused person eonvicted has the right of
appeal, with the right on the part of the Appellate Court to change the sentence, to order
a new trial, or to make such disposition of the
matter as in their juldigment is right.
Well, so long as you have that condition of
the law, is it not in the public interest that
t-hat right of appeal should be conferred upon

286

SENATE

the prosecution as weij «q upon the defending accused person? It would seema ta me ta
be so. This provision of the Bill now under
consideration, it will be observed, is 8trictly
limited toi an appeal upon a matter of iaw.
Now, if such an aqipeal is taken by the Att>orney General, as representing the Crown, the
Court of Appeal has noa power ta pronounce
the accussed guilty, and there is nothing ta
thie detriment of the prisoner except a second
trial; and a second trial for what reason? By
reason of some error in law iii the first trial.
Take an instance that may arise any day
in the week. Suppose upan the evidence and
the facts of the case there is litulle room
for doubt, and suppose the judge erroneously
takes the view that the facts estalished de
flot in law constitute an offence, and tells the
jury so, and directs themn t'hat their duty is to
acquit because, upon the practically admitted
facts of the case, the offence charged has not
been committed. The prisaner is accordingiy
acquitted. If the judge has in truth erred
entirely, ought the accused not to be tried
upon the facts, and upan a correct staternent
af the law ta the jury? That is ail t'hat would
be accomplished if thîs change in aur present
law be made. and the right ta appeal bu given
ta the Attorney Generai.
Or take anotiier case, which is very hiable
to arise as long as judýges are hurnan, and may
make an errar as ta the law.
Suppose in
the course of a trial the pro2ecutian' tenders a
piece of evidence which is ail-important, but
the ju-dge presiding erroneously rules tbat that
evitierce is not admissible, and exeludes it,
ind the prisoner is acquitted.
If there is a
rigbt of al)peal by the prosecutian, the Court
of Appeal will correct that errar by saying:
"This evidence was wrongly rejected; it is perfectlY good evidence, and we will arder a new
trial, sa 'that at the new trial that eviden-ce
may bie admitted."
Wel, it is perfectly true.
in a sense, that that decision bas put the
prisoner a second time in jeopardy; 'but ought
it flot to be so?
Hie n'as on the first occasion
released from fris jeopardy because the judge
made a mistake in his law.
His jeopardy is
renewcd if a second trial is orderedl; but in
fact it is only a continuation of the original
jeopardy in wbich hýe was placed frorn the
moment that bis case -%as put inota the hands
of the first jury.
It would seem to me, witb aIl deference ta
tbe opposite opinion, that a provision of 'thiq
kind is a very proper one if you are going ta
permit an appeal at aIl.
Section 5 was agreed ta:

AYLESWORTH.

On section 6--script4frauds; liability, ta prosecute:Hlon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen,
there are a few words in aubeection 2 of this
section which may make very viciaus law if
adapted. They are these:
Anyoaie who coumnits or has at any tiane heretofore
coînmitted any offence-

It will be noticed. that these words deal flot
anly with the present and future, but refer
back inde6initely.
That is contrary ta ail the
principles of British legisiation.
When the
hanourable gentleman moves the adoption
orf this clause, 1 would move in amendment
that the words be oiuitted:
Or has at any tisne heratofore committed.
That will make the subeectian deal with the
present and the future, but take away the
retroactive effect.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I would not be
sure thýat the end which my honaurale friend
bias in mind would be effected by his amendment.
I understand that the ides, of this
enactrnent is ta wipe out section 20 of chapter
25 of the Statutes of 1921, and the el!ect of
that section, so, tbat, drafted as it is, it wili
be as if it had neyer been in existence.
It
will re-establish ail the parties in the state
in wbicb tb'ey were the day before this chapter
25, section 20, of 1921, was passed.
Tbere is
no question about it: it is retroactive so far as
it declares tbat ail offences committed priar
ta 1921 can corne under tbe Iaw.
ILt says:
Any one who commsitis or lias at anýy tâne heretofore
committed any offence relaîting to or arising out od the
Iocatirn of land which was paid for in whole or in
part liv script or was graýnted mepon, certificates issued
fo hait 'breeds in connection with the ejctinguishwnent
of Indian titie, shall, with respect tihereto, be L~al>le
to prosecut ion or to an action for penalties or forfeiture in the sane inonner aînd to the surie extent as
if said suIfyparagraph (iv) had neyer been enacted.

1 arn infoýrmed that tbe case which is sup-à
posed ta bave called for tbis amendiment ie
tbe on-ly case tbait wi]l not *be reacbed, even
%vben tbis Act is passed.
At the timne the
Act wuts passed, a cbarge bad been laid against
a party wbase nrame 1 do not exactly remember
-and it is perhaps as well not ta name him.
I aim speaking noýw witb tbe autbority of the
Deputy Minister of Justice, whom I consulted.
Tbe prosecutor erroneously tbourgbt tbat bu
tuas absolved by the statute of 1921, and there
wma a nolle prosequi, s0 that he cannot now
be tried again for tbe sarne offence.
Yet,
apparently, parties in the West believe that
tbe situation, should be re-establisbed courpletely as ir was before this Act came into
force.
I mention tbis fact because there may
be an impression that tbe party who, gat tbe

JUNE 17, 192629
èffective -prdteeti*n uft this Act--te whieh
he was net ent1led--*ilI have the adrahtsge
of having been iaecl*red from the offetce, if he
éver comtnitted the c«ende, becaise the action
was wi'thdrwffi by the Attorney Qeneral.
*Hon. W. B. ROSS: It is a ver>' bad state
of things that, a man is charged with an
offence and there'is a nlole prosequi entèred,
that the crown is unwilling to proeeed, and
that the prosecutor, working in the n"me of the
Crown, took this step because he had made a
mistake about the law. I think that ought
to end the n1atter. 1 think it is grossly unfair to say years after that you will revive
this in order to get over the error of judgment made hi' the prosecutor.
Hon. Mr. DÀNDURAND: No, it would
not cure that mistake in the withdrawal of the
case.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: No, but it will throw that
man open to an action. If it does flot do
that, there is no need of the section. Only
a glance at the section is needed to see that
if you miake it wide open, and extend back
to any length of time an action for the sale
of script, such action ma>' be brought against
a man when ever>' witness that he could have
called to prove bis innocence, or to prove the
facts connected with the prosecution, May
be dead and gone, or his books nia> be lost.
I think that we need not go further than
the general principle -that retroactive legislation of any kînd is obnoxious, and you have
to make out an extremely strong case to
get this House, or, I think, an>' British Parliament, to pass it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This amendment was not in'troduced by the Minister of
Justice, but was moved in the House of Commeons. It may be that in ni>'short explanation I have not done justice to the cl ause,
and I would prefer to have the Conimittee
retain the Bill, so that I ma>' submit a
further statement later. This part of the
Bill is not a Government measure. It wau
added in the Commons, and I would like to
suhmit the explanations which I presume
were given in the other House.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: I hope it is net political.
Section 6 stands.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Honourable gentlemen, ma>' I asIc your indulgence for a few
moments in order to submit, on behalf of the
honourable gentleman fromn Hamilton (Hon.
Mr. Lynch-Staunton), some amendments to
this Bill, which I think are not of a conten-

tious nature. One is an amendnient to ad
at the end of the Bill the following clause:
Section two, paragraph (7) mub.pipash (1) of
the taid Act, as eaaeted by asotàau one of ch*t>ter
torty-thàre of the Statutes of 1920, is hereby reveuied.
and the ScRowing sub-paragraph mibstituted therefor.
"(a) Any three judges ci the High Court Dlivision
of the Supreme Court of Ontario deftnated by rules
of court."

This was haaded to me by the honourable
memaber for flamilton, Who, after some consultation with the judges in Ontario, wanted
to have this inserted in the inteÈprýtation
clause to show more clearl>' what constitutes
a Court of Appeal in Ontario.
Hon, W. B. ROffS:
criminal cases?

A Court of Appeal in

Hon. (Mr. McMEANkB: Yes.
The other proposed amendment is an
amendnient te subsection 1 of section 1014
of the Criminal Code:
Parapsipbj (b) end (c) of section 1014 (1) are hereby repébIed sud the tollowine aubstitated theréfor:(b) That the judgment elt he trial judge ahodtd be
set aside on the grouad thiat it is contrary to the Iaw
ot evklemne.

The reason for that amendment is this.
The criminaL appeal law was copied froin the
English Act, and in the Old Country the
trials are principaîlly b>' jury. As the present
clause is drawn, the judges feel that there
must be "a miscarriage of justice" before
the>' can hear the appeal and set aside the
judgment.
The judges want the clause
worded as in this amendment, in order that
they may set aside a judgmnent without being
obliged to impl>' that there has been "a
miscarriage of justice." This is merel>' a
formai amendment. There is nothîng in it
of a contentions nature.
llon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The honourable gentleman is subniitting those amendments. We will not dispose of them now.
I will obtain the opinion of the Deapartment
of Justice with regard to them, and we can
take them up when we again go into Conimittee. The amendments will appear in
Hansard, and honout able gentlemen will be
able to read the text of them and the remarks of niy honourable frîend.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: From a conversatiohi I had with the honourable gentleman froni Hamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton), I think the>' refer to the constitution of
the Court of Criminal Appeals in Ontario.

to understand that we cannot receive them

explanations upon the third reading of the
Bill; but if it is desired 1 mnay give them
now. I think it is but faïr, wben we change
a publie Bill of this importance coming from
the Commons, that we âbould state on what
grounds we bave acted.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: Before the honourable gentleman proceeds-is it not a rule of
the buse that the report of a Special Committee on Public Bills shaîl go to, the Committce of the Wbole Blouse?
No, not here.
Hon. Mr. CAiSGRAIN:

On examining the

by the Board, prices which were too bigh
had been paid. We had it fromn the Chairman of the Board that in bis opinion there
were some cases in which the settier wa-s
entitled to relief. In dealing wiitb the Board
we received the assurance that, being composed of returned soldiers, it is sympathetie
with the settlers, and that they shaAl have
justice.
We were also iiormed that fromn
the beginning the Board kept in contact
through its officiais witb every settier, and
had reports as to, bis conduct and the manner
of bis cultivating the land, and ail available
information on thbe value of the land.
Tbe Board werc confronted witb this situation. The Bill as passed by the Commons
(leait with a great number of cases, possibly
amounting to some 11.5W0 or 11,800. Under
the Bill as passed by the House of Commons
a special tribunal would have to deal witb
every case if everx' soldier exercised bis power
of dcmanding bis own arbitrator. Il was
tbought that this would involve a very large
expenditure which migbt run into millions
of doll-ars, and thar. this feature sbould be

On receiving the settler's application, whicb

that bis dlaim is well founded. After this proceeding. the Board will pass upon the dlaim.
Then, if the settier desires to appeal to the
Exebeqiier Court of Canada, provision is made
f0 facilitate that appeal and to avoid the
necessity of bis leaving bis domicile and'

The honourable leader of the Government
in this House gave important information in
moving the second reading of the Bi' ; but,
although most of the information to which
1 purpose calling attention has already been

to make.

SENATE
Board itself has power to reduce the price of
the land to the incoming immigrant. That
was the Bill as it came to us. 1 think I
perbaps ought to say in the first place that,
after a lapse of some seven or eight yéars,
thoughtful men amongst the ex-soldiers begin
to realize that this country has only a certain
amount of money to spend upon ex-service
mon in pensions and hospitalization and aids
of that description, and they are more than
ever persuaded that in any scheme for the
amelioration of their condition the trouble
in the past hais heen that under the provisions made f00 much money bas been spent
upon administration, too large a proportion
of thec money involved bas gone to a large
body of officiaIs, and flot a proper proportion
to the ex-service men themselves. This Bill
as it came to us is an example of tlîat weakness on the part of legisiation in the past.
One would have thought-as a matter of
fact, if did occur to some persons in the
other House-that the Board itself might very
properly make an adjustmcnt. There were
various objections offered to that, but none
of them have any weight with me for a
reason whicb 1 shahl give before I finish
The legisiation as it reached us seems to me
to smack rather of sucli legisiation as miglit
be passed under certain other conditions to
prevent two persoos at variance coming together, and compchling tliem f0 resorf to law,
when logically the soldier and the Board
miglif well corne together and settie their
difficulties without resort to gay tribunal at
all.
The letters read by the honourabie gentleman from Montreal (Hon. Mr. Béique) go
to suggest thaf nof all the soldiers who ma 'y
appeal will appeal, and f0 my mind at least
if will ho possible for the Board itself in
maoy cases fo ad.Iust ifs differences with the
ex-service men without the intervention of
any tribunal.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: In must cases.
The Chairman
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
of the Soldier Seftlement Board advanced
the opinion thaf about sixty per cent of the'
cfiseý- miglit bie settled hy conversations andI

those who will 00f appeal at aIl; thoen you
bave those who will ask for a readjusfment;
thon you have sixty per cent of those disposed of hy inutual agreement, and then a
small proportion ef t who may appeal.
In the discussion on the Bill as if came
from the other Hoiîse, if hocame apparent to
mie thaf the cost of these tribunals was gobeto ho very higli indoed, and I had reason
f0 doulif the wisdomi of a tribunal consisting

Mr.

GRIESBACH.

of three porsons, one of whom is already corninitted f0 one side, and another of whom is
already committed to ftle other side, thxis
leaving fbe third person to decide. Yef this
was the tribunal which was eonstituted to
carry on this work, and at very considerable
exponse to flie country. I say, for the reasons
given, that 1 was of thle opinion that in carrying out the general principle of reducing the
cost of administration and applying it f0 the
ainelioration of the soldiers, we ought f0
examine the possibility of the soldier himsolf
and the board coming f0 a safisfactory conclusion. Having given that some thought, I
00w say that I support fthe amendments of
the Committee, the principal of which is
merely tbis: that we have made it possible
for the Soldier .Settlenienf Board and the
seftler f0 come togother and agree; and, in
case thev do nof agree, provision is made for
an appeal to the Exchequer Court.
In respect of thaf appeal, a number of questions have been and no douhf will be asked
as f0 the procedure which will bie followed.
The aniendments provide that the procedure
f0 ho followed will be laid down by the Governor General by Order in Council, and I
fancy that in preparing the regulations the
proper authorifies wilI ho guided. f0 some
oxtent hy the discussion which takes plae
here to-day, and for their guidance any honourahîn gentleman wbo foresees a difficulty
will do well f0 elahorafe upon if.
An honourable gentleman, who no douhi
will speak later bas stressed the importance
of a complote case heiog filed wifb the Soldier Set tiemeof Board, a copv of thaf statement beinr given f0 tlie soîdier seffler himself, and the whole bein - submitted to tlic

a maffor for fhîought in the preparation of
the regul'ifion.t, and I would lie satisfied f0
beave f0 flic proper authorify the preparation
of those rogulafioos, asuming ýthat they ho
jusf and fair and equitable.
The question raised hy the late Mînîster
of Solihiers' Civil Re-establish ment (Hoo. Mr.
Bélao(lf az f0 hîow ap)peals will ho conducted,
that is fo say, w bat will ho infroduced in the
shape of new evidenco, is aiso a very inferesting one. I amn quite aware of flie lawyer's
intorpretation of wvhaf is meant hy an appeal. It nîcans 'an appeal upon the evidence
and the facts suhmifted af the original trial.
There is also an extension of thaf rule so thaf
even after an appeal e\-idence whicha was not

reasuns.
With respecf f0 the point raised hy the

hardship. But in actual fact there is no hardship, for the reason that it 4s always competent for the appellant, up to the very lait
minute, to file with the Board of Pension
Commiseinners such evidence as hie may have.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: Up to the time of the
appeal.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Up to the time
if the appeal. And I have it from members
af the Appeal Board that, if it can be shown
to them that there is evidence available which
for soine reason or other could nlot be produoed before, tbey will re-open the case, even
if it is appealed. It is a matter for the ruljng of the Board tbernselves. They shaîl be
to some extent guided by the Department of
Justice. Just upon that point, I amrn ft so
sure that they are willing to be wholly guided

themselves say that, even when they have
given a decision, if it can nevertheless be
shown that there was evidence whieh bears
inportantly upon the decision, and which
could not for soine good and sufficient reason
be produced, the case will be reconsidered if
there is some proper explanation. The Board
of Appeal dlaim the right to establish that
doctrine.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: My honourable friend
xnay be right, but my impression is that it is
only in case the new evidence bears on aý
dîfferent disability from that which bas been
decided upon.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I stili insist upon
mny point, and would add that in carrying out
these appeais, by shifting the disability, a rehearing can be had. But, generally speaking,
the Board of Appeal, notwithstanding the
limitation to the evidence upo-n the record,
is giving fairly general satisfaction-as good
satisfaction as it can give.
Now, there is in these amendments a radical
departure fromÉthe Bill as introduced. 1 arn
agreeing to the amendments. I arn taking the
amendmente in good faith for a special and
particular reason. If that reason did not exist,
then I might be much sharper and more careful
in my critiicism of the amendments, even
though I have taken part in drafting thein.

of land for these British immigrants. The
Soldier Settiement Board le charged, first, with
the responsibility of administering the Soldier
Settleenent Act and of .keeping the soldier
settler upon the land. When bie leaves the
land, for any reason at aIl, then the Soldier
Settiement Board, acting in another capacity,
has to seli that land, under that restriction
as to a fair price, to a British immigrant.
The situation is more or leas psychological
from the soldier's point of view, and that ià
why I strongly advocaite that the Soldier
Settiement Board should bie empowered to
deal with the eoldier. I urge it for this reason.
When the Board ie dealing with the soldier,
hie may complain that his land has depreciated
in value-that hie paid more for it than it is
now worth. In that case the Board must have
in the back of its head the idea that any
ruling it rnay give on this application is subjeet to a mo*t drastie formai review, for if ite
decisioii resulth- in Mas leaiving the land the
Board must seli that same land practically
in the open market, under conditions of
careful scrutiny. If the sokiier settier s9hould
corne before the Board and say, "I paid
34,500 for this land, and I contend that itk
is worth oniy 33,5W0 now," the Board may,
say to him: "We refuse to recognize yourcontention: we maintain that the land is;
stili worth 84,500." The soldier .says5: "I cannet pay it, and I will not stay," and hé
goes off, and terminates bis contractual relations. Then the Soidier Settiement Board,
in order to justjify its position-and, remember, it ie encompassed by a great cloud of
wiitnesses in ail these scttlements-must now
.selI to the incoming British immigrant, under
the scrutiny of the Colonisation Department,
that particular land for tbat particular price.
If it selle the land for any lesser price it
justifies the contention of the soldier. I submit that that stage of aiffairs constitutes a
safeguard for the soldier such as hie could have
under no other circunistances. He need not
bother about whaît the Exehequer Court or
anybody else may eay. The Soldier Settle-

S ENA TE
ment Board must deal with him in the knowledge that if the Board fails to deal on a
satisfactory basis it must dispose of the land
practically in the open market to peraons who
are protected by ail the organizations of the
Colonization Department.
If that state of affairs did not exist, I arn
niot so sure that this Bill would be satisfactorv 1.o me; 'but, in view of the existence
co that condition, I arn reasonably satisfied
in my own mind with this Bill as amendbcd,
plus the regulations thýat may he adopted
by Order in Council, following this disonséion and such representations as have been
rmade, plus the outstanding fact that behind
the whole business stands this scheime of the
Immigration and Colonization
agreement
with Gýreat Britain as to the settiement of
British imomigrants.
1 'believe that the
soldier w'ill have substantial justice because
of these facts alone, and for this reason I
support the amendment.
Hon. J. J. DONNELLY: Honourable gentlemen, I would like to, inquire of the honourable member of the Committee whether
any consideration has been given to this
other phase of the situation. The construction I put upon the Bill is that this is a
nieasure to revalue the land only.
As I
understood from the figures given by the
honourable member from De Salaherry (Hon.
Mr. B6ique), there was a total expenditure
of more than $70,000.000, of which amount
$54,000,00O was excpended in the purchase of
land. In other words, about 25 per cent of
the total expenditure w-as for stock and implements.
At the time the Act went into
foirce a much ýhigher value wvas pl'aced on
stock and implements than is placed on them
at, the present time.
Soie oif the soldier
set tiers may take the vicw that their difficulty in fulfilling the obligations which they
inciirred is due to the depreciation of the
value of stock and implements.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBA'CH:
deait with -alreadv.

That has been

Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: Has it?
Some
provision has been muade for it? I see.
Hon. A. B. GILLIS: Horroura;ble gentlemen. so far as we have considered the a.mendments made te the Bill, I arn quite in accord
with them; 'but we have had very littie
information with regard to these very important amendmepnts.
The Bill has been
s0 altered as to be scarcely recognizable as
the Bill which came from the other flouse
somne days ago. Ail the inforimation we have
had is that which is contained in the 'report
presenited yesterdav and printed in the
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

Minutes of Proceedings.

Those who were

not members of the Committee have comnparatively little grasp of tihe important
changes that have been made.
For that
reason I think that, before concurring in
the report and giving the ýBibil the third
reading, the Bill should be re;printed. as
amended.
I feel satisfled that more than
two-r.hirds of the honourable -me.mbers of
this Chamber have very little conception of
the important changes that have 'been made
in this measure. Personally I have had the
advantage of having the changes explained
to me in priv-ate; 'but, as the amenýdments
are of far-reaching importance, I think that
every honourable mnember of the flouse
shoul'd be in a position to grasp them fully
before we are called uipon to pass the Bill.
There is no rule against referring this
inatter to 'Comiittee of the Whole flouse.
I know it is not the custom of thýis Chamber
to have reports of Commnittees submitted in
that way, but, I repeat, the changes are so
important that we ought to be given a little
more time to study the'm.

Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: If it would be

of assistance to any honourable gentlemen, I
ivould be glad to miove that the next reading
t'tke place on Mondav.
That would give
honourable members the week-end to read
and study the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDUTRAND:
If the report
is adopted we cao direct the Clerk to have
the Bill reprinted hefore the third reading.
The lion. the SPEAKER:
May I point
out that this is a Couimons Bill, We might
have it reprinted for the information of the
Senate. but the Bill as received from the
Hlouse of Commons will have to be sent back
to, that flouse with a mne-ssage pointing out
the Senate amendments.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL:
That wouid
probably hieip those who want information.

Hon. Mr. BELCOT'RT:

1 should like to

make two observa tions--and I shahl be very
brief. One relates to the argument put forward by iuy honourabie friend opposite (Hon.
Mr. Griesbach) in rcgar~d to appeals. As hie
anticipateil, lawyer-like. I cannot agree aitogether with that proposiîtion. There are
severai reasons why there should be a finality to the proceedings rather than the reopening of them froîin time to time.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
1 was repIying
to the honourable gentlemian from Lauzon, the
former Minister of Soldiers' Civil Re-estab-

lishment (lon. Mr. Béland).

I was discuss-

ing with him certain aspects of the appeai in
pension cases. 1 did not discuss at iength

JUNE 18, 1926
the appeals involved in this Bill. I expressed the hope that the method of appeal
would be satisfactorily arranged by Order-mnCouncil, subject to what was said here, and
that it would be workable, and would be Just
and fair as well, regard being had to the
peculiar nature of the case.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do flot see how
we can expect to apply to this Bill the principle which my honourable friend, evidently
with some hesitation, suggests, namely that
there should be a right to put in evidence
before the Board of Appeal.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: But as it is done
We apply to the Board of
Pension Commissioners for a pension, and if
our application is refused we can take an appeal to the Appeal Board. It did not take
us long to discover that in the application of
the Appeal Board law as we had passed it,
and the regulations which had been issued, if
between the time of the decision of the Board
of Pension Commissioners and the hearing of
the appeal new evidence should arise, the
situation ought to be met by submitting that
new evidence, the Board of Pension Commissioners making it part of the file which.
would go up to the Board of Appeal. The
Board of Pension Commissioners have been
known to arrest an appeal already in the
hands of the Appeal Board, and to say: "In
view of this new evidence we now grant a
pension-we now agree that the applicant
has pr.oved that he is entitled to it." That is
a matter which has grown up,, to the satisfaction of everyone, I think. But the lawyers
may not like it.
ini pension cases.

Hlon. Mr. BELCOURT: That may be
so. My honourable friend has not stated
whether or not there is in the regulations
some provision whereby the Pension Appeal
Board could refer the matter back to the
Board from which the appeal came. I arn
not aware whether they may refer it back or
not. Perhaps my honourable friend knows.
There may be some provision by which. it
could he referred back for the hearîng of
further evidence.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: Under the Act the
Federal Appeal Board cannot entertain any
new evidence.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:

That is clear.

Hon. .Mr. BELAND: The man who has
seen his etaim refused by the Board of first,
instance is free to reopen it before the eame
Board if he Uae new evidienoe; but if he decide to go before the Federall Appeaàl Boa.rd
no new evidence can be submitted and none

295

can .be entertained, and the decision rendered
by the Fedýeral Ap4peail Board is final unls
a new -disabiIlity is brouglit up.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Even if reason
did exist in the case of the Pension Board;
there woukd be less reason in this instance for
alilowing evidence to be taken after an appeal
bas heen lodged.
Hon Mr. GRIESBACH: It wouird seem ao,
at the moment.
Hon. MT. BELCOURT: The quieètion is a
very simple one: it is to determine the value
of land. You would flot refer it back or enteiltain an-y further evidenoe on that subjet.
There wouild be no occasion for doing so, because it is a question which could be determined finaïly. In the courts a new trial is
granted meredy because of some fart arieing
which justifies the Appeal Court in referring
back the case, but that reason would not
apply -here, becauise here it is merely a question of opinion and not a question of fact
The question is whether the valuation put oni
the land by the Board was a pcroper one or
not. So I do flot thinik we 4hould entertain
the' idea of allowing the Appeal Court ta
hear new evidence.
There is one point of the BijLd w'hich I think
was perbaps not sufficiently considered in the
Com-mittee. Honourable gentlemen will see on
reading the Bill1 that it provides for an appeal
t.o the Exchequer Court. I have a doubtI dare say bonourable gentlemen wil a"~
have a doubt-as to what exactIy wikl be the
power of the Appeal Court. We have ndt
said in ithe Bull1 as reporeid that the Court may
increase or diecrease the compensation. Are
we to assume ithat the Appeal Court, that is,
the Judge of the Exchequer Court, may only
increase the amount?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I shouffd say so.
Hon. Mr. BELCQURT: But we, -have not
so stated.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: Is it not, ixupliied?
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: No.
Hon. MT. BELAND: The application is for
a decrease in the valuation of the land'.
I
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: It may be.
arn not so sure about that. I doubt whether
the Appeal Court could not, under the wording of the Act, decrease the amount.
Hon. Mr. DANDIJRAND:

That is, reduce

Hon. Mr. BEL4JOURT: Yes, reduce the
amount of the compensation.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Surely the Bill
is olear on that point.
According to the
general rude, the appesi is for an increase of
thse benefit to the soldier.
There lis no0 crossappeai asking for a reduction of the benefit.
So tihe appeal would simply bear on, the question of more liberal treatment.
Hon. Mr. GR'IESBAOH: Yes.
The position of the soidier is that he bas bought
land which is now lower in price than before,
but hie bas a ýcontract, -and thse Soldier Settiement Board refuses to adjust that contract,
or refuses to adjust it sufficiently.
The
soidier seffler appeais against that decision.
Surely the anewer of thse Board couid only be
that hie is nýot entitled fe, any reduction, or
that bie is entitied to a reduction.
Surely the
Board couid not increase the amount involved
in bis contract.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
And tbe Board

Right Hon. Sir GEO0RGE E. FOSTER: As
to the question of new evidence, wbich bas
been raised by my honouralale friend, is it
realily of mucb practical importance?
Here,
to my mind, is the -procedure.
In tbe first
place, thse Board, through its officers, receives
thse application. Tb, Board has in fourteen or
fiffeen different parts of tihe Dominion its
officers, who are au fait with tbe bistory of
thse case as betiveen the solier settier and tshe
Board. The seidier and these efficers of thse
Board get together and examine the whole
matter, witb the records.
Thse soidier states
bis case, and if if is flot settled the stage
is reached where he makes bis application.
That application cornes f0 tbe general Board,
and witlh if cornes tbe statement of thse case
on bofh

Tbe

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR:
Ilonourable gentlemen, the pacifie nature of this discussion seems
te warrant the ho-pe thaf we wii.l nef ho
accused of some neW borror in our proceedings
to-day in mutilating a Government Bill.
Tbere seems te be perfect unýanimity on both

that in a matter of tbis importance thse Government frankly admits tfiat thse measure

JUNE 18, 1926
I was glad to hear the meies of letters read
by the hanourable gentleman .from De SalaThiey indicated
berry (Bon.. Mr. Béiqu e).
ta me a frame of mind on the part of the
soldier settlers 4tbat might very well be
adopted, if not enlarged upon, 'by the Administration, particularly by the Soldier Settlement Board when they came to deal with this
problem. I take it for granted that the letters
read bore were sam-ple letters of the 1,600 received, and were not mereiy picked out because they seemed ta indicate a certain frame
of mmnd. I accept themn as they were offered

on the ýpart of the soldier settlers ta play the
game; ta look on the bright side of tibeir
position, and ta ca-operate with the Soldier
Settiement Board in a liberal sonse, and ta do
tbe best they can under the circumstances in
which they find themnselves.
If I have any criticism ta offer of the Bill
now beo re us, wbidh I do think is an improvement on that wbich was referred ta tihe Cammitteo, it is that it has a tendency ta go in
a direction contrary to that in which the
soldiers are proeeeding; that the tendency of
tbe Bill is ta, lirait tbe autbority of the
Soldier Settlement Board and of the Exebequer Court, and ta narraw down ta the
lowest possible limits the dotails o! the relief
which Iboth the Government and Parliament
semr ta bave deided shauld be given. I like
the suggestion of the honaurable gentleman
from Lauzan (flan. Mr. Béland), lately Minister of the Department, that pains sbould be
ta)ken ta make as complete a presentation as
possible af the case af the soldiers, go that they
may nat lase anytbing for want of information
conveyed ta the Exebequer Court.

find that there are twa main subjects for
determinatian by the Soldier .Sottlement
Board. One is the depreciatian in tbe value
of the land between one period and anather,
and the ather is thue estimate to be placed

v

qiîite possi'ble that the Goverument may
provide for that when they make the regulations. If there can be an.y benefit from
any suggestions that I make, it would. arise
from the influence they migbt have upon the
Governinent in widen'ing the regulations to
provide for sncb a state of affairs as the
rig#at honourable gentiemuna bas indicated.
But as I read the Act now, it is very mucli
narrower; and, unless the Governor in Council
were influenced by the discussion during the
passage of thisQ Bill, I arn afraid that the
regulations would not be any broader than the
Act itself.
The .pitfall which I have in mind is this:
that the application is made by the saldier
in wvriting to the local Superintendent of the
Soldier Settiement Board. The soldier sets
out bis claim, and the reasons for it, the
amount of money paid for the land, andwbat he th-inks is its value now. He sends
that to the District Silperintendent, who forwards it ta the Board. As there is a limitabian in the reference in the Bill, as amended,
which says that depreciation shaîl he allawed
onfly upon diminution in value not incurred
by the neglect or mismanage*ment of the
soldier, naturally, although it is not so providpd in the Bill, the Soldier Settiement
Board looks ta, the District Superintendent.
That is the only way the information can
ho got. The saldier hiipself writes ta say
that bis dlaim is not due ta bis own neglect,
and for an opinion upon that the Board
Ico<s to the District Superintendent, who is
in. close tauch with the situation. I have
urged bef are. and I urge now, that any commounication made by the District Superintendent ta the detriment of the soldier's
application as a settbor should be conrnunicated by the Settlemnent Board ta the
saldier himsoif, and that the District Superintendent sbauld ho required ta say upon what
he bases his repart that the sottler is unfit
or negligent. The settler, having got that,
shauld be .plucod in a position ta meet it
with any evidenee that may be necessary-his own statement is aliready -in-with the
ovidence af bis neighibaurs, or with explanations of any allogod outstanding evidence of
neglect or .ýismanagem.ent. fie should ha
put in a position ta deliver bis defence hofore the Exchequer Court against any aspereion-, upon his charagter as a settler.
The question then arises, how is that practicable? In answer, I would refer ta the
Act itself. As I see it, the strongest justificatioin this flouse could have for substituting
the plan outlined 'in this aýmendment for
the contrasting phatn of the Blouse of Com-

SENATE
mons. is that in doing this we are virtually
foilowing the direction 'laid dlown in the
Soldier Settiement Act. That Act provides
that the Governor in Council shall have
power to 'add to the Exchequer Court one
or more judges to investigate and deal with
any questions which 'may arise under the
Act. As I read that Act, the idea is that
matters of this kin.d, to be reasonably and
intelligently decided, have got to 'be deoided
on the spot, and that the regular judges of
the Exýchequer Court heing biisy with their
ordina'ry duties at Ottawa, have flot the time
te make the long joureys that would be required for m-atters of this kind. -Se there is
the provision that the Government may have
power to add temporary judges to the Exchoquer Court for just such purposes as are
indicated in this Bill, and 1 suggest te the
honourable gentleman wlio represents the
Govcrnment in this Chamber the wisdom of
considering whether or flot, for the expeditieus hearing of these cases, we sbould net
have .iudges appointed, as contemplatcd by
the Act, who could actually go on to the
soidier's land, see the man himself and the
progress he has made, investigate any reports
as te negleet, ami so on, and arrive at the
intelligent conclusion that can only be arrived at in cuses of this kind by a personal
\'jnjt.
It is because the Bill as it ca'me
te us from the lieuse of Commons contompla:t.ci -Pcrsonatl dealings on the lands themsoive-. in ail cases by qualified local .iudges
that I considered it an improvcuMnt on the
Bill as first introduced in the Commons. The
difficulty, of course, was the absurdly elaborate arrangement provided for which gave to
ecd soidier the authority to name his own
representative on the Board of Arbitration.
Thaqt was a fatal defect in the plan presented
te us. We have here, however, in the reference te the Exchequer Court, read in connection wîthi the Act itself as te the appointment of extra judges for purposes such as
thus, a rea8onahie way eut of tic dîfficulty
without any great expense.
If you refer
soiely te the two judýges of the Exehequer
Court sitting at Ottawa, it scems te me that
you will leave tiousands of seres open
throughoiit the country; tiat the situation
w'ili be aggravated rather than improved in
se far as public protest is cencerned. The
men who are doing reasonýably well now are
net the enes that yen hear from. We are
liearing from the ones who are having difficultv. ail ever the country. When yen tell
one of those men, who is already in a nervous
and irritable frame of mind because of bis
difficulties, that the Board lias decided against

enter upon a course of correspondence, in
competition against the Settiement Board,
with the Exchequer Court of Canada, I arn
afraid you will net make much progress
toward paoifying him. If, on the other hand,
that, man could see a strange face in the
person of a judge who would hear his case
and talk te hima reasonably, as judges do talk
te unfortunates brouglit before them, the
adventure in pacification might achieve the
very complete success that it otherwise will
net attain.
There is another feature. I spoke about
the narrewýness of the Bill in some respects.
I might refer now te one matter net covercd
by these amendments, and save discussing
it on the third reading. That is the provision that where depreciation is found
hetweee the value of the land at the time
of purchase and the value of thc land to-day,
the ýallowance made fer the depreciation shahl
be limitcd by the amount of money the
Settlement Board were authorized te advance
te the settler. That amendment was put in
the Bihl in the lieuse of Commens, and was
net contaieed in it as eriginally presented.
Therefore. it is net part of thc Goverement
scheme. I ani quite satisfled that that provision was put in without any proper refictien-mn fact, it seems te me, without any
reflection at aIl.
The only explanation, the
only defence, that I have heard of that is
really a condemnatien. The defence te which
I refer is that it is almost impossible te
ascertain definitely wliat suma the soldier paid
for any land he occupies in addition te the
suma autliorizcd by the Government; that
soldiers have pretended in varieus ways te
have given valuable censideration wliere they
may merehy have traded je certain lots in
exehange for the farmn property which thcy, je
conjunictien witi the Board, have assumed.
Wien. you tiink for a moment of this, the
only objection made te my suggestion, it
answers it-self; because, if a soldier, overstates tie amoiunt of money lie lias paid for
land, in addition te, the Government grant
for that purpose, in proportion as lie overstates the amount, hy just that proportion lie
decreases any claim he may have, under the
application of depreciatien, te the moncys
advanced by the Government. I hope honourable gentlemen will sec that.
Take an illustration. A soldier settier is
permitted by thc Board te purchase for $7,000
a piece of land whieh lie intcnds te occupy.
Such cases actually occur, partiicularly în
British Colum:bia, where tliey commonly pay
$200, $254) or $300 an acre, and whcrc the
hittie aliowaece of the Board would be very

JUNE 18,.1926
quickly exhausted without giving the soldier
any substantial holding. *Many cases have
occurred in British Columbia wliere soldiers
have bouglit land at a price in exce.ss of the
amount that eould have been secured by loan
from the Board. In the case of a soldier wlio
buyts a piece of land for $7,000, paying 52,000
of bis own and obtaining a loan of 55,000, the
Soldier Settiement Board or the judge may
say: "We are convinced froma inquiry in the
neighourliood that that land lias depreciatd
in common with other land there, by 25 per
cent of its real value in the 7 years that have
intervened." Then there cornes the application
of this resticting provision in the Bill, which
says that, although. thut inquiry lias shown
a diminution of 51,750 in the value of that
soldier's holding, you must take the original
value at $5,000, being tlie lirnit of what the
Board wus permitted to lend, and as you find
tliat lis entire holding is stili worth more tlian
this 55,000, it follows that although there is
a depreciation of $1,750 that ooldier is allowed
nothing at alI. It is not sufficient to answer
that that man is a prosperous man. We are
not administering charity.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: What wouid prevent
the Board from applying the 25 per cent on
the $5,000 as a reduction, lesving out the
balance lie lias paid of lis own money?
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Nothing but the
amendment to which I refer.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But the valuation would go heyond the 55,000 lirnit.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURLAND: The lionourable
gentleman st-ates it would be $1,750 of a rcduction, but it would mean that the land woud
ie- valued at $5,250.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: 1 am glad that the
former Minister (Hon. Mr. Béland) asked
that question. It shows that bis heart is in
tlie riglit place. The difficullty is in this
unfortunate proviso, which I feel quite satisfied wus not understood or thouglit of by
those who put it in:
Prov7ded that in any eaue where the actual -aie
Price is greater than the maximum amount which under section sixteen of this Act may be ad-vanced by
the Board in the purchase of land on behalM of any
settler, such maximumn amnount saai -be deoemed the
saie price for the purpoeseto this Section;

Hon. M.r. DANDURAND: I may tell my
honourable fricnd tihat it wais with eyes open
and a clear conception of t.he situation that
the Bill was thus frarned, because the law
fixed a limit of $5,000 that could le advanced.
In the actual case my honourable friend gives

299

lie would have to state that $5,250 was the
remaining value of the land, while tihe law
made $5,000 the maximum limit. That ils 'why
that limitation is there, and why the -provision is go written.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: But I invite the
honourable gentleman's attention to the
difficulty of carrying out this proviso, even
if you desire to show a spirit s0 different from
that shown by the letters of the soldiers that
were read here to-day.
But that is
Hon. *Mr. DANDURAND:
the law, whioh bas fixed a maximum of $5,000
that can be advanoed to the settier on his
lan~d, and my honourable friend would now
have the land valued at more than 55,000 liecause the soldier paid more than 57,000 for
the land himself, but that was of 'lis own
free will.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: But there is nothing
in the la-w to prevent this Parliainent changing this Bill 80 as to al.low the depreciation
on the amount the Board was authorized to
advanoe, w.hich was the suggestion made by
the honourable gentleman from Lauzon (Hon.
Mr. Béland). I was going to speak of the
difficulty of appiyi ng this wlien you corne
to value this $7,000 tract; the question wi'll
immediately arise, which part of that was
bou4eht with the $5,000 advanced by the
Board? You cannot differentiate between one
property of 20 or 30 acres. and say that sucli
and suci an acreage was bought with thle
$5,000, and sucli and such other acreage waa
bought with the settier's own 52,000. There
is no justice ini saying to the man w.ho lias put
52,000 of his own money into the venture. so
as to make it a little larger than rwas contemplated by the Government, that he mnust
stand the wliole depreciation. whereas the
setti-er adjoining, who bouglit only $5,000
worth, is allowed $1,2W0. You .may find two
settlers. one 'who bought a few additionùi
acres and paid $7,000, and his neiglibaur who
bouglit a smaller acreage and paid only the
$5,000 advanced by the Government; yet you
allow one $1.250 and yoit allow the other
nothing.
But where
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
would my honourable friend draw the line if
that settier had paid 510,000 for that land?
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: All 1 would ask is
that you allow himn the diminution on the
amount that you authorized him to buy,
I
that is, on $5,000.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If there be any
depreciation fromn that figure.

âUU

SENATE

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Yes. if there be any
depreciation.
1 would treat the two preeisely the sanie. If the man on the right
owned a $5,000 property and is entitlcd ta
$1,250, the man on the lef't who had the
$7,00Y propetry in which we have $5,000
interest should be equally entitled ta the
diminution of $1,250.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
1 wauld draw
the attention of my honourable friend ta the
fact that the ýSenate can decrease the
amounit of a money Bill, but cannot increase
the charge, and this one cornes ta us from the
House of Commons with this proviso.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: I would flot ]ike ta
set up my humble opinion against that of a
distinguished autbority on constitutional law
like the honourable gentleman, but I would
asî bin if the fact. that the message from the
Governor General presenting this legislation
to the House did flot contain this provision
does not warrant us in dealing with it. 'This
limitation was not in the message from the
Governor GenEýral by which this Bill was introduced, neither xvas it in the Bill as intraduced.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAN.\D: 0f course, I could

1mw mnany creditora was it divided?
3. Itow mnuch money hais been paid te date te cred;tors of the Heone Bank on claims under $500?
4. How nsuch money has been paid to date te credttors cf the Home Bank on claires over $500?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

5. How mnany claimns under $500 are etiil pendnmg

6. Hesw many claimes over $50 are stili pending?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
1. Yes, $640,877.64 reprezenting 1,301 dlaimns.
2. Yes, $440218.80 representing 1,004 dlaims.
3. 3894,302.1 7.
4. $1,343,M9.09.
5. The amount required to pay 35 per cent
on eligible dlaims under 35W0 was depoaited
in disbursing banks on August 28, 1925, for
withdrawal on application of creditors enttitled
to the same. The Act provided that such
claim.s be paid withotxt investigation by the
Commissioner.
To date 6,474 creditors have not applied
for payment to them of re.lief out of the
moneys so deposited. A large proportion of
the claims of such creditors consists of small
balances.
6. 1,852.
Hon. Mr. REID: I would like to ask the
honourable leader of the Government if it is
the intention to lay on the Table of the House
the rest of the information which. should have
been submitted to Parliament in accordance
with the Act passed last Session. There was
to have been laid on the Table of the House.
wi'thin fourteen days after the opening of
Parliament, a report of ail payments made up
to date. An inlterim report giving information
Up to Novem-ber, two months before the
opening of Parliament, wao laid on the Tab!p
in another place, but it covers only the payments Up to $500, and under a clause in the
Act we in this House are entitled to a com-

plete statement. Are we going to get it before
the Session closes, or are we to have only the
interim. report?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I confe.5s that I
have not seen the interim report, and I have
not the Act before me at the moment. Would
the answer I have just given my honourarAe
friend ho in conformity with what is .reqmired
by the Act, or is a much more minute report
necessary?
Hon. Mr. REID: According to the Act. a

full list of all creditors who had been paid was
to have been laid on the Table of the Husc,
whether the payment was lIss or more than
$500.
The statement was to contain thL
names, the amounts claimed, and the amotînts
paid. As I have said, an interim report was
presented, containing-a number of pages, but
it included only the dlaims Up to $500, and
gave the information only Up to November
30. I think
is most unfair that we are not
gettîng the statement to which we are entitled

inquiry as to statements made by a soldier
that besides the $5,000 hie bad given otber con.ideratiorrs to the vendor of the property.
The Departrnent, tberefore after otudying the
situation, came to the conclusion that the Act
iu that particular, sbould romain as it is now,
and that tbe sumn of $5,000 sbould be the
anrount supposed to bave been paid for the
property. In fact, it was tbe amount that the
Soldier Settlcrnent Board did pay, because
it had no right ta pay a dollar more.

Hon. Mr. GILLI8: Less 10 per cent.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, less 10 per
cent. For these reasons I must inform my
honourable frien-d that I cannot in this particular come to bis rescue.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: In regard to the changes,

1 quite approve of rnost of tbem, but I think
that a cumbersorno systemn is being introduced
in the matter of appeals from the decisions
of the Soldier Settlernent Board. Instead of
appointing a judge of the Exebequer Court,
wliv not appoint county or district judges,
suclh as we bave in the West? In Saskatchewan ive bave sorne 21 judges located in
juthicial districts. who could go fully into these
matters in their localities, and in tbat wayI
think those mou should ho the ones to whom
appeals should be rcferred when nocessary.
We have rnany judgcs out West wbo are
practically going to sced for want of work,
and I arn told that this state of affairs oxists,
to a gýreater or less degroe, tbroughout the
country' , and that tbose .iudges are practical
nien with ripe legal knowledge. I understand
that there are onîy two Exehequor Court
iu(lges in Canada, so that if an appeal were
made in British Columbia, in one of the
Prairie Provinces, or even in an eastern Province, an Exehequer Court judgo would ho
required ta take a long journey to the Province
concerned, in order ta decide that appeal.
No; the ExHon. Mr. DANDURAND:

fact tbat by the rniethod adapted thiere would
be uniforrnity in the judgrnents. because they
would all corne back ta these two judges in

On the Order:

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Honourable gentlemen,' with the leave of the Senate I wish to
movo that this report, and the evidence attacbed thereto, ho referred back to the Standing Cornmittee on Divorce.
In doing so, 1 do flot intond in.the sligbtest
way to criticize the report that bas been
made. I attended the sittings of the Cernrnittee and heard the evidence, and although
it was circumastantial I mnust admit that it
contained very serious charges against the
respondent. The seriousness of those charges
is the main motive for rny motion. Those
whio are ail fait know to what family the
respondent belongs: there is no more respectable family in rny part of the country. They
are also acquainted with the relatives of the
i espondent, ahl of whorn are highly respectable. Therc is no doubt that those charges
are very painful indeed, not only ta the
iespondent and to hier child-for she has
a youing girl, a mere child of 10 or Il years
-but to the whole of ber family.

As required by the procedure in the Province

marital relations between the parties, as adznîtted by the petitioner, at regular and frequent intervals from 1921 to 1924, that there
inust have heen complete reconciliation. Besides, the case in the Civil Court of which I
now speak was settled out of court by the
parties, the petitioner agreeing to pay $125
a month to bis wife, whom lie now accuses
of adulterv.
It seems to me that in a case like this al
possible opportunity should ho given to the
respondent to clear lier reputation, that of

There is no great hardship to the if she can.
petitioner,
except of course that the 'Session is nea.ring
its close, and there rnay be a fear that this
Bill rnay not pass the other Bouse. But if it
is true that that danger now existe, it wiil
flot be very greatly increased. On the other
hand, we have to weigh for ourselves the
very grave injustice that may be caused-not
by the Committee, because they have been as
wide as possible under the circurntances--but
by failure to hear the respondent's defence. If
these charges can be met and repelled, it
would be indeed a bard fate that would pre..
vent the respondent from producing ber
evidence.
I do not think that my motion is an unusual one in this Bouse. I arn advised that
even the Chairman. of the Standing Committee
on Divorce, when there bas beau a doubt in
the minds of the Commnittee, bas hirnself
moved, that a case sbould be further heard
in order that there should be absolutely no
danger.of injustice being done.
As to the recondiliation, I have now the
evidence in xny bands.
Why that was not
produced I cannot understand, except of course
that this was an ex parte case.
For these reasons, weighing on -the one aide
the sligbt inconvenience that there miglit be, and
on the other the gravity, of leaving a charge
of. that nature standing for. ail time. against a
name that bas been beretofore respectable in
the Province of Quebec, I hope .that this.
Biouse will accept my motion,. and refer .back
the report and the evidence to the Conamittee.
From what I have .seen
and beard, if the
report goes back to the Cornnittee, I have.

flot -the slightest doubt !that the g.reatest
possible freedorn will ho given to the respondent to establish ber innocence.
Bon. Mr. LAIRD: Bonourable gentleman,
wbetber the motion before the Bouse is usual
or not, it cornes as a surprise to sorne of us
that we gbould be expected to vote on such
a question without some statement from the
Divorce Comrnittee wbicb heard the case. I
tbink we are entitled to some information or
sorne explanation frorn the Committee. I do
not know anything a-bout this case at ail,
and in the absence of any such statement
I arn put in a very embarrassixig position in
being asked to vote on this question.
Hon. Mr. .- ILLOUGHBY:
W
Bonourable
gentlemen, the honourable member who bas
rnoved the amendment (Bon. Mr. Beaubien)
bas rather commended the Divorce Comrnittee upon theý impartiality with whieh it
bas beard this application. Be bas made no
strieture or comment in regard to tbe action
of the Committee; tiherefore no defence is
necessary. The evidence offered, after every
opportunity had been given to the respondent,
was in the opinion of the Comm'ittee sufficient to warrant the action wbich was taken.
I arn neither going to oppose nor support the
amendment of the honourable gentleman.
He is quite in order in saying that on one
occasion during this Session a petition of
divorce, was referred back to the Cornmittee at
my instance. I may say that if et any time
it came to rny notice as Chairman of that
Committee, after we had beard tbe evidence
and recommended in favour of a divorce, that
there was collusion that had not been brought
to our attention, I would tbink it incumbent
upon me to do what the King's Proctor does
in England, or what the Attorney General
in Saskatchewan dos, namely, to inquire into
thnt question. In the Old Land the decrec
nisi only becomes final after tbree or six
months, and if certain tJhings transpire in the
meantime, it may nover be issued.
If it
came to my knowledge that the parties had
heen guilty of collusion and that facts had
heen suppressed, I would ask that the report
'ho referred back.
Right Non. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
The honourable gentleman bas stated one
case in wbich he- would consider it his duty

as necessary that it be taken into account by

I quite aigree with my honourable friend
who spoke before (Hon. Mr. Laird) that
every one of us who was flot ait the meeting
of the Divorce Committee is put in a position that we do not like to occupy. No one
wants to do an absolute injus-tice to anybody,
least of aIl to a woman with a child; but
we know notbing of the faets of the case at
ail. Whait 1 looked for was a statement from
the Chairman of the Committee that ail the
evidence had been presented-wbich I understood to be the case-and that the decision
had been made on the facts of the case wbich)
were freely allowed to, be presented before
the Cornmittee. It is almost ton much to
aisk one witbout any knuwledge of the facts
to vote upon a question of this kind. If the
Cha;irman of the Committee had said, " I will
look into the matter, and if I consider that
this is absolutely new evidence, I will raise

other ilian the staýtement which the honourable gentleman bas just made, and wbicb
he makes upon bis responsibility as a member of this House, and whicb I accept as being
made in gond iaith.
As to tbe remark that there migbt be otber
cases, I mnax say that in my view the Divorce
Committee is dealing- with more than a mere
contract: it is a contract plus. Speaking for
myseli, if it came to my knowledge, even aifter
we had beard a case, that beyonct tbe sbadow
oi a doubt tbere had been condonation or
collusion, I would be open to he«ir evidence
upon that point. I do not regard divorce as
a civil maitter in the courts, wbere a client
bas bis day in court and must stand by the
decision if he fails. We are dealing witb
something more than contract, aind tbe report is under our control tilI it passes into a
Bill. 1 can conceive ni cases in wbich 1
would be inclined to hear evidence which bad

Our rules provide that a defence bas to be

Chairman of the Divorce Committee, if it
were brought to bis attention that important
evidence could be produced, wouild*allow it
to be laid before the Committee even tbougb

Certainly 1 would always adopt that rule.

Hon. Mr. BARNARD:
As a member of
the Conimittee whdch sat on this case, I
would like to say a word or two. Uni ortunaitely I was not in the Chamber wben the honourable gentleman moved his motion andi

JUNE 22, 1926
In conclusion, I may say that this is an
excellent instance of the very absurd way in
which we try to conducet the divorce business
of this country.
We ail know that a very
large proportion of the population does. not
believe in divorce; unïfortunately, there is also
a very large proportion of the people-in fact,
I think the greater proportion-who do believe
in divorce.
The resuit is that you have a
court which I think most of the members
of the HEouse will agree strives to do its best
under the circumnatances, but whose decisions
are left to the revision of a House composed of
96 men, 90 of whom have not head or bothered
to read the evidence. However, if the people
of Ontario and Quebee want their matrimonial
squabbles settled'in that way, I suppose they
must have it. So far as I arn concerned, if
a vote is taken on this proposaI, I intend
to support my action as taken in the Coinrnittee.
Hon. Mr. REID: I think, so far as my experience in this House goes; it bas been the
cuistom ito accept%'he decîsions of the Divorce
Cornmittee. The memibers of the Committee
have heaird the evidence and know the aircumnsUances, and in this case I see no reason
why I should not vote in accordance with their
report.
However, a question hae been raised,' and
an amendment moved by an honourable member who etates that there is new eviden:ce. 0f
course, I quite agree thait if our vote to-day
were to prevent the hearing of that evidénce,
I might sce fit to reconsider the matter and
vote for the amenchnent. But every honourable gentleman -in this House knows that there
is a Committee of the other Huse to which
every Bill is refcrred, and that evidenice is
hea-rd there. I remember a nunaber of cases
ini which, when I was a member of the bouse
of Commone, the Cornmittee of that House
heaird evi'dence.
Hon. Mr. CASGRLAIN: Took evidence?
Hon. Mr. REID: Took evidence, yes. There
i6 no doubt tbat they have the saine right to
hear evidence that our Divorce Committee
has, and in a few cases they have taken
evidence. I could mention casesl in which it
has been dyne. If we let this case go to the
House of Commons, and they refer it te their
Committee, that Committee Weilil any new
hear
evidenoe there may be, and wilideal wîth the
case accordingly. Why cannot we let the Bill
take the usul course? In doing otherwise we
may be doing an. injustice te the Divorce
Committee and to the parties interested. If
this case were referred bwck to our Committee and the samne report was presented later
14015--20à

307

on, it would then have to go to the Hous of
Commons Committee, where it woul be gone
into again. The Session is nearing an end,
and I think it would be hetter to let the Bill
go to the other House, where the parties can
be represented before the Committee, and if
there is to be a fight, the parties can fight it
out there, and the decision of that Committee
would practically settIe the whole matter so
far as the divorce is concerned. I feel that
we would only be makcing trouble in referring
the report back lIo the Committee here. For
that reason, I1 amn going to support the report
of the Committee.
bon. Mr. 'DANDURAND: I arn somewhat
surprised to hear that there is such a procedure
in the other branch of Parliament as that
mentioned by my honourable friend. I always
thought that a case was tried on the saine
record in both Houses. I do not understand
that aftcr the evidence is heard by the Senate
Committee, and printed, and sent to the other
House, the Committee of that Houas can hear
further evidence or new evidence without
being obliged to reprint it in order to explain
to this Chamber the reason for their decision.
Surely a case which is tried by the two Chambers must be tried on the saine evidence. I
have neyer heard of a divorce case coming
back from the Commons with supplementary
evidence printed and distributed to members
of this Chamber. It is true that I do not read
divorce evidence, that I do not attend the
Comrnittee, and that I have taken no part,
pro or con, in divorce matters. I should
think it very regrettable indeed that there
should be a division of opinion on a proposition to refer a case back to the Committee
for further consideration if new evidence is
offered. That would surprise me very much.
I must say that I arn much surprised to hear
that my honourable friend has been in a
Committee of the Commons which took
evidence.
bon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: If I understood
correctly the honourable leader of the Government, hie questioned the statement of the
honourable gentleman to my lef t (bon. Mr.
Reid). I can give one specific case that
occurred when I was a member of the Private
Bili Commnittee of the Hous of Commons.
That is the Committee before which. Divorce
Bils used to come, and I presume they do yet.
Hon. Mr. BlELAND: Yes.
bon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: I remember very
distinctly one case in which the Private Billh
Committee of the Commons took evidence
for two day.

Enghli practice, but it is now usual to refer them to
the Standing Committee on Miscellanieous Private

Hon. Mr. ROSS: Yes.

Hon. Mr. ROSS: As a matter of fact, I
know of one -case which occu.rred wben I was
Chairma-n of the Divorce Committee, and in
whicb evidence was taken on the other side.
It was a case from Toronto-I bave forgotten
the names of the parties.
I sbould tbink that in the present instance
one or other of two courses ought to be taken:
cither to refer baek the application to the
the hearing on the
Committee to re-open
ground of the discovery of further evidence;
or elise to send the Bill to the other House
with the eviidence that we bave, and' let tbat

there for tbe first -time and need not be impeded by wbat bas bappened in this Honse.
If this were the middle of the Session I would
vote for a motion to send this report bac-k to
tbe Committee, to give the Commilttee a
chance to, hear an application for a re-opening
of tbe case in the way I speak of; but at the
end of thse Session, I think the right thin&g to
do, seeing that you are not thereby committing any injustice towards t.be respondent and
at the same itime are not tbrowing the petition
out or putting the petitioner off tili another
Session, wouid be to let the Bill go t.o the
other Hou-se.
Hon. Mr. BEAIJBIEN: Honourable gentlemen, may I try to roake myseir clearer?
I certainly did not wish to give this House the
impression that my motion sougbt a condemnation of the report of the Committee.
I thought I had taken ample precautions to
show that in view of the evidence on record

3R~

JUNE 22, 1926
I for rny part had no fauit to find witb the
report.
My motion, therefore, was not
directed against the report. I have attended
the sittings and heard the evidence, and have
flot one tittle of complaint to make in that
respect. That is the first point.
Now, as to the advisaibility of hearing new
evidence. You have always coneidered that
reconclliation was a bar to divorce, and, there
bas been subritted to me only this morning,
and not before, the evidence which the petitioner swore to in court in Monitreal.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Will my honourable
friend permit me a question? If that was a
defence, that miust have been within the
knowledge of counsel for the respondent.
There was continuai reference during the
hearing to the fact that there had been civil
proceedings in Montreai between these parties.
Why did not counisel for the respondent
produce that as a defence?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I did flot say that
the case was altogether an ex parte one. I
said that the lawyer who appeared was evidently not farailiar with 'bis record, and that
is quite plain now. When you open that
record you see the evidence that couid have
been brought out so clearly. The trouble
is that it was not presented.
I think the right honourable the junior
member for Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George
E. Foster) bas made a very good suggestion,
and I arn quite wiiling to leave the evidence
in the hands of the Chairman of the Comrniittee. Defer consideration of the report
until to-rnorrow if you like. After ail, I arn
not more chýarged with this record than anybody else in this House; but I wouid hate
to think that evidence which should have
been adduced which was available, but was
not presented, cannot be brought in now.
So I -arn quite willing to accept the suggestion
to adjourn consideration of the report until
to-morrow.
When the Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Divorce hias learned
of this evidence, perhaps he wiil say whether
there is eny prima facie evidence which
wouid justify the return of the case to the
Committee. I think the honourable member
front Middleton (Hon. W. B, Ross) bas
correctly described the procedure whieh wouid
folIow. The formai application for the reopening of the case wouId then be made, and
the honourabie gentlemen of the Committee
couid decide wbether or flot Vhey should
consider that new evidence, whatever may
have been the reason why it was not previously adduced.

I therefore move that this report be n&_.
now considered, but that it be piaced on the
Order Paper for to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD: What about the
bonourable gentleman's other motion?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: With the leave of
the House, I wiil withdraw the first motion
and move that the order be not now considered, but be placed on the Order Paper
for tbo-morrow. Ia the meantime the evidence
wiii be handed to the Chairman of the,
Divorce Committee.
Hon. Mr. REID: I would like to under-stand the honourable member's motion,
'If
it 18 passed by the House, does the bonourable gentleman intend then to hand the evidence to the Chairman of the Divorce Comn'ittee?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. REID: If the Chairman of ther
Divorce Committee considers it of sufficient:
importance. he wili oeil the Committee together, and if the Committee decide that the
application sbouid be referred back, it wili
be referred back? If not, it is to go through
to the Commons to-morrow?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: That is the way I
understood the suggestion of the right honourable gentleman from Ottawa.
It is a reHon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
sponsibility that the Chiairman of the Committee does not want to take upon himseif.
I have no objection to the matter beîng referred to the Committee if the House so, desire, but it ougbt not to be left to the Chairman.

FARM LOAN BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON
AND COMMERCE

BANKING

Hon. GEORGE G. FOSTER presented the
report of the Committee on Banking and
Commerce on Bill 148, an Act for the purpose of establishing in Canada a system of
Long Terni Mortgage Credit for Farmers.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, on behalf
of the Committee on Banking and Commerce,
I desire to lay before this Chamber a report
which is the result of careful and thoughtful
study by the Committee extending over many
days and many sessions. When this Chamber
submitted that Bill to the Committee on
Banking and Commerce, it was recognized
that it required examination and careful
study; and that it has had that careful study
and examination is evidenced by the fact
that I am submitting to you a Bill in which
there are 14 changes from the Bill originally
submitted to this House from the House of
Commons.
We examined witnesses from
many walks of life, heard all who desired to
submit their views and experience to us, and
this report is the result.
I am not, at this time going to submit
to the House the details of all the changes,
because they are so numerous; but, in order
that the House may have some idea of those
changes, and the reasons for them that were
laid before the Committee, I desire to submit
a brief statement which I shall supplement
later with further details.
One of the most important sections in this
Bill is section 7 subsection (5), which provides
the basis for computing the rate of interest
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

which shall be charged to borrowers on
mortgage loans. It should be pointed out
that the Bill is based on the assumption that
after the organization stage has passed and a
reasonable volume of loans has been made,
the system will be self-supporting. This means
that out of the interest received from borrowers on their loans, there must be provided
interest on the farm loan bonds issued, all
the expenses of operation and the reserves
necessary for actual and anticipated losses.
The rate of interest to be charged the
borrowers should therefore contain at least
three elements:
(1) The rate of interest to be paid on the
farm loan bonds;
(2) The expenses of operation; and
(3) The provision for necessary reserves.
The Bill as introduced into the House of
Commons left the latter two elements to the
discretion of the Farm Loan Board. This
necessarily precluded the fixing definitely of
the rate to be charged borrowers on their
loans. The reason for such a provision w-as
that it is difficult at the present time to form
a conclusion as to the probable rate of expense
of operation. In the first place the scheme is
unique in providing for a measure of cooperation between Federal and Provincial
authorities, and it cannot be predicted at
this stage to what extent this offer of cooperation will be availed of by the individual
provinces. This makes uncertain the extent
of territory to be covered by the system, the
volume of loans to be made, the density of .
the farming population and consequently the
probable expense of operation.
Another reason is that the system of loans
provided by the Act differs materially from
any other system. It bas points of marked
similarity to the Federal Farm Loan system
in the United States, but there are also important differences.
In view of the uncertainty above mentioned, it was felt that the judgment of the
Board should be absolutely unhampered in
deciding upon the rate necessary to be
charged borrowers.
In the House of Commons the Bill was
changed in this respect by imposing a limitation of 1 per cent of the amount of the loan
upon the rate of expense of operation. The
provision for necessary reserves was left to
the discretion of the Board. In the Banking
and Commerce Committee of the Senate this
limitation has been struck out and the subsection restored to the form in which it was
introduced in the House of Commons.

duty. It is not possible fer all the members
of any legislative body ta give particular attention, exclusive attention ane may say, to

There are several reasans why I view the
matter in that way. We ail have knawledge
of the changed conditions in political and
canstitubtional relations that abtain between
Canada and the mother country and the
ather nations of the world at 'large now as
compared with 50 years aga. There has been a

It was the judgmnent of the Committee that
it would be necessary for the Board, and
particularly the Farm. Loan Commissioner,
to makre a careful etudy of ail existing State
or quasi-public loaning systems on this continent for the purpuse of ascertaining the rate
of expense likely to be învolved in the Canadian system. Estimates of the probable cost
have differed very widely from 1ý per cent
urged by the private loan companies ta 1
per cent indicated by some Provincial systems
in Canada, and to something less than 1 per
cent îndicated by the experience of the
Federai Land Banks in the United States. It
will be necessary for the Commissioner ta
endeavour to reconcile these divergent estimates by a detailed investigation of the
different modes of operation and the expenses
peculiar to each.
The other principal change in the Bill was
the introduction of a provision for recagnizing
provincial experience iii the administration
of the loans for the purpose of determining
the net cost to the borrowers in that province.
The section does not attempt to explain in
detail how this shaîl be worked out, but
establishes the principle for the guidance of

vear. If we have Trade Commissioners, and
di.stribute them throughou.t the world ta work
ont the commercial necessities and activities
af Canada, we consider it our duty ta bring
ta Parliament, each year a report as to what
has been accomplishcd. That serves ta il]ustrate my position. Likewise, if we have
taken on certain obligations and duties in1 a
national way in connection with the League
of Nations, I think it ig the duty of the Govcrament ta put int.a the hbands of the representatives of the people in bath Houseýs a report ai and information in regard to the
aperatians ai the League af Nations ai whicb
wc are a member, and in whosc deliberations
we take part.
The appaintment of Dr. Riddell as Liaison
Officer at Geneva carnies out the first stcp in
that direction: but the second step is equally
necessary, that we s'hauld know nat only that
we have such an officer there, but aiso what
takes place as a resuit af bis residence and
officiaI work as Liaison Officer at that place.
My motion suggests that the Government
ehouid give ta us ail papers that can reasanably be brought down, that will détail, what
action bas taken place between the Canadian
Goverament an.d tbe institution at Geneva
during the year, and what bas been done by
the Dominion Govcrnment. I do not know
ivbetber tbey require a repart from Dr. Riddcii or not, but if not, I think they sbould
eall for such a repart, taking in very generaliy the doings and work ai the League ai
Nations eo far as Canada bau a part in that
work.
Anyone who bas inquired inta and read ai
the operatians ai the League ai Nations
kaows tbat each League Assembiy passes a
variety oi resolutians, and t'bat the Council
af the League bas ta see that, those resolutions are carried out. In this pracess there
-nust be questions and answers, communications af varia-us kinds, betwcen the League
ai Nations and the Government oi Canada
and we ought ta know what these obligations
and transactians are in wbich Canada bas
beex a5ked ta take a part, and wbat part this
country bas taken.
Very important resalutions and conventions
are approvcd, which require the assent af the
nations that belong ta the League, and one
duty of the Council is ta see that t'hose iýmportant resolutions are pia.ced beinre
the
Goveraments,
and that the Govcrnments
answer them. Those answers are compiied,
and, became the property af the next Assembly ai the League. I think it is important,
if we are ta keep a live interest in the League,
and aiso keep tab on the work ai the Gov1{o. Air. G. G. FOSTEII.

ernment in cannection, with it, that we sbould
bave a record ai thase muýtual communicationýs between the Liaison Officer and ourselves.
Aga-in, I tbink that, just as a Goveroment
fecis its respansibility ta give bath Houses
ai Parliament a repart of any anc oi its administrative activities during the year, s0 it
ought ta be the duty ai this Goverament ta
put inta the bands ai every representative in
the Commons and in the Senate at icast the
summary ai the proceedings ai the League
which iE; po'blished monthiy at Genieva, and
which gives in succinct iorm ail the tranoactions ai the preceding month, so that the recipient can learn from monthi ta month and
from year ta year the progress the League is
making in ail its diversified, activities. Two
or three years ago I sugge ted that tha t shoul
be donc by tbe Governmcnt, but nothing bas
yct. transpired, in 50 far as estimates are concerned, toward,3 carrying out that idea. At
ieast, tbat much could be donc by the Government, and prabably ail that would be neccssary in that direction would be ta present
ta each member ai Parliament that înonthly
suýmmary, s0 that each representative could
make himseii acquaintcd with the workings
and doings ai the League. That is aIl I bave
ta say witb reference ta that portion ai the
business.
Then I wish ta caîl the attention ai bonourable members ta the League itscii, especially
ta the iast yenr ai its aperations, and in this
way continue, ta a certain extent, the short
addresscs I have made bcre from year ta ycar,
sa as ta pince upon the pages ai aur Hansard
a connected record ta be at the dispozaI ai
aIl members.
It is truc tbat the League ai Nations bas
flot metamorpbosed the warld in the six years
that it bas been at work. It lias not revalutionized ail the lines ai action ai whicb it
bis disapprovcd, in principle and in practice,
which bad heen in vogue dîîring all preeeding
years. No anc shauld be sa unreasonable as
ta hope that an absoiutely new venture in
international relations couid, in so short a
pcriod as the League bas bcen in opération,
make an ultimate and compicte succcss ai
its ideals, and incarnate tbem in actual practice. I arn certain that no member ai tbis
Assembiy halds such an opinion: that would
be too unreasonabie ta expeet.
Tbe marvel ta me bas been tbat, cansidering the absolutely different idéal cmbadied in
the League ai Nations regarding international
relations, the new venture bas bad co much
success, and bas made the progress tbat it
bas actuaiiy made. Nobody doubted from

JUNE 23, 1926
the first that difficulties would be encountered.
They were anticipated-not the exact nature
of the difficulties, but it was known that
difficulties would be met, and would have to
ho surmounted. From year to year, in the
experience of the League, these difficulties
have arisen; but a mere glance at the solution
of them brings gratifying evidence that in
almost every case when the difficulty was
brought to the crisis a satisfactory solution
has been found, and the setbacks of the League,
s0 to speak, have been astonishingly f ew.
TIhose who are apathetie or antagonistic to
the League naturally make the most of those
difficulties; but the League has notable
achievements to its credit, and in fairness,
while taking cognizance of the difficulties, we
ought also to take account of its achievements.
When we corne to do that I feel that n0
new departure in international relations, from.
the time that history began its record of
them up to the present time, shows the
astonishing progress that has been made by
a new idea in so short a time. I think we
must take that into account. It i.s true that
the League has nlot eliminated ail race
hatreds and race prejudices; these have their
roots too deep, and those roots have been
in the soul for toýo long a time, and the fruitage
hms been s0 vast and so widely dis9tributed,
that it wilI take the moral strength of decades
and even of centuries to entirely obliterate
them. But no reasonable man can dispute
that the League has done much to modify
and soften those race prejudices and hatreds,
by bringing nations and their repre.sentatives
face to face with each other to consult with
regard to their difficulties.
It is also true that the League of Nations
bas not eliminated or entirely abolished war.
It will be a long time before wars are absolut ely abolished; but 1 asic honourable gentlemen to take this fact into account, that no
two nations of the 55 which belong to the
League have engaged in war with one another.
Wars have taken place along two lines: they
have occurred inside of nations, where the
League had no business and no right to interfere, and also between outside nations. The
charge against the League at first was zhat
it would prove to be a super-pgwer, and would
interfere with national administrations and
policies. The experience of six year shw
that that has not been true in a single instance;
and the fact that the wars that have taken
place have been wars within nations, or
amongst nations wthich were outside the
League, goes to prove absoluteiy that this is
not a super-power, and aiso brings out clearly

3E~

the fact that nations must bo allowed to,
carry on their affairs within their national
limits without forced interferenco by the
Loague.
There have been disastrous, sad and dopiorable wars in China, within the nation itself,
and they are still going on; but outside of
the general moral influence oxorted upon
China as a membor of a League of 55 nations
that are against war, and are in favour of
peaceful solutions, tihere is at work withîn
China to-day an influence whivh wili shorten
the period whon those internai wars will bo as
provalent and ns exponsive as thoy are to-day.
There is that moral influence which is boing
oxorted constantly.
Thore is, or was, a war in the Riff, but that
was a war of a difforont kind. France and
Spain had -dominions in Morocco, and had
to proteet them. Tho Riffs were outside of
the Loague, and thoy bocame a thorn in the
flesh of tho administrations in Morocco. That
was a mattor of national interest which France
and Spain alone could decide, as to policy,
and as to the methods to be pursuod. But
even there it cannot be doubted that amongst
the French and Spanish pooplos themsoives
there was a distaste for that war, and a desire
that it should not be u.nnecessarily prolonged,
but shouid bo brought to an end as quickly
as possible, hy agreement or some other
mothod; and the fact that the League of
Nations existed of itseif shortened that war.
Then, you have a war of a different kind;
it is a war internal in a mandatoryHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Do not forget
Spain.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Spain was with Franco. We had also a war
in Syria, an insurrection in a mandatod territory; but that territory is in charge of
France undor hier charter as a mandatory
power, and under conditions imposod by the
League, and the League itself cannot dictate
to France how she shail ma-nage the mandatory within horself, except in one way, and
that is the way in which it is being done.
France takes a ýmandatory; sho has a charter;
that charter bas certain conditions; it is supervised by the League. There is a Comnmittee of 9 which sits permanently, to whom
ahl transactions in mandated territories are
reported. That Committee takes into consideratien what is taking place, asks for information, examines grievances as they are made
known, and asks for their expianation fromn the
mandatory power; mýakes its report to the
Couneil, and the Council spreads it before the
Assombly, which places it before the world.
That is the way that mandatories are carried

314

SENATE

out-not by the arbitrary interference of the
League in the affairs of the mandatory power,
but in a review of the action taken, and in
approval or otherwise of that action, which
cornes aftex'wards.
So ail these wars, which may he cited, and
are cited by people who do flot quite understand the Leaguc formation, are flot arguments against the League itself, but are
rather avidence that the League is flot making

That,
again, was not a war; it was a. step taken by
one member of t.he League to another which
might casily have resulted in a disastrous
war, but which,
under the constituýtional
mathods' of the League, wao stopped at the
eacliest possible moment. The arrangement

of the League was 'brought upon them, mut.ua]ly consented to have the difference hatween them arbitrated by the Ambassadors'
Conference. That Conference heard both
sides. I may say that the very award of the
Ambassadors' Conference was founded upoIl
and mainly consisted of -the arrangement
which was proposed- to them by the League
of Nationýs Council itself, which they adopted
and carried out in practice. So, as I have
stateci, fno war bas taken place between membecs of the League itself. Its pled'ged membership bas been truc to, its plecige, and in ail
repects, up to the present time, what 1 have
stated wvill be found, I think, to be absoluteiy
true.
N.ow let me go a step farther and take up
some of those difficulties wbich have csccurred
and whieh more particularly pertain to the
past year. Perbaps I shaîll do that bast, by
making allusion to ëome threa or four of the
out'standing achievements of the Le.ague of
Nations. Mly view is thisý-and 1 think everyone wvill agrea with me-that the last year
bas been the most intecesting and most fruitful ycac of the League of Nations. It bas
encountered possibly greatar difficulties than
avec before, and it bas attained
gieater
achievaînants than aver before.
The chief of thasa difficulties in our mincis
to-day iýs pcobably that in cefarenýce to the
Spacial assembly of the League of Nations
which was eonvoked for the one andi sole purpose of tdmitting- Gecmany to membecship
in the Leagua, an.d, according to the understanding, to a permanent place on the Council. I wil.l n.t enter into a lengthy story of
that, but the kernel of the affair is this. The
Pact of Locarno was entered into by the
sevan nations which are by fac the most important nations, or set of nations, in Europe,
andi agreement among them -almo.st necassitates accordant action by the other European
nations. Those seven
nations consist of
France.
Germany,
Italy, Great

the names bears out my assertion that those
seven are the great praponderating powecs

Germany should be included in the League.
Well, it was ton near the war to undertake a
project of that kind. France would have been
absolutely oppcsed to it, and so would many
other mnembers. But Argentina bad so set
ber seul upon it that when she was refused
by the As.sembly she said she would not, play
any more in that garden, and she got up and
left. She did not abandon the League of
Nations; she kept ber membership; and now,
in the fiftb year afterwards, she bas ptiid up

and bas intimated ber intention to take an

That explains what bas occurred, and the

a possible loss, there bas not been aiso, a great

In tbe romaining part of my remarks tbis
aftcrnoon I will allude to sorne of the achievemonts of the League. I bave told you of
some of the difficulties.
What about the
a-chievemients of tbe past year? They are
notable. The first achievement of the year
bas been the accession of the United States
of America to the Permanent Court of International Justice. The attitude of the United
States Governiment in the begining may be inferred from the fact that in the first and
second years of the League, wben the League
wisbed for information from
the United
States Goveroment in connection with its
goneral bealtb eperations and wrote to that
G-overnment for statistics 'and other information, the Goveroment of tbe United
States refused evcn to acknowicdge
tbe
Lcague's letter-nut oniy deulined to give the
information, but declined to receive any communication from the League. Tbe only way
tbe League of Nations got tbe information
on those bealtb subjects was hy appiying to
Holland, wbicb was a memnber of the old
heaith organization. and asking Hoiland to
communicate with Wasbington and get tbe
statisties and the information, and thon send
tbem on to tbe League. That marked the
then attitude of the United States
with
reference to the League. Tbe situation chang-ed

of war. Military armaments to-day axe one
-hundred per cent more expensive-maybe that
is too how an estimate--than they were at
the beginning of -the late war. So, from. the
inception, there was the idea that we muet
get rid of the burden of armarnents, and that
the only 'way to. do it was to estaoiish a
feeling of confidence in the nations that thcy
will be prcserved without those expensive
armaments--a sense of security which wil
permit them in common agreernent to diminish
to the very howest lirait the armnaments which
are necessary for their national preservation.
For five years the League his been workinlg
upon that most complex and difficit question. Fancy 55 nations of the worid, each
'with its national ardour and national sentiment, coming to a conclusion as to how they
can arrange this matter sa, as to make ea.ch
secure and give no one an advantage, and 80,
get rid of the burden upon them. The matter
progressed dromn stage to stage, until at last it got
to the point of the League convoking a preparatory Commission to, examine into the
principles and foundations upon whieh a proposai could be put before the worhd of nations
that they should agree to a diminution of
armaments. That preparatory Commission is
a most important and representative one:
Germany is on it and the United States is
on it, ahthough neither of them is a member
of the League, and when the invitation was
given to the UJnited States to go in with
the League on that Preparatory Commission.
President Coolidge adopted the idea, and
Congrese gave him the vote which was neecessary to send a delegation and probably no more distinguished representative dehegation of the UJnited States has
ever been sent abroad than the one
which is to-day in Geneva co-operating-with
the Preiparatory Commission in order t(o
estabiish a basis nipon which. the nations of
the world can be asked to corne together for
disarmament. I give that to show the change
of sentiment which. is taking place. That is
one of the events of the last year.
Another notable event of the hast year is
the Locarno Pact. The Locarno Pact arises
out &f the Protocoi. The Protocol was the
culmination of five years of effort to get at a
basis of security and confidence amonag the
nations which. would enable flhem to disarm to
a imited or to a large 'extent, and so get rid
of the burden of armament. That Protoco'
was the unanimous decision of the fiftL
Assembly, and that decision was sent to the
Government cd every nation in the League

317

in order to get its opinion uipon it. Though
the Assembly agrees upon a certain proposition, it is flot effective until it gets the support of the stipulated number of nations behind it.
Now, the principle involved ini the Protocol
was arbitration of ail questions arising
between nations--arbitration instead of war.
If you can once pin down the principle that
not war but arbitration shall be the rnethod
otf settiernent, then the provocation or the
incentive for armarnent and heavy forces is
d-one away with. Once instil confidence, once
'just make it possible for ail the nations to
sohidly accede to arbitration, and you have
the foundation for security. Once you hqvp
that, ynu have the foundation for disarmament.
But there cornes the point. A nation says:
"Hocw arn I to be sure that the one that I
have a&dispute with wiIl subrnit to arbitration?
Wherc is the sanction?" There cornes in the
question of sanctions. In the Protocol the
s anction was provided. It was provided that
the aggressor should be defined so that a
-child could pick him out, and that the
ag.gressor should be the proscribed bandit
amongst the nations, and that ail the other
nations should band themselves togetheÉ
against that bandit nation, and, if necessary in
the end, to do what your policeman has to do
on the streets of Ottawa-to take the robber
or the burgiar or the bandit by the coat coflar
and carry him off if he will not go peaceabiv,
and put hinr in a ceil.

Under the League, what happens? Bulgaria
is a member of the League; she is under
obligations to the League. Greece is a mem-.
ber of the League; she is under obligations
to the League. The League lias a Couneil
which is ready to get together inside of 24
houi-»-a Council which represents four great
Powers and ail of the 55 nations of the Lýeague
Assembly. The Powers do nmt have to get
into communication with one another and say,
"What, can we do about Vhs?" They have a
riglit to say, as they did, "Greecel Bulgaria!
You are violating your obligations; instead
of going to war, you. should have submitted
this difference to the League; we will eaUl a
meeting of the Cou-ncil in Paris on Monday
evening'"-this was on the Friday preceding"and we summon you to have your representatives there Vo lay before the Counci]
thiýs trouble that you are in. In the meanlime, silence every gun; take every soldier
out of your opponent's territory; do noV, fire
a cshot. If you do, you come under the
sanctions of the League." What liappened?
On Monday Greece and Bulgaria had their
representatives before the fuit Council in
Paris. lI the meantime Vhey had witlidrawn
every soldiler from contiguous foreign territory,
they had put their guns aside, and there was
no shooting. The resuit, was that inside of
three days both those countries came to. conclusi'ons which were urged upon them by the
Council, of the League of Nations. The dispute
was eettled; a Commission was sent, to iniquire
into the matter and assess the damages; that
Commission acted and assessedi the damages
on Greece-a most wonderfully vital principle, which is that the aggressor shall psy
the damage. lIn the end the Council agreed
.to this Commission's report; the fine was paid;
the two countries shook hands, and, what i'better than ail, an international arrangement
was made by the League b>' which neutral
Swiss officers patrol that frontier between
Bulgaria and Greece in liaison with the outposts on each side, so as to prevent, any
recurrence of that kind.
Now, that is the contrast. If nothing else
was achieved by the League, is that noV a wonderful aohieveiment? But the fine thing today-ig that, with ail tihe grea4t Power present,
that princile was nailed down-that war is
not to take place, either with -big niations or
litAe nations; and that the damages must be
amsaesed on thé tüuntry, big or littie, that
makes aggression. You casmot have a ehild

Corfiu business, but the League lias grow.n,
and it has immeesurab>' increased its preistige by fixing that principle. That, and the
Locarno Treat>', are wond'erful achievements
of the past year.
There was another case-Mosul.
There
was a dispute bebween Great Britain and
Turkey under the m!andatory oif Iraq, w'ith
reference Vo the boundary between Vhem. In
Vlie Tre-aty of Lausanne it was stipulateï
that Great Britain and Turkey ahould agree
on that line, and if the>' could not do so
within nine montbs, it was Vo be sent Vo
the Lpague to settie. They did) not so, agree,
and the League app)ointed a Commïssion
which travelled over the whole region, took
aIl the information tihey could get front
headmen and tribesmen of the different races,
and fromr the Governments involved, and
they came back with a report settling upon
a provisiýonal line called the Brusseis line.
That une had been made provisional in
1924, and the reprementatives ofê both Turkey
and Great Britain had agreedi tfiàt they
would properi>' respect that Iine,.asud would
flot move on either aide of it agaînst eseli
other, and thnat they would abidie by the
decision of the Councîl. But when it came
before the Couricil the T<urkish Amnbassad-or
simply said: "I repudiate that; my Government does niot recognize it; unless we get
wliat we want in Mosul we wiIl take nothing;
anyway, your Council has not power Vo décide
it; ail you can do is Vo advise witih us." That
raises the question of competency: How could
that have been settl'ed if there had been no
League? But it was reiferred Vo the World
Court; both aides argued their case, and the
Wrorld Court gave its decision, whicli was that
the Council hàd the right Vo decide the
matter the Council did decide it. Then
the Turkisli representiative rose and gaid:
"Ail right; deoide it; we wilI have nothing
more to do with it; we do not, and we wl!
not, recognize the settlement." But second
tliought are best, and what prompted the
second thought? IV was Vhis: Turkey saw
that Vhis was no longer a matter between lier
and Great Britain; it had now passed out
of Great Britain's hands, and, had become a
decision <)f 55 nations of the world. That was
a different roatter, and meant bucking up
sgainst 55 nâtioiis of the world.

mutual co-operation between all the members of the League. Turkey saw that. Turkey
bas been powerful, in the past because she
played one country against another, and she
would be powerful in future if she had the
same privileges; but it is pretty hard to play
against 55 different nations that must stick
together in their decisions.
What has happened? -Great Britain went
to Turkey in a friendly spirit, willing to give
and take. So there has been an agreement.
They came to a conclusion, some little adjustments were made on the part of Iraq
and the British ýGovernment, and the two
countries have signed Treaties, and the whole
question has been settled. Now, if there had
been no League of Nations, that dispute would
have had to be decided between Turkey and
Great Britain, and nobody knows what would
have happened, but probably war would
ultimately have taken place.
Now, honourable gentlemen, I thank you
very much for your kind attention, and I do
net propose to keep you any longer.
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: Honourable
gentlemen, the right honourable gentleman
who has just spoken (Right Hon. Sir Geo.
E. Foster) started by saying that many of
us might not be as familiar as himsel-f with
the affairs of the League. I think that is
quite correct. He has had the good fortune
of being sent by this Government to the
League, and one of the happiest events of his
life took place there, as I understand, and be
came back accompanie-d by a companion. The
right honourable gentleman is also President
of the Canadian League. So it is with a great
deal of diffidence that I undertake, without
preparation, to attempt an answer to some
of the things that have been so well said.
Everybody knows that for the last 40 years
there has been no more eloquent speaker
either in this place or in another place, or
throughout the country, than the right bonourable gentleman who has just taken his
seat. He has made a life study of this question. Others, like myself, who have other
occupations, are necessarily taken away from
that study, and cannot devote so much time
to it. Therefore I ask the indulgence of this
House while I endeavour to express disagreement with some of the things the last speaker
has said.
Startling from the very first, as I said the
other day, I am afraid that the poor League
is falling to pieces.
We read only two days
ago in the newspapers that the, Right
Hon. Austen Chamberlain, answering a question in the British House cf Commons,
actually admitted that Brazil had resigned
Hon. Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

from the League.
Now, what 'is Brazil? The
right honourable gentleman to-day compared
Argentiina with Brazil; but Argentina has only
a population like that of Canada with very
much the same productions.
The beautiful
river La Plata runs through that country, on
one side of which is prairie and on the other
side a wooded country. But Brazil contains
at least a third of the population of the South
American continent, some Z5,000,C00 people,
which is more than twice the population of
Argentina.
Brazil has immense resources, and
is the leading nation in South America. Without Brazil, what would all those little countries
do?
The right honourable gentleman talks
of 55 nations in the League, but there are only
8 nations in the whole world that are worth
counting.
For example, how many white
men are there in Nigeria, which belongs to the
League?
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: No,
it does not: my honourable friend is quite illinformed.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: I am sorry; I was
quite sincere when I sa-id it was; I will look
it up again; I have the book here. There are
other little countries.
I would ask my
right honourable friend if Guatemala and
Nicaragua belong to the League?
Right
Yes.

Hon.

Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:

Hon. Mr. OASGRAIN:

Does Ecuador?

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE
Ecuador does net.

E. FOSTER:

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: What about all those
little countries?
In fact, there are more
white people out of the League than there
are in ýit.
I have made that assertion in the
House before, and I have given the names of
the countries, so I am not going all over
that story again.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
gentleman was counting Germany as outside
the League, but Germany will be in the
League in September.
Hon. !Mr. CASGRAIN: Oh, do not be so
sure; and it will be a sad day for the League
itself when that happens.
I would not like
to sec Germany in the League, for if it goes in
it will only do so in order to carry on its
policy of considering treaties as scraps of
paper.
When I hear of an arrangement with
Germany in our generation I say, let the time
pass, let another generation come. The right
honourable gentleman spoke a moment ago
about Germany coming in and giving a pledge.

will not.
Right Hon. Sir 'GEORGE E. FOSTER:
France stems to have done it.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Poor France: I
am glad the right honourable gentleman la
helping me on. France joinied. the League of
Nations with one vote, and our Emipre has
seven votes. It is possible to be naive, but
not to that extent-to, go and play cards with
a man who can draw seven carde, whl you
tani onIy draw one. The United States knew
One of the reasons
better than to do that.
why it did not join the League was that the
President of the UJnited States, representing
115,000,000 -white people, who can read and
write, knew that his country would have only
one vote, whie Kinig George of Engliand- would
have seven votes, because cd the votes that
are given to, the Overseas Dominions. I can
speak freely about my 1ioyalty Vo King George,
because my people for generations have served
t~he British Empire in the Army, the Navy
and the Civil Service; but I do flot wonder
that the United States said: "Very well, we
wiât join the League; we have 47 States; give
us 47 votes, and we will join."
But there is on very important department
of the Lea-gue which the right honourable
gentleman glosses over in ail bis speeches
througrhout the length and breadth of this
land. He neyer ta'ks about the Budget of
the League, which is $4.000,000 a year, 40
per cent of which, or $1,600,000, is handed
over to that notorious Socialist, Albert
Thomas, who, repreAenting France 'I suppose. has absolute control. Sir Eric Drummnond. the general manager and officiai Secretary od the League, can:iotinterfere with that
Bud-get, for that money is set apart. That
auma has not been f ound sufficient; there has
been a deficit from year to year on that; and
yet Albert Thomas bas been sending Socialistic propaganda througbout the world continunlly, and we in Canada are helping to
psy the cst of that propaganda. I say that
tha best Vhing the League could do would be
to prevont Socialisth fomnenting trouble
Of course, Aibert
throu'ghout the world.
Thomas and other Socialiste around him are
14015--21

321

very much in favour of the Lefflue, for very
good reasons; they are drawing sca&ndalous
salaries, and if you look at the Budget of the
League you will sce the number of employees
under the, supervision of Mr. Albert Thomas.
You will find, that ha has got as many as Sir
Erie Druimmond. I muet say that there are
many ladies employed there, too, and when
the officiais of the League visited. the -harems
in Constantinople and other places--that was
one of the occupations of the League. to see
that the harems were .closed down, or that
they were made free and so on-I think they
did flot need to leave Geneva; they might
have stayed right there, and left Constantinople aTone.
Then it is intereeting to see the amount
of money that IMr. Albert Thomas receives
for translation. I do not know how many
transistors there are; but if you look at the
Bu-dget you see that they have neyer yet been
able to translate the words, "Frais de représentation." That means money given to have
a good timne--entertaining, having dinners,
supper parties, theatre entertainimente, and eo
on; that is "Frais de, représentation." Why
not be honest with the world, and find a
translation for those words? But the Engliah
people are prudish, land they wouild neyer
allow t.hat there was so much money given
away for suoh purposes. But I will say thie
for Albert Thomas: although he receives that
money he does not spend it for "Frais de représentation." He knows that this thing is
not going to lest long, ao he is just hoarding
up the money. It is handed to'him for the
purposes of entertainîment, but be takes good
care of it, and he is ýwise, because hîs job ie
not permanent.
The rizht honourable gentleman spoke of
Corfu. Well, if there was one thîng that was
injurious to the League, it wae that Coilfu
matter. I think that should. not ha talked of
hy anybody who advcates the League. We
ail remem-ber that some Italian engineers who
were laying out the boundary in Albania,
and so on, were âhot down. Nobody could
prove who shot them, or what happened, bacause no one was left to tell the sto;ry. However, the League of Nations naturally took
action in Vhie matter, and 'Mussolini who is a
sort of second Napoleon the Firet, said: "Look
here, if the League la going to interfere in
my business I will withdraw from the League."
The League collapsed at once and did noV
interfere. What happened? There was a
Council of Ambassadors sitting at Paris, and
the League said: "For goodness sake, settIe
this for us. This mnan Mussolini is a terrible
fellow, and, whatever you -do, aýgree with
Mussolini, or it ie aIl up with us as far as

REVISED EDMTOI<

Italy is concerned."
What was tihe resuit?
A disgraceful award. Here were Italy with
its thirty millions of people-a pawerful nation-and Greece, a poar, littie nation. Every
humiliating condition was iinposed upan
Greece. Sa humiliating were the terms t.bat
tlhey shamed 'Mussolini-he wag ashamed to
take the money. It wae even declared that
there must be celebrated in Athens a solemn
Mass-a Catholic Mass, mind you-which
those Greeks, non-Catholics, shouki be campelled ta attend. And they did attend. For
what purpose was that condition iinposed?
Just ta humiliate the Greeks. They were
required ta salute the flag ai Italv. Every
humiliating condition
was imposed
upan
Greece. and then that littie cauntry was condemned ta pay a large sum af man'ey. Well,
wheii Mussolini heard of this large sum of
money he did nat know what ta do. 1 have
read three ]ives af Mussalini, and, you know,
lic seems ta ho a pretty decent sort of felf0w. He said: "I caninot take this money
frorm poor Greece; the Greeks cannot affard
ta pay that much. StilI they have been ordered ta pay it. I cannat tel] themn I wiIl
give them their money back: that would be
still mare humiliating, after aIl this humiliation. I will tell you what I will do." Hie
resurrected the Order
af the
Xniights af
Matta, which had nat been active for many
years. H1e Sound out who was the Grand
Prior, and hie went ta himn and eaid: "Look
here! When the fleet went ta Corfri, aur guns
did a great ýdeal af damage. killed some innocent people. and sa on. You are the head
af the Order of the Knights of Malta. We
will give you this maney. Go aver ta Corfu
and diistribute it there, sa that it may nat ho
sid that we have taken this money-this iligatten gain." For it is nathing e:lse. The
aggressors who fired upon those poor surveyors that were killed were guilty of plain
murder, such as accurs in the streets of
Chicago every other d'ay. The right hanaurable gentleman a few minutes aga said
that the aggressor was alwayis punished. It
was the aggressor that was re'warded-so rewarded that lie was ashamcd ta take the
maney and gave it back, through the Kaiglits
ai Malta.
Naw for the Protocal-that dear aId
Protocal. I attended the wake of the
Protocol, and enjayed it immensely.
And
wha strangled the poar Protocal? Who killed
Cack Robin? Why, it was Sir Austen Chamberlain who killed it. When it was drafted it was
suppased ta be a panacea. With the Protocol
peace was ta ho ýrestored thraughaut the
warld. My honourable leader here (Hon.
Hon.

Mr. CASGRAIN.

Mr. Dandurand) said: "The Protacal did
not pass, 'but, neyer mi.d it will be
adaoPted next time." We ail heard hima say
that. Hie said: "The Protocal is ail riglit:
it is a grand thing." The purpase aof the
Pratacal was simply ta put teeth into Article
X; that is ta say, it was ta carry out the
original intention ai the Lea.gue.
Thase
nations were ta club tagether and ga ta war
against the minority, and of caurse, havint'
the greater strength, they wauld wiri out. The
League met. Wha was the first man against
the Pratocol?
It was the Right Hon. Sir
Austen Chamberlaýin; and ho wus riglit. The
Protocol was stopped at bis instance. It hms
disappeared, like many other t.hings frmr
which a great deal had been expected. Aiter
a w'hule we shahl have a Eist afiaal the schemes
that were adapted with piaus invocations andi
declared ta be thc greatest things on earth
in the interest af world peace. Nothing has

Then there is the Locarno Pact. That is not
a League accamplishment. The Locarna Pact
was made outside the League. What was the,
roatter with the League? Wherc was it when
the Part was made? The League acted in
the Locarno affair like the monkey-wrench
that is thrown into the machinery. That is
what the League did. What was donc at
Lacarno xvas ail right except that they trusted
Germany, as I would not have donc if I had
been there.
Outside ai that there wa. just
one thing wrong abaut Locarno: it was ta
drag the League inta the affair. If they had
let the Leag-ue alone and gone an without if,
there would have heen no trauble, and the
,Locarno Part wauld naw be in force. My
honaurable friend ta my right (Hon. Mr.
Béland) tells me that the Locarna agreement
is not in farce yet. What is retarding the
putting into effeet of that agreement? It is
the League ai 'Nations. with thase seven great
Powens. that stands in the way. Instead of
being a peacemaker it is a 'trouble-maker-it
is a war-maker. If the Locarno Pact is nat in
force it is because the League will not let it
came inta farce.
My riglit hanatirable friend (Riglit Han..

who prampted Brazîl? There may have been
others an the Cauncil who were nat in favour

why should they compromise themselves?
Why shaw their hand? Brazil wau fot oppased ta Germany*s entering, but wanted a

At the same time
Paland wanted ta came in, and sa did Spain.

has no sheriff to send. If the Protocol had
prevailed, the League would have had a

British Navy to go anywhere to enforce the
rulings. But the English taxpayers, with their

navy. We will send it, not when the League

Greece protested that she

of Bulgaria.
I do not believe fihere were

There were only a small

little row. And how can people fight wit.hout the means?
The great Napoleon said
that dn order to make war you must have
three things: the first is money, the second

Well.
neither of those nations had any money with
which to fight, and they had no credit with
which to buy ammunition. There could not
have been a war even if they wanted to
make war.
In the first place, they would
have needed some powder and shot, and that
ammunition they could not get on credit,
betause their credit was long ago exhausted.

fight against the admittance of Germany to the League,

The diplomats at Geneva feel that once more they are

Hon. L. C. WEBSTER: May I ask the
honourable member from what he is quoting?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN

(reading):

Were it not for the League of Nations, the Locarno
Treaty would now be an accomiplished fact. This
Treaty which was hailed as the greaitest advance in
history in the promotion of the peace of the world,
unfortuna.tely had a clause recognizing the League of
Nations, sud that clause has wrecked it. Under the
Tresaty of Locarno, France, Germany and England
liad found a way by whceh they could live together in
pence and work out their problems in a apirit of true
neighborliness. Had there been no League of Nations,
ail would have been welI. But as there is such a
League, Germany asked for, and was promised, membership in i.t. Inmediately the agreement was transferred from peaceful Locarno te warlike Geneva, all the
old hideous plots and jealousies reared their heads, and
Brazil, of all the nations in the woedd, became the
catspaw whereby Locarno was thrown lnto the discard.
Meanwhile ail sorts of off-shoots of the League are
functioning in its name and fattening off its revenue.
There is the International Labor Bureau, for Instance,
which, under that well known French Socialistie agitator, Albert Thomas is apending a goodly share of the
League's funds in ,promoting Socialism. Yesterday's
papers brought another side-line inito the lime-light, a
telegran from Geneva stating that Sir Austen Ohamberlain had told some committee or other of the League
to keep its meddlesome fingers out of other people's
business. The committee, it seems, had corne te the
conclusion that ail future town improvement schemnes
throughout this terrestrial globe must include swimming baths.

That is one of the decisions of the Labour
Bureau.
Evidntly Sir Austen thinks trouble will be generaýted fast enough by the mere existence of the League
without going out in active search of it.

even then giving promise of what it was later
to be, the greatest State of the Union in
population and wealth and influence, carried
the aceptance of the constitution by a vote
of 30 to 27. Fiske, the historian to whom I
have just referred, says:
But for Alexander Harnl-ton the deoision of New
York would unquetionab1y have been adverse tu accepting the constitution.

Although this process of adoption began in
1787, it was not until 1790 that Rhode Island,
the last of the States, flnally accepted the
constitution and completed the circle of 13,
without any one of which there would have
been no United States to-day.
Instance after instance coulId be given to

When I hear eloquent, forceful and discouragrng things said by the smiling gentleman across
the floor (Hon. !Mr. Casgrain) I always look
hack to what has happened in the past and
gain encouragement. Looking at the events
of the time in which we live is like looking
at the surface of the sea: sornetimes it is
fretful and disturbed; at other times it is
calm. It is not the superficial aspect that
makes for the peril or othcrwise of navigation, it is the deep undercurrents whicb are
running out of sigbt. It seems to me that the
success of the League of Nations depends on
whether the undercurrent of affairs is a real
vital desire of the nations for peace. In that
case the League will be succesfu1. If, on the
other hand, the desire for peace simply cornes
frorn war wcariness such as followed the
Napoleonic wars, then our League, which God
forbid, will have the fate of that devised a
,century ago by Metternich and bis associates.
Hon. RAOUL DANDUTRAND: Honourable
gentlemen, already this Session I have had
,occasion to speak of the events that took
place in Geneva in Marci last, and to reifer
to thc Locarno Treaty, so I do not intend to
cover that ground again. 1 sirnp!y wanut to
tell my honotîrable fricnd from De Lanaudière
(Hon. Mr. Casgrain) that thc League--it may
not be in bis time-will demonstrate its permanency. It is to-day in a state of experimentation. This organization has been founded
by sorne of the best brainis of our generation.
It bas been ifounded in, or-der to bring the
nations together. Before 1914 t'hey were aIl
working eseparately,
and we know what
bappened in that year. My bonourable friendt

at Versailles when thc Treaty was signed;
but of a sudden he met a friend who told
hlm t-here would always be war on this earth,
and from th-at tirne on he lost ail his
enthusiasm.
Thc TTeaty of Versailles wu~ signed in 1919.
We arc no'w in the year 1926. I realize 'that
we werc ail disappointcd by the United States
withdrawing fromn thc League, because the
United States would have been a splendid
disinterestced umpire in an-y dispute whicb
rnight ýarise between European states. Neyertheless, even without the United States,
Europe can still save itselif, and I think the
Locarno Treaty lias paved the way for that
salvation.
The great danger of the morrow is another
clash betwcen Germany and France. As the
rîght hionourable gentleman (Right Hon. Sir
George E. Foster) bas explaincd, Treaties
have been sign-ed at Locarno by whioh Great
Britain will stand witb Italy as umpire betwceu
Gerrnany and France, and I arn convinced
that their position will, be a deterrent to anýy
ambition on the part of cither of those states
against the other.
Undoubtedly sorne time will clapse before
disarmament to any degree is attained. We
have just corne -out of a formidable upheaval.
But I sec the day wben the United States
will .ioin the League of Nations, even thougli
that League may have to alter, to a certain
extent, its constitution. .Iust visualize what
that ivould me.an, bonourable gentlemen-a
world association in which the United States
would play a role. I arn convinced that no
first.-class Power would plot or engineer an
assault upon another nation wben it would
consider thc risk it would run, of baving every
other great Power opposed to it, including
the United States.
To,-day wc bave the nations of Europe prepared to nieet in Geneva in Septembe, to
confer over the difficulties of the day. We
have a, Council cornpot-cd of 10 delegates from
various parts of the world. including four of
the great nations of the world, and to-morrow
a fiftb, Gerrnany. My bonourable friend says
that Gerînany bad better be lcft out of thc
League.
That is pont the opinion of thbe
European countries which are the rnost. interested. Thcy feel tihat tbey would rather
have close contact with Germany than sec
her ourside attending to ber own affairs and
go verning berseLf witbout havinig any conference witbi the outside world. I believe that
Europe is riglîýt in tbinking that Germany

I think the

I desire to
mnove that this Bill, as ýamended, be put
down for third reading to-morrow, and I
would asic the Clerk to see that the Bill be

Hon. Mr. POPE: I do flot think that
to-morrow is the proper day. A great many
inembers of this Flouse go away to-morrow
afternoon. We will flot have the Bill printed
until to-morrow, and those who, like myself,
are deeply interested in it, want an opportunity of studying it. I would much prefer
Monday.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would not my
honourable friend compromise with me by
saying Saturday?
Hon. Mr. POPE: We are not going to
sit on Saturday, so I would not say Saturday.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would rather
say at the next sitting. If the Senate is not
ready to take up the Bill to-morrow it will
either go over until Saturday, if we eit on
Saturday, or Monday. It is not probable that
we wjil sit on Saturday, but I will know by
to-morrow noon.
Hon. Mr. POPE: I quite understand the
position of the honourable leader of the Government, and I know my own position. We
will not sit on Saturday; that may be information for my honourable friend.

CRIMINAL CODE BILL
OPINION 0F MINISTER 0F JUSTICE
SUGGESTED

On the motion for adjournment of the
Senate:
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: In connection with
the Criminal Code Amendment Bill, in
regard to which there wus a division taken
on the amendment as to giving the Grown
the right of appeal, it was stated by the honourable leader of the Government, in the
course Of debate, that the Crown had that
riglit prior to the amendment allowing appeals
in criminal cases. I have very grave doubts
about that, and I was going to asic the honourable leader if, when the Bill cornes up on
Monday, ho wou.ld ýbe good enough to furnish
the House with an opinion from the Minister
of Justice stating under what section the
Hon.

Mr. WILLOUBHBY.

Orown had the right to appeal before the
amendment allowing criminal appea.ls.
Hon. Mr. DA-NDIJRAND: I will do that,
and at the same time subeait the amendmenta
whioh the honourable gentleman suggested as
coming from. the honourable memýbes, from
Hlamilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch..Staunton).
Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: Has the honourable
gentleman got them?

OF BILL

Bill Y7, an Act for the relief of Joseph

Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Honourable gentlemen,
1 would move, with the leave of the Senate,
that rules Z3 (f), 24 (a), 24 (b) and 63, be
suispended in se far as they relate to this Bill.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It is flot my intention
to oppose this motion. but 1 had intended to
make a short statement to the Senate in
regard te it. 1 told the ýChairman of the
'Divorce Committee that as far as I was concerned 1 wouid help te, facilitate the Bill

reprt of the Committee wvas adopted here.
I hav~e no objection te the Bill being sent on

I have referred upon the Orders of the Day
being called.

On motion of Hon. Mr. Laird, the Bill was

DELAY 0F LEGISLATION
Hon. -Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
Before the

Senatç' adjrurns I desire to make a ýfew remarks
in reference te a matter that is flot on the
Hon. W. B. ROSS.

Order Paper. 1 refer to the Grain Bill, which
stands over for the evidence of the Grain
Coýmmissioners.
The honoureble the Chairman of the Committee tells me that hie has
been in communication with the -Commissio-ners, and tha.t they are te be here, I think,
to-day or te-morrew.

Hon. G. G. FOSTER:

To-morrow.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
Their coming
means that further consideration of the Bill
will be de'ayed ontil Monday.
With ail
possible resp ect for anybody who desires to,
h,-ar thosýe Commissioners. may I say that I d
net see how they can add te the record a tittie
of evidence that will 'ho of any service te us,
for the reason that those who are oppos'ng
the Bill are citing the statements made by
those Commýssioners in the Agricultural Coimmittee of the other House hast year. I am flot
instructed th-at those gentlemen have changed
their attitude; se everybod 'v who is oppos:ed
te the Blill has the benetit of that. The only
objection I have is that we are unduly delaying- the Bill.
Hen. Mr. DANDURAND: The complaint,
of my honeurahie friend comes somewhat late,
berause the House has de-cide«l that whien it
adjouros it wvill stand adjourned until Monday itftýernoon.
I confesgs thaýt I join with my honourable
friend in regretting any apparent ýdelay because there are uigly rumeurs in the newspapers as te dilatory tacties being adopted for
political purpo..es and te the prejudice of certain legishation.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I would agree entirely
wvith the complaint if it weýre simply that we
are delaving the Grain Bill; but there are new
claquses in t.he Bill, inicluding a very importanz
une affecting Moose Jaw.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER:
1 do net often
complain in this flouse, but I would hike te
protest again that although we have been in
session for nearly six meonthe. two very, Importa.nt Buis cannot take their regular course.
I do net altogether blame this flouse in this
mnatter, but I ido censure tihe Government. In
mv opinion, and I believe in the opinion of
this flouse, both the Farm Loan Bill and the
Grain Bill coul'd have 'been dealt with twe
months ago just as well as to-day. It is the
saine old sto-ry year after year. For my part
1 ýcannot understand why the Govemnment
Iea'der3-avd I do net care which party tihey
beleng te, whether Tory or ýGrit-do net bring
about a change of conditions. It was expected
that we woufld proregue before new, but we
are about te adjourn until Monlday next. 1
agree with the honourable gentleman who fhas

JUNE 25, 1926
just spoken (Hon. ýMr. Willoughby) thýat there
is notiiing to lie -gained by waiting for the
Grain Commisgioners; in my opinion, such
delay is entirely unnecessary. 1 would like to
aésk the honourable leader of the Government
in this Ilouse, a gentleman for w'hom I have
the very highest regard, why he, who likes to
do something in the interest of the country,
cannot change this êtate of affairs, when important Bille reach t7his Huse in thel'ast diays
of the Session, and are put off fromn day to day.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
0f course,
there is a rule ngainst referring to what bas
ta.ken place in a Committee, but miy bonouraTole friend knows 'that I did flot see the
necesity of calljng members of the Grain
Board; so that I should be absolved of any
responksbility for the delay that occurs.
Hon. Mr. SGHIAiFFNER: The honourable
gentleman is quite right. Hie wanted to go
on with this Bill; I recognize that.
'lon. Mr. DANDIJRAND: But since the
Committee decided that we should await the
arrivai of those gentlemen 1 had onily to
abide by the decision of the Committee. 1
was ready to go on with the Rural Oredits
Bill this afternoon. My honourable f riend
knows what has been suggested by my hionourable friend opposite, and I haël graciously
to yield and say Monday afternoon. We
will take the Rural Credits Bill then, and
1 hope we wil-1 dispose of it in the aîternoon; then we will examine the Grain Bill
in the evening in the Banking and Commerce
Committee, notice of the meeting of which
lias been given already by the Chairman.
As t-hese Bills are of some importance I
believe we can cope with them and decide
upon our course before Tuesday evening.
ýWilI an effort be made in the other Chamber for prorogation on Wednesday?
I do
not know, but if the other Chaimber is ready
on Wednesday, 1 hope t'hat we shaH- be
ready. If not, we will remain here a fow
djays longer, and do our work thoroughly. I
only regret, for the reasons I have mentioned, that this Grain Bill did flot come
out of Committee two or three days ago.
Hion. Mr. MeMEAN-S: Will the bonourable
gentleman inform the buse. what will
happexi if there is a change of 'Government
in the meantime?
H1-on. Mr. DANDURAND: Well, I generally wait to reaob the river before I think
of the way I will cross it.
Riglit Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER:
Honourab1e gentlamen, my honourable friend
lias not replied to the very reasonable

stricture of my friend behind me (Hon. Mr.
Sdh-affner), that we have been put in the
position that two of the most important
Bis have come from the Com'mons within
practically a few days of the time when we
may be summoned to leave this place. I
do not see any reason in the world why these
two Bis should not have been here two
months ago, instead of coming at the time
they did. That is where the initial error
lies-mi keeping important 'Bills so late. My
honourable friend agrees with me in that;
but when he intimates that there is a somewhat bad feeling in reference to the Senate
not putting these Bills through rapidly, I
would remark that if there is any ill4eeling
at aIl it ougbt not to be directed towards my
honourable friends bere and myself, or any
member of the Senate.
If the Senate is to be anytbing more than
a cipher, or to show any reason or warrant
for its existence, it surely must pay particular
attention to the legislation that comes front
the other House, and it must, in the interest of the country, set itself to the very
best solution of questions as they come, one
by one. If -the Senate is not to, be a cipher,
it must not relegate its duty and responsîbility to the background. The initial fault
lies upon the agency which neglects to get
these important Bills here in time to give
us an oppoxtunity for their proper consideration.
I take a little of the onus for asking the
members of the Grain Board to come down,
not beeause of the portion of the Bill which
is concerned with the amendment made, and
wbich we bave been particularly diseussing;
but the question on which I want some ligbt
is that of the erection of an Inspection Department at ýMoose Jaw. During ahl the time
that I was Minister of Trade and Commerce,
and had matters relating to grain under my
supervision, the Grain Board,' the Department,
the Government itself, and I think the very
best judges of the general interests of grain
production and marketing, did not favour the
erection of an inspection plant at Moose Jaw.
We thouglit the reasons for our decision were
very good; but now, all at once, there comes
a section in this Bill which goes back upon
that traditional and well-based poliey. If it
can be shown that circumstances have changed
so as to make that a necessary and beneficial
step for the general marketing of grain, I am
content; but unless that is done, I do not
want to vote in favour of it, and I consider
that the presence of the Grain Commissioners
is necessary in order to elucidate the matter.
The Senate adjourned until Monday, June
28, at 3 pa.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, I have a communication to make to
this Chamber. I will do so in the terms in
which it was made to the House of Commons
this afternoon.
The Hon. William Lyon
Mackenzie King made tjhe following statement:
The public interest demands a dissolution of this
House of Coiniunons. As Prime Minister I so advised
His Excellency the Governor General shortly after
ioon to-day.
His Excellency having declined to accept
ny advice to grant a dissolution, to which I believed
under British practice I was entitled, I immediately
tendered miy resignation, which His Excellency lias
been graciously pleased to accept.

Under those circumstances I have ceased
to act in this Chamber as a member of the
Government, which has gone out of office;
and, the situation being as it is, I move the
adjournment of the House.
Until when is the
Natura0ly,

The motion was agreed to.

Third Reading Bill 148,
of establishing in Canada

an Act for the purpose
a systein of Long Term

Mortgage Credt for FEarmers.-Hon. Mr. Dandurand.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Will the honourable gentleman take charge of this Bill?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: As it stands in my
honourable friend's name. I think it would
be well if he moved the third reading. That
would bring it before the House.
Hon. Mr. DANDURANID:
I move, seconded by Hon. Mr. Murphy, that this Bil
be now read a third time.
Hon. G. G. FOSTER: Honourable gentlemen, the changes that were made in this
legislation, as indicated b me the other day
before this House, are practically the important ones that come under two heads. 'One
was the limitation of 1 per cent for expenses
and so forth, with regard to the carrying on
of this Act that was placed in the Bill in
another Chamber; the other was the limitation imposed under an amendment proposed
by the honourable member for De Salaberry
(Hon. Mr. Béique), who said he thought that
all expenses, interest. and charges of any kind
in each Province which came under the operation of this Bill should be limited to the
Province. In that the Committee concurred.
Those are the two principal changes made.
Now, in order that we may understand the
Bill, I will read to the House the changes
made.
1. Section 3. A change was made in this
section to provide that the appointment of
the Canadlian Farm Loan Commissioner and
the other two appointed members of the
Canadian Farm Loan Board shall be "on such
terms and conditions as the Governor in
Council may prescribe."
When this section was under discussion it
was felt by the Committee that the man appointed as Commissioner, for instance, should
be specially qualified, and should possess
great experience and training in lending
money and general knowledge in order to discharge the duties of the position, and it was
felt that in the case of all the appointments

JUNE 29, 1926
under this section it should be lef-t ta the
Governor in Council ta prescrihe the details
of appointment and that there should be
some provision made for retiring an incompetent Commissioner.
2. Section 5. A change in wording was made
in the first sentence of subsection (1). There
is no change in substance involved.
Two slight changes in wording were made in
subseetion (2.), one being for the purpose of
making it clear that the capital stock shahl be
based on the amount of principal outstanding
on mortgages fromn time to time rather than
on the original face value af the mortgages
made and out.standing; the other being to
provide that shares in the capital stock may be
transferred at the option of the Board.
In
such a case as the sale of a mortgaged property to a purchaser satisfactory to the Board,
the Board might desire to continue the bcan to
the purchaser and to transfer to him the
vendor's stock in the Board.
As the Bill was draftcd the owner of the
stock would remain the awner although he
sohd his property, and it was feit that in case
of sale the new horrower should own the stock
and that the Board should have the right to
transfer it ta h-im.
3. Section 7, subsection (5). This subsection
was changed by striking out the limitation to
1 per cent on expenses of operation of the
Board. It was felt that the judgment of the
Board should be unfettered in fixing the provision ta be made in the mortgage interest
rate ta take care of the cost of operation.
6ubsection (6) was amended to provide that
the borrower shahl have the choice between
annual and semi-annual payments on the
mortgage.
The Corrmittee felt that the borrower was
the one who should stipulate with regard to
that.
Subsection. (M. An amendment was made
te provide that the borrower shail pay in
addition ta interest, aswSemenits and taxes, ahl
other charges the paynent of which is
necessary for the protection of the Board, and
if such payments are made by the Board interet thereon may be chargedi at a rate not
exceeding 8 per cent. In such event, if the
said paymient by the Board is nlot repaid ta
the Board by the borrower on the next interest date the borrower shail be deemed ta be
in default under the mortgage.
Subsection (8).
This subeection bas been
amended ta recognize the right ai the borrower
ta repay his ioan in whole or ini part
at any
time, inetead
of after five
ye-ars, as in the original Bill.
This privilege, however, wilh be subject ta regu-

30

lations not inconsistent with the provisions of
the Interest Act, which provid-es that the
penalty
o prepayment after five years
duration shail net exceed a three monthe'
bonus of interest.
The Committee had a good deal of di&cussion upon that question. Some thought it
was oniy justice that the Board when loaniing
money should know that it had been Ioaned
for five years and could not be repaid within
that time; but, after taking into consideration
the representations made an several occasions,
the Committee feit that perhaps a man borrowing money perhaps for ten or fifteen years
might have a gaod crop and might desire to
repay his boan within five years of the boan
and we felt that hie should have the right ta
do it.
Subsections (9) and (10).
These sections
were amended ta provide that the calling of
the boan for misapplication of proceeds by the
borrower, or upon sale ai the property shaîl be
at the option of the Board. The original Bill
made such action in those circumstances coimpulsory.
It was represented to us that a borrower
inight say: "I want ta borrow $1,000 or $2,000;
I am gaing ta buy so much machinery and pay
s0 many debts," and s0 on ;-and, as one of the
witnesses said, hie might go and buy an automobile. Under the Bibi as draited, that would
automnatically make the loan due. The Comnmittee fait that it should be lef t ini the hands
of the Commissioners to say whether the misuse of the money was of such a nature as ta
mae it necessary ta recaîl the loan.
4. Section 8. The number of members of
the Provincial Boaaxd provided for ini subsection (2) was reduced from llve te four, the
reduction being in the members representative
of the borrowers f roin two ta one.
There
was also a proviso added ta this subsectian te
the effect that until the borrowers can. be
organized ta make the nomination of a representative ta the Board practicable ahl the
functions of the Provincial Board may be exercised hy the three members nominated by
the Government af the Province.
Sonie thought this provision unnecessarythat, as the loans would be scattered about
throujghout the country, there wauld bc no
con.necting links between the borrowers, and
that it meant nothing; but the consensus of
opinion wae that at any time, when representations were made in a proper way, the
borrowers might weIl be given representation
on the Board af Management.
5. Section 9, Étubsection (1). This subsection was amended ta make it ehear that
the 25 per cent ai the net earnings ta be

.336

SENATE

allocated to reserve may be discontinued wheii
the reserve equals 25 per cent of the paid
capital stock, not including, however, the
initial capital. The section as originally drawn
wmîld include the initial capital.
A new subsection was added to the section
to provide that on foreclosure of the mortgage and transfer of title to the Board the
capital stock hield by the borrower in the
Board shaîl be cancelled and the amount p3id
thereon by the borrower forfeited to the
Board.
That is to say, the boan having- been repa'd,
there was no reason for the borrower being
the owner of that stock, and therefore the
Board would have the right to ýcancel it and
with it make up in a sinaîl way for a poorer
i nan.
6. Section 13. A slighit verbal change was
made in section 13 to make it clear that the
salaries of the staff of the Provincial Board
shaîl be fîxeit by the Farma Loan Board. The
wordinýg of the section xvas originally thaït the~
said salaries should be "subjeet to the approval
of the Board" which miglit imply that they
shýould be flxed by the Provincial Board
itself.
7. Three new sections have been inserted
after -section 13.
One providcs ihat the audit of the Board
and each Provincial Board shall bc made a
firm of chartered accounitants appointed by
the Governor in Council and that a copy of
the report of the accountants ou the annual
stateinent shail be laid hefore Parlianient.
The feeling was that the Board of Auîdit
should bceconîposed of the very best men,
and that their report should be laid before
Parliamient.
Another new section is to the effeet that,
so far as practicable, the shareholders in each
province shaîl gct the full benefit of the
operations of the Board in such province. This
will authorize the Board to give te the sharoholders in each province the benefit accruilg
from a, favourable loss experience by varyirig
the dividends payable to borrowers, provinces
and the Dominion on capital stock of the
Board tsub-scribed in respect of the boans ;n
the varinus provinces or otherwise as the Board
may decide. This will, it is believed,' provide
an incentive to the Government of the Province and to the borrowvers in the Province to
sedure sound administration
and careful
selection of boans.
That clause was discussed very thoroughly
by the Commnittee.
At flrst sight there
appeared to he seine objection that there
would be different rules and different rates
and different management in the different
Hon. Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

Provinces; but it Ivas felt that. if the usefutne-s o4 this organization wvas to extend beyond
elue or twc Provinces. some sort of encouragement, would have to be given to the borrowers
ou(s:de of those Provinces. Honou-rable gentlemen wÎll realize that different rates of interest
prevail in several of the Provinces of this
couni mv; thcy wiil realize that the ratio of
the expense in occ Province will be differer.t
froiii tat in a.nother, and that in -oine Proi 1:nues th(, bans may be scattered throughuut
the country. wxhile in others they will bc
grouped. There was also a feeling that i'xc
shcîîld do sonuething to bring in the organizatiens cf Provinces like Ontario, who have
taken the position that, they are well enouglh
off now. The answer of the Ontario officii
te the invitation to our meeting was "We are
not interested, we have an organization ce
ciii owu., our rate is satisfactory." The Coinnlittee knew that because of the rates pai-1
iii soine Provinces it would be very difficuit
Io get themi to corne
the seheme. They
borrow their mioney at a different rate; they
itet il froin municipal corporations and coinpanies that give it to the Province at a low
rate. and therefore they are able to boan il,
te the borrowers at a rate at, which we coîîîd
ot 'possibly hope to give it to themn under
this -chene. VWe alsoi felt that if the ComniIii~oner or an orgamization in a, Province
were prudent iii their Jea.ns, reasonable in flie
paymnn cf salarios, and successful in their
busine-ýs, they '.hould secure a benefit for thecir
borrcwers in that, Province.
T he third niew section provides that, except as nîay be othcrwise decidied by the
Governor in Council, the actions and decisions
of the Board shall ho deemed to bc within
its powers, and shaîl be conclusive against
ail interested parties. This section is designed to prof ct the Board from attacks by
persons, f.or political or other reasons, seeking
to establish the fact that the Board has in
soie transaction or other exceeded its powers.
It may hai e the effeet of avoiding vexatious
litigation which might do much to hamper
the suecess of the Board.
Section 15 was amended to provide that if
bonds of the Board arc purchased by the
Minister and repurchased by the Board, the
repurchase shall be at the same price as the
original purchase.
That was flot in the
original Bill or in the Bill as submitted to us;
but it seemed to us tixat it would be an adi antage to the Board in many of those
provinces, and that if they repurchased those
bonds they should be permitted to do so at
the rate et which they were soid.

mbt

JUNE 29, 1926
Section 16 was amended to provide that the
duties of the appraisers, inspectors and other
officers of the Board, as well as their remuneration and the termis of their employment, shall be subject to regulation by the
Governor in Council. That is to say, that
the recommendation would corne fromn the
orgapization itself, but that they could flot
go on and make contracts for 25 years, say,
with a man, or with a large number of men,
ini such a way as to destroy the usefulness of
the scheme and the committee thought that
they would be less likely to do so if they
were under supervision.
That, honourable gentlemen, is the list of
amendments made by the committee. They
were made after the most careful study, and
after we had the fullest opportunity of hearing experts in ail the branches that Were interested in the Bil. The Committee submit
these suggestions to the House for consideration with the best wîshes for the Bill, and in
the hope that if it hecomes law it 'will prove
to be successful in the Provinces that have
expressed the hope and wish that it should
lie passed.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I would like to
make a suggestion. When the question was
under discussion some days ago I suggested
that opportunity miglit be taken on the third
reading to put on Hansard some of the information that was laid before the Cornmittee
as to the amount of loans now outstanding
by insurance, boan and trust companies, etc.
together with the cost of administration; also
that the sarne statisties miglit be arranged
to show the cost of administration by Provinces, the amount of arrears in those
Provinces, etc. 1 had hoped that this in!formation would go on Hansard at the samne
time as this report, and thereby support
-many of the amendments which, have been
offered by the Cornmittee, more substantially
than would otherwise be the case. 'I would
like to ask the honourable gentleman who
has just spoken if lie lias that information to
give us, and whether hie could flot -give it to
us now.
Hion. G. G. FOSTER: I did not preparé
the statement as my honourable friend suggests, because I felt that we liad'had more
evidence produced before us that at first we
did not have any idea of receiving. 1 arn
nlot a.ble to give the information which my
hônourable friend desires, but there is neo
-reason why the staternent suggested 6liould
iiot lie prepared,. and I think we rnay be able
~to' put it before the Hlouse -to-morrow, althougli if -the evidence is priated, as I shall
move, it will not be necessary.

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourable gentlemen, in listening to the
evidence as it was given before the Coinmittee I feit that rnost of it was in its nature
unusual and ver>' valuable. We were attacking a new proposition, the establishment of
a rural bank outside of our general bankîng
system, and it was a new question for most of
us. A great deal of thought was given to the
matter, and a very careful examination was
made b>' various associations into the principles, methods and resuits of the working of
banks in other countries that were almost
similar to those proposed in this Bill. Most
valuable research was made, and statistics and
information were presented to us as to, the
experience of loaning associations in our
country, in the different Provinces, the principles upon whicli they' were formed, the main
objects that were carried out, the results in
the way of expenses, arrears, foreclosures, and
aIl the problems connected with them.
1 doulit whether man>' Committees had
more varietl and corAplete discussion of the
whole principle in reference to this problemi
than we had before that Comniittee.
It
mould be a pîýt> if that information should
be lost. I understood the Conimittee to
,have corne to the conclusion thýat the particularl>' teclinicail part of that evidence wouhd
bic prepared for us and made available to us
in print. This question is onfly -on the verge
at present, and àt will no doubt be before
this House and the other House man>' times
in future, and I th-ink the information given
to us will be a valuable source to have in
convenient forrn for future examination, and
study of cognate subjeets. My understanding
was that a careful selection should be made
of the most important evidence, which sliould
lie printed and put on our records. I may
add that several parties, men of large experience and- teclinieaj knowledge representing variaus associations, have expressed the
wish to have the evidence at their disposaI
for the ipurposes of comparison and guidance.
Hon. G. G. FOSI'ER: The Committee decided that we would have a number- of extracts made, !but-they fe'lt that without the
.ingtructions and concurrence of thig House
tliey woÛlid fot be justified in going to the

Hon. Mr. !M.IMEANS: As we are now on

read,-:
(5) If as a result of proceedings under any mortgage the titie to the property securing such rnortgage

gentleman who had charge of these Boards in
Manitoba and Saskatchewan was to thé effeet.
that tinie and titne again they had sold properties that had corne into their hands by
foreclosure. and had made a profit. 1 think
it wau the Chairinan of the Board fur, Manitoba who said that on several farms thet
he had receiyed after foreclosure there was a
profit of $20,000.
My honourable friend says that those men
areso badly in debt that they cannot redeeni
their property; but wbat 1 want to point out
is that aiter the man subecrihed and paid ini
say 8250, he receives no adVantage if thé
Board f oreclose for, enough te pay thein, the
legal charges and selling coots, and then want
to take aw&y the stock, which representa the
xnoney the man has paid.
Bon. Mr. DANDURAND: The clause waà
înuerted becaie 50 pet cent of thôse làndà
may be sold at à lus, and there muet be
sarne chance ta recallp the Board.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
'My bonourable
friend states that when foreclosure proceedings are taken the borrower loses ail interest
ln the property.
That i. not so. When a
sale is made of property uiider a power
of sale, if it realizes more than the amount
of the mortgage, the mortgagor bas a right
ta corne back and demand that money aver
and ahove the amount of the debt and costs.
I contend that the same rule would apply to
property sold by the Board. 1 do not wish to
push this matter to an extreme, but it seems
to me very severe, and very unfair to the bortewer if there is a surplus over the aimount
of the 13oard's dlaim, that he should alsa, lose
the amoUnt paid on the stock.

not to indulge, especialiy under a Bill of this
kind, thé, purpose of which is to help the

Hon. Mr. DANDUR-AND: The honourable
gentleman muet not lose sight of the .fact that,
in virtue of this Bill, the 5 per cent, plus the
dividend upon the stock representing that 5
per cent, goes to meet the last payments
due by the borrower at the end of the terni
of twenty or tblrty-two years. Therefore the
condition that is set in the Act does nlot
occur because of his failure to pay during the
time When that amount is available to him.
IJnder these circumstances the Committee feIt
that he shotild flot relnailh a creditor of the
Board, since be had been in default in hie
payments to such an extelit that the title
had passed to the Board.
Bon. Mr. McMÊANS: The simplest way
ta solve the difficulty would be, in drawing
your mortgage, to take a mortgage on the
stock and on the 'property. I do not like the
Word "f orfeited."
Hon. W. B. l«M. Honourable gentlemen,
I tb ink the honourable member froni Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. McMeans) bas not quite

the clause provideo:

The whole tbing is transferted to the Board.
There iras no trouble about the land: the
land would be vested in the Board. But what
about the stock? That question was raised
in Cbenimittee. The stock would be in the
borrower's naine: Itow -would the Board get

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I will not insist
upon the amendment. I desired simply to
point out to the House my view of the
matter. In answer to the honourable gentleman, I would say that the effect of my amendment, which I drew very hurriedly, was simply
that the stock would be held by the Board,
and, if the farm itself did not pay the mortgage in full, then all money applied on the
stock would be applied to the indebtedness.
That seemed to me only fair and equitable.
However, I withdraw the amendment.

I wish to move an amendment to this Bill,
and in explaining it I will try to be as brief

it is if, before reading it, I read a part of
section 8 of the Bill, which is printed at the
bottom of page 5:
Loans under the provisions of this Act shall not
be made in any province of Canada until notice of
intention to commence the moaking of loans in that
province bas been given by the Board in the Canada Gazette, provided that the Board shall not give
such notice until the legislature of such province
shall, by enactmnent, authorize, prescribe or provide:
(1) The subscription by the government of the
province to the capital stock of the Board to the
extent of five per cent of the total loans outstand:ng
at any tine in that province as such loans are issued;
(2) The establishment of a provincial board of
four members-

I need not read the rest of that section.
You will sec there that this Parliament has
had to call upon the Provincial Legislatures
for legislation in order 'to work out this Bill.
The amendiment that I propose could be
worked into that section which I have read,
but I dislike striking out words 'and putting
others in, if an amendment can. be effected in
another way, because this method is apt to
Hon. W. B. ROSS.

lead to complications.
I eau arrive at my
amendment by a new clause to be added at
the end of the Bill as section 18:
This Act shall not corne into force until a majority
of the Provincial Legislatures have enacted the legislation required by section 8 of this Act.

That is simple enough. Certain legislation
is demanded by section 8, and if the Bill stands
as it is, any one Province could set in operation the whole of the machinery provided in
the Bill, which involves pretty large sums of
money.
Now that the Bill has been reported,
I am not going to say anything about that
except to give an explanation of my amendment.
As a inatter of fact, I do not like the
Bill at all, and never did.
Some years ago
a Bill was brought into this House for the
purpose of assisting the Provinces in building
I voted on that occasion against
highways.
I thought then, and I think
my own party.
still, that where we have a federal system, with
subjects assigned to the Dominion Parliament
and others to the Provincial Legislatures, it is
a mistake for the National Government to be
intruding upon the functions and powers of
the Legislatures, or vice versa, or mixing them
up. The fact that we are invading provincial
powers is proven by section 8 itself. We have
not complete jurisdiction to enact this legislation, and therefore we have to appeal to the
Provinces.
I have that general objection to
the legislation, and if I had my own way
about it, I would never be a party to introducing it at all, but would leave it to the
Provinces themselves.
However, in this
world a man cannot have all his own way, so
he must take what he can get.
I have stated my objection to the mixing
up of juriediction. Some day or another there
will be trouble resulting from it. We made
up our minds not :to have a legislative union.
If we had, of course a proposition of this
kind would be quite in order, and the question of jurisdiction would not so often arise.
But, apart from these considerations, which
I think are serious-though I will net stress
them, as the Committee have reported the
Bill-I want to point out another feature.
From all we know about the matter, this Bill
is not needed. I had prepared for me a statement which I think is substantially in accord
with one made by witnesses before the Committee as to the work done by the Provinces
of Saskatchewan,
ýManitoba and Ontario.
Other information that I got, about the other
provinces, is incomplete and not of much
value. It appears that the provinces of
Manitoba and Saskatchewan have, between
them, lent a very large sum of money, between $9,000,000 and $10,000,000.

JUNE 29, 1926
The Province of -Saskatchewan reports a
revenue for the year 1924 covering ail operating expenses and depreciation and' leaving
a surplus of 364,000.' 0f this they transferred
to real estate reserve $30,000, and- there remained a net surplus for t'he year of $34,000.
The Province of Manitoba for the same
year shows a net profit of $57,725.
The Province of Ontario reports that there
wo a net surpluq of $15,641 on the operations
of the Board from its inception in the year
1921 to Octokber 3lst, 1924.
There are three provinces that are lending
money and are flot losing, but gaining by it.
I would like to know why this Parliament
interferes with the provinces at ail. Why flot
let them alone.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is, Manitoba and Saskatchewan?
H1on. Mr. ROSS: Manitoba and Saskatchewan. The Province of Ontario is on the
same footing; but, as we know, their representatives have refused to corne before our
Committee. They said they were .making
loans at 5ý per cent, and they aEked to be
excused fromn appearing and giving evidence.
I cannot speak for any of the other Provinces
-Quebee, New Bruinswick, or Nova Scotiaexcept to say that I have the statement of
good, reliable business men in those Provinces
that they know that their Governments will
not have anything to do with this Bill. 0f
course, those Provinces would have to speak
for themselves.
What I think woub-d be an improveiment on
titis Bili, and would partly meet rny objection
as to our interfering in Provin-cial jurisdiction, would he to provide that the Bill shall
flot corne into force until a majority of the
Provinces signify their intention of coming
under it. That wouid be some assurance t¶iat
at least a part of the people of the Dominion
of Canada wanted this legisiation.
I do not desire to prolong the discussion. 1
wilI hand to the reporter this memorandum
with regard to, the boans made in the different
provinces.
Memôrandum for Hon. Senator W. B. Ross
on Agricultural Credits in Canada
In a report on Agricultural Credit prepared by Dr.
H. M. Tory in 1924 for the Dominion Goveroment,
statisties are given for those provinces which administer arts offering financial assistance to agriculturists.
The information is brouglit down in most instances to,
the end of the year 1922. Activities in most provinces
bave fallen off since 1922, due to fonds net bemng
available from provincial sources.
The followinz atatistics by provinces, supplement
Dr. Tory's statements as far as information is available in the Bureau of Statistirs. Those in British
Columbia for 1922 are taken fromn Dr. Tory's report,
while -those for 1923 and 1924 are from tbe Public

during the year 1924:
"Applications for jeans were received during tbe

amount of 81,604,900, but, tbe report explains, as
the amount te be advanced te the board was limited
by the Legisiature te $500,000 for the year and as tbe
board waa requested te make advances for seed grain,
baij insurance premiums and fire insurance premiuxns
for a large nmnber of borrowers, tbe board preferred
te use its fonds for assisting our present borrowers
sud for tbe protection of our existing securities, and
as the anieunt required for these purposes was uncertain the board considered it advisable te cuitail its

Dr. Tory's report states that three acts respecting
Rural Credîts have been passed and are n0W i

under the name of the Manitoba Farro Lands Association. Up to Deceier 31, 1923, approxinsately j3,000,
000 had been loaned under this aot.
2nd. The Rural Credits Act is an set authorizing
the inaking of short terrm lans. In 1923, approxiînately
$3,000,000 was outstanding in boans of which at least

three-quarters were renewais of loans with ouotanding interest charges of approxirnstely $30,000.

What representations have we hiad against
thiL Bill la the Committee an Banking and

The represcntations made were
flot against the principle of the Bih, but
against the amen(lmcnt wbich Ivas put in by
the Houose cf ('ommons .declaring that the
Joan should. cost the farmer the actuai cost
of the money raised by the issue of bonds,
Plus a maximum of 1 per cent for cost of
operation, plus a certain percentage for passibIL losses. The Joan rompany representatives told us that it would be somewhat dangerous ta fix a maximumi cf 1 per cent te
caver the w'hole cost cf aperation, because
in their case the cost had been a fraction
above 1 pýýr cent. The Committee feit that
ful discret ion sbould ýbe given tbe Federai
Board te fix the rate cf interest, and in providing for that ive have practically removcd
ail the objections that wer.- made ta the Bill
mn the Committee.
Under the circumstances 1 regret ta say
that 1 cm unable ta agrea ta my honourahle friend's proposai te suspend the operatien of the Bill until fiva Provinces have
agreed te accept it. 1 know that Manitoba
and Saskatchewan are in urgent naed cf this
legisiation. Although Quebec may nlot take
advantaga cf it, althoogli Ontario may declare that it is standing on it own feat and
is lcnding money at 52' per cent and is not
interested in a iih authoriziog the lending of
moncy at 612 per cent,, I feel like taking the
broader vicw that with respect te two of the
Provinces cf the West where
there are
farmers that we have brought in, we have a
certain moral responsibility.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY:
Honeurable gentlemen, I shahl occupy your attention but a few moments. I do ot think it
is incombent upon me te take the position
of, or pretend te, be, the sole exponent of the
views cf the Western Provinces on this subjeet. On the other hand, I have taken a very
keen interest in this matter. Last year, in
this Ibuse and elscwhere, I have puhhicly
advocated a system cf farm Jeans.
The
honourable gentlemen opposite (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand) has taken wbat 1 think is a very
statesmanlike attitude: hie bas spoken from
the point of view cf a member from the greait
metropolis of Montreal and has expressed the
opinion that C'anada, as a whole should receive aur earnest consideration. I arn sorry
Hon, Afr. DANDURAND.

that I do net find myseif in sympathy and
accord with the ameedment proposed by my
bonoured Leader (Hon. W. B. Ross). With
his usual charming fýrankness, and without army
attempt at dissimulation or camouflage ha
bas told us where he stands.
I likae that
tude. Ha has told us tbat he bas neyer attibeen
in faveur cf the principla of intarlocking
lagisîctiva power as batwean the Provinces
and the Dominion, and if bis suggested
amendment is adapted it will certainly giva
the quietus to this Bill.
The honourable gentleman bas told us that
ha does net think the Province cf Ontario
wvill join in this measura. If it can gat money
cheaper than it can ba possibly ba lent in 1-he
West, it bas no objeet in doing se, and what
ha says in that regard is probably troc. The
honourable gentleman also says that ha is
credihly informcd by raputabla men frern the
Maritime Provinces that tbay will nat take
advantage of this legislation. That disposes
of four out cf the nine Provinces. It wou!d
be presumptian an my part te speak for the
Province af Qucbec, but I wauld La deligbted
te think that the Province cf Quebec would
came in if it bcd the option cf staying eut.
1 remember the honourabla gentleman froni
De Sclaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique) saying that
ba hoped that the provisions dealîng witb anather phase cf the Act would bring in the
Province cf Quebc.
I hape that mny Le
the case. By adopting the amendment moved
by my bonourable Leader, 1 tbink wa wculd
ha torpedoing the Act. 1 say, bonourable
gentlemen, if yeu da not want it ta came
into farce at al], pass the amendment and
the Act neyer will coma loto force.
The partieular system of rural credit under
this 1B111
docs net appeal te me very much.
In my opinion it is net at all on ideal systeni.
Howaver, it is a system of rural credits, and
it is better than nothing, and I think haîf
c loaf is Latter than ne brccd.
The demand for rural credits did oct criginate in the Province cf Ontario, although
cpparently there was such a dcmand in that
Province that the Governoîent cf the day
cdopted what is virtually a systeinocf Goveroment boans and that systema bas been sanetioned and carricd. on by the succeeding
Governmant.
The svstemn propased rioder this Bill is immeasugirablv removed from the American
systern, wbich, with certain adaptations, is I
tbhink, a Latter sysem fer this country. Another provision which vitally affects the operatien cf the Act is clause (b), wbich bas been
read te, yeu and explained by the very able
Chairman cf the Ccmmittee.
This clause
is an ahsolute departure from the fondamental
principia cf the Act.
The Bill as originally

JUNE 29, 1926
introdueed by the late Government,-perhaps
at the instigation of the Progressives--I care
not whom-contemplated that the rate of interest should ha uniform throughout, Canada.
That was fundamnental.
Then we proceeded to make the 'legisiation
very much less desirable, I think, by dividing
the country into water-tight compartmaents.
The Provinces will be the units, and the rates
of interest may vary in the different Provinces.
In this there bais been a radical departure
from, the Bill as introdViced.
I live isi the
West, and know someth'ing of conditions there

I want to.say of the Chairman of the Committee, of which I happened to be a memnber,
that he, with his usual fairness, provided everybody -vith an opportunity of presenting his
view. But when a great public measure of
this kind, is under consideration, may I be
permitted to say that I think we shoiild have
called before us nlot on.ly those opposed to the
proposed legisiation, but also those in favour
of it.
Vested interests somnetimes become
vested wrongs. I do flot say that was so in
this case, but ýi merely malke the suggestion
that the Cornmittee, which was one of the
most efficient that I have ever seen, might

and elsewhere. This opens a view of the
progress that we may expeet from that part
of the country.
As a resident in the eastern part of Canada,
I sometirmes find that Our western friends are
somewhat exacting, but I think they are entitled Vo the sympathy df eastern Canadians.
I have so expressed myse'lf in Committee. I
would go a long way to, satisfy Vhemn in any
reasonable demand, and I think that course
would be the best Vo promote national unity
ini this country.
I might say, in passing, that I hýad made
up my mind to make a suggestion during this
Session which possibly might help national
unity. If 1 arn here next Session I propose
to do se, but our Session has been sa, short.
and so abnormal in some respects, that I did
not Vhink it was the proper âime Vo make my
suggestion.
Now, what evidence had we before the
Committee? We learned that, as far as Sa--katchewan is concerned, that Province has
been able tVo ban $10,000,000, and it could
have loaned $50,000,000 or $100,000,000. That
shows that it had flot enoughcapital to
meet ail the requirements. .We were told
that for the last two or three years the organiza 'tien in Manitoba was able Vo obtaîn
fromn the local Goverament only the paltry
sumn of about $500,000 a year, when there
were demnandas for millions. i think we had
evidence Vo the effect that in Alber'ta the
Government is not now in a position Vo
supply the necessary capital to provide for
these long-terma lans.
Agriculture in the West hus become a
greater fe-ature than in 'the East, and has
grown to be a real live industry that requires
capital to properly feed it. I think it is but

SENATE

Thse honourahie member f.rom Moose Jaw
(Hon. Mr. Willough.by) bas criticized clause
B of the Bill, for which I arn responsible.
Knowing the sound judgment of the honourable gentlemana, 1 speak with a great deal o.f
diffldence, but I cannot accept his view as to
the eff'ect of that clause. I think that this
amendment (b) wiIl facilitatle the joining of
the eastei'n Provinces in this schemne, land
that it is only just. The honourablie gentleman spoke of the United States, and his
references w*ere very fair. The faot tha-t the
farmers in the United States have organizati.ons of this kind is a good reason why we
shauld try to h-elp in the creation in Canada
(if a similar organization. which would tend
to reduce the rate of inte'rest. As the honourable gentleman Nvill no doubt agree, the cost
of operaition will be much reduoed by a large
volume of loans, and the scheme, by providing
for long-term boans, wil'l have the el!ect o',
inducing thrift in -the country. The honourable member losee isight of the fact that in the
United States, where there are a number of
organizations of this kind, made up -of diffe-rent banks, the rates of interest are flot at al
uniform. In soTne States the rate is 41 or
443, whi'le in other States it is k- per cent.
My objlect, in draîting t.hat clause was to
make the Bill as flexibýle as possible. The
clause does not, necessarily mean that rates
of înterest woul.d be diffeen in the different
Provinces. They rnay be the same if the
Board ,dee.ms that advisable, because in the
leastern Provinces the differencc of interest
will -be made up -to a certain extent by the
dividends .received.
1 think that what we
should look to is principally the creating of
a acheme whicb will app-eal to aIl the Provinces and be the means of ýreducing t.he cost
of operation.
This ean be donc only *by
making the boans so large in volume that
instead of the cost of operation heing 1 per
cent it may be reduced to ý per cent, as we
were toid is taking piace in somei Provinces.
Right Hýon. Sur GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Wil-l ýmy honourable ýfriend allow a question?
In the Committee, as boere, I gave aIl possible
credit to my honourable friend as to his intention in moving this amendment, wh'ich
cirried in the Committee. But 1 wish to
ask this question ere you have one body
ioto which both Dominion and Provincial
monýey goes; it is sufficient for the moment
to con-sider !that Dominion money goes into
it. Now, if the branch of that body in Saskatchewan uoffered a boan -of 31,000 at a certain
percentage, could the similar body in Quebec
Ho2I.

Mr. BMIQUE

or Ontario offer a boan at some l'ower rate, say
7 or 6 per cent? If sol does that flot iminediateiy -cause discontent, and i-aise the
question: "Here is a Dominion subvention
going into a seheme, and money is loaned out
to lar.mers in one Province, who arc charged
so muah, whi-le fai-mers in another Province
are charged so mueh less." Now, wi'll you
put th-e rate a-t exactly the saine figure in one
Province as you wild in another, so that the
farmers -i the variou8 Provinces will be put
on an equal.ity -as Il Tate of intercst? If my
firot question is anewered in the affirmative,
I have my answer on that point; but, ail the
same. the diffieul-ty witb me, if I arn right
î.n my impression. is to sec how the scheme
will be worked out so ns to, be equalized. and
flot cause discontent in the différent Provinces.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: As I stated a moment
ago, that condition of things--the difference
of interest-has been dealt with in the United
States on a large scale, and the plan bas
flot oreated discontent.
I have flot the
figures by me, but I could give them. I hope
that the Board wibb see its way to make
the ratc uniforma, and flnd the means of
securing, through dividends, the equality or
fnirness which should be applied to ail the
Provinces. I do not expeet that it wibl be a
cause of discontent.
The object of my
clause, as stated in the clause itself, is to
make it the duty of the Board te work out
this scheme equitnbly for ail the Provinces.
Nobody can take exception to that. There
is a common interest, which is the reduction
of the cost of operation. There is another
common interest, which is the retention of a
large arnount of capital to satisfy ail the i-equirements of the several Provinces of the
Dominion. I think that should make for
unity, and for satisfaction of ail parties concerned.
Rigbt Hon. Sur GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Now that my honourable friend has answered
both nîy questions, I sec bis point. I only
hope that, when the Board cornes to work
out that method by which the equalization is
done, they will have the services of my
honourable friend at their right hand.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Honourable gentlemen. I do flot care to vote on this Bili without first telling the House what I think. There
is no member in this House who bas a monopoly of sympathy for the Nortbwest. For
my own part, I look upon Canada as Canada,
not Eastern Canada or Western Canada.
Anything that helps out any one part helps
the wbole. But so far as this kind of legis-

JUNE 29, 1926
lation is concarnad, I have xny doubte; it is
patarnal legislation, I think, and not of a good
Oort.
Sa far as 1 know the Provinces, and I

differenca in the rate for boans made by the

ba a batter systese for each of the Provinces
ta attend to its awn wants in relation ta the

Canada is lookad upon as a cow that produces maney. Such persans give no thought

minion, I have my doubts about the result.
Same fears hav4Q been expressed that thera
is no chance ai ail the Provinces giving this
measure their support. It has bean intimatad that several Provinces will not corne
into the seheme; and if they do not corne
in, that appears ta me ta 'ha a block against
the passage of the Bibi.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Block, or blet?
Hon. Mr. GORDON: Both. It has beau
stated here, and I heard it aiso in the Coininittee-although nlot a memxber of that Coinniittee I was present-that billiona of dollars more could ha lent in the We.qt than
were being lent One gentleman said that if
they had $100,000,000 they eouid lend it out.
I ask rny honourabie friands here, particularly
those wha have anything ta do with the loan
business, if that situation is not reflected al
ovar the Dominion of Canada and avery
othar country in the world. It is a very
simple thing ta lend monay; it is as easy as
falling off a log; but getting it ail back is a
differant thing. A witness before the Cornmittea said that by landing out $100,000,000,
as they could have done, the cost of handling
the rnonay would be vary mucli reduoed. I
agree that ha is correct if thera are no lassas;
but yen ail know what happens with banka

347

and other institutions who lend money recklessly or place it s0 that it is impossible f or
themn to get it back. 1 believe that the
reason why the provincial govemnments have
not handed out nmore money through t.heir
own lending organlzations is, nlot that the
tnoney la nlot available, for, as we ail know
very weil, they can command millionis to-day;
but the reason why they are nlot lending out
millions of dollars is that they know a great
deal of the money would be hard to recover.
They know that, but 1 arn sorry to say that
there are many persons in Canada who apparently thlnk that so long as the money
cornes out of the Faderal Treasury it does
not matter whether it ever cornes back or neot.
1 think that the sooner we taka a detached
position and look at these things from a
purely business point of view, the sooner will
Canada get upon its feet, and the sooner will
our taxation ha reduoed.
I have a rather peculiar feeling over this
situation which has arisan from the amendment introduced by aur honourable leader
MHon. W. B. Ross). I did nlot anticipate that
amandment; I knaw nothing about it; but I
intend voting for it, because, even if this
Bill Is killed, whila tha West might regard our
action as unsympathetie, I believe that eventuaIl it would turn out ibetter for both the
East and the West. At the same tîme I arn
not sure that under the circumstances I would
like to do anything to kili the Bill.
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: Honourable
gentlemen, having been forced to deoline ta
permit my nama ta be recorded as that of the
seconder of the motion, 1 should say why.
Briefly, my reasons are these. The Provinces
are units which are recognizad in many
respects, and ought, to ha recognized, 1 think,
in this instance. My mind goas back ta
twenty years ago, and the conditions then
prevailing in the West. Every year during
the last twenty I have beeu privileged to visit
Western Canada. 1 made my first littie investment in the West twenty years ago last
month, when interast was at 12 per cent in
that part of the country. Thera was a strip
of practioally virgin prairie 400 mniles wide andc
300 miles long, and that had ta 'ha developed
by capital from the outaide, becauee capital
did not exist within ta tarritory, novw coinprieed in the three Prairie Provinces. To my
mind this legisiation eimply extends the credit
of the Dominion of Canada ta the people of
those three Prairie Provinces, who are young
and who have not as yet within their own
houndaries the capital necessary for the. carrying on of the necassary development.

Hon. Mr. GORDON: Would the bonourable

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I will come to
that. Therefore it is proper that the Federal
Government should do what it can to, assînýt
those thrce provinces juist as it should do
what it can to assist any other part of Canaîda
by extending credit. My bhonourable friend

Surely Canada mucst be regardedHon. Mr. CORDON: May I ask the
bonourable gentleman a question?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Will my bonourable friend pardon me? No one interrupted
bim. I will answer the honourable gent'mians,, questions later. Surely the Dominion
of Canada. nmust be regarded as a unit, so far
as Dominion legisîntion is concernied. In this
legislation, as in many othcr measures enacred
in years past, especially in recent years, it is
intended to offer aid to the provinces ini
carmg on work necessary to them, tboughi
pirhaps more necessary to one province than
another. The Technical Education Act, the
Gond Ruads Act, the unemploynîent assistance
that was given in 1920, during those few years
of buiîoness deprcsion-aIl were Acts of the
Federal Parliament to assist the people of
the provinces to meet their special needs as
conditions proved to be- necessary. I feel that
the same principle is embodied in the Biîl
00W before, this House.
I beartily endorne,
and intcnd to support, the recommendeïin
of the Comnmittec, becaunýe it. was arrived at
after înost careful investigation. I do sincerCl'y
object to the idea of dc.claring- that we mîint

Hon. Mr. GOR'DON:
My bonourable

Hon. J. S. MeLENNAN: Honourable gentlemcnn, the course of this discussion seems to
show the inconvenience, even wbere tbe idea
is to gain time, of having a Bill go te Committee without, our discussing its principle.
Here we are in the final stage discussinig the
principle of tbe Bill after very careful atte-ntion bas been given to the details of it. It
bias heýen thoroughlly well
thought out in

this Bill is a .iudicious and proper one.
I am net going overthe series or arguments
aeains.t the Bill. I wvould like to say, in pass
îng, that, the amendment just moved hy the
honnurable meinher fromn Middbeton (Hon.

malignant desire on bis part to injure some
of otir fellow citizens, or a certain degree of
ignorance; but I de not think any of us
would attrihute tobim. cîther one, or flhc other.
Here is a Bill provîding for assistance te those

really need it invoives a certain expenditure
on the part of the other Provinces. Though
assistance may be needed main]y by two
Proviinfee the serven other Provinces pro tanto
must contribute tbrough the Dominion
Treasury for the support of this schemie. It
does not seem. to me at ail unreasonable that
before the proposed contribution is made
fromn the Dominion Treasury to the Pro-vincial Treasuries the majority of t!he Provinces
6should be in favour of that aid, and should
want it. Apparently six or seven of the Provinces will have to contribute. for the benefit
of the fewer number of Provinces who reaiiy
want this aid or some assistance in carrying
out scbemes which. they aiready have. 1 feel
that the honourabie member for Middleton
is net making an unreasonabie dlaim in bis
nWotion. With ail the sympathy which everybody 'bas for the West, 1 think it is a question whe'ther the proposed plan is not an improvident method-a mnethod ba6ed on faise
premises as to the relations between the
Federal Parliament snd the Provinces.
It is not a question of taking up details.
For example, we had one honourable member,

for which the boans sbouid be approved and

provides that the proceeds of a boan may be
used for the purchase of land, fertiiizers, seed,
live stock, farmi buildings, etc., for the disýÉharge of liabilities already accumulated, and
for other purposes. Well, with the exception
of land and prohably drainage, there is not one

provide not only for the purchase of land and
the erection-of buildings, but aiso -for the purchase of live stock. We have been advised
in Western Canada, and, I think, quite properlýy, especially since the depression in wheat
raising in recent years, that the farmers in
order to stabilize agriculture shouid engage
in mixed farming as mudi as -possible, particuiarlv in districts where it can be profitably
practised. That part of the Bill- appeals ta
me very strongly, because I believe that if
agriculture in the Western Provinces is ta
develop properly, mixed farming must be
adopted, and under present conditione it is
almost impossible for fariners to secure fromn
the banks or f rom the ordinary boan companies
the assistance necessary for 'the purehase of

that respect it will greatly enihan«ce the wealth
of Western Canada and of Canada as a whole.
I do not kuow whether honourable Senators are aware of the fact that the province
of Alberta, wisich twenty years ago, at the
time it became a Province, was importing
most of its dairy products, is to-day exportir.g dai'ry produets not only to other parts
of Canada, but acroas 'the Atlantic to Great
Beitain and algo to Asia. In dairy production
it stands to-day as the third Province in the
Dominion of Canada. This progress is due
to the fact tbat the farmers in Alberta have
adopted mixed farming in most districts.
There are other sections where probably the
loan companies have made thei'r greatest
losses. While I sympathize with the boan
companiies, I think they didmake a mistake
in being too -free with their 4oans in, areas
where agriculture had not been-fully established. The bulk of their boans have noV been

have been able to carry on and meet their
'obligations, nlot -becausa they confinad theinselves to the raiýing of wheat, but because
they had cattie and hogs and other live stock
ta depenri on. Sa I say that if this measure
encour-3ged the farmar la no other respect
than in the borrowing of money for the purchase of live stock, it will assist in the developinent of mixed farming in Western Canada, and will add to the wealth of Canada
as a whole. I arn very strongly in favour of
the Bill primaiiiy on that accounit, and would

of the first elements. Now, under thie sicheme
are we meeting th-at dennd?
The second clament that we should bear -in
mind is that we are adopting a new princi-ple
in meeting the demand. Up ta the present
turne we have had loan companies operating
in thac Western Provinces and lending money
ta the fariner an a certain percentage of the
value of his praperty and for a term of three
or five or six yaars. Under that systein there
are due each year interast payrnents and certain instairnents of principal. Everyone who
hag livad in that western country knows the
difficulty the farmars have ta contand with in
sections whara conditions are nlot as stable
as thay are in othar parts of Canada. They
have difficulties in meeting nat oniy their

GRAIN BILL

REPORTED FROMI STANDING

OOMMITIIE

Hon. G. G. FOSTIER presented the report
of the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce on Bill S, an Act to amend the
Canada Grain Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, before I
submit to this Chamber the report that has
been made «by the Banking and Commerce
Committee, with regard te what îs commonly
known as Bill No. 8, to amend the Grain Act,
I am asked by the Committee to make to
this Chamber the following explanation.
Immediately after this Bill was referred to
the Committee we met and decided upen
securing a certain line of witnesses in order
that the Committeo might ho apprised of
certain important features of technical and
other evidence, with whicli they were net
famildar. We have held ton sessions, which, it
is only fair to say, have beon attended
diligently by a very large mai ority of the
members of the Committee, and a large num-~
ber of niembers of the Sonate who are not on
the Committee, showing general interest in
the line of evidence that was adduced. Having
in mind the interest thst was taken, and the
short timo that there ia beforo prorogation,
the Committeo decided that it was practically
impossible te place bof ore this House in printed form the evidence that was brought
bof ore it, and that it should leave te those
who are advocates 'for and against the Bill to

3W3

explain to this Chamber the details of evidence
that was considered important for their consideration.
The following witnesses were examined by
the Committee at the ton sittings, giving their
views for and against this legisiation, and
explaining to the Committee the practices of
the grain trade with regard to shipping and
marketing, as under the former Acts, and
the Act now in force, and also the effect of
the proposed legisiation:
Mr. T. J. Murray, Barrister, Winnipeg,
representing The Western Wheat Pools.
,Mr. Robert Magill, Secretary, Grain
Exchange, Winnipeg.
Mr. Colin H. Burnell, President, Manitoba
Wheat Pool.
Mr. Isaac Pitblado, Barrister, Winnipeg,
representing the Grain Trade.
.Mr. James Dougail, representing the Canadian Pacifie Railway.
Mr. J. G. Rosa, M.P. for Mooso Jaw.
Mr. John Evans, M.P. for Rosetown.
Mr. W. R. Fanaher, M.P. for Last Mountain.
Mr. John Vallance, M.P. for South Battlef ord.
Mr. H. E. Spencer, M.P. for Battle River.
Mr. Leslie H. Boyd, Chairman, and Messrs.
Matthew Snow and James Robinson, Commissienera, of the Board of Grain Commissioner..
On clause 1 of the Bill, the point at issue
between the parties may ho briefly summarized as follows:
The farmers' organizations dlaim that under
the law in existence prior to 1925 any farmer
in the Prairie Provinces who wished te ship
a carload o.f grain had the legal right te
select any terminal elevator to which. that
grain should be .shipped. They also claîmed
that in practice they exerciaed that right to
a considerable extent. On the other hand they
dlaima that by the amnendment passed to the
Grain Act last year, the farmers of Western
Canada were deprived of that right. By the
Bill now under consideration they come again
te Parliament and ask that the rights, which
they dlaim were previously enjoyed by them,
ho reâtored, and that the draft, Bill submitted
to Parliament lest session by Mr. Justice
Turgeon, Chaîrman of the Royal Grain Commission, should become effective.
On the other hand, those opposed to Clause
I of the Bill, contend that under the legislatien in existence prier to 1925 the farmers
did not have the legal riglit se claimed, and
that the practice whereby farmers designated
the terminal elevator te which. their grain was
sent, was only exerciaed witheut legal right
and to a very limited extent. They further

14015--23
REVISED EDITION

354

8BENATE

dlaim that the legisiation of last session on
this point rnerely conflrmed the rights the
elevator companies bad hitherto enjoyed.
They now bold that clause 1 of Bill No. 8
should nlot be approved because they believe
that if passed it will give to the farmers of
the West a statutory right which they did
nlot cnjoy.
The farmers dlaim that as a matter of
public policy and in -the interests of the
grain growers they should have the rigbt to
control absolutely the handling o! their grain
with a view io securing the largest possible
return therefrom. On the other hand, the
Grain Trade take the view that, as there is
invested sorne eighty-five million dollars in
country elevators, terminais and other plants,
if this legisiation passes, this investment wil
be prcjudicially affected.
The Cornmlittee, having corne to the conclusion to report the Bill without a recornmendation in reference to clause 1, decided
that the saine course should ho adopted as
r(,gards clause 2, and that both clauses sbould
be left te the decision of the Committee of
the wbole flouse.
The evidence which was adduced hefore the'
Cornmittee vwas, as honourable gentlemen will
understand. of a highly tcbnical character,
besides ernbodying differences of opinion. On
general lines tbe Committee felt that those
in favour of and those opposed to the logislation will be able, in the best possible manner, wvith the advantagc of the evidenco tbh1 t
lias been adduced before them, to place before this flouse and the country tho essential
features of the evidonco that was produced.
and upon which this Chamber must base its
decision for or against tbis legislation.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY:
Honourable gentlemen, the Cornrittee having made
nu recommendation, 1 intend, after consulting with the honourable leaders of the flouse,
and after being advised of the proper procedure, to move that theo buse go into Committee on the Bill. Before 1 sit down I shalh
make that motion. In the meantimo 1 want
to discuss the matter a littie in the flouse.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 'Could not the
bonourable gentleman wait until the Bill is
referred to Committee of the Wbohe?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
1 tbink that
if I discuss it now we shahl be able te speed
it up a little, because you will have heard
whatever representations 1 may advance, however inefflciontly, on behaîf of the Bill.
We have had the pleasure and great advantage of a very fulhl discussion in the Committeen
We have heard the views of the
organized grain trade, represented hy the
Hon.

Mr. G.

G.

FOSTER.

Secrotary of the Grain Exchange and by my
friend Mr. Pithlado, who dazzled us by the
enormous number of grain companies and
grain institutions tbat ho represented. and
for whom I have ne hesitation in expressing
very bigh admiration and respect. That high
admiration of the argument of Mr. Pitblado
is such as to imply that he could win in anything. Such are bis gifts as an advocate, that
I would he willing to entrust even the worst
case to him, and I would find it well presentod. Hie bas gone on the assomption, and
made the repeated assertion in bis legal
pleading, that the new Act virtually only confirrns what was intended hy the existing Act
of 1912, and be anahyzed the sections to showv
that tbe farmers nover did enjey by law-and
he amplified bis argument to show that tbey
neyer enjoyed in practice-tho rights that
existed unider the Act of 1912.
Now. witb tbe permission of the Hlouse, I
propose to analyze the sections that are
operative under the o'ld Act and~ in the new
Act, and te subrnit the conclus.ion that tbe
law is not as laid down by Mr. Pithiaýdo at
ah! that in any event there is h*eyond peradventure another interpretatioil of the law
justifying the position taken by the farmors.
I :sibrnit that the law goes furtber, and
absoluteIy justifies tbem in that position.
I arn going to analyze tbese operative
sections. Honourable gentlemen are ail pretty
familiar with tbem now, because we bave bad
the %-eryIu(id argument of Mr. Pitbiado, and
also the propaganda of the grain trade. I may
just. say, in passing, speaking in the bearing
of members of this flouse, that altbough I
have bad the honour of thjs Bill being entrusted te me, it was net an honour or responsibility wbi ch I sought, and 1 assumed it
only after strong pressure, and since that time
I have nlot canvassed any member of this
flouse on the Bill. I took charge o! it on
the express condition that I would present the
view of the promoters, but that I intended
personalhy tu use nu influence on behaîf of
the Bill, leaving it absolutehy untrarnmelled,
and te ho deait with only in accordance with
the views -of the flouse.
Now, section 159 o! Chapter 27, Statutes
of 1912, is the governing section. Subsection
2 provides, that the receipt, tbst is, the warebouse receipt given te the person delivering
the grainShail state upon itê face that the grain mentioned
thereini bas been reejved into store, cand that upon
return of such receipt andi ujpon seytnent or tendier of
pa3,7ent osf aIU Iawfuf Charges for Teceiving, storing,

-now we corne to the option questionOr, if elther party so desirea, in quanbtities not lma
than. casoad lots, on track et any terrainéd elevaitor in
the Western Inspection Division, on the lUne of railway upon which ste receiving country eqevator le aituate, or aiw line connecting therewitii, an aoon as the
transportation contpanly ddsvera te esne at sai
tein,ml, and bte certifleate of grade axai weiglit is
retumed.

On that point 1 wisb to emphasize the
language of the governing section of the
statute of 1912, which I have just read to you
in part:
Or if either party o desirea, in quan-tities not leva
than. csrload lots, on track evt any terminail elevator-

-lot at "a" terminal elevator, but at "any"
terminal elevator.
Subsection 3 provides that in the case of a
country e!evator on the line of railway
formerly known as The Northern Pacific and
Manitoba Railway, or on an-y line of railway
that was known as The Grand Trunk, if either
party desires such grain to be shipped to a
terminal point, it may be d.elivered on track
at the praper terminal elevator at, or adjacent
to the harbour at Duluth.
Subsection 4 provides that nothing 4therein
shall prevent the owner of such grain, at any
ti.me before it is shipped te terminaIs, from
requiring it to be shipped to any other terminal
than as herein before provided.
These sections contain the option. Whatever this argument be worth, it is my own,
and bas been submitted to nobody, even -the
people whomn 1 represen't, for their suggestion.
The argument on behai of the grain trade
is, in short, that the farmer has the right to
select the terminal elevator point, but flot
the terminal elevator. It is submitted that
the interpretation placed by the grain trade
on this section is flot the true interpretation,
and if the true in'terpretatiou-which is flot
admitted-it was, in practice, flot the only
interpretation. First, there is an eleetion given
te the shipper, under the words "or, if either
party so desires". It is submitted that that
election bas flot only to do with the choice
of a terminal point, but also a terminal
elevator. The language is wide enough to
bear suob an interpretation. It 'will be noticed
that it provides for deliv-ery after the election
is made, in quantities flot less than, car.load
lots, on track, at any terminal elevator. It
did flot jntend to regtriet the generality of the
right given, to the farmer, or shipper; otherwise, the language is flot appropriate, and the
restriction Lshould have be-en te "a" terminal
elevator, and flot "any" terminal elevator. I
1403--23à

3M5

submit -that the use of the word "any" in connection with the terni terminal elevator, as
under the proper construction of the wordis,
presupposeà the right of eitber party to a
choice, on behaif of the shipper, te select bis
terminal elevator, and the obligation of the
comapany is flot discharged by delivering it
at an elevator otber than that selected by the
farner.
Under subsection 3, above quoted, the
language again ie such to bear out thbe argument that I -have advanced. It provides thaï;
if either party desires such grain to be
shipped te a terminal point, it may ho
delivered on traok at the proper terminal
elevator, at or adjacent to Duluth. That io
the language when you corne te, Duluth or
anotber point. It will b., noticed that the
words "proper terminal elevator" are used.
If the election of the shipper waà confined to
a terminal point, and witb no rigbt te name
the elevator at, tbe terminal point, thefr tbe
introduction of the termi "proper terminal
elevator" is unfitting, and the word "proper"
should be struck out, and it would. appear
that it might be delivered on track at
terminal elevator at or adjacent to Duluth.
lI the language of subsection 3 of mection 159
the grain la to be shipped te a terminal point.
The language is not "st a terminal elevatos9'
but "at a proper terminal elevater." What
does that mean? I submit tbat it is the one
selected by the farmer at the beginning,
bearing out the interpretation put on the
earlier cl ause: "or if eéther party so demiree/'
It was said by those arguing on behalf of
the grain trade, that that bore out section
169. The form of warebouse, receipt given
te the shipper is te, be f ound. in ferm "B"
for storage of grain, not grain net specially
binned. Formn "C' provàdes for spe'cially
binned grain. Form "A" provides for warebouse receipts for cash grain, and does not
enter into the argument because we are dealing only with carload lote. It will be found
on eamination of tbe storage receipt, botb
as to grain not specially binned and grain
specially binnedb that such warehouse receipt
preserves tie exact rights given tô the shipper
under section 159, subseotion 2, above quoted.
The warehouse or storage receipt as described
follows exaetly the language of the main section, namely, giving te tbe farmer the liberty
to, ship at suob ëlevator as eitber party se
desires. So the actual document tbat the
fairmer or shipper gets preserves the rigbt au
given te, bim in section 159.
It is contended by the grain trade that
their interpretation put on section 150 is
substantiated by section 161 and section 164,.

SENATE

355

I desire ta analyze these twa sections. As
ta section 161, that merely provides that if
it is the intention af the shipper ta deliver
the grain at a terminal elevator point, the
warebouse man shall deliver a certificate in
the iorma provided unrier that section. It is
submitted that this section in no way takes
away the right given ta the shipper to make
bis own selection. It provides only what shall
be done in the event af the shipper desiring
the grain ta be shipped tù a terminal point.
Any righits acquired under the prior section
159, are not interiered with. Then, anather
section, 164, is referred ta for the purpose of
showing that it bears out the interpretation
that the grain trade seeks ta put on section
159.
Section 154 is invoked hy the grain trade
ta show the rights ai the campany ta ship
it ta any elevator selected by dt, at any
terminal point. This clause might, perhaps,
give* ta the edlevator company a right that it
dîd nlot possess either umder section 159 or
161, but the right can only be exercised if
the elevator company gives ta the shipper 48
bours' notice of bis intention ta ship the
grain. Doubte&s, this section is provided for
the purpose of allowing the reeeiving elevator
ta function se, that it will nlot become blocked,
and it is submitted is exereisable, only wbere
the farmaer bas made no selection, in wbich
event it might be contended th-at the rigbt
af selection after 48 hours' notice has expired.
This section conflrms my argument under
section 159 and shows ane bow it can be
last. That is the aonly clause, is my submission, under wbich there is any possibility
af doubt as ta the elevaitor company baving
the right af selection of the terminal elevator.
It is cibvious and admitted t.hàt the r-ights
of the shipper are apparently changed under
section 150 ofi the new Act ai 1925. Subsection 2 provides, in fine 6, the following:
The grain is delhverabde to the persan on whose oecount it bas b,.en taken int store, or to bis order from
the country ellevat.,r ahere it was rBeevvd for sterage,
or in quantirties ot les than cnrload lots on track,
nt a public terminal elevator (rinifls otberwa&e rnutuaglly
agreed), nt suob terminal point in the Western Div sion
as the owner may specify.

This section obviously restriets any right
an behaîf oi the shipper ta select bis terminal
elevator ul
s scb terminal elevator is
agreePd upan between him and the elevator

The important amendment ta the

foundecd an the Draft Bill submitted by the
Chairman ai the Grain Commission, and the
restoration ai the Dra.ft Bill in the language
ai the Chairman ai the Commission is all
that is saught in the Campbell Bill, No. 8.
In the Draft Bill, the Chairman, who prepared it, states opposite section 151 ai tbe
present Act:

of the grain is the person who shall decide
tc what terminal elevator his grain is to be
shipped. There is, therefore, no doubt whatever as to what was the intention of the
Chairman of the Board, Mr. Justice Turgeon;
and he states that lie made the amendment
ir, consultation with members from the Grain
Commission when he re-drafted section 159.
So we have the finding of the Chairinan
of the Commission, a judge of eminent standing, saying that this only restores to the
fariner the riglit he heretofore had; and lie
says he made that finding in consultation with
the members of the Board. Did the members
of the Grain Board, when they consulted with
Mr. Justice Turgeon, not know the effeet of
the language which was going in the Draft
Bill? Through the attitude they have taken
they practically stultify theinselves, and say:
'We did not understand it." But there is the
statement of Mr. Justice Turgeon, wbich lias
neyer been challenged before the Committee
at any time. Now, I do noV want to make
any attack on the Grain Board; they are
respectable gentlemen, performing a public
function, and I do not want to say anything
in this Bouse that I would flot say outside
or anywhere else; but when they come down
and damn this legisiation which I propose to
introduce, they practically confess that they
did flot know what they were about, and did
not properly understand the section of whicli
they had the draft, which Mr. Justice 'Purgeon says they approved, because it was prepared in consultation with lim.
Now we come Vo the question of practice.
Mr. Pitblado, representing the grain trade,
urged that the practice contended for by hum
wa s in keeping absolutely with thse law. 1 have
dealt with the law. It is eubmitted that the
facts do not ibear out thiis interpretation.
First, we have the evidence of four members
of Parliament, farmers, who Jaad shipperd
grain to the terminal elevators selecte!d by
them-and there were ot-hers who could noV
leave their duties in the other Ilouse-wlio
stated that suob right ied, neyer been denied,
nor npparently questioned. One of them,
who appeared, Mr. Vallance, stated that in
1924 the riglit was questioned to somne extent,
but finally wac acceded, but that in 1925 it
was refused.
It is urged that 989o of the grain had gone
in the way advocated by Vhe grain trade. If
that percentage be true, it ini no way affects
the validîty of the riglit of the shipper Vo say
to what elevator his grain shaîl go. The force
of this suggestion is merely increased. by the
development in the grain business. Prior to
1900, the volume of grain shipped outside of

357

Manitoba was not large. Thle first Act was
designated as the Manitoba Grain Act. In
1912, we find, owin-g to the rapid growth of
grain production west of Manitoba, tihat the
n-ame of the Act, in order to correspond with
tho fact of thaý rapid growth, is the Canada
Grain Act. Since 1900, and particularly since
1912, the Province of Saskatchewan has -in,
creasingly become a great producer of wheat.
To-day the quantity produced in Manitoba
lias, I believe, declined, while the growtli in
Saskatchewan has steadily augmented, and
to such a degree that. grain growing in Saskatchewan to-day exceeda the wlieat growing
in ail the rest of Canada Voget'ler.
The farmner in thse early -days, i Manitoba,
was comparativelýy near Winnipeg, and thlerefore nearer Fort William; consequently he
was more in toucli with the grain liandling
companies, -and was in a position to negotiate
his 'business personally. There were also two
large farmner companies which grew into existence, the United Grain Growers of Manitoba,
andl the Saskatchewan Co-operaVivE, Elevator
Company. Thle United Grain Growers, deting

Company a little laVer on. The Uniited Grain

shareholders, but each had his large commission business in handling the grain of others
as mucli as they could attract, and their commission businessl in each case was very large.
I will not tire the Bouse by giving figures,
but there were a countless num'ber of farmers
who feIt that they preferred Vlieir own fariner
company Vo any other company.
Now, the Saskatchewan Elevator Comipany
and the United Grain Growers souglit at ail
times Vo slip -the grain through tiheir own

companies. In other words8, if a pool meraber put -the grain in one of their country
elevators, they want to make a profit on~
terminal handling for their shareholders just
the saine as any ordinary company. This
wùuýd explain the attitude of Mr. C.rerar respecting the use to be made of commissions
in taking -the etrong attitude lie did aga;net
the pools. Ris attitude wss supported in
1925 by fils suocessor in Vhe leadership of the
Progressive movement; but in the present
year it le found that bis successor lias voted
with those who deeire -the pools should have

SENATE
the right which is sought in the Campbeld
Bill. Mr. Crerars opinions are flaunted
everywhere in support of the grain dealers'
contention, and the opinion of his successor
given in 1925 âs also so flaunted, with the
exception of the fart that the present leader
of the Progressive pa-rty lias changed the
attitude taken in 1925 and is now a supporter
of tihe action of the poo. Great emphasis is
placed on the propaganda of the organized
wheat trade in giving quotations from an
addre-s of Mr. Wood, Chairman of the United
Farmers of Alberta, testifying on his part to
the fair treatment he had received at the
hands of the Alberta Pacifie Grain Company.
It <is, I believe, quite true that the Alberta
Pacifie Grain Company deait very fairly and
generously with the A!berta Wheat Pool, but
there were close personal relations between the
manager of tbat Company and Mr. Wood. I
do not intend to criticise, but this may wellhave caused the generous treatment by the
Alberta Pacific Grain Company of the pool
handlbng of grain in Alberta. However, at
the present time. the fact 'is that the Wheat
Pool of Alberta has by resolution supported
the Campbell Bil, as bas the Wheat Pool of
Sa-katchewan and also of Manitoba.
We had two very large farmer companiesand such companies are growing in numbersboth of which were shareholders' companies.
The one in Saskatchewan in my own time
grew from a very small beginning, when it
received .the sponsorship of the Saskatchewan
Government, to large dimensions, and is now
one of the grea.t grain companies of the world.
That company, ,like any other, made ýits profits
by handling grain. It sought in every way
to get the ibusins-s of every shareholder of the
company, and I have no doubt that in 99
cases out of 100 it succeeded. The farmer
desired to patronize it. It was his company;
if there were any profits made. and he was a
shareholder, he got the benefit.
The same is true of the United Grain
flrowers of Manitoba. That is a sharebolder
eompany. Mr. Crerar, as president of that
company, was vitally interested in tIhe financial sucoess of the company. He is a man
thait I highly respect.
Primarily he was
loking after the interest of his shareholders,
and it was up to him to perform that function
successfuldy. We are aIl pleased to know that
he ditd sucoeed. The farmers up te thaet time
had confidence in him. I wil not say that
they have not stil. Mr. Crerar was speaking
from the point of view of a shareholder company: he was in the same position sa any
member of the organized grain trade that

to make profits in the handling of grain ait
the company's terminaIs. We have not seen
bim this year; I do not think his voice would
have been as potent in the Agricultural Cornmittee of the Commons this year as it was
last. This Bill went through the other iIouse
without anyone having the courage'to test
the opinion of the House, and -it went through
the Committee on Agriculture on a vote of
48 or 58 to 12, to speak from memory.
I say that in practice tiere 'were many
reasons why the farmers in the old days were
quite willing that the elevator compandes
should handle their grain through their own
terminals. First, the pools had no terminals.
The shareholders in the United Grain Grower and in the Alberta company and the
Saskatchew-an company had perfect confidence in the handling of the grain through
their own terminais, and kne;w that they
would receive a benefit in the way of dividends -if there was any profit made on the
transaction. The growth of the cereal grain
trade has been enormous, it having increased
from tiny proportions in 1900 to magnificent
proportions to-day. Many of the grain companies dealt fairly with their customers at
thoir country elevators. They wanted to attract custom; they wanted to satisfy the eustomners they had obtained -et many points,
and on the whole I have nothing to say
against them. In the great majority of cases,
I think tihey gave reasonable satisfaction to
their cust-omers. Up to the time the Wheat
po01 started there was no occasion for the
farmer to urgently insist upon his rights; he
had no other medium for marketing bis commodity than the organized grain trade and
the other agencies. If there were two or
three elevators at the country point, he had
to elect at which he would ship 'his grain,
and be was quite content, I have no doubt,
thalt it shouild go to the terminal of the company he selected in ordin-ary cases. But, bccause he allowed the grain to go to a company
terminal when the only option he had was
the ehoice offered by the country elevators,
it voultd be absolutely illogical and unfair
to argue that now, when he is in a position
to choose another terminal, he should not do
so.

-

I elaim that under the Act as it stood in
1912 the farmer did have the right to choose
his terminai. The language is ambiguous, it
is true; but if either party so elects-urely,
if the farmer says to the elevator manager,
"I have a load of grain here, and I want it
to go to a certain elevator," and the elevator
:,an says, "That is not my elevator, I will
send it to another elevator," and the farmer

If there wcrc any reaily

Yet the grain trade teal us: "If
you inicrease that rate from lî cents a bushel
you wili drive the farmer to the country platform."
I submait you would flot do so to any
greater extent than is donc at present.
It is
manifest tihat, the farmer, the man who owns
the grain, is perfectly willing to take the assumed risks of deterioration of the grain, of
loss in grade and of dockage; and it is an
obvions deduction that in order to, scare us
those risks are hugely magnified by the advocatets of the grain trade.
They can now

The rate is fixed
flot by statute, but by the Grain Commissboners.
If a -charge of li cents a bushel, or
2.1 cents, is flot adequate pay for the services
performcd, let them increase it.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
May I ask my honourable friend, is it true or
flot that the Grain Commissioners, when they
come to the conclusion that the rate should
be increased, have to submnit a recommendation to the Government, and that the grain
rates are ultimately fixed by Order in Council?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: That may be.
My right honourable fricnd, having bccn a
Minister in charge of tbat Dcpartment, will
pcrhaps know what 'the Grain Commiýssioners
did. It may be perfectly truc that the Government had to approve of their recommendation, but I presume that in such a matter the
Government would act, in the end, on the
skilled advicc of the proper advisers. So the
argument is flot changcd in the slightcst degree.
Now, if you look at section 159 of the old
At, the Act of 1912, you will sec that the

flot want vou to ship that away at all; I will
take dclivery here." If he took possession of
that grain at the track and shipped it away
himself, or through his own agcncy, the
cievator company wvas still liable for the
grades and the weights. Under the ncw Act
what do you find?
Where delivexy >s mnade lonto car on track at the

Hon. 'Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

So aIl the country cievator has to do at
the present time, under thc Act of 1925, is to
ship that grain out, if the farmer desires, at
any time of the day or night. The clevators
are operating 24 hours daily. Frequently the
farmer is ten or fiftcen miles away whten his
grain is being sihipped out, and he has no way
of iooking over it. The Act provides that he
shaHl be given -an affidavit of weight, but it
does flot even say by whom thc affidavit shall
be madc. It does not require the affidavit to
bc madc by the clevator company. You may
say that in practice the cievator company
makes it, and I have no doubt that is truc,
but the Act does flot so provide, and the
affidavit may be made by anybody. Thereupon thie company is rciieved of ail further
liability. I submit t-hat that, again, is a departure from a right that the farmer enjoyed
under the Act of 1912. As I have just stated,
he had thc right to take deiivery at the treck
if he desired to ship the grain himseif, and the
elevator company stili continued (o be liable
for grades and weights. Under the prcscnt Act
the farmer takes the grain absoiutely at 'bis
own risk. It is loaded out when he is flot
present, for in fine cases out of ten it is impossible for the fermer to be present when the
grain is shipped. He does not know et wbat
hour the cars wiii corne in, or what number
of cars wiil be available. The fermer may
say, 'II want the grain delivered to me," but
when it is actually delivered he has no way at
aIl of checking deiivery. His oniy sefeguard
is that somnebody makes an affidavit and
halnds it to him. Then he must t-ake ail the
risk himsclf. I repeat, the fermer is depriveý
of righits he enjoyed under the former statute
I do flot controvert the fact tbat there are
profits in handiing grain at the terminais;
ccrtainly there are. But the rate at every
stage of the handiing of grain under the Act
should be an indepandent one; (bat is, tha
elavator coxnpany, the raiiway company, and
the terminal cievator should each be compcnsated according tu the service it pcrforms.
The main profit, howcver, is in the mixing
of grain. The advent of the mixing house
has entirclv changed the situation.
Until
comparativciy recent years, as I have said,
the farmer was iargely indifferent as to the
terminal clevator to which he sent his grain.
He becamne vigilant and active as soon as

île more or lcss felI in with the habits of
the company when he was a member of the
Saskatchewan Co-operative Elevator Company, the United Farmers of Alberta, or the
United Grain Growers Grain Company. Since
the advent of the pool he wants to get tha
mixing possibilities out of bis grain. Those

JUNE 30, 1926
representing the pooi have advised him that
last year they made 8170,000 in the mixing of
their grain. Mixing was Iegalized in the
Act of 1912. Before that time it was entirely
illegal, and grades alone governed. It was
found, however, that in the handling of grain
it was possible to promote grades; that a
good No. 2 Northern, or a certain proportion
of it, rnight be promoted to a No 1, and
that sirnilarly other grades rnight be raised.
The Grain Pool this year expeet to make in
this ifianner not $170,000, but a very rnuch
larger sum of money. The elevator comnpanies in rnany cases have made very large
fortunes, not merely by terminal charges
alone, but also by the mixing o.f grain, since
the advent of that systern. Anybody who
knows anything about the grain trade of
Winnipeg knows that the mixing bouses are
making a grèat deal of money. If the Pool
could make $170,000 when they were only
at the inception of that phase of the business,
and if they hope to make at least three tirnes
as much this year, it is obvious to those who
are concerned in the handling of grain or
know something about it that the legitimate
promotion of grades can be made profitable
to the grower. Who should get the profit?
The pool, which is a co-operative institution,
is seized of the idea, that all profits from the
handling of grain, after legitimate expenses
are paid, should be distributed -equitably
among the shareholders.
It is said that we are goîng to confiscate
the large investments of the -organized grain
companies. I say in absolute sincerity that
if I believed that by this measure we were
conflscating the investmnents made in those
companies I would hesitate ever to introduce
this Bill. They want us to accept first their
interpretation of the law under which, they
say, their business has grown up, and then
their interpretation of the practice which has
followed the law. I admit neither. I say
that they took only such chances as have
to be taken by a man ernbarking upon
any line of business, who may subsequently meet with another formi of competition. A man starts a factory, and shortly
after commencing operations perhaps when hie
lias begun to prosper, sornebody with a new
patent cornes along, and establishes another
factory to make n simîlar product, and puts
imr out of business. That is an incidentaI
risk such as we all have to take in
the investment of our rnoney. All investments do not turn out well. If the grain
tradti did not have the absolute legal right
to determine the destination of the grainand I contend they before 1925 dîd.not have

that riglit, but the farmer had it-they took
the ordinary risks of business and they canflot complain in the end of confiscation simply
because a new set of conditions has arisen
and deprived thern of opportunities which
they formerly had to maire money.
Honourable members who do not bother
about the Grain Acts may flot realize to what
extenit the Parliament of Canada has interfered with the handling of grain. The right
honourable the junior member for Ottawa
(Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster) is familiar
with grain legislation, because for a long time
he held a portfolio as Minister dealing with
the matter of grain inspection. Fromn the beginning we have been legiolating and making
regulations on the grain trade and the legiqiation has been prirnarily in favour of the farmer,
the man who was not in the position of being
unable to proteet himself. We first imposed
.upon the grain companies building country
elevators the obligation of making them public
warehouses. Under the various Grain Acte
since 1900 they have been f orced to admit
into their warehouses the farmers' grain. That
was not interfering with vested rights, you
would say. For they built up their trade with
that law on the Statute Book. The investments in elevator companies were made with
a knowledge of that fact, and, I say, they have
taken only the ordinary chances of trade.
Many of them have been enormously successfui, particularly since the rnixing houses have
been established. I have not a harsh word to
eay about them. I have many friends in those
companies. I arn neither a socialist nor a radical, but I do eay that if the ordinary interests
of the grain trade clash with the intereste of
the great body of the people who produce the
grain, 1 arn for the body of producers. It is
they who produce the weaith, and I arn going
to look to the primary producer rather than
the middleman to get the profit. In my
opinion the grain trade will go on functioning,
though not perhaps so lucratively in the future
as in the past.

fiscation, but as to what might resuit in
confiscation at the end of two or three years.
The first point is, under what conditions was
the investment made? The grain trade are
the people who bave changcd the iaw. The
Act of 1925 gives them rights and advantages

they neyer possessed under

the

!egislation

existing when they maade their investments.
That is une answer to the honourable gentlemnan's question.
The publie interest in
important matters of public policy ~sanother
consideration.
I arn willing t0
base rny
contention on what was the ack-iowledged
interpretation of the law by the farîners and
what the st itute, I su.bmit, shows.
There
can ho no confiscation, because the investors,
if thoy oxamined the question properly, were
perfectly aware of the risks incident t0 the
investmnent they madýe.
Hon. LORNE 'C. WEBSTER: May I ask
the bonourable gentleman if those investors
are not entitled f0 saime protection?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Yes. The investors sbould be absolutely prot"cted and
ougght to tbe considered if they did not put their
money in under the law as if stood forrnerly,
Have not the farmers a right to ýbe r rotccted?
Ouglt they to be deprived of the riiehts they
enj.oyed from the beginning?
Thiey have
been deprived by the grain trade of rights
thatfthey enjoyed. both in Jaw and in practice,
by the amendmient that wa passed, largely
dute to the advocacy of Mr. Crerar, wbo wa.s
a dominating person at thaýt ftime, 'but iho
d-oes flot dare ýto come 'hefore us at present.
Now the grain trade say: 'We have a vested
right, given us in 1925. We got it up-on the
Stahte Book.'
1 say: "You neyer should
have got. it uipon the Statute Book, and the
grain trade confiscated the rights that the
fermer had 'had from. the begýinning."
Hon. ýLORNE C. WEBSTER:
s it flot
poasible to make the 1,1w fair to both sides?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
It ýmay be.
That is a matter for negotiation. There may
hoe something in that. I arn only saving tha.t
the ýtalk of confiscation does not corne gracekilly from the mouth of the grain trade. whýo
Hon.

Mr. GOnDON.

bave oonfiscated the rights which the farmers
believe they had enjoyed from the beginning.

When 1 digressed I was going to, say that

the Sta-tuýte Book from the first. from, the
time before 1900 down te, tihe present, izs full
of legislation dealing with grain and regul*ating
the grain trade.
Parliament realized the
necessity of regulating this great commodity
by law, and for the handiing of the business,
it appoi'nted a special Board to, make ail
kindýs of internaI regulation flot .provided
.hy the statute itsel.
The farmers had
no organized means of dealing wit-h thae
companies. bu.t were deait with as individuals,
and the trade wvas so important and the situation so diffleuIt for tihe farmers that it bccame necessary to place varîous Acte tipon
the Statute Book f0 regulate the handling -of
-grain, and to aflow the Grain Conmîssionters
to make a set of regu la tions. Coneider what
týhis Parliament did in 1922. "Confiscation',
you say? In 1922 the Dominion Goverrnent
placed on the Statute Book ýthe moist drastie
powers. Chapter 14 of the Statutes of 192.2
cna,ct-ed th-at the Gov'ernor in Council might
appoint a Board to be known as the Canadian
Whea.t Board, t.o consist of flot more than
10 members, etc., and with provisiýon for

That Act was f0 corne into for-ce as Soon
as the tbree, western Provinces, by their
Local Legfisiatures, concurwed and passnd the
ncesýii
au xiliary legislation to make it
eff(ective. If it had come into effeet ýit would
baive ostahlisbed a Board in competition with
tho Board of Grain Commissioners. but if
was not able f0 function.
I believe Saskatcewan and Alîberta both passed the
auixili.qry legAsations, but, speakinz subject
to correction, I think Manitoba did not. The
rronioters fried for a long time to secure a
suifable manager, but elaimed that they could
not get one.
Tbat Act contemplated
machine-r by which ail the grain of Western
Canada should be controlled.
Mr. Meighen, in his piolicy enunciated ail
over the West in 1921, said hie stood for tha,
organizntion of a voluntary pool, to which
would be accordeýd ail the Governrnent facilitips for the handling of grain. That is the'
way the matter was interpreted f0 us, and
I have heerd bis position sfafed publicly by

JUNE 30, 1926
public speeches. If that pool had functioned,
't cauld only have done s0 by the use of the
established,
then
agencies
Governmient
namely, country elevators aind every other
agency; 1 claim that the Board conitemplated
by the statute of 1922, if established, would
have been a competitor to the pools in the
grain trade to-day. If it had functioned and
worked successfultly, it would have been,
practically the sole grain-handhing power in
the Provinces.
I could give you other illutrations of the
feeling that prevails, that the groducers of
grain are of the greatest importance ta, Canada, that the morale of the people of Western Canada should be sustained, and that the
fariner should be reasonably prospeirous. The
Western fariner has had a hard row to hoe
For the hlast two years he has been reason-.
ably pirosperous. The crop over a very considerable portion of Saskatchewan and Alberta
was a comparative failuire in 1924, though the
prices in 1924 and 1925 have been profitable,.
and the morale of the fariner has grown
enormously in that turne. For years prior ta
that, save during the turne that the price of
grain was regulated by tlhe 'heat Board
under the War Measures Act, the farmner's
lot was an unhappy one. In 1923 the average
farmner did not make any money, did not
break even in handling bis grain. In that
year the only farmner wbo had any hope of
making xnoney wa.s the small self-contained
fariner who had the labour i his own
family. The fariner on tlhe larger scale who
bad ta hire help was frequently a great
laser; in many cases the grain produced in
1923 d-id flot pay the cast of .prcoducinïg and
marketing.
I say that it hi for the benefit of Canada
that the fariner should prosper. The people
in the East should wîsh well ta the fariner,
regnizing the absolute need of the Western
Provinces bei-ng successful, and recognizing
the necessity of the morale of the farmer
being kept up to, a high point. We need
optimisin instead of disappointment and
pi-ssirnism, and that optirnisin has developeil
very rrapidly in the West within'the last year
or two.
As showing what Governments are doing in
the exercise of their superior riÉhts, as Goveriments, in interfering with the private
dealings of faTmers and others in connection
with their crops, I shouldl like to read the
following despatch which appeared in the
Toronto Globe of the lSth inst.:
Kemrptville, June 14.-Encouraged by the succs in
hanrating a prortion cf the epple crop test year, the
Ontario Governenent now proposes to take fuHi charge
of the marketing of proctfcally al1 the agricuttural out-

u

apples, and
pu~t produced for export. Butter, eg,
aiiything eise sh*!ppecl out of the country in any vol-be
urne by the farmnars of thia Province wiMI coHlected,
inspected, graded and exiported under a officiaI Govermoaent brand, according ta an ennounmenent by
Hon. John S. Martin et tihe Keniptvile Agriculturel
Schoci here to-day.
The Goveruneat expeets to nake errangemnents with
the new $7,000,000 warehouse n0w under censtruotion at
the doot of York Street, Toronto, for storing the produce, so that the sarne mnay be marketed gradually
throughcut the seaaon. The Governeeit, tstated Mr.
Martin, ia çrepored to bear the total cet cf atoring
grading and inspection.

This is one of the oid Provinces that proposes to take this step in connection with
export products fromn the farms of Ontario.
I need flot amplify that. If the Government
puts into effeet any such measure as that outlined by the Ontario Minister of Agriculture,
there will be an interference with vested rights
in -Ontario. Under that policy the farmers
will not be able to ship their exports in any
way they please, but will have ta have their
products inspected by Government and -marketed under Government direction. What
more drastie legisiation could there be for
disposing of the farmers' products than that?
This proposai appeals to me because I think
it is in the public interest.
After ail, this Bill is dealing with carload
lots, and street grain wiII go as it did before.
Lt has been said that the pool wants ta exact
fromn the street fariner the saine tolls as the
elevator campanies want ta exact frain the
pool fariner. But the fariner is nat obligated
ta ship ta the pools if he does flot want ta,
and the pools are nat seeking street wheat
because it is cash wheat. There is no provision under the pool systein ta, pay cash ta
anybady at the turne af delivery. If a fariner
takes his wheat ta a private elevator he will
get bis initial payment, but he cannot get
his deferred payments. There are alwayq
thre2 payments. There are many farmers
who are not in the poal, though the pools are
inereasing with almost lightning rapidity6,000 last year in Manitoba, I arn told, and
about 17,000 now. In Saskatchewan and AIberta they are increasing at the saine rapid
rate; s0 that in the end they will contrai
increasingly larger quantities of'grain in the
Prairie Provinces, but a considerable portion
of that will always find its way inta the
private elevators, which are not ta he put
aut of existence, or ta be scared out by this
Bill.
The street seller f armner wants ta take his
cash home; his business and farnily necessities frequently require ai11cash. There is
individualisin among the farmers; they are
flot ail collectivists, who want ta join a pool

and enjoy the beriefits of co-operation. Tbey
have stili other rights under those other elevators, to sbip the grain through the organized
grain trade. The country elevator owned by
the pool must take in street wheat because
the Grain Act implicitly obligates them to
do so when street wheat is tendered, but they
are flot Iooking for that wheat.
In conference with Mr. Murray, wbo appeared before the Banking and Commerce
Committee, as f0 the quantity of grain in the
Western Provinces that would be affeeted if
the Campbell Bill went into force, 1 found
that flot more than 12 per cent of the business
would be touched. The poois have only oneeighth of the elevator capacity, while they
have 50 or 60 per cent of the grain; therefore
of necessity the pools will have t0 use the
other clevators, uniss they buy or buiid more
country elevators.
If oniy 12 per cent of
the grain is affected, this Bill would not mean
spoilation or confiscation.
In conclusion, honourabie gentlemen, I ask,
you f0 put the stamp of your approval on
this new system of co-operation-rather, I
sbould speak of if as the growing system. It
is hecoming the system throughout the world.
I had an opportunîty of seeing co-operation
working in Australia in various branches.
Central Europe is deveioping on that line,
and in many cases producers are doing cooperative buving as well as marketing.
In
addressing this House previousiy I gave the
figures showing the growth of co-operation
in the United States up
1924. Pools for
various commodities are found aIl over that
country-not only for wheat, but for tobacco,
fruit and varinus other kjnds of products, with
the obleet of minimizing tbe cost of middlemen between the producer and the ultimate
consumer. The present trend is to do away
with middlemen, even in the case of jobbers,
and t0 conduet business directly between the
manufacturer and tbe retailer, and sometimes
even.with the ultimate consumer, eliminat.ing
the jobher altogether. Co-operation is the~
movement of the worid to-day, and I think
we shouid look favourably on it, and make it
as eas.), as possible for the farmers of this
country to co-operate successfuliy. The movement for co-operative marketing is increasing
throu-lhoît, Canada, and the seheme outiined
in the despatch I read amounts almost f0 a
system of co-operative marketing in Ontario.
I say that it is in the highest interest of
Canada that we sbould improve the morale
of the farmers in tbe West. They are not
dreamers, visionaries. or wild socialists. The
fariner is a real conservative-I do not mean
in a political sonse at ail; but he is one of
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

fi

the most conservative elements in the comnmunity, and if is only when he thinks he is
not getting a square deal that he becomes
nggrcssive and organizes for defence or attack. Improve bis morale by making conditions mo «re profitable on the farm; let him
get out of bis grain every fraction of a cent
that there is in it. He bas f0 compete with
other countries that can produce grain cheaper
than be can. In an addrcss in another year
I gave you the figures of Argentina, sbowing
that tbe cost of marketing grain from that
country wvas less than if cost the fariner in
the western part of Saskatchewan to put bis
grain in Fort William. When I addressed
this House at the time tbe Panama route was
opened up. I tbink I was listened to witb a
great deal of incredulity w.ben I predicted a
great future for that route. If is our duty
to heip the fariner in bis world competition,
for in the nature of tbings be cannot be protected, wbeat being a surplus commodity in
competition with tbe wbole wvorld-Argentina,
the United States, India, Russia, the Balkans
and other wbeat-producing countries. Let iis
belp the farmer f0 make bis labour profitable.
and if he tbinks he can make more out of
bis grain by marketing it through bis own
channels, cutting out the middleman, I ask
this buse f0 reflect carefuliy as f0 wbetber
we sbould refuse f0 enact wbat was passed
unanimousiy by the House of Commons oniy
a few weeks ago.
CONSIDERIED IN COMMITTE.E-PRO-GRFS

On motion of Hon. Mr. Willoughby, the
Senate wvent into Committee on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. Ro~binson in the Chair.
On section

of warebouse

re-

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honouirable gentlemen, there are a few words I woulrd like f0
s:with rc-ference to clause 1. In tibe firsf
place, if is su.mewh at unfoc'tunate "that tliis
Bill bas reacbed us so late in the Session.
However, that is an old compiaint, and there
is very littie f0 be gained by iabouring it at
the present time. I merely wisb f0 state tbat
the Committee tbat sat on this Bill for some
ten days or so bas not bad time, in tbese the
dying days of the Session, f0 make a proper
report te the Huse, but bas simply reported
the Bill witbout any recommendation at ail.
That is exceedingly unfortunate, because there
are many members of the bouse wbo did not
attend the meetings of the Committee and
whn did nt hear the evidence.
I need not say that this measure involves
a grcat manýy t.ecbnicalities and debails of

JIJNE 30, 1926
which a great many members of the Bouse
have very littie knowledge. The Bill bristies
with technicalities. The members of the
Cornrittee did the best they could within the
time at tlheir disposai, and wihen tiheir labours
were finished I think the Committee had a
very fair knowledge of these technicalities and
details. But those who did flot attend the
meetings of the Committee cannot possibly
have that knowledge. For that reason 1 think
it is exceedingly unfortunate that tihe Coinmittee had flot time, because of tihe lateness
of the Session, to consider ai the evidence
that came before thern and make a straiglit
recommenedation to the Bouse as to what
should 'be done with this Bill, at the samne
time submitting the evidence so that every
member of the Bouse might have an opportunity to read it.
We have ju.st listened to a very lengthy
speech by the honourable gentleman from
Moose Jaw (Mon. Mr. Willoughby)-a speech
ci owded with detail-and I arn sure that not
many honourable gentlemen who listened to
hlm have a very clear idea as to what is the
real issue. The issue is a very narrow one and
can be stated in very few words; and, while
I do noV intend to weary the Bouse at any
length, I arn going Vo Vry to get at what I cali
'the real heart of the qu'estion-the principle
involved.
1 arn not going to quarrel with my hionourabie friend fromn Moose Jaw with regard
to the pool systern. There was no nece;ssity
for himi to dwell on that question for fifteen
or twenty minutes. Pools are recognized the
world around: farmers and others are going
into themn everywhere. Neither is anybody
going to quarrel with the statements of the*
honourable gentleman with regard to the
desirability of the Government assisting
agriculture in every way possible. We are aIl
desirous that the farmer of Western Canada
should bie prosperous; we ahi realize that if
lie prospers the rest of Canada will prosper
with. hirn. We need noV labour that aide
issue at ail.
As I say, there is a reaI point at issue, and
it is a very simple one. Briefly, it la thi&-as
was so, weiI stated by the Chairman of th~e
Comrnittee in bis rernarks to, the Bouse: The
farmers of the Vhree Prai-rie Provinces dcaim
that when a farmer has a carload of grain at
a country elevator that hie wishedi Vo forward
to the head of the Lakes, he has the right
without any question at al to decide to
which ter~minal elevator it shouki bie sent.
They say that was the old law.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: And practice.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: And practice. T-hey
also cdaim that by the hegielation of last year

365

that law was changed, and that right was
taken away frorn Vhern; and they corne to us
new with this Bill asking us Vo restore. that
right. On the o-ther hand, the elevator coinpanies and others opposed Vo Vhse legislation
say that the farmers neyer had the right by
haw to make any sucli sehection, andh that liecause of the system of elevators that lias been
huilît urp under the old law, the position of
the farmer is noV jv.stified. The grain trade
say in effect: "We have invest-ed sornewhere
in the neighbourhood of $85,000,00 under an
existing statute-and *an existing practice, id
you choose-and now you prlopose by this
legîshation te put that investmnent in jeo,pardy." There is the whohe point. They say:
"You tihould noV now, after thoee tonditions
have been established, and after we hava
made that investment in grain handling
facihities, pass such a law."
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Put it back where it
was a year ago.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: They say: "You
should not now, *hy statute, give the farmers
a riglit that they did noV have whcn we made
our investrnent."
Hon. Mr. WATSON: The riight was taken
away a year ago.
Hon. 'Mr. CALDER: No.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: 'Under this Act.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Ah, the question
arises whether the right existed or not. I
Vhink I have stated the question very fairly
to the Bouse.
Now, I am not going Vo atternpt to follow
the honourable gentleman fromn Moose Jaw
in hie argument on the legal question of whether or flot the farmier had that right. Ail I
wish to say in reply-and I amn responsible only
for rny own vote--is that the argument placed
before the Committee by Mr. Pitbiado with
reference -Vo the legal right of the farmer was
not met by any penson who appeared before
our Committee. Other memblers of the Oorniuittee rnay take an entirely different view
of that, but that is my opinion. I have sati8fied myseif in thaV point on one ground,
namely, tlie evidence submitted to us in connection with what is caled the Turgeon
amendment. Mr. Justice Turgeon, Chairman
of the Royal Graih Commission, pre>pared a
draft Bill in which there was a clause to the
effect that the .4rrner hadI the right to select
the terminal elevator. But what was the
evidence that came be.fore us? It was tha;t
Mr. Turgeon himiself did noV, prepare that
amendment. The evidence t-hat came hefore
us was that there was absohutely no conten-

366

SENATE

tion between the farmers and the- elevator
companies on thýat point. I su'bmit to every
member of the Committee the question of
wbether or not I arn right. I say again t-hat
the Turgeon amendrnent wag put in the draft
Bilt-the arnendment rejecfed by Parliament
last year-without the slighf est attempt on
the part of either the farmers on the one hiand
or the grain trade on the other to have that
provision placed ini the law. I say there was
no dispute
Nobody asked for that. The
Royal Grain iquiry Commission carried on
their inquiry for a whole year, and went ail
over the country from EaLt to, West holding
sittîngs, and nobod'y ever siibritfed tri them
the question of whether or flot there should
be any change made in that feafure of the
law.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Why? Would
it not be because the right of the, farmers in
the West had neyer been challenged?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: No, I would not
that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
grievance?

a

There was no

Hon. Mi. CALDER: I will corne to that
in a second. Conditions have changed. I say
thaf question ivas nover submitted f0 the
Royal Commission at aIl, and that when Mr.
Justice Turgeon put that amendiment in his
draft, the recornmendation camne from the
Board of Grain Commissioniers. And according to the evidence suhmiffed f0 us, tbey put
if there for what reason? To give the farmer that right wifhout question? Not at ail.
As we ail know, within the last two or three
years there has been a very large grain mnovement f0 Vancouver-last year if amounted f0
anywhere from 35,00,000 f0 50,000,000 bushels
-and in a few cases there was Eome dispute
as to whetber or not fthe farmer had a righf
f0 send bis grain to Vancouver instead of f0
Fort William, and according f0 fthe evidence,
the Board of Grain Commissioners -suggesfed
to Mr. Justice Turgeon that this ameodment
be put in the law in order f0 make that quite
clear.
That is the genesis of the whole
maffer; that is the real ground for what is
called the Turgeon ameodment.
Last nigbt we had Mr. Snow and fthe other
Grain Commissioners 'before us. and t bey
sfated f0 ftho Cominittee just what 1 arn
stafing now. I say that the provision of a
year ago was not put there, as the honourable member for Moose Jaw stafes, for the
purpose of making clear f bat fthe farmer bad
a right to do wbat hie bas been doing for
fwenty years or so, but for ftle purpose of
niaking if clear that the farmer bad a right
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

f0 send bis grain f0 Vancouver instead of f0
Fort William-to chooso bis terminal point,
flot the terminal elevator.
So far as t hat point is concerned, I have
~satisfied myself at least on the question of
law. I admit that there is room for a difference of opinion; but, so fac as I arn conecned, I arn convinced f baL the argument
aâdvancod at very considerable length by Mr
Pitblado before the Committee has not been
met, evon by my bonourable friond.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
Thaf is the
only affempt that was made to meef if. Mr.
Murray wenif away.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF:
I would say thaf
several times during Mc. Pifiblado's addross
to the Commitfee objection was made f0 bis
argument on that point, and, boing a very
cle%-er lawyer-one of the aiblest in the West
-on each occasion Mr. Pithlado said: "I1 arn

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Weil, my bonourable
friend. That question, as a matter of fact,
bas archen in a confenfious way only wifbin
the last fwo or fhree years, and if bas arîsen
because of the creafion of thc pool. These
pools have begun f0 acquiro country elevators
and terminal elevafors. They bave now somewhere in fhe neigbbourhood of 800 ouf of a
total of over 4,000 count.ry elevat ors thaf they
own, operate or leas-e, and fbey have in the
terminal elevators a cap;city of 20,000,000
bushels ouf of a total, eapacity of something
like 70.000,000 bushels. I amrn ot absolutely
sure of t he figures, but they are approxirnafely
correct. That bas ail been done wifbin fwo.
years or so, and it is because the pool realize
thaf there are cerfain pro>fits in the terminais.

JUNE 30, 1926
that they corne to Parliament and ask that
pool members, like others, shouid, have the
right to select their terminal. In other words,
they are seeking the profits. I do flot blame
them in the slighest degree. I quite agrec
with my honourable friend from Moose Jsaw
that the farmer should have the fullest riglit
to make every cent of profit he can ma-ke
out of bis grain, provided h does flot unjustly and unfairly hit some person. else who,
should not be hit. That is a ver>' important
proviso. I wiil go just as far as an>' honourable member of this House te see that every
farmer in Western Canada by ever>' possible
means, gets every dollar to which lie is entitled from his labour; but I will flot go so
far as to say that he rnay hit sorne person
else unfairly and unjusti>'. That is the crux
of the whoie situation. When Mr. Crerar and
Mr. Forke last year, in another place, stated
that they considered this law unfair a.nd
unjust, I believed Mr. Crerar and Mr. Forke
meant every word the>' said.
Hon. Mr. GILILIS: Mr. Forke bas withdrawn
that.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes, he lias.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: He has resigned too.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Sornething bas hapr>ened since last year. Some people have not
bee-n as frank and as straighforward this year
as the>' were last year. I put it very frankly
to this body-and I think one ma>' speak
frankly here: political exîgencies have sprung
up and exist to-day whidh have had a tendene>' to compel some people to do gome
things that in rny judgment the>' would flot
do under other circumstances, and I say that
this body ghould flot be governed by an>'
considlerations of that kind. In the press recentl>' there have been intimations that this
body should take a certain course with reference to certain legiation that reaches us.
There have been almost threats as to what
would happen if this body did flot take that
course. There has been talk about the reforrn
and possibly the abolition of the Senate, and
ail that sort of thing, because this body lias
seen fit to amend or reject certain legisiation.
Well, I say that this House was created by the
Fathers of Confederation for a specific
purpose: it was made a body for the review
of legislation passed elsewhere. In rny opinion,
if there his ever been ini the histor>' of Canada a time to exercise those powers which was
given to us by the Constitution, that very
tirne is now, when these peculiar political
exigencies exist. So far as I arn personaîlly
concerned I do flot hesitate at ail. It is flot
an easy matter for a person like myself,

coming from the Prairie Provinces, to oppose
legislation of this kind. I have said I do
flot care whether 150,000 farmers ask for this
-I do flot care whether ail the West ask for
it; the whole point in this legisiation i8 the
question whether or flot it is fair and just.
Is anything being done or atternpted that is
flot right? If so, I intend to oppose it.
What is the position in so, faxr as the
elevator companiesl are concerned? And when
I have stated that I shall have practicaîl>'
finished. There has been built up in Western
Canada a line of country elevators numbering more than 4,000. 'Phose country elevators
in thernselves cannot operate succesfulIy. That
is adrnitted. There rnust be connected with
them certain terminal elevators. The terrninal
eievators in themselves, standing alone, cannot
operate successfull>'. It was shown to us that
the C.P.R. and the Grand Trunk built their
terminais, but could flot operate thern, because they had no feeders. I sa>' we must.
accept the statement that a line of country
elevators standing by themselves cannot
operate successfully, nor can a set of terminal
elevators operate by themselves. The whole
system must, work together.
What does this legisiation propose? This
is one of the worst features of it. It proposes
that, any one of the farmers, flot the 125,000
farmers, but al1 the farmers of Western
Canada. should have the right, which would
be exercised, to send bis grain to any terminal
at the head of the Lakes. Suppose I arn
the manager of the pool system, and I send
out word to alI the farmers in Western Canada: 'Order the eievator companies to aend
your grain to me." Ver>' well. I 'have 20,000,000 bushels capacity at the head of the
Lakes, out of 70,000,000, and I get orders
f or .50,000,000. Here are these other private
terminal elevators nearby. I have absolute
control of the situation. 1 can fll any one
of those other terminais if I so desire. Is
not that plain? Thougli I can handle only
20,000,000 bushels cf grain, I have got contrèoi
of 50,000,000 bushdis. I can decide wbere it
shali go. The farmers out in the country
have ordered that their grain be sent te,
me, as manage of the pool, or te rny terminais. Here are A, B, C, D, E, F and G. I
arn in a position to say to, A: "Not one
bushel of these 50,000,000 wiil you get. I
arn going to, favour B"--or "I arn goîng te
favour C"-or "I amn going te favour D."
I put A out of business te-day, and I shaîl
put B out of business to-morrow, and C out
of business the next day. In other words,
by this statutory provision, the Pool are
put into sucli a position that they rnay kill
any terminal elevator. What would fdllow?

368

SENATE

If you have flot your terminaIs, then your
countYry elevators are no good-they cannot
operate at a profit. You must have the entire s.vstem.
Hon. Mr. DANDURANLD: Wi1l my honcurable friend a'llow me to put to him a
question?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDIJRAND: Does it fot
stand to reason. that the line elevator cornpanies at the terminais, whose storage capacity
will Se abzolittely needed Sy the pool-since
the pool, tbough àt may control 50,000,000
bushels, can handie only 20,000,000ý--would
arrange to meet the pool's conditions? The
pool wvili not be master of the situation if
those eiev ator companies stand together and
say: 'Here are our terras. Let us makei a
bargain. Let us corne to an agreemnent." It
scerns to me that. at that stage the two interests wiii be face to face and on an equai
foot'ng., ready to defend their respective rights.
I would put that question to rny honourabie
friendi.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That wouid Se perfectly satisfactory if the trade would stand
together, but here are six terminal elevators,
ailcornpeting for business, ail anxious to get
profits, and the representative of the pool
cornes aiong and says: "Your ordinary charges
are so and so, Now. you just shade off oneeighth of a cent a bushel and we will give you
the business." Those terminal elevators are
cornpeting with each other ail the tirne, just
as the country elevators are, for business, and
the pool, baving in their hands tbat extra
quantity of 50,000,000 bushels of grain-I am
stating only an imaginary quantity-bave a
&:ub wbi'cb tbey rnay use agains+ the terminais.
Not only have they a club, but if they make
up their rninds to kilI any priîvate terminal
they can absolutely starve it-pic-vent it from
Seing fed wvith grain. XVhere tlid thýat grain
corne frorn? What were the agencies for the
collection of that grain? Sorno 2,300 country
elevators that the 1)001 does flot own or
operate or ]case. Yet when they bave got
that 50.000,000 extra bushels of grain that
those e&evators bave coilected in the country,
they turn around and say, "You shall flot bave
a single Sushel of it." The pool is in that
position; it bas that power. It can, if it
wishes, ki Il any one of those terminal
elevators,
There is anotber phase of the question.
What is the necessity for the proposed legislation? I say it is unfair. It corfers a power
that rnay do great harm. As te, the urgency
of it, what was tbe evidence ýet before us,
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

not once, Sut two or three times? Again I
submit to the jucigment. of every honourable
mernber of tbe Cornmittee. "Gentlemen, if
you do not give us this legislation to-day, we
shahl not need it two or'tbree years from now."
Was not that. the st'aternent made? We were
toid in Committee: "The pool is growing by
leaps andi bounds. It is gatbering in money.
It is eollecting two cents a Sushel, or $400,000
a year, now."
Hon. Mr. ROBE'RTSON:

Four maillions.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes, $4.000,000 a year,
te, provide facilities. The pool's representatives
said: "Wby, we have got the grain trade up
against a stone waii. Txvo years from, now
we shahl not ýneed tbe iegis!ation atai.
If tihat is so--if tihe pool at the present time,
after Seing in operation *only two years. ýhas
800 country elevators and sorne 20,000,000
busheds iof stocage at Fort William, and if
tthey expect in two years' time not to require
any legisiation of thîs kind at aIl, xvby -in the
world sbouid we be in sueS baste to pass it at
present? Tbere is no necessity for haste. The
situation will take oare -of itself. Perso'nally
I should -have liked to seeHon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
I do not want
to interrupt the honourable gentleman. but
hallf of those, or -more t:ha.n haîf. you know,
were taken over froin tbe Saskatchewan Couperative. Tliey were a.iready Suiit.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes, certainly, aiready
built.
The
Saskatchewan
Co-operative
Elevator Comnpany were on a perfect.ly sound
basis. Thýey paid ,Sack every dollar they ever
Sorrowed froma the Governrnent, paid every
cent of interest due, and paid very veasonahie
divid.ends to ail their sharehoiders. The pool
Sas taken over the Saskatcbewan Co-operative
Elevator Comnpany as a going ooneerfi, perfectly solvent, and on a good, sound basis.
So there is no danger in that, respect.
What I should have like to see-and ;in
this connection I understand there ýis a
possibility of an amaendment oomi.ng before
the House-would
Se sorne :arrangement
whereby we eould bridge ov-er the difflcuity
that exists. I tbhink that il our !Committee
bad had an opportunity, if we bad had two
or three more days, we might bave done that,
hecause, after ail, it is only -a question of a
year or two until this probema hbas solved
itseif. The pool is big and strong, and it is
going to grow and to bave ail kinds of money,
just like the Saskatchewan
Co-operative
Elevator Company. They think .nothing of
going ýto Buffalo and building an elevator cf
1.500.000 Su.she's capacity, -or building 15,-

JUNE 30, 1926
000 '000 bushels storage at Port Arthur, and
500 or 600 other elevators in the province of
Saskatchewan, ail an a good, sound basis and
paying satisfactorily. So I say that within.
a year or two thýis question wauld have soived
itself, and before the BiH- 'leaves this (Domrnittee I should like to see at least an effort
made ini sorne way or another to 'bridge over
the differences between the two interests. I
sincerely trust that the effort will be made
and that some means may be found to aceomplish it.
As regards the main principle of section 1
of the Bill, 1 oppose it. Not because 1 arn
opposed to the pooi, flot because I do not
wish to see the Western farmer su-ccessful,
not, because 1 do flot wish the farmer to get
every 'cent he can out of his grain. I oppose
iLton the ground that it is unjust to, place the
pool, by statute, in a position in which it
may legally do something which it should ngt
have the right to do. I oppose it because it
may leopardize capital that has been invested
under a law passed by this Parliament; because there is a possibilîty that people, not
those who originally invested their capital,
but people who 'have since taken an interest
in theee various elevator systems, may be
deait with unjustly by a statute of this kind.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: WiIl my honourable friend allow me ta put to hirn a question? Do I understand him aright when I
infer from bis staternent that within two,
three, or fou:r years the pool can become so
strong as absolutely to, cornmand the situation?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The honourable gentleman heard the evidence. He will rernenber
that Mr. Pitblado made the staternent that
Mr. Murray and Mr. Burneil hadi said that
within two years the grain trade would corne
back ta Parliament to ask for this legislation,
and when Mr. Burneil was called before the
Comrnittee the last time I aïsked him: "You
heard Mr. Pitblado's staternt that you and
Mr. Murray hnd said that the poDl would not
requi1e this legislation ini tiwo yeara' time?
Did you, mean it? Why did yoir say it?" 1t
will be remembered that lie replied: "We have
got the trade up against a wall." Then he
eorrected hirnselýf and said: "We have got
them up against a stone wall." He intixnated
-as strongly, ini My judgment as it could be
intirnated, thst in two years' time the pool
would be ini such a position thât. they wouki
not requie this legislation at all.
Hon. RIUS HL POPE: Honrourable gentlemen of the Senate, I -have listened to, my
honourable friend who lias just taken hie

3139

seat.
He has given us a history of this
aiffair. 1 desire to say that there is always
a reason for these things. There is a reason
for the existence and the success of the pool.
It does not exist because the farmers of the
West have inherited any desire for co-operation. They are *made up of disconneeted
elernents. They have corne frorn different
parts of the world. It was- evidently an imperative business necessity that campelled
thern to, think -in the first place of co-opeeating, and then of pooling their interests.
They did so-why? Because the vested interests, froni whidh we hear so rnuch, and for
which I have sorne regard, did noôt deal fai-rly
in their handding of the farmers' grain. They
deait very unfairly. As one of the farmers
who have produced and handied grain in
the early dahys, in the middle stage, and up
to the ýpresent time, I arn in a position to
state frorn my own experience what halppened to us. In the early days; we had no
alternative. There was the elevator owned
by some one of t-hose line elevator campanies. At that tirne rnany of them were
flot in combination, as everybody knows they
are naw. Some were owned by ane organization and sorne by atiother. However, as for
the sale of the grain, we weire treated in the
saine way. Let me give you a fair illustration of conditions in the early days. It does
flot apply ta myseif in particular, because I
was able to build alongside the railway
track some ternporary granaries into which
1 coulkl put rny wheat. But takce the case
of the man who came in with a single load
-and he was a fair more important factor
for the future of ýCa«ad-a than I was. He
had gone out there to, live and to become a
citizen of this country, in the hope of earning prosperity for himself and his family.
That rnan arrives with a load. of wheat-we
will sa:y flfty bushele-in bis wagon or other
conveyance. He .draws up to the elevator,
The elevator mani, if he n handle that
wheat, looks it over and says: "Yes, not too
bad a quality-not too bad; but there is a
Iittle shrunken wheat there, and there is
other grai-weed seeds or sornething-in
there. I ean't give you No. 1 for that: The
best I couid possibly do>is to give you No. 2"
-- No. 3, as the gentleman deoides. That
or
change of grade woil be eqpivalent i value
to about 5 bushels, according te rny ez>perience; so that would leave hîm U. bushels
of wheat, for which lie would be poÀd the
price of No. , or perliaps No, 3, wliatever
the buy4'r declared it ta be. Thon. the buyer
would charge him freiglit on t&cS 5 budWal,
which, at the 4timie wheu. 1 wae eperatiug,

14015--24

SENATE

would be 15 cents to Fort William, or 75
cents on the 5 bushels. Then he would take
ont the cost of cleaning this wheat when it
got to Fort William, and the farmer would
have to pay that. In these ways the farmer
would get a lower price for his wheat; and
such treatment is the best that he could
anticipate in those days.
Now, the surplus owned by the Grain
Exchange of Winnipeg amounted to about
S2,300,000, which they had taken out of the
farmers at Fort William in the way of freight
rates, and all such things. It is not very
astonishing that the farmers are beginning to
be nasty. By such experiences as I have
related the foundation was laid for co-operation, and for what is called the pool to-day.
Suppose a farmer comes in with his load of
wheat when the elevator is full. This poor
devil has 50 bushels of wheat, and he wants
some groceries for his family. What is he
going to do? He is told to go to the storekeeper and sec him, He goes over, and the
storekeeper says; "I am filled up now with
wheat, and I don't know when I am going to
get it out; I don't want any more." The
farmer says he has a load of wheat worth 75
cents a bushel, but the storekeeper simply
says he is very sorry for him, and he does
not want the wheat, but if the farmer insists
he will give 50 cents a bushel. the price to
be taken out in groceries. The farmer is
very glad to do that, and goes back home
with the groceries.
I quite agree with my honourable friend that
so far as we can consistently do it we should
protect fundamental things; but we are not
here to do that at the expense of the men who
are absolutely essential to the development of
this country. Of course, the man who is
making investments is essential to Canada in
order to develop our varions industries and
activities; I appreciate that; but fundamentally
the man who comes from the four corners of
the globe and settles on those lands of ours
in the West or the East, is entitled to the
protection of the Senate as well as of the
House of Commons. Therefore I ask, why
there can not be a resolution or amendment
introduced into this Bill that will give a fair
deal to both of the parties concerned-one
that will provide an opportunity for preserving
the capital investment, and also benefit the
farmers? I trust that both parties will get
together and handle this matter in the interests
of the farmers of the West.
I am sorry that I do not know enough about
this matter to suggest an amendment. I am
not on the Banking and Commerce Committee,
which is quite proper, because if there is
Hon. Mýr. POPE.

anything I do not know about, to my regret
and sorrow, it is banking. Anything I know
about banking affects my heart in a crucial
way that almost breaks it; therefore it could
not be expected that I would know anything
about these matters that are dealt with by the
Committee. But if the Committee cannot
agree, let them come back and so report, and
then some of us who have a deep'and practical
interest in this problem would consider what
proper amendment might be made to this
Act so that all the people could be satisfied,
both the vested interests and the people who
form the pool, who have been forced to form
it by the vested interests known as the Grain
Exchange, or elevator organization, or whatever term you use.
Therefore I think that we should consider
these matters to-morrow.
Hon. !Mr. LAIRD: It is now nearly 6
o'clock. Might I move that the Committee
rise and report progress?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Call it 6 o'clock.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I intend to move the
adjournment until to-morrow and not to sit
to-night. There is plenty of time to thresh
this matter out.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
motion?

What is the

Hon. W. B. ROSS' There is a motion that
the Committee rise and report progress.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am not ready
to accede to that motion. I intend to ask
the Senate to sit this evening, and if necessary
we will divide the House on this question. We
are in the closing days of the Session. We
have been accused of dilatoriness in our work.
Now, surely, as this is the last Bill, the Senate
could clear the Order Paper. It is said that
we should give time to the study of this Bill.
Well, let us give the evening, and if the House
of Commons decide, to sit to-morrow we will
know by 8 o'clock; then we will go on with
it to-morrow and dispose of this legislation.
But surely, when there is a possibility of
voting Supply wholesale in order to reach
prorogation this week, we should not risk
being accused of allowing this legislation to
drag on from day to day.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen,
I do not think that my honourable friend need
have any fears of having any charge laid
against us of neglecting the work here. I am
perfectly satisfied that there will be abundance
of time to deal with this Bill. I do not see
any necessity at all of sitting to-night for this.

JUNE 30, 1926
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: The motion
is that the Cornrittee rise, report progress,
and ask leave to ait again.
But there is
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
considerable difference of opinion, frorn what
I amn told, as to the possibility of a short
ending of this Session, and my honourable
friend bas not given this Chamber any reason
wby we should lose the wbo *e evening in
discussing the matter. Here we are, witb quite
a large attendance. Many members desire to
be heard on this question; shall we, deprive
them of the three bours that we can give to
thec study of this Bill this evening?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I arn eatisfied that we
will sit all fthis week, and away into the next
week. There is plenty of time. There is a
large amount of work to be done in the other
House, Estimates and uther mattera, and tbey
will go on there.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But my honourable friend bas not given any reason wby we
should not go on and study the Bill this
evening.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: There is no necessîty
for it.
Hon. G. D. R.OBERTSON: My honourable
friend bas intimated that in another place
they rnight proceed witb prorogation. May I
state to bim that it is reported that Estirnates
were ready to be proceeded with thie afternoon, but the frienda of my honourable friend
in another place bavýe introduced extraneous
matters and discussion la going on, and it is
possible that it will be another week before
prorogation. We bhave beard three very excellent expositions relating ta the su-biectmatter contained in this Bill. The last honourable member wbo spoke (Hon. Mr. Pope)
made a very great imnpression upon my mind
I think it is very desirable that some mutual
ground should be found, some ground upon
which tbis House can stand, as being fair and
just to botb parties, and not permnitting either
party to take advantage of the other. So far
as I -can sec ye[t, there doca noV appear any
such middle*ground, or any proposal that has
been submnitted to the House. I think we
could adjourn to-nigbt, and that bonourable
gentlemen could make an honcat and earnest
effort to have sornetbing of that sort ready for
presentation to thbe House Vo-morrow, so that
we could proceed to dispose of this Bill intelligently und with fairness to all- concerned.
Hon. Mr. DAŽWDURAND: But ean we
not lay our views before the Senate this
even.ing, and out of the discussion will we not
find the solution which .has -not yet . been
suggested? We have tihe. Bill, which some
1401--24à

371

members believe should lie passed as it is,
feeling that it ia justified. Now, these arguments may be put before the House to-niglit.
I arn ready to go on th.is eveniiig and sta.te
my views on the Bill; others will do likewise;
and if we do flot reach a conclusion this
evening we will have the whole night to sleep
over the situation and try to corne back
with some new ideas to-morrow afternoon.
No one bas suggested en amendment, thougli
the junior member from Moos Jaw (Hon.
Mr. Willoughby) thought a middle way could
be found; but if neither he nor any other
member proposes such, should we flot proceed,
and reacli a conclusion? I cannot realize why
we should not discuss this Bill t.his evening.
We have been told by my honourable frîend
from Regina (Hon. Mr. Calder) that we are
t¶ireatened .with extinction if we do one thing
or the other; but it hais also been said that
this Chamber was gaining time in order flot
to hurt the feelings of some memibers of the
Commona, one way or the other. Well,
should we not act independently, in our own
way, and decicfe as to what is Ithe best coums
to adopt in this Ohamber on this Bill? I
arn ready to take my stand. I doubt, very
mucli that any honourable member would say
that he would rather adi ourn the discussion
because of a party advantage elsewhere. I
arn not tbinking of that; I arn ready Vo discuss this Bill.
Hon. Mr. MACIDONELL: 1 think we
have lots of time to-morrow, and most likely
the next day. We have worked very liard
to-day, and I think it would be a great pity
to work this evening. I would Tather have
a rest, and go on to-rnorrow.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do noV know
bow my honourable friend has worked, because we sat in Cornrittee, and we sat this
afternoon. I have known of days of hard
work, but not this one, surely. I think every
member is freali, and can give tbree or four
bours this evening.
We have
Hlon. Mr. MACODONELL:
listened to three or four speeches this afternoon already.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAiND: WedI, there are
days when rny honourable friend lias heard

Hon. Mr. GILLIS: But would it flot be

then discuss the question on that amendrnent,
rather than go over the ground again?

friend has moved that the Committee report
progress and asic leave to sit âgain. I will
divide the flouse on that question.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: As a member of the

to -my bonourable friend.
I want to take
exception, I think very properly, to, my honourable friend making a statement which suggests that any bonourable member of this

with regard to bow bis action in this buse

ta express my amazement that my bonourable

GRAIN BILL

STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN 0F COMMITTEE
ON BANKING AND COMMERCE

On the Orders of the Day:
Han. G. G. FOSTER: Honourable gentlemen, before the Orders of the Day are called,
I desire to draw the attention of this Chamber
ta a moatter that I deem. to,be of publie importance, and which relates to the good naine of
this Chamber and of the Committee on Banking and Commerce. I have been silent when,
in this House and out of it, certain insinuations
,have been made with regard to delay8 Ii
what is known as the Grain Act, which wgs
before the Committee to which I have referred. I have been silent because I did not
want it to appear that the Committee on
Banking and Commerce, over which 1 have
had the very great honour to preside for seven
years, did not peed. to be deifended.
But I
must break that silence to-day, because I arn
told that it is currently reported outside this
Rouie that the delays that have accurred with
regard to'that Bill have been due to that
Committee.
I desire to place upon record the following
information with regard ta the Grain Bill
legisiation.
Parliament met on January 7th,
1926. The Grain Bill was introduced in the
Bouse of Commons three weeks later, on the
let of February, 1926. The Bill was in the
Bouse of Commons until the 10th of June
and came to this Bouse on the llth of June.
It was submitted to the Committee an Banking and Commerce on the l6th of June, one
week being lost thraugh no fault of the Committee.
The dates of the meetings of the
Com7nittee on Banking and Commerce upon
which the Bill was considered are as follows:
Thursday, June 17, il a.m. to 1 p.m.; Thur&day, June 17, 8 p.m. ta Il p.m.; Friday, June
18, 10.30 a.m. to 12.50 p.m.; Tuesday, June
22, 8.30 p.rn. to 10.40 p.m.: Wednesday, Jume
23, 10.30 a.m. to 1 p.m.; Wednesday, June 23,
8.30 p.in. ta 10 p.m.; Tuesday, June 29, 8 p.m.
to 10.30 p.m., and Wedneeday, June 30, 10.30
a.m. ta 11.15 a.m. The Committeeé submitted
this Bill to the Senate on the 30th of June.
I submit that froin these facto this Houie
and the country can readily understand that
if there has been any great delay with regard
to this Bill, and delay ta the people of the
country getting the benefit of the legislatior
contained in it, it has flot been due at ail ta
the Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Han. Mr. BEIQUE: 1 would suggest that
the Chairman of the Committee should also

state the time when the Grain Board was
asked ta appear before the Committee, and
the delay caused thereby.
Hon.'G. G. FOSTER: I may say that there
was flot any delay on the part of the Banking and Commerce Conimittee in summnoning
them. They were summoned ai soan as instructions were given ta do sa.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: They were ta be here
at the end of the week, and were unable ta
get here bef are the adjournment at the end
of the week, and the Committee had ta await
their convenience for several days.
Hon. G. G. FOSTER: Supplementing the
statement which I have made, I ask permisaian, in answer ta the suggestion of the honourable member from De Salaberry, ta read
the following telegrami.
On the 22nd of June I addressed the Chairman of the Grain Commission, Mr. Leslie H.
Boyd, Fort William, as follows:

DUPLICATION 0F TRAIN SERVICES
INQUIRY AND DISCUSSION

Haon. G. GORDON: Before the Orders af
the Day are cslled I desire ta caîl the attention
of this Bouse, and particu!arly of the Leader
of the House, ta a matter which I think reqiaires same iaoking into. Advertiiements
have appeared reeently in the newâpapers
atating that snother train de luxe would be
placed an the run between Montreal and
Toronto -by the Canadian National Railway.
That train, I believe, ie already aperating. À
eew deys later the announcement appeared
stating that the C.P.R. was doing the samne

374

SENATE

thing. Before these two trains were put on,
there were running between Montreal and
Toronto five trains per day on each road,
which I submit and believe were sufficient
to take care of all the business offering between
those two points.
If honourable gentlemen will look back only
a short time, they will remember that the
evidence which was placed before us when
we were inquiring into the railway question,
went to show that millions of dollars were
being lost by both roads on passenger traffic.
If I remember aright, in 1924 the Canadian
National system lost some $24,000,000 or
$26,000,000, and I think the statistics showed
that the C.P.R. lost something like $10,000,000.
This being the case, it seems to me that
these two great railways are still persisting in
the war between themselves to the disadvantage of the people of this country, rather than
entering into the co-operation which we were
led to believe a short time ago they would
enter into.
I protest most vigourously against what
appears to me to be the worst kind of extravagance. I like others have been looking
forward to the day when the railway companies
would be in a position to reduce railroad rates
which are weighing so heavily upon the
business of this country. While I am not a
railroad man, and do not pretend to know
much about the business, I frequently travel
between the two points mentioned, and I have
never yet found that there was not plenty of
room for myself and others before these
additional trains were put on. To me it seems
ridiculous that a Canadian National train
should be put on to leave ýMontreal at 12.45
in the daytime, reaching Toronto eight hours
Jater, 'and that another train on the C.P.R.
should leave Montreal at 9.45 in the morning,
reaching Toronto about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, because business men, if they take these
trains, will arrive too late in the day to do
any business. I say that already there were
too many trains leaving these points in the
morning, before the additional trains were
placed on the run.
Some people may think that this is a matter
that does not concern us very much. It is
very pice to ride around in expensive and
palatial cars, but it is driving away the time
when we may look for reduced rates. I
therefore ask the new Leader of the House
to make inquiry into this question and to see
if there is not some way by which the heads
Hon. G. G. GORDON.

of these railways can be brought together in
co-operation to the advantage of Canada
instead of continuing unnecessary trains to
its disadvantage.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: May I ask my honourable friend a question? Is not this new
train put on to accommodate the tourist traffic
between those two important cities, which
is so heavy during the summer months?
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I am glad my honourable friend has asked that question. However, it is one that I cannot answer very well.
His suggestion may be correct; but let me
say that last winter, about December, we
witnessed a similar spectacle, only perhaps
worse than the present one. The Canadian
National Railway advertised that they were
putting on a fast train between Montreal
and Winnipeg and Toronto and Winnipeg,
which was going to run much faster
than other trains. It was put on, and
a few days after that the Canadian Pacifie
Railway put one on; I understand they did
not want to be outdone by the other railway.
I believe that action cost many hundreds of
thousands of dollars to each of those roads.
They found that they could not maintain
those two new trains without a tremendous
loss, and after having lost very much money
they took them off in a month or six weeks.
Now, I do not believe that they require this
rew train for tourists, or any other trade
curing the summer, as each of the railways
has five trains per day leaving Montreal and
going to Toronto, and the same the other
way.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen,
I may say on this subject that it has always
been a puzzle to me to know wha! all those
trains between Montreal and Toionto were
doing. The last time that I had occasion to
look into the matter, which was last winter,
there were five trains a day on the C. P. R.
and five on the other railway; that would be
ten trains a day, and they were de luxe
through trains. Besides them, there was also
a sprinkling of so-called accommodation
trains.
I may add that if I can get information and
explanation as to those two trains I will
be glad to submit it to the House, because
it is a puzzle to me. I know that the tourist
trade on the western section from the 1st of
July until about the 10th of September is
very great, and the railways require all
manner of trains during that period. It may
be that the new train referred to is only put
on for four months, and will then be taken
off; doubtless it is so.

DUNCAN REPORT IN CUSTOMS
INQUIRY
REQUEST THAT IT BE LAID ON TABLE

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I would like ta ask the
honourable Leader of the House if hie would
place upon the table of this Chamber a
certain section of the report on the Customs
Inquiry which was held in another place.
That section of the report bas not been distributed to the members of thîs House. I
refer to what is known as the Duncan Report.
I understand it contains information with
which the members of this House should be
acquainted.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I will see if I can
obtain the report for the honourable gentleman.
Hon. ýMr. DANDURAND: Is it composed
of evidence, or is a duphîcate of it obtainable?
What is that Duncan Report? I confess hat
I have been flooded with reports frorn that
Comrnittee, both in French and English, and
that I have not read the first uine of them.
I have seen the words "Duncan Report," and
understand that it came from a gentleman
who had becn detailed by the late Government to make an investigation. I have not
seen that Report, and I do not know whether
it has been tabhed in the other Chamber, or
whether it is composed simply of written reports, with any exhibits, etc. If the Report
bas not been printed, there can be but one
original, which may be in the other Chamber.
and which could not be here at the samne
time.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I understand that the
so-called Duncan Report was laid on the
Table in the other House, 'and that it is the
report of a detective that was ernbodied in
and became part of the report of the Comnmittee. In somne way or other the Committee
made evidence af it; I do flot know whether
they called the Inspector and asked hirn to
swear to the truth of it, or how it was done.
As I understand, it is. part of the record on
which the Committee made their report.
If it is part of
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the record, bas it not corne along in the daily
reports of evidence that have been distributed
to the members?
Hon. W. B. ROSS- It appears not; I do
-not know.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: It is part of tha
record that was taken by the Committee,
'and bas been tabled in another place. In

that case we have the samne right to have it
tabled in our Chamber. It bas not yet corne
to us, and I arn in exactly the sarne position
as the honourable leader on the other aide
of the House: I have not seen it, but I think
it is right that we should have it. I simply
ask for that portion of the Duncan Report
which was tabled in another place.
Hon. Mr. MAGDONELL: The report was
placed publicly before the Comrnittee and
everybody. I heard it rnyself.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: It
seerns to me that what we ought to have in
this House is just exactly what they have ini
the other House. We are equally interested
in the probe which has been carried on, and
we are bound, as legisiators here, to secure
and study ail the information we possibly
can; therefore we ought to have an exact
replica of what they have in the other House
-report, evidence, and ahl documents attached.
CANADA GRAIN BILL
FURTHER

CONSIDERED

IN

COMMITTEE

The Senate again went into Cornmittee on
Bill 8, an Act to arnend the Canada Grain
Act.
Hon. Mr. Robinson in the Chair.
On section 1-contents of warehouse
receipt:
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable gentlemen, it bas been intirnated to mne to-day that
there is a possibility of the. two parties to
,the dispute which we have been. considering
in connection with this Bill getting together.
If I could be sure of that I would not occupy
the attention of the House at ail, because,
after aIl, this dispute is between the large
body of farmers on the one hand and the
grain trade, on the other. While the general
public have an interest in it, stîi I think we
ail recognize that -the dispute is between those
two important bodies. If, through our discuss,ion of this question, they have been able
to get together in somne way or another, I
arn sure we will ail be flot onhy greatly
pleased but aloo somewh4at surprised.
When I spoke yesterday I did so wi.thout
any special preparation. I ltad, attended .al
the meetings of the Committee and heard
ahl the eviderice, and I did not intend or
expect to occupy the time I did. But witb

tiens, in their evidence took the ground that
the country elevators pay. They were ask.ed
questions time and again with reference to
that point, and they had no hesitation. in
st,ating that the country elevators, not merely
a faw of thema, but ail, were profitable. As a
matter of fact, the statement made to our
Commîttee, not once but many tames, was
that those elevators had paid for themselves
many times over. 1 ask honourable inembers
of the Committee if that was nlot the eviderce
that came to us.
If it is true that theee country elevators
pay-if it is true that the pool consider them.
profitable and that there i6 no danger of a
loss, then why should. they hesitate either to
build or to acquire elevators? When I asked
the question as to why thiey dîd hesitate,
what was their reply? Mr. BurnelI, the Secretary of the pool, one of their chief offcers,
himself admîtted that if he were free to do
as he chose, to build or acquire elevators
was exactly what he would do; but he said he
could not get the other meanhers of the organization to see as he saw. When he was
asked the pointed question, what were their
objections to acquîring or building elevs>tors,
what was his reply? He stated there were
two objections. In the first place, they di
not wîsh to duplicate existing facilities. There
was some evidence to the effecr, that there
.were too many country elevators. Persoaly
I dloubt if ahi the facts will bear out that
opinion, because when we have a bumper crop
we have flot too man.y elevators; they are al
filled and there is not sufficient space for ail
the fariners to get their grain in. At any
rate, he held as one of his resens why they
did not inove in that direction that they dýid
not desire to duplicate eisting elevators. The
other objection was that they did not wish
to use the'ir finances at the present time for
that purpose.
As regard their first reason, if they acquired
elevators by pujichase or lease there would
be no duplication. As to his second objection,
my reply is that if there is no question about
these country elevators being on a paying basis,
if they will carry their interest charges and
ail overhead charges and earn a profit, there
ashould he no difficulty in getting capital even
if the pool do not wish to use their own. What
is the history of the Saskatchewan Co-operWhen I was a
ative Elevator Company?

Saskatchewan our Goveruiment was instrumenta1l by statute ini creating that company.

I take.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I do not want
to interrupt the honourable gentleman's argument at ail, but in that connection rnay I put
Could the Saskatchewan
just thia question?
Co-operative Elevator Company ever have
functioned il the Provincial Goverument had
not put up the 85 per cent? It could neyer
have corne into existence. The farmers could
not have raised the money.
Hon. Mr. CALDER-: That was possibly
true, but we axe no longer at -that stage.
It was an experient then; it is no experiment now. The histary of the Grain Growers'
Company, the Saskatchewan CJoGrain
15levator Coimpany, and the
operative
organized farmers of Alberta in the operation
of country elevators h«a ail indiicated that
capital need not be fearfiil of invïesting its
money in institutions of that kiod. On the
other hand, take the in.vestment mnade by t'he
province of Manitoba. The Manitoba Goverment went into the 'business of country
elevaïors, but with very gad resulte. Their
elevators did not become a dead loss, but
they lost money yeez by year-anil why?
That goes to the very heart of the question
that we hawe under consideration. The
Manitoba Government bmd theiT feeders, but
they bad no term~inais at the hend of the
Lakes. Feedere withoiit terminels wilI not
and cannot pay. If the Saska4ehewan Cooperative Elevalor Conmpany eucceeded it wa

SENATE

andl provided. storage capacity there. They
knew tihat unless they had, the 'terminal
facilities for their country feeders tbey coulil
neyer suc'ceed. That, howeve.r, is a side issue.
Let me give an illustration of wh'at Mr.
Burnell told us in eviidene on this very
point. We weïre talking 'about tihese elevators
paying. and honourable members of the Committ-ee will remember that be instanced a
point in Manitoba, complet4y within bis own
knowledge, at which there were four elevýators.
What was bis evidence? He said: "Our
elevator qiandiled 300.000 bushels of grain; the
privatre elevator next door handiled 28,000;andther one, a littie farté-er on, bandied about
40,000, anid ano-ther one 'about the same
quantity." In other words, the fa.ct tjhat the
poo~l had au~ elevator at that point to serve
their darmers placed them in such a position
t¶alt they got 300,000 out of a total of about
400,000 bushels marketed there. It seems to
me that there is noV the slightest danger that
the pool if t'hey desire to go int-o this business,
will ever loýse 'a single dollar on the building
or acquiring of the country e]evators wbioh
are reýquired by them in order to handie the
business gîven Vhem by members of their
orgariizat ion.
Instead of the pool themselves building r
buying at those 892 points at which they are
flot now represented, tbey come to Prlfament
and ask us to pass a law compelling 3,467
privateiy cwned country elevators, iscattered
Vhroughout the Prairie Provinces and baving
at the terminýaIs connected witb them as part
of their plant a storage capaoity of 50,000,000
bushiels, to act amcollecting agencies Vtofeýed,
flot the terminais privately owned, but those
bcionging Vo the pool. Remember that ail
the t'me I am assuming, as I mugt, assume,
that the farmers had noV the legal rigbt which
they say they b'ad. They are asking Parliement to pass3 a law that will compel those
privat-ely-owned elevators to colleet and store
grain eat -the initial points and ýthen transmit
it to the pool terminal elevators et the boed
of the Lakes.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Is thbe honourable gentleman's statement exactly right? As
I understand, î t was the practice, tlhough 1
am doubtful whether it was the ]aw or not,
for the farmers to deeignate the terminal
elevaitors to which their grain should go, but
thýat right was taken from them last year, and
thnt is why tbey are (here now seeking legisletion in accordance with thýeir practice.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: My whole argument
is based on wbat I believe is a proper interpretetion of the 1aw; and, as I àte'ted ye-sterday, in my judgment the argument put forth

(Hon. Mr. Willoughby), who spoke yesterday.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I would lik2
the 'hcnourab'-e gentleman to argue the question.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: If I had a reputation as a lawyer I would not besitate to do
so. But I will ey this. As every 'bonourable

Hon. Mr. 'SCHAFFN FR: We have often
heard argutments like that.
Hon. Mr. CALIDER: That is quite true,
but Mr. Syming-ton bas a reputation. He is
noV a straw man; he is a man who bas been
employed by the Government of this country
in many important cases. H1e bas a reputation throu'ghout the ien.-tl and breadth of
this land.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I am flot împeàching the professional reputation of Mr.
Symington, but he is a member of a iaw
firm acting for thie United Grain Growers.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I amn simply taking
Mr. Sy-mington's statement. I say Mr.
Symington, who is a very able counsel and
has a reputetion at stake, made the statement, in the Agricitural :Committee that in
his judgment no lawyer of standing would,
over bis signature, express the opinion that
the farmers ever bad by statute tbe right
which t'hey now dlaim they had. And I go
further, as I did yesterday: having heard my
honourabie- friend (Hon. 'Mr. Willoughby)
yesterday, and baving heard tbe arguments
previously put forth by Mr. Murray, I
steted yesterdlay that I was noV convinced
by ail the arguments tbat tbe farmer had tbe
right, whicb be dlaims. I do not ask any

JULY 1, 1926
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: They are getting paid

Hon. Mr. CALDER: They are getting paid
for the use of those facilities. That is what
they are there for. Under the law, what has
.capital done, starting 'baek as many years as
yoi like, when no facilities existed? According
to rny interpretatian of the law, it is the right
of the privately-owned country elevator ta
scnd grain stored in it to its own privatelyowned terminal elevator. Under that condition, what has capital done? It ha.s invested
$M5,000,000. With that investment it has
provided sornewhere in the neighbourhood of
3,400 country elevators and something like
52,000,000 bushels of starage capacity at the
head of the Lakes. Now, what does my
hanourable friend propose?
It blas been stated to our Committee, without there being any question as to the exactness of the statement, that country elevators
operating alone cannat operate succesfully.
I say again that it has been demonstrated ta
us that terminal elevators operating alone
cannot operate successfully. Arn I flot right?
Was not that the effect of the evidence euhmitted to us? My honourable friend shakes
hie head.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY- I do flot think
that was demonstrated by the evidence.
Hon. Mr. CALDER. What ie the evidence
with regard to the Grand Trunk elevators and
the C.P.R. elevators?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGH-BY: Those are terminals.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: What is the evidence
with regard ta the Spiller people? They had
their terminal at Vancouver, and they had ta
acquire country elevators.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I thought you
were speaking of the country elevators.
Hon. -Mr. CALDER: We have flot nny
evidence with regard ta the elevator syetem
in Manitoba; but as a matter of fact, as my
honourable friend knows, and as I know, the
elevator syâtem. without terminale failied
because it had no terminais. We alsa knaw
that the C.P.R., because they had no feeders,
had ta 'hand over their terminais after they
built them ta people who bad feeders. There
is no question about the evidence in that
regard.
However, Mr. Chairman, 1 anly wfrhed to
place a few facta before this Cornmittee with
referenice ta the number of elevators that we
are dealxng with. 1 simply wish ta make this
one point clear: 1 amn as much in favour of

co-operation amongst aur farmers aa any
member af this House.
Our record in
Saskatchewan, where we have hlazed the trail
in co-operation, shows that. As hanourable
gentlemen know, I had a good deal ta do
with niany of the nieasures placed on the
Statute Book in that connection. So, when
I oppoee this legisIation, it Le flot because
I arn opposed ta the Farmers Co-operative
Organizatian, nor becau8e I arn apposed ta
the pool. That is a strong and vigarous institution that will become very much stronger
and bigger in the daye ta came. I wish it
every success, and I arn sure it will have it.
My opposition ie based on something entirely
different. It is based an the principle that I
do not believe that 'Parliamnent ghoul-d interfere with capital that has been innocently
and legitimately invested. It je nat capital
that was invested fifteen or twenty years ago;
we knaw ai instances af people putting their
money inta those institutions within recent
years--probably within the last f ew days.
Those institutions, in zny judgment, have
been built up under a systemi af law whereby
the privately owned country elevatar could
send the grain that came ta it ta its own
terminal elevator. But yau naw ask that
Parliament shauld with a sweep ai the hand
take away frarn thase privately-awned
country elevators the right ta send the grain
ta their own terminal elevators. Yaîx go
further than that, and place in the hands af
the organized farmers, as I said yesterday, a
club that can be used, and used effeetively,
ta kill any privately-owned terminal elevator
at the head of the lakes. That la my opinion.
I may not be right, but all af the evîdence
submitted ta the Committee and all the
discussions that I have had in this cannectian
lead nowhere else.
Hlon. Mr. GILLIS: Just a moment. In the
event ai the pool people aoqu'iring elevatars
at aIl the pointe throrghout the West, wauld
nat the eame thing be accamplished? Would
it nat destroy the money investment at Fart
William and ather points within the course
af a comparatively short time?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Surely. I say surely,
aïd let it; but do not asc me ta create a law
ta do it.
Han. Mn. GILLI6: The honourable gentlemau in the beginning of his speech argued, ta
the effect t.hat there waa na reason why the
pool people eould. nat acquire elevatore at
all initial points.
Non. Mr. CALDER: And I aine that now.
They have the right, ta do so under the

382

SENATE

common law. Let them come out and build
ail the terminais and ail the country elevators
they like; but do not ask Parliament to put
them in such a position that they car do
something they have not a right to do.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: It bas the same effect.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: It bas the same effect,
but it is an entirely different thing to do it
by statute.
Now, one other point. Some stress has
been placed on the assumption that this law,
if passed, will affect only a small percentage
of the grain. Mr. Murray and Mr. Burnell
placed the amount at 12 per cent of the
grain now handled by the privately-owned
elevators. The honourable the junior member for Moose Jaw (Hon. Mr. Willoughby)
yesterday gave figures indicating that that
would be the position, and the argument was
that anyway it was only a small thing, as it
affects only 12 per cent of the grain.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: At most.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: At most. In order to
arrive at that 12 per cent, those who made
the calculation based it on the assumption
that one-half of the entire western crop would
not be affected by this legislation. They based
it on the assumption that street wheat, that
is, wagon-load wheat, would not come under
this law. Those who were on the Committee know what the argument in reply was. It
is quite true that the pool have not used the
existing contracts that they have with the
trade for the purpose of getting street wheat
through their terminais; but, as I heard the
evidence, and as I read the present law and
this proposed law, there is nothing ir the
vorld to prevent the pool from handling
street wheat just the same as any other wheat.
In other words, the argument is based on the
assumption that "Oh, well, after ail, there is
only a very smal. fraction of this wheat to
be handled in ithis way." I say that not only
12 per cent but 50 per cent of the crop may
come under this law.
I do not know whether it is worth my
while labouring this question, which is a very
technica.1 one. Dr. Magill saýid: "Well, if the
pool will give me $100,000, I will show them
how we can hande street wheat under this
law." Mr. Pitblado said that there was no
question about it at al.1, and we had some
argument as to how it could be Jone. Mr.
Pitblado said there was no question at ail
that street wheat could be brought into this
pool, and intimated that they had managers
-grain experts and men of excellent ability
-who were clever enough to do it. The
resuit of it all was that Mr. Pitblado said:
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

"It will affect us not to the extent of 12 per
cent, but to the extent of over 50 per cent."
So, any argument that bas been advanced
that after ail this is a very sma11 thing is not,
in my opinion, based upor a solid foundation.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: Does the honourable
gentleman know why the pool should not
handle street wheat?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Not at ail. I have
They could handle any
never said that.
kind of wheat. They are entitled to do so.
The honourable gentleman did not get the
point at ail. It is said that if this law is
passed it will not affect street wheat, which
is 50 per cent of the crop. He consequently
fals low, when he says that, after ail, the
trade is affected oniy to the extent of 12
per cent. I say, in reply, that is not true;
that the evidence goes to show that the
street wheat can be brought under this law,
and if it is, then not 12 per cent, but over
50 per cent of the grain handled by those
private interests, will be affected.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS:
But does not the
proposed Bill state that this only applies to
carload lots?
If the honourable
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
gentleman is going to force me to go into a
statement of how it is to be done, I will
only have to repeat the statement I made in
the Committee.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: But the Bill distinctly
states that it shall oly apply to carload lots.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
Let me illustrate
Suppose that we are ail farmers living in a
certain district, and none of us has a carload. I bring in 60 bushels, another brings
in 40, another 30, another 20, and so on, and
we go to the elevator. The elevator man has
No. 1 bin, No. 2 bin, No. 3, No. 4, etc. Our
grain goes into No. 1 bin because it is No. 1;
others go into No. 2, No. 3, and so on. As
a result of that we have in bin No. 1 two
carloads, and under the law I have a right to
assign my grain to a certain gentleman, and
I give an order to that effect. That gentleman owns my grain; he owns another man's
grain, and so on. He bas so many cearloads,
and the pool asks to have it shipped down
to the terminal. That plan can be worked
out as easily as rolling off a log, once they
have the machinery to have that done.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: The honourable
gentleman has made a very good exposition
of his side of the case, and has given a great
deal of information, ancd for that reason I
would like to ask a certain question. I think

Hon. Mr'. CALDER: I understand froni
what, the Commissiomers said yeste'rduy that
it was passed because Vancouver came into
existence as a pIain1 shipping point, and 1there
was some question es ta whether, usider the
law as it exiisted, the farmer had a rigiht to
se'nKd bis grain to Vancouver in.stead of ta
Fort William. That is the evidenûe of the
CommiWsOners when Vhey .were cal'led here
the last time, and it has nlot been -disputed.
Com~missioner Snow made. a statement to thst
effeet to oui' Committee-that the cmly objet
in 'having the law of 1925 was ta give the
farmer the unjdoubied rigbt to have ii grain
shi'pped either to Vaincouveir or Fort William.
I say that ent'irelly new conditions have been
establïshed during the ist few years by the
ereaon. of Va'ncoiuver as a terminal point,
and.on aceount of the spr'inging inta existience
of the pool having the ownership of terminals.
I hava not ex~presse~d an opinion os to whalt,

the undoubted, absolute right ta acquire

800 odd points where they are nlot represented.
Even if they do net wish ta inveet new

If that cannait be agreed on, we must go

Hon. Mr. WATSON: Would you wipe out

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Wipe it out. Then
wbFre would both parties be? They would
stand before our courts. What is happening
at present is that we are asked to sit in judgment on this matter, and there are legal questions involved that many of us do not grasp.
That being so, I say let us go back to the old
law. and place the farmer exactly wbere he
was, and place the grain trade exactly where
thcv were. and let them figbit it out in the

HGn. H. W. LAIRD: Hon ourable gentlemen, I arn sure the IHouse has listened with a
great deal of pleasure to the addresses whicb
we bave beard thus far regarding this legislatin, and we have had the assistance of the
preseotation from the respective standpoints
of those favouring and opposing this Bill.
Yesterday we biad the privilege of bearing a
very learned legal disquisition on the part of
the promotors of the Bill, and to-day we hiad
a discussion which wvas very informative upon
certain features of the Bill, from the other
standpoint.
Having been a member of this Committee,
aod having attended ahl the meetings, I reahize
that this Bill is surrounded with many teebolcahities and legal details which possibly the
orginary layman bas not been able to comprebend. If my bonourable friend from Moose
Jaw (Hon. Mr. Willoughby), wbo addressed
lis legal argument to the House yesterday,
was appcaling to the Court of Appeal, or even
to tbe members of tbe Committee who beard
the teeboical evidence, lie migbt bave been
uoderstood better than lie was by many members of this House. As I say, the subject is
surrounded witb so many legal and technical
détails that if we shlow ourselves to drift into
a consideration of those side issues, importatt
in themsehves, but necessarily teclinical, we
wilh neyer arrive at an understanding te, what
the main features and principles of this Bill
really are.
I reahize that in this House there are many
members wbo were flot on the Committee,
and they have flot the privihege of hearing
the evidence and discussions in the Committee,
and I can easily understand that there are a
number of members in this House who do
flot yet understand what this Bill in ail about.
To ask them to, vote on legishation so, important as this Bill, without a full comprehension of what it involves, is to my mind hardhy
reasonable.
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

I bave lived in Western Canada for 25
years, and my netivities tbere have brought
me in contact with a knowhedge of the practices in the bandling of grain, both from the
farmer's and the grain deaher's standpoint,
aîthougli I have not had any connection witb
the trade for 20 years, and bave not been
directly or indirectly interested in it during

prejudiced standpoint, but from n fair, impartial standpoint, apart from side issues, and
free from hegal teclinicalities, some of wbich

As 'a preliminary to the discussion of the
mernts of this controversy, let us devote a
few moments to see exactly how mucli grain

and thereby get an idea of the importance of
the issue between these contending parties-,
and in order to get a elear idea of the situation, let us first consider the different metbods
of marketing, and see exa ctly what cîass of
wheat and the quantity of it, wbicb will be
au.ected.
Up to to twenty odd years ago, the Western farmer was confined in bis marketing tû
the use of the country elevators, which were
nt as numerous in those days as they are
to-day. It was in the early days of a pioneer
country, and the farmers claimed that the
country Elevator Companies took advantag-e of tbem, and not only dieprived them of
fair prices for their grain, but also impoeed
on tbem in the matter -of w.eights and grades.
Tbis feeling became general among the
farmers, and led to the original organization
of the Grain Growers' Association in the
year 1901. It was largely due to the agitation býy the Grain Groywe-rs' Association that
tbe first relief legislation was securedi, which
consisted of the necessary provision by the
railway companies of loading platforms. By
means of the loading platforms farmers were
able to load their grain from waggons direct
into cars, and, ship their cars to terminal
points, and seil their grain through commissioned agents who were largely located in
Winnipeg. ThIc toadïng p]atform system, to
some extent, made a farmer independent of
the Uine elevators. These loading platforms
exist at the various shipping points at the
present time, b~ut owing to the increased
facîlities and the more satisfactory treatment
of the farmer in the later days, they have
become obsolete, except in oome parts of
Manitoba. So that the first method -of mar-

14015-254

Now as to the bill itself. This Bill No. 8
deals exclusively with getting grain out of the
country elev&tor once it is in, and to- understand its provisions we muet first understand
how grain is put into the elevator. I arn now
referring to graded grain in general lins, which
is the main class of grain aflected by this
legisiation. When a farmer puts his grain
into the country elevator, hie receives from
the operator a grain ticket which states on
its fade that upon payrnent of charges, the
grain will be delivered to the farmer either
at the country elevator or at any terminal
point the farmer may desire.
Now, how does hie get bis grain out of the
elevator?
This is one of the material points in this
whole controversy. If he takes delivery at
the country elevator, lie gets no guaranltee of
grades and weights, although his grain ticket
provides for sucli; lie muet be satisfied with
an affidavit of the operator that lie loaded
into the farmer's car the saine quantity and
the saine grade as lie received in. This is the
law as it stands to-day. By this Bill Number
8 it is proposed that, aithougli the farmer takes
delivery of hie .carload, and bimself ships it
to a terminal elevator of bis own choice, the
country elevator shall be responsible for any
loss in weight or grades en route. This is the
first point on which the contending parties
clash.
The other controversial question arises iit
case the farmer wants delivery of bis grain at.
a terminal point, a.nd not at the countryelevator. By this Bill No. 8 lie seeks to
compel the elevator cornpany to deliver bis
carload of grain at any particular terminal
elevator at a terminal point, wbich lie hirnself
may designate or choose.
Now, what is the argument on hoth sides?
The pool interests dlaim that the. farmer owns
the grain, that the elevator company is
simply his agent, and that lie should have the
riglit to control his own property, and to say
what terminal elevator bis grain should be
sent to. He also, daims that hie lad ths riglit
by law for twenty-five years, that sudh rigît
was taken away from him by last year's
legisiation, and lie is now simply asking that
it be restored to 1dm; that the elevator coinpany is not prejudiced in any way because
its representatives have the right to lie present
when the grain is inspected at Winnipeg, and
a Government weigbmaster weighs it at any
terminal elevator. The grain trade, on the
contrary, dlaim that the farmer bas bad the
riglit for twenty-five years, and still bas, to
name the terminal point to wbich bis grain
saal lie sent, but not the terminal elevator, as
provided for in Bill No. 8; that the proposed

388

SENATE

Bill would make their elevator system a collection agency for their competitors, the pools,
at the 1,300 points where such poois have no
elevators; that the elevator systems are compelled by law to receive any farmer's grain,
and to compel them at the same time to
quarantee weights and grades et rival terminal
elevators after the farmer has had possession
of the grain en route, is unfair and unjust.
They argue that if the pools want to do
business at the thirteen hundred points where
they now have no elevator, they should build
and operate their own bouses, and flot seek
to compel the Elevator Companies by law, to
place their large capital investment at the
disposai of rival iuterests, simply to enable
the pools to carry ont their contracts with the
pool farmers whcreby they are bound to accept
their grain whether they have facilities or
neot.
Those are the dlaim-s of the two parties.
Now, what is the solution of this; contreversy? I must confess I have hiad some difficulty in arrivlng at, a conclusion to guide my
own action in supporting or opposing this
Bill. The grain trade dlaims there is unfairness in the legislation, and that it practicalhy
amounts to confiscation
of their property.
Whihe it contains elemnents of injustice, I
wvould not go so far as to sav thaýt it ýinvolves
confiscation. Thiere are occasions when seeming injustices, are imposed by -legisiation.
Public opinion becomes so pronounced at
times that the general good takes precedenýce
over personal or private interests. Take the
case of prohibition for instance. Sentimýent as
wide-spread as the Dominion itef dernanded
that the operation of bars for the sale of

liquors must be remnoved from hotels, and
notwithstanding illions of dollars invested

in the hotel business which were practically
ruined, the general gond was considered first,
and the cry of vested interests did flot awaken
much sympathy. The unp.recedented movement by the farmers which culminatod in the
formnation of tise grain pools is so prnnounced
that we are practically asked to disregard
private interests in order that their demands
xnay pre-vail. We are brought face to face
with this issue in Bill No. 8. Perhaps the
statements of representatives of the farmers
themnsei'ves may help us to a conclusion.
Mr. Forke, the leader of the Progressives,
in another -place, opposed the samýe Bill lest
year, and gave his reasons. Honourable gentlemen may have read them, but I will, put
themn upon tie record:

Hon. Mr. LAIRD.

cOrne effort to niake the staternt, but I cannot v.sw
it in any other way. If you put reaponsibilities upon
the local elevator you must give that elevator also
anme privileges to proteet its own interest. The farmer
lias a1wayrs a riglit to ship his grain te, any terminal
elevator lie may cheose, but if lie dooe se, ougl

but I arn doing wliat I lielieve to lie in the interest o:
jusýtice in veting as I propose te do on tlie measure.

It is true Mr. Fork-e suPPorted the Bill haif.
heartedly this year, but he cannot recall hiwords of lest year, as the situation bas not
changed. in the meantinîe. If I was forced tc
a conclusion one wey or the other just now,
I think I wou'ld be inclined to support Mr.
Forke's opinicn. But happily I see a mediumn
course to follow which gives us a loophole
whereby the farmers' pools mey attein the
end they desire, white at the same time doing
nuo injustice to the grain trade.
During the sitting of the Commiittee the*
recognized spokesmanb for the elevator companies stated that they were prepas-ed to sell
to the pool an elevator et each of the 1,300
points- where the pools are not presently represented; that in case of dispute they would
allow the Board of Graàn Cominissioners to
decide whet partricular elevator was to be
sold; and they were prepared to arbitrate the
price and ternîs. That wes his statemient before the Committee. Tse, question then arises,
are the pools :P, a position financially to take
up this offer? The evidence before the Cutimittee shows that the pools withnold two
cents per bushel on every bus)eýl the pools
inarketed for the purpose of building and
extendinýg their system. llandling fifty per
cent of a $400 000,000 crop, this wotsld give
themn $4,000,000 annuelly in cash to devote to
this purpose. The eviýdence furthei showed
that the cost of a new elevetor of 30.000
bushels cepanity was approximately $10,000.
and that the Manitoba Government hed sold
70 elevatord hast year to thse pools at an average price of $7,000 each. So that $8,000,O0C
would he .reqîired to equip the pools with an
elevator at every one of the 1,300 points at
which they are flot presently
rppresented.
With $4,000,000 in cash annualhy availablE
for thse puýrpose, it is olear that the pools
could easily finance the transaction, and be
in a position to have an ehevator et every
shipping point in the three Western Provinices, ready to handle the 1926 croip.

JTULY 1, 1926
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: As evidence oif the
prantkinUbity and deairabiity dif acoeptiing
thi8 proposal, Mr. Burneil, Vice President of
t~he Manitoba W'heat Pool, ropresenting ll
pools before t1he Committee, went so fer as
ta tell the Committee that if he 'were general manager of the pools he would accept the
offer, 1but ie did not think tihe farmers
generally would do sa, beoause bhey feit
tihat the elevator companies ihad taken
unidue tolla ïro~m -the farîners in the
past, and that tlhey wo'uld not mae ta
buy back with their own money what they feit
was ini a measure, their own property.
My awn opinion is that this Bill shauld lie
held aver until the warring factions can get
together and work out a solution which would
prove mutually satisfactory. I agree with Mr.
Burneil that the proposition made by the
grain trade is f air and should be accepted. If
their desire is ta became tharaughly eatablished
in business immediately s0 that they can
camply with their contracte with the farmers
ta accept grain at every shipping point, here
is their chance an fair and equitable terms,
doing nobody an injustice, and costing no
mare than it would cost thema by a policy of
building new elevatars; and it would relieve
Parliament of the anus of passing legislation
which, whether rightly or wrongly, is feit ta
be confiscatory and unjust, by established
interests. If the Senate can effect a solution
along these lines, they will be doing a good
service, and a service too, for which they
have a splendid precedent. Honourable gentlemien will remember that in the Session of
1924 thia House refused ta apprave the construction of a railway in New Brunswick and
a railway in British Columbia at a cost of
$5,000,000, which railways were ta parallel the
existing uine of the Canadian Pacific Railway.
The Bill was held over for a year on -the undergtanding that the parties would get tagether and arrange for running rights for the
Canadian National Railways over Canadian
Pacifie Railway tracks. This was done, and a
saving effected ta the country of approximately
S5,00O00. I think the same principle should
bce applied ta this Bill No. 8. The parties
should came together immediately and arrange by mutual consent, what is proposed to
be done by this legielation, and thereby relieve
Parliament of the necessity of passing legislatian whieh, no matter what the argument may
be, la bound ta do injustice ta one side or the
other.
The principle which I have suggested would
nat bc a new one, and would nat be one w'ith
whieh khe pools have had no experience, because they have adopted it in the Province
of Alber~ta. Some time ago they stated ta the

389

grain trade that they proposed ta buikd, elevators at 30 different points, and suggested' the
purchase of existing elevators il the trade
approved. The result was that the trade gat
together and apportioned the elevators in
every one of the places mentioned, and the
pool has purchased them and the transaction
is row gaing through.
Now, honaurable gentlemen, in order ta
carry into effect the suggestion which I have
madle, I propose ta move an amend'ment ta
section 1, which reads as fol.lows:

At the same time, sa that honourable gentlemen may more intelligently consider this

ta move at a later stage, reads as follows:

The offert of the Bill with these amendmonts 'added is sirmp:y this. Claýuse 1 stands
as Vtis with the addition of a statement that
it is Vo corne into effect by pwroc1aaation
publishod in t'le Canada Gazette,. and i't wýit
remain in force for one ycair from the date
it is assentýed to.
I propose to move another arnendruent to
carry ou't the rarbitration idea. It will impose
uipon t.he grain trado the necessity, if they are
required so to do. to sodil one or more elevatoirs
at each place upon terras to be arbi'trated
upon and for other cconsidteratiuns n.pGn iioh
the Board of Grain Comimissioners shahl ho
the ailbitrators. There is no obligation on the
part of th-e pool to accept it; the obdigation
is on the part of the grain trade to soul in
case tihe pool doutre Vo boy.
Under these prciposals the pool wiil;l recpive
the licgislation they have asked for, and in
addition they wil have the ýopportunity of
purdhasing eleviators at the 1.300 points where
they are ýnot ropresentod, and the terms on
whirh ýthey may make the purchase are ýail
stvbjert to arbiý)itriation proceedings.

The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: The amendment propcsed is as follows:
T7hia section ahall came loto force on such date as
mnay ha fixed by the Governor in Counicil by proc1arnationk pdW.ished- in -the Canada Gazette, and shali remrain in force for a period not exceeding one year
from the date that it is assented to.

Should flot that ha proclaimed?
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Does not the honourable gentleman require ta alter that?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: "This section -shall
corne into force"-is very unusual. It should
be "This Act shall corne into force."
Hon. Mr. GORDON: BefiDre the arnendment is put, I want ta ask a question in
reference ta the amandment. Does it flot
state whether there is one elevator or more?
Ho>n. Mr. LAIRD: We are flot considering
that naw. That is another section.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable gentlemen, as 1 understand it, the affect of the
amendrnent now k3ubmitted by the honaurable
member for Regina (Hon. Mr. Laird), together
with notice that ha has given of a further
ameniment, is that the first section of the
Bill before us shall ha approved subjeet to
it becoming effective as and when the Gavernor in Council may issue 'i proclamation
bringing it into force.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: For one year.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTBON: And to continue
in force for one year. There are reasone, in
my humble opinion, why Vhat would ha wise.
The honourable member for Bedford (Hon.
Mr. Poqpe) yesterday made a very happy and
clear prasentation of the facts that probably
led up ta the coming into exstence of the
wheat pool. That às; to, say, the Western
farmers fait that thay had grievancas. Doubtless some of them war.e reai, and many
imagin-ary. Neverthaless, in theit estimation
they were real, and they finally resulted in
the wheat pooî arrangement for the marketing of grain.
'JIhat is only a repetition of what bas
occurred in other ldnes of activîty in our
national lifa-in the lindustrial field and aIsewhare. Those who feel aggriaved set about
by collective action to remedy their grievance.
In other activities whare men have finally
succeaded da adjusting 'their grievances we
have seau that they are proue, thinking.they

39

have the whip-hand and that they may treat
the other fallow as ha trea.ted tham, to take
advantage; and I ver>' much fear that if
this legisiation were passed without an>' restriction just such a situation might result.
Although not a member of thc Committee,
I listened to the discussion and the evidance
submitted ta the Committee, and was much
impressed with what was said b>' one gentleman,. who was representing the~ pool in the
capacit>', I thînk, of secretar>' of the joint
pooi for the thrae Provinces. It was refarred
to b>' the honourabla the junior member for
Moose Jaw (Hon. !Mr. Willoughby), though
not quite in the identical words used b>' the
gentleman when hae gave his evidenca. A
gentleman representing the elevator interests
said that the elevator people wera !prepared
on a fair basis of agreement or arbitration to
place tha pool in possession of a country
elevator at evar>' point whera they did not
already have one, so that tký pool would
have their own facilitias for sanding grain to
their own terminaIs, and that it was a fair
proposition. A gentleman rapresenting the
pool agraed, and eaid yes, that sa far as his
parsonal view weut, it was; but hae further
said: "I have no authorit>' to accapt it; I arn
acting only in a representativ2 capacity. If
I had authority, I would say that as a business
proposition it was a fair ana." I think ha went
ta the extent of saying that ha would ha inclined to accetpt. Ha was then asked why the
people ha represanted would not acoept it;
and what, did he sa>'? To my mind it was
tha most significant statement of aIl the
evidence givan; ha eaid because the farmers
falt that those elevators had in years past
paid for thamselves several timas over, and
the>' were not gaing ta pay for them
again. Now, I do not beliave that expression
represents the views of aIl of the 12500
farmars who are members of the pool, but it
evidently> represeuts the ambition of certain
gentlemen who are pramoting this legislation.
Hon. Mr. DANDUR.AND: I did nat miss
one minu~te of the Com.mittee- meetings, but
I confess that the. statement from the lips of
my honourable -friand surprises me.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: Oh, fia.
Hion. Mr. DANDURANID: Well, I undierstaod that the pool were noit ready ta pay the
price that was a9keýd, and that the>' wauild
rather in some instances bui1d their own
elevataors; but whèn the grain trade saw that
tht>' were in eamest about building elevators
the>' reduced their -prioes to a considerable.
extent, and then, the>' bought.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I fear my honourable friend must have misse-d that pairticular m'mark, because, I understand that
several gentlemen who were present at that
hearing recail very vividly the startling suddenness with which it dawned upon us what
the gentleman s-aid and nieant. To carry that
same thought a little further, what does it
mean? Scores of times I have heard gentlemen engaged in agriculture in the West, state
that out of the sale of a single crop they had
paid for their section of l]and, in tlimes of good
crops. I have known the West rather intimately for over 20 years, and consequentIy
speak with some knowledge of western conditions, thougn I arn an eastern man. Tbough
for perbaps 10 years a given fainmer had
raised enough off his section of land to pay
for Ithat land year after year. Surely ro one
would for a moment say that that was any
reasýon why somebody %hould go in and say:
"I amn going to take your land and raise the
crop on it nextt year." That is what was
meant by the sýtatement ithat was made, and
1 say that Parliament cannot ]end itself to
any legisiation that wotfld bring about that
result.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Was that gentleman speaking for himself, or for the farmers
at large?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
He was esked
why the farmers would object to the acquitin.g of elevators on the terrns suggested by the
gentlemen representing the elevator company,
and that was bis reply.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: 1 de not think it
is fair to quote, as the opinion of the wboIe
farming eommunity of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Aliberta, a statement of that kind
made by one man.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I diistinctly said
that I cid not know that the farmers held
that view, but I said that the gentleman representing the farmers did, and when. the
pool contraIs 125,000 farmers it is not tLhe individual farmers who have the disposition of
that grain, but it is the pool.
The honourable gentleman from Moose
Jaw (Hon. Mr. Willoughlby) said yesterday
that any company might be put out of busin'ests if it was determined to take such a
course; therefo'e I feel that Parliament ought
to exercise care to see that no one interest
takes undue and unjust adivant-age of another.
Here is a pronosal made in good- .faàth, ohviously, where the grain interests say: "We
agree that aur friends of the -pool are at a
disad'vantage because tliey 'have not elevators at alI the 1,717 counitry points. We are
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

pérepared to selI them an elevator at every
point where tbey have not one. We are prepared to let îhem choose the elevator t.hey
wvould prefer at each of those points, and in
fact where there are several elevators and
they want more than one we are agreeahle
to sell the-n what thieir requirements caîl for.5'
They further said that if the parties could rot
agree on a price that was acceptable as fair
to both. they were prepared to adijust the
differience by arbitration.
The, carrying out of that suggestion would
mean that the grain tiradýe was a.ssisting to
put the pool in possesýsion of elevator facilities
at every coun-try point, so that every pool
fariner couýld send bis grain through the pool
country elevators to the pool terminal elevator, andi then the rtwo interests would be in
diirect competition with each othrr, neither
having an advantage oveir the other.
But without that, by reason of the law as
il stands~ to-day. the pool farmer, who represents 50 per cent of ail the farmers in the
Prairie Provinces, may bring bis grain to the
lune elcvator, and if the line elevator is ful!
those fariners. representing haîf of the grain
shipped froin the station where there were
perhaps four elevators, may put 50 per cent
of the total pDroduction of grain through nonpool elevators to the exclusion of non-pool
farmrs, and tiherefore force non-pool farmers
into lte pool against their will.
In other
words, we wolild have wvhat in other quarters
would be called the closed-shop principle.
Furthermore, sending that grain through the
non-pool country elevators to the pool
elevators would, leave the non-pool elevators
stndinig idle at t'he h'ead of tlhe Lakes; and
I ýýay that Parliament ought not to ]end itself to assi;ý"t in making possible a situation
of that sort.
Parliament ought to say to both parties,
who we helieve, from what we have heard
to-day, are practically in accord, that their
differences should be adjusted on the basis
of negotiations for country elevators, and of
supplyiog the necessary equipment and space
to handie lte pool business. When that is
done, and when the Governor in Council is
satisfied t.hat both parties are treating each
other fairly, then this legisiation may be
brought into effeet by Order in Council; but
until the Government is satisfied that both
parties are prepared, as we say, to play the
game, neither ought to hie given an advantage over the other.

I hold that to defeat this Bill would, be

wrong, because if the farmers' grievance is
as bas been stated, they would be burdened
by that gievance until another Session of

JULY 1, 1926
not, tlhen by arbitration. 1 think
Parliament at least. Therefore I feel that sible, and if
that is the text and intent of the next amendthe legislation, ought to be .passed, but that
which, if adopted, will make t.his perit ought not to go into effeet until the differ- ment, clear.

permitted to put their grain through the line
elevators to the disadvantage of the non-pool
farmer, and also to disadvantage of the
elevator people so far as their service to the
whole community is concerned.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: In my judgment there
is a point in the question asked by the honourable member for Assiniboia (Hon. Mr.
Turriff). We must put the boot on the other
foot. At present the pool bas in the neighbourhood of 20,000,000 capacity at the head of
the Lakes. I dare say they claim that they
require that capacity for the number of
elevators they now have; we must assume
that. The greater proportion of that capacity
came froin the Saskatchewan Co-operative
Elevator Company. Now, let us assume, for
argument's sake, that they buy 500 country
elevators. Will they, in turn, have sufficient
terminal facilities to handle the grain that
would come from those additional 500
elevators? There is a possibility that they
would not. Just as I argued for the other
protection, I am going to argue now. If they
have not sufficient capacity to handle the grain
coming from the 500 additional country
elevators that they purchased, then I must say
I have not grasped the full force of this
amcendment.
But if in turn, through the
Board of Grain Commissioners, they should
have the right to acquire such proportionate
space in those privately-owned terminal
elevators as is necessary to take care of their
share of the grain, I think that is a matter
that could very easily be arranged by the
Board of Grain Commissioners and the trade.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Is it net correct
to sav that during the rush season for handling
grain it often occurs now thajt when one
e evator at a terminad point is full, be it a
pool or non-pool elevator, that grain is
diverted by agreement, or by order of the
Grain Commission, so that no congestion is
perrnitted to occur at terminals so long as
there is elevator space available, either pool
or non-pool?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That is not the
point. I quite agree that the grain is taken
care of in some wav; but now I am going
to assume, and I think I am rigrt in my
assumption, that the Saskatchewan
Co
operative Elevator Company did not build
more terminal space than was necessary for
its line elevators, some 450, the buk of which
eleva.tors are now owned by the pool. We
must assume that they have net built more
space than was necessary. Now we assume
that the pool may go out and purchease or
acquire in some way 500 additional country
el eva tors.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Or 1.000.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Or 1,000, and they
in turn have the necessary terminal faciilities
to take rare of the grain that cornes through
their elevators. My argument was aM the
other way-that we had no right to stap
in and compel privately-owned elevtors to
take care of pool grain; but I am prepared to
argue now that the pool shiould be placed in
a position where it will be required te 'have
terminal elevators to take care of its grain.
So I think there should be an amendiment
made te the effect that if tihat condition
arises, the Board of Grain Commissioners
shorld have the right to step in and adjust
that situation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Have we not
had the statement in the Committee that with
the limi'ted number of country elevators which
the pool had, they sent out f(ar more wheat
than their terminal elevators could take care
af, and that a very large proportion went
over to the private elevators?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That was because
of the contract which the pool made with the
grain trade.
Under that contract every
e!evator in Western Canada gathers grain for
tihe pool, and the pool has not sufficient
termina-l facillities to take care of that grain
whieh it gathers from private country elevators. That wvas tie reason why they 'had
to turn over to private terminals a very large
proportion of the grain belonging ýto their
members.
At 6 o'iock the Committee tok recess.
The Conimittee resumed at 8 o'cirýk.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would as. the
honourable gentleman from Regina (Hon.
Mr. Laird) the purport of the amendment
which is now before us. I can understand the
first part, which reads:
Section 1 of this Art shall not come into force until
such date as nay be fixed by the Governor in Council
by proclamaýtion published in the Canada Gazette.

But what is the idea of limiting the operation
of this clause to one year, after which it will
be null and void, and will disappear froin the
statute as if it had been repealed? It is very
exceptional.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I understand that the
parties interested were satisfied with that
and had fixed upon that formula as a settlement of one part of their dispute-that it
would be in force for a year, and that after
that time it would net be needed; that the
Governor in Council might proclaim it at

JULY 1, 1926
the end of the first rnonth after the Bill
received the Royal sanction; that then it
would be in force for eleven months, but that
at the end of that time it would be ahi off,
and would not be needed. That i, what I
understeod. 1 may be wrong.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honoureble
friend surmaises frorn the reeding of the clause
thet the need wi'll disappear-that during
twelve rnonths certain things wili corne to
pass which will meke the legislation unneces4aary?
Hon. Mr. ROSS: I do not surrnisL it fromn
the clause; I surmise frorn the conversations
and frein all that I heard before thc Committea thet if you srnooth out thl:s metter
for twelve months the situation will have
solved itseîf owing to the very na.turc of it.
There will be enough elevators built or
acquired under this Act to settle the whole
matter.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: Do I understand the
honoureble Leader to sny that the Ao(t would
remain in force only twelve montlis after it
had received the Royal sanction, or that it
would remain in force twelve rnonths3 after it
is proclairned?
Hon, W. B. ROSS: Yes, after proclamation.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: I could understand
a provision of that nature if it affected a
se4ction similar to the one which. I underztand
the honoureble member frorn Regina (Hon.
Mr. Laird) is going to hring in as an amendment after this; but when it relates to section
1 of the Bill1 I cannet understand why it
shouhd only remain in effeet for one year.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: It mgy neyer corne
into eflect et all.
Hon. Mr. Gordon: That is iust the point.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: It is a very simple
matter to me. This has been forced on the
Senate in the dying days of the Session. We
have ne ver had the evidence printed, and
anyone listening to this discus:on would be
very rnuch rnystified. The situation needs
ciearing itp. If we say we will deal with t1i s
now for only a yeer we will be doing no harm
one way or the other, and after that time or
before the eyÂpiry of the year w'e may be in
a better poetition to deal with the situation.
I thinlc ry honourable friend wihl agree that
the situ-ation is rather a difficult one. I for
one would like to reed aIl the i2vidience before
saying what conclusion 1 should corne to. I
think this is a wise provision. It cennot do
any herm in the meantirne, and will clear up
the situation.

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I thought the shorthand reporters were there.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: They were there for
part of the tirne. Was not the evidence te.ken

Hon. MT. DANDURAND: I tried to obtain

in order to refresh rny rnerory, and 1 was

Hon. Mr. MURPHY: The honourable gentleman is essurning that this would corne into

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Suppose this body
in thei-r wisdom, decide to rai ect the Bill entirely, it wouid be inert?
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Quite sn. The effect
is just the sarne.
Hon. Mîr. TURRIFF: Througi faulty hearinýg, or otherwise, I have not been able to
understand the position we would be in if
the arnendrnent were carried. What I went
to know is what would happen if the amendment were carried and the proclamation
delayed a year.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: The Bill would be
dead.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Wou!d Me Bill as

Hon. Mr.,MoMEANS: Yes.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
On this point,
I understand that there is one gentleman Who
does not occupy the most iprominent position
in the pool, and who has been here with more
important or 'more responsible representatives,
and who ie now confronted with th:s offer
whic)h is made. I do not know whether he
is jumping at it or is bowing to necessity, but
he fias not got in contact with the three pool
organizatilons of 'the Western Provinces, and I
would not îaccept the statement that the wheat
growers of the West are satisfied with these
amendiments unless the 'representatives cf the
three Prov)inces in the two Chambers expressed their satisfaction. Of course, if the
representatives of the three Western Provinces
in this Chamber declare that they are satisfied, and that they speak for the wheat
growers of their Provinces, that may be sufficient to carry the amendment.
Hon. Mr. CORDON: You speak of the
wheat growers of the West. I suppose you
mean tihe pool?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I mern the
farmens, because I do not believe there is any
antagonism between the wheat growers of the
West who are in the pool and those who are
outside. Those who are not in the pool have
conti'nued doing business as ieretofore, and
are awaiting the experiment of the pool 'to
decide whether or not they will come in. As
I understand it, there are not two facitions
in the West. I believe that there is no rivalry
between them, but that the non-pool farmers
are lookdng with sympathy upon an experiment which may be a great success, and
in which they may join.

Hon. Mr. SHARPE:

Mr. Hoey, who is here

representing the pool, consulted the members
in another place, and had their consent.

Hon. Mr. MURPHY:
may I inquire?
Hou. Mr. MeMEANS:
bers.

Whieh

members,

The Liberal mem-

Hon. Mr. SHARPE: No, the farmer members, tbe Progressives of the other House,
and fie bas given bis approvad to that amend-

ment.

Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Does the honourable
gentleman say that the gentleman to whom he
has referred consulted with the farmer members?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: From the tlhree
Western Provinces?
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Ail the members from
the three Wejtern Provinces?
Hon.

Mr. LAIRD.

Hon. Mr. SHARPE: I could not say that.
He consulted a large number of them.
Hon. -Mr. TURRIFF: There must have
been a misunderstanding on the part of my
honourable friend, because -the gentleman he
names as representing the farmers-I do not
know whether herrepresents the farmers or not

-is a pool man?
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Yes.
Hon. -Mr. TURRIFF: But
authority.

he has

no

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: He is an official.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: He bas no authority
from the pool members in Alberta, Saskatchewan, or Manitoba, to accept these amendments, and could not accept them if he
wanted to, and I doubt very much if be does.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: I was just going tc
remark, as Mr. Hoey's name was mentioned
before six o'clock, that I happened to meet
him in the dining-room to-night. I asked him
if he had agreed, and he said: "No, certainly
not. I have no authority to agree, and I am
not going to get mixed up in this affair."

Hon. -Mr. SHARPE: I met Mr. Hoey on the
road to this Chamber since I had my dinner,
and he told me he had no authority to speak
for the pool, but, so far as he was concerned
personally, he would accept the proposition,
and that would be his advice to the pool.

Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I do not know what
the procedure in this House may be, but it

is customary, I think, in legislative assemblies
to hear a statement of this kind from the
honourable gentleman promoting the Bill. That
occurred to me when the honourable gentleman from Regina (Hon. Mr. Laird) stated
that he had not any knowledge on the subject,
but that his information was thus and so.
May I inquire from the promoter of the Bill
whether the amendment in the form in which
it is before the Committee is acceptable to
those for whom the honourable gentleman
bas spoken, and spoken very well.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: May I ask for whom
the honourable gentleman on the other side
are speaking?
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: I am speaking for
myself in my capacity as a member of this
House.
Hon. Mr. McCORMICK: As a member
from the East, I have tried to gather from the
discussion that I have heard how I should act
and vote on this matter. I gather that during
the early years after the colonization of the

JTJLY 1, 1926
Prairie Provinces there was no other means of
transporting and handling the grain exoept
that provided by some men who invested. their
capital in this enterprise under the sanction
of the law. With the development of the West
-which we are ail pleased to see-we find
that the farmers and the people who are
settlecl on the prairies have attained a better
position, and they feel that they 9hould
receive ail the advantage possible from the
growing and handling of the product whicli
they raise. Nobody quarrels with that idea.
So far as I arn able to gather from what I
have heard, there is an attempt to take frorn
certain people what they had before-that in
the past two or three years there has been a
change with regard to the handling of grain
owing to the acquisition by the pool of a
very large proportion of the grain-handling
facilities. Notwithstanding ail the doleful tales
that we have hcard about the miseries and
hardsbips of the people of the West, they are
now in a position to expend sorne of their
rnoney in providing these facilitiezs, and perhaps they desire to acquire some of the incorne of those people who originally invested
their capital during the early years. While we
desire to give the farmers every possible
advantage from the growing of grain and the
other products of the prairie, speaking f or
myseif, I do not want to perpetrate an injustice on the people who under the law of the
country invested their capital in the first
instance to facilitate the handling of grain
when there wa.s no other way of handling it.
For this rea.son I arn in accord with the amendment of the honourable gentleman from
Regina (Hon. Mr. Laird).
Hon. Mr. GIIÀLIS: It seema to me somewhat unfortunate that the names of persoa
either for or against- this Bill should have
been rnentioned in this House. It is an
unusual thing. This Bill bas been before this
House for a considerable time, and we have
had every opportunity of considering it both
before the Banking and Commerce Committee
and in the House for some days pazt.
As to the Bill itseif, I nsight say that at
the outseM I was in favour of it, and I still
favour the principle of the Bili-. I f'eel that
the fa rmers of Western Canada who produce
grain by their own toil should, have every
opportunity of marketing it to the very best
ad1vantage. On the other hand, it is contended
that certain inte4 reste will be diaturbed by the
passage of this Bill.
I arn not going into any djetails, because
the Bill has been discussed in every shape
and form, frorn every standpoint. I have
corne to the conclusion that under thbe

397

arnendment of the honourable gentleman from
Regina (Hon. Mr. Laird) there is a possible
chance of matters so adjusting tbemselves
during a period of gay one year, as Vo ei.able
bath parties to corne together and s0 arrange
that no hardship will be imposed 1upon anyane. I think that we should eliminate altogether the feelin. of any outsiders, and
view this Bill from the standpoinit of the
general interest. Let us deal with this matter on its own merits. These are my viewc on
the question.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, one cannot 4idscuss this amendment without thinking of the other one which
will follow. This arnendment recognizes the
principle cantained in the Bill, and accepta
the point of view of the farmer who olaims
that he should have the right Vo select his
own terminal cievator, but limite that right
to a year; and the amendrnent tel!s the tirade
that this concession is made Vo the pool ruerabers because there is added Vo it an obligation on the pool to 'buy a certain number of
their elevators in the country.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: No, there is no
obligation at aIl.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: There is an obligation
on, the grain trade to selI, but no obligation
on the pool to buy.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No, but the
pool will only geV Vhis legislation by Order
in Council if it bu-ys those elevators. That is
the question I put Vo my. honourable friend
from Welland (Hon. Mr. Robertson), and he
Eaid that certainly the Order in Council or
proclamation would not issue if the pool did
not buy elevators aM those various points. I
do noV know how many they are to buy; is
it a thousand?
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: T-hen. I read the
amendiment wrongly. I understood that it
referred only Vo section 1 of the Bill, and did
naV refer to the second amendrnent at alI.
The Act does not corne into force until proclamation by Order in Council. That doee
noV applyto the second arnenclient proposed
by the honourable rnernber for Regina (Hon.
Mr. Laird).
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But the two
amendments stand 1together, and f oTrm part of
the whole scheme. The transfeir of the authority of Parliament Vo the Governor in Council is for the purpose o>fhaving the three
pools give a fai.r deal in the purchase of the
thousand elevaitore that fihey will need at the
pointe where rhey have no elevators, and I
arn told that these powere given Vo the Gov-

SENATE
erement will act as a leve-r for bringing into
action the th'ree pools, and forcing 'theim ta
do the fair thmng by the grain trade, by buying those elevators.

ification, t.hat if bis Government had been
je the samne position, and proposed the same
thing, he eould have iooked te me as one of
bis supporters.

The bonourable
Hon. Mr. MoMEAINS:
gentleman seems to, forget that there bas
been a recent change of Goveroment.

Well, thore is
Hon. 'Mr. DAND1JRAND:
one thing that surprises me vea-y much. Here
is the grain trade that says: ",We have $85,000,000 of capital invested, in thîs venture,
and' you are about to wreck oiar erganization,
and wipe eut our capital; and' yet te-day we
feel that if the pool eperators wilI huy a
certain number of our country alevaters at
a cost of $7,000,000 or $10,000,000 we will be
satisfied." I cannot understand that position.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Why should my
bonourable friend be se much affected or
baunted by 'that idea, becauise the Government of yeslerday is not the Goverrement
of to-day? How long is the Goverement of
1 arn tbinking of the

six mnonths? But I ask my honourable friend
from Manitoba: if I dared a month ago to
corne before this Chamber and ask for that
power for my Governmcnt, would he have
stoo(l tp and voted for it?
Under the samp,
Hon. Mr. MoMEANS:
cirClImstalcO.s 1 would. 1 woffld net oppose

we cannot tell. Under these conditions I can
assure mv henourable friend. without quaiHn.

Mr. DANDURAND.

But the honourable
Hon. Mr. LAIRD:
gentlemen heard those gentlemen make that
proposition in the Committee?
Hon. Mr.
heard it.

DANDUIIAND:

Oh,

Hon. Mr. LAIRD: It is net for

I

us te

Ueduoubtedly,
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
but I have a right te weigh that offer. They
offer te selI clevators te the pool wherever
the pool bas no elevator. But whit bas that
te do with the principle containod ie this
Bill? The pool people said: "But we can
buy elevators; we can build elevaters; we
can go te yen or te any alavator company
and roake a ýbargain; we can make a dicker;
we can arrange te buy; we de not need the
logislation that is containcd ie the amendmient."
Now, this is what I cannot understand
-that the grain trade are 50 anxious to sell
te outsiders a certain number of their country
elovators, because they would thms strengtben
their rivals; hy se much. They weuid be
putting je the bands of their rivaIs a number
of feeders, and thus hasten the day wben
that competitien would go increasingiy against
them. That is the problemn whicb is facing
me, aed 1 cannet understand why the grain
trade made that offar te the Committea, and
now repeats it te this Chamber througb a
member of the ýSenate.
Wc bave the honeurabie the junior member
for Moose Jaw inferming this ýChamber that
le two or three years the pool people weuld
net need this legislation, bacausa they would
dominate the situation.
SHon. Mr. CALDER: 1 bave been repeatedly
referred te as the henourable member for
We have two membera from
Meose Jaw.
Moose Jaw in the House at present, my old
friend on the other side of the House, Senater
T. H. Ress, whe bas been a Senator for a
good many years, and Senator Willoughby on

JULY 1, 1926 -399
this side. My residence is Saltcoats. My
honourahie friend to the right here (Hon.
Mr. Willoughby) is being credited with al
may statemen te.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The'-bonourable
gentleman from Saltcoats has repeated the
8taternent of sarne of the pool representatives,
that in a very few years they would flot need
this legielation 'because they would dominate
the situation.. Now, to me that is fatal, for
if the pool has the sucicess which it seems to
bave, and if it grows normally, -as it seems
to be growing, they will draw into their
ranks a very large part of the farmers that
are not members to-day. Under those
circumstances it seems to me that it is a very
short-sighted policy on the part of the grain
trade to refuse this legisiation to the pool
farmers, because if they succeed in baulking
it, in having it rejected, they will simply
force those pools to exert tbemselves to meet
that situation, and the pools wilil find a way
of equipping tbemselves, and will do so to
the loss of the grain trade, to their own loes,
and to the loss» of the country, because 1
believe, from what we have been told, that
there are enough country elevators throughout
the West, and enough terminal elevators at
the head of the Lakes, to meet the requirements of the West for some years to corne.
If we do flot grant this legisiation we einiply
aocentuate the activities of the pools, and
their determination to icope with the difficulty
which is presented to them; wbile if we grant
this legisiation, and restore to the farmers
what tbey claim to have been their -righta
-and I believe to have been their rights
under the law of 1912-we satisfy the pool
organizations, who feel that tbey have no
grievance, that they have been deait witb
equitably by this Parliament, and we put
them in a mood to enter into an agreement
wîtb the ellevator companies for carrying on
their business jointly, and to their mutual
satisfaction.
Honourable members of the Committee remenmber that Mr. Pitblado said: "We are
ready, and we have been ready, to make contracts with the pool people to carry their
grain; we did se last year under an agreement."~ That agreement was read to us, and
bie added: "We are ready again to enter into
an arrangement with them." I said to him:
"But you would like te have the whip-hand?"
Re stopped for a moment, and then said:
"Yes, se would thc pool people like to have
the wbip hand in entering the conference, and
discussing with us." Now we are just at the
crux of the difficulty. Who will have the
whip-hand? The grain trade think they have
it Dow, through the legislation passed in 1925.

There is something very extraordinary, hionourable gentlemen, as to what happened last
year. We have the western farmer; we know
his difliculties, how he is handicapped by the
fact that hie is a thousand miles and more
away from the Lakes. MHe is a formidable
distance from his market. Re has to move
his grain to the seaboard, and to send it across
the ocean and ]and it at Liverpool. Wben his,
grain leaves his farm he knows the quotstion
of grain at Winnipeg or at Chicago, and he
secs At leaving bis farm and moving towards
the market. As it moves be has a little
margin of profit, sometimes small, and it goes,
on diminishing, being gradually eaten up, and
sornetimes bis returns leave behind two-thirds
of lis profits, and aIl members who corne from
the West know that in some years his lean
profits were turned into deficits. He has thE
goods, he produces the crop, 'but when it.
cornes to bis returns he secs tbem vanish
because of the formid4bIe cost of transportation and the charges of the middlemen. Re
bas bad suspicions that he has neyer bad a fair
deal; that tbe rniddlemen were watching for
bis grain and sometimes making a large profit,
wbile be bas bardly enough to pay bis hands.
That sentiment bas grown tbrough the West,
and, joined with the difficulty of spreading
returns from bis sales tbrougbout the year, he
has readily corne to the conclusion that the
eo-operative syste-m offered him was his salvatien in the bandling and marketing of bis
grain, and in the selection of the day when it
should be sold.
This is wby 125,000 farmers havé flockect
to tbe pools. Tbey have feared that tbey had.
not a fair return for their grain wben tbey
supplied it to the strange bande that manipulated it as far as the boats.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Pardon nlie. Surely the
bonourable gentleman must kncw that for a
number of years, in every one of the threc
Western Provinces, there bave been farmers'
co-operative companies operating in the grain
business and bandling a ver>' large volume
of the farmers' grain. So te say that this pool
is a new movement on the part of the farmers
cannot be correct.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not say it
is something new, but the vastness of the
movemenit is sornetbing new. There have
been co-operative societies, I know, and grain
organization in the thrce Provinces, but we
bave neyer before seen tbem co-operating
for the single purpose of retaining possession
of their grain, transporting it to the mnarket,
selling it, and getting fromi it a1l the returns
tbcy can after paying what the>' believe to.
be legitimate costs.

I need not repeat that they considered that
there were profits in the mixing of grain and
in the premiums which were being received
and did not come to them. They are proceeding to demonstrate, or they believe after one
or two seasons that they have already
demonstrated, that there are profits there that
should come to them. This appeais to me.
We have been talking at this Session and in
.past Sessions of things that might benefit the
West and the Western farmer. We have passed
the Farm Loan Bill.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: It appeals to all of us
just as much as it appeais to the honourable
gentleman.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, it appeals
to all. The grain trade say that the country
elevator does not pay them; that it means
a loss to them; that they are not receiving
a suffirient fee for the reception of grain at
the elevator. They insist that the country
elevatorHon. Mr. GORDON: Right there, may I
say that I happened to be in the Committee
part of the time, and my understanding was
that Chief Justice Turgeon had stated that
the country elevators made a profit of fourfifths of a cent per bushel.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, but the
grain trade have claimied that that was not
a sufficient return-a paying rate.
Hon. Mr. GORDON:

I sec.

And they have
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
insisted upon recouping themselves at the
terminals. I say, al right, they may recoup
themselves at the terminals for the grain that
is their own. We have been told 'that the
ptrpose in building those country elevators
was first to purchase the grain and then to
transport it to the terminals. On ail the
grain that they control, by purchase or otherwise, they are welcome to all the profits that
they can get from the tu-rover; but it is not
ail rigbt when they say, "We will contrcl the
grain that is not ours and will take the profits
on it as if it were our own grain." If they
were content to do simply on elevating
business in the terminals at the head of the
Lakes, we could understand their operations;
but they are not.simply doing an elevating
business at those terminals and unloading the
grain linto the boats. They perfoun other
operations while in possession of tha't grain,
and that is the reason why the farmer is
striving to retain the ownership of the grain
up to the 'moment when it is sold et that
point.
Hon.

Mr.

DANDURAND.

iI heard Mr. Pithiado explain tlhat the law
before 1925 had for its object to allow the
farmer freedom to chose his terminal point,
but not the terminal, elevator. Mr. Pithlado
made on that point a disquisition which
seemed fairly logical. T tried to girasp the
essentiall ellements of his argument and to
apply his statement to the Act itself. I tried
to get a copy of his opinion: I could not
get it. But when I look at the Grain Act
I am at a loss to understand upon wihat
clauses Mr. Pitblado founded his argument,
for I do not see any point corrobora;ting the
argument that he made. On the contrary, I
find in section 159 that "lif either party so
desires"-that is, the fanmer, or, if the fermer
does not express any wish, the grain company
-the grain is deliverable
-on
track at any terminal elevator in the Western
Inspection Division, on the line of railway upon which
the receiving country elevator is situate, or any line
connecting therewith, so soon as the transportation
coinpany delivers the same at such terminal, and the
certificate of grade and weight is returned.

I have read simply a phi-ase from section
159. Perhaps I should read the section at
length:
Such receipt shal

also state-

That is, the receipt which the farmer gets
at the country ellevator-upon
its face that the grain mentioned therein has
been received into store, and that upon the retun of
such receipt, and upon payment or tender of payment
of all lawful charges for receiving, storing, insuring,
delivering or otherwise handling such grain, which may
accrue up to the time of the return cf the receipt, the
grain is deliverable to the person on whose account it
has been taken into store, or to his order, from the
country elevator where it was received for storage, or,
if either 'party so desires, in quantities not less than
rarload lots, on track at any terminal elevator in the
Western Inspection Division.

Not to any temninal point, but to any
terminal elevator in the Western Inspection
Division. And the receitpt he gets contains
also this same phrase:
Upon the return of this receipt and tender or payment of above named charges accruing up te the time
of the return of this receipt, the above quantity, grade
and kind of grain will be delivered, within the time
prescribed by law, to the person above named or his
order, eiýther from this elevator or warehouse, or, if
either party desires, in quantities of not less than carload lots at any terminai elevator in the Western
Inspection Division.

Not to any terminal point, but to any
terminal elevator qn the Western Inspection
Division.

can proteet themselves and make arrangements with the pool in order to prevent the
pool from building other terminal elevators
and from spending millions off dollars in
duplicating the country plants. We have no
interest in doing anytbing whicha would bring
about that condition of f fairs. Our farmers
in the West need their mýoney. They are nlot
eager to spend, $10,000000 or $15,000,000 to
buy country elevators and to acquire or build
terminal elevators. We are not interested in
allowing them to do so. We know their need
for money. It has been said that Saskatchewan
alone could absorb $100,000,000 of money for
use by the farmers. We are interested in
the prosperity off t-he farmers off the West,
and sbould do everything possible to prevent
them putting their money into a duplication
of elevators througbout the West. As I have
said, there are already enough elevators. Let
us grant the farmers the right, whicha they
had, of declaring where they want their
grain to go, and we will more surely bring
these two great institutions together and
save a large and useless expenditure.
To me the amendinent is absolutely unacceptable.
We should flot give to any
Govcrnnent. a right which appcrtaios to Parliament. We s'bould not put any Government
in the pos.ition off an uimpire or arbitrator
between these two big intcrests. Goveroments
arc, comipoued off buman beings and are often
influenced by political considerations.
My
bonourable friend from, Manitoba (Hon. Mr.
McMcans) last week would have admitted
the soundness off my istatement; now he shakes
his head as implying the opposite. Sooner
than he thinks be may return to bis attitude
off last week.
I would pexhaps be willing to accept the
last part 'off this amendment, to make this
Bill operative for one year. TFEst would not
be as disagreeahie to me as the whole amendment. There might be some sense in the view
that this Act s-hould be placed on our Statute
Book for a year, to see how . will operate
and how the parties will deal with each other;
but it wouldt be unjust and unwise to throw
upon any Goveroment the responsibility off
sitting- in judgment between these two vast
interest4s. If there is flot a majority off this
Chamber ýin favour off clarifying the Act off
1912, as suggested by Mr. Justice Turgeon,
I would mucb preffer an ameodment wiping
out the clause off the Act off 1925 and reestablishing the fa.rmers in their full rights
under the Act off 1912. But I believe that we
should not involve, the ffarnîers in lawsuits.
1
If we return to the Act off 1912 without any
clarification, it is very likely that lawsuits
Hon.

Mr. TJANDURAND-

would ensue, witb the resuit, I believe, that
the farmers would win. But as I feel that the
farmer bas a right to ffollow bis own grain
to this owvn terminal elevator, 1 am disposed
to vote 'for 'the clause beffore us and against
the amendment proposed by the honourable
gentleman from Regina.
Hon. J. G. TURRIFF: Mr. Chairman, 1
would like to say a word on one phase off this
question that to my mind bas not been dealt
with 10 any great extent. W2 have beard a
good deal in the Banking arnd Commerce
Committee and in th;s House to the effect
that the pool farmers were trying to gain an
advantage over the elevator compaiies; that
what they were really tcyiog to get by the
Bill before us amounted practically to confisc'ation off the rights off men who have put
money into elevators throughout the counltry.
I would like to ask 'the honourable membe-s
off th;s HouQe: Who aske{l those men co corne
ffocward and put their nioncy ,nto elevators?
It was flot the farmers; it w~as the gra:nl
elevator men. And they arc r'ow conmhinecl
into -oie great company.
In years gone by, more especially during
the past few yearsý, compe:tition amor.gst the
elevator men induceci tbem to bu-ild elevators for the use off the farmers aIl through the
country. Tbey wanted to briîg volume, as
they sa-id, to their business, aid to my
knowledge they put up elevators in towns off
a fexv bundred people where there were already two or three elevators doing business
and making money simply as internaI elevators. Two or three companies would have
elevators aIongside one another, aid if there
was a good crop perhaps they would both
make money. But neither off them wvas satisfied. And if someone else attempted to comne
into that town aid bu-ild another elevator,
wbat did tbey do? The old elevator people
bad a good krowledge off the surrounding
country, and they tu-ined to and built, or got
somneone eliao to build another elevator at that
point in order to compete. They put their
money ir there with their eyes open. The
lawyers may say wbat they like about the
law as tbe elevator men understood it and
as the farmers understood it. I say the
elevator men bad a perfect knowledge off that,
but still thýey went on and bu.ilt four or five
elevators at a point that only justified two,
and naturally five elevators could not make
morey where two had done so.
Dhd you ever hear, Mr. Chairman, off anybody being able to get rid off the eovbarrassment off over-building by coming; to Parliament and asking permission to compensate
himseîf for bis ffolly? Take the case off a

as I remember it was that when there was a
bumper crop such as we had last year there
were flot too many.
Hon. Mr. TUIRRIFF: Mr. Burnell in giving his evidence stated, I think, that in bis
own townHon. Mr. CALDER: At certain points, yes.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF:- He said that there
were four elepvators in his own town in
Manitoba, and that the pool elevator took
in,' if I remember rightly, 390,000 bushels of
grainHon. Mr. CALDER: 300,000 bushels.
Hon. Mr. TURRJFF: -and that of the
otheT t-hree elevators, one took in 28,000
beshels, one 40,000 bushels, and onje a littie
less than 40,000-a total of less than 100,000
bushels. That shows that in that town there
were two elevators too many. Even with s
bumper crop there was no more wheat thar
would justify the erection of two elevators.
Tfhe anibition of the elevator companies ta
get a bigger share of the 400,000 bushels marketed there led thern to build four elevators.
Now, should the farmer pay for the building
of those four elevators? He had nothing ta
do with their building. He did~not induce
those men to build the elevators.

merchant, for instance. When there is a good
crop a merchant in the West does a roaring
trade for several months of the year. He éell.s
out his stock at a good profit and buys more
goods. The n'ext year the crop amounts to,
perhaps only one-third of the good crop. What
does the merchant do? He has to curtail bis
business. He probably loses a great part of
what he made in the good year. What would
you think of such a man if he came to
Parliament and said: "I had good business
lastar, I had good business the yeaT before,
and made some money. I went on building
and expending money to put myseif in a
po.sition to do a good business last year, but
last year webad a poor crop, and two or three
new merchants came into the town and built
up-to-.dte stores, and competition was keen,
and I have flot been able to make a dollar
to pay for the improvement.-." That is
exactly the position taken by the elevator
companies., Do you think, -Mr. Chairman, that
the farmer should pay the losses of the
elevator men because they misjudged their
business, and went ahead too fa.st and spent
too much money? We have now in the
three Prairie Provinces two elevators for
every one that is needed, no matter hqw big
the crop is.

having maiketed 1,600 busbels of grain in the
year 1880, 1 kriow sometbing about it. We
had no elevators at that time, and tbrough
lack of them, and lack of licenses for grain
dealers to buy, 1 did not get one dollar, not
one cent, for my 1,600 bushels that I had
piowed and sowed and reaped and thresbed
largely with my own hands; so I Iost my 1,600
bushels of wheat.
The farmer's row has been a bard one, as
my honourable friend from Compton (Hlon.
Mr. Pope) stated the other day. The farmers
have had an uphili row to hoe, but they have
kept hoeing until they have now got into a
better position througb this pool, by which
they think they ýcan 'handie their wbcat and
get ail the profits out of it. They wish to put
their wheat through pool elevators, of wbicb
there is a legitimate number, and they are
willing- to pay- such price to the grain elevatora
for their work as will be sufficient to, make
the elevators pay. But if two or three
elevators are built where there ought to be
one, there will not be sufficient revenue to
make ail of them pay. Should the farmer be
punishcd for over-building? I say no. I say,
let the fermer get his fair share of his own
wbeat.
What do the people of the Prairie Provinces
tbink of this Bill? From aIl 1 have heard 1
believe that 95 per cent of the people of
Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta are in
favour of it, and they do not believe for une
moment that they are doing an injustice to
the grain men, or confiscating their money.
As Mr. Burn-ell said when speaking in Committee about making the farinera purchase
the elevators, they have paid for tbem already,
some of themn several times. From my own
experience I know that in many cases grain
men have paid for tbeir elevetor in one ycar,
and paid for it out of the money of the
farmers. In my little town wbere tbere were
only a couple of hundred people, wbere we
knew pretty weil what was going on in al]
the elevators, au elevator man, wbose building had not cost more tlhan 88,000 or $9,00
in those days wben construction was cbeap,
told me that after the season was over and
tbe wheat was ail shipped out he bad 3,000
bushels surplus. I neyer mentioned this beforc, because I tbougbt the elevator man did
not want it spoken of. That wes a year wben
we had first-olass whet, but I do not remember enytbing about the grades; there
was no talk about grades at that time, eway
back in the eariy ninetica. Many of the
.elevator compenies have paid for the elevator
in one year, and that is what made them su
ready to go on building elevators when tbey
were nut sure of getting a great amount of

wheat to handie. Why should the farmer be
put up against a proposition of that kind?
And wby abould we, by legislation, went tu
make him pay for thet?
I voted for lest year'a Bill. I did not
understand it, but 1 went to a man in whom
I had the greatest confidence, and I saw my
uwn leader in the o'ther flouse was supporting tbe amendment that was put in lat year,
and my friends said it was ail Tigbt. But
aecording to Mr. Pitbl-ado the wbole onus of
that last year's Bill is put on Mr. Crerar and
Mr. Forke. Mr. Forke has repented of bis
sin, if it was a sin to vote for that; he bas
repented of bis action, at ail events, and be
supported the Bill of this year cancelling tbe
clause that was înserted lest year. Mr. Crerar
was down bere, and canvassed for the Bill
lest year, and I think the statement is true
thet it was largely througb bis influence that
lest year's amendment was passed; but we do
not find him down here this year, and do not
find him writing to his friends asking them. to
see that that amendment is not repealed.
Wby? Because, being a good and bonest
man, be sees that it was a mistake. It bas
been said that a foui neyer changes bis mind,
but that a wise man does su soinetimes.
Weli, evidentiy Mr. Crerar bas cbanged bis
mind; certainly Mr. Forke bas, and the Blouse
of Commons bas due su, ail tbrough, because
this Bill before us, as it came to us, bad
passed through the Comrnittee of Agriculture
in the flouse of Communs, which bas 100
members, and th~e Bill gut ail its readinge ini
the flouse of Communs wîthout a single vote
against it.
Now, beonourable gentlemxen, are we going
to vote against thia Bill? 1 arn une of those
Senators wbu believe in the absohite independence of the Senate, uncontrolled in any way
by anyune, or by the Bouse of Gomnmons.
Ever since I camne here 1 bave taken my own
course, not earing much whu it pleased or
wbo is did not please. If I think a Bill ia
rigbt T support it. When a Bill cornes froma
the flouse of Gommons 'I always say to,

what position oan you take?" Unleas I can
say to myscif, and feel, tbat I cen defend my
course successfuliy I will not vote againgt the
wisbes of the elected representatives; but if
I feel that the Bill is not juat, and that I
could not defend paasing it, I do net heaitate

lion. Mr. BEIQUE:
Honourable gentlemen, a gon-d deal of time was wasted, in my
estimation, on aide issues and on things wbieh
were flot disputed when this Bill ivas 'before
the Cornritltee, and I regret that we are doing
something of the sarne kind here, to a certa.in
extent. For the la.st 25 years we h-ave ibeen
called ipon in this Parliarnent to ýpass legisiatien concerning f-armers and the bandling of
grain. As far as 1 arn concerrned. I have
abst-ained as rnuch as possible from tik-ing
any lea-ding part, first, because 1 think thiese
matters principally concerfi the western menmbers. who know the conditions in the W/est,
and a3so beoause for several years I have been
on the Board of the Canadian Pacifie Railway, and 1 feared that my intervention rn'ýght
be interpreted as 'being the e.mpressin oFf the
views of that Comnpany, a conclusion which
I desired to 'avoid. This evening also I u-ouilid
have preferred to follow the sairne course. but
wben a matter cornes to, a point where it is
shocking rny nwn conscience, I cannot allow
any such consideration to prevenýt me frorn
cxpressing xny mind very freely.
The question, I tbink, is very s:mple. We
bave the capitalists who have biiilt vp a large
numnber of elevators, both eoountýry
and
terminal levators. The two clîisees have been

yesterd-Ly it was necessarv in the interests oif

the receivers of the grain ready for sh%,pment. The peopile who 'have invested the very
large (arount of money that bas b.-en

the Grain Act of 1912. Under that Act their
prolperty was 'made a public u'tility. the ýGovernmîent assurned control of it by means of
the Grain Board, and these eievator compaHon. Mr. TtJIRIFF.

nies had te, submit te tihe requirernents of the
law 'and aeept whatever rulings were enacted
by the Board. That was done in the puiblc
intere.9t. That a very large amounit of money
was inveated is not denied; it is adrnitted by
everylbody. It ils said 'that the inve9tmnent bas
been a paying one; that the money originaiy
invested bas been recou'ped.
I would be
ready to admit That it bas been reco.uped
twîice over, 'if you like; 'but I take it for
granted t'hat in those companies, as in others.
the ýinterest is represented by stock whicb is
con.stantly changing hands.
At present it
belongs te A, but to-noprrow it im.ay belong
to B. In the Cornmittee we biad eviden-ce to
the effeet 'that wi'thin the last two or three
years a large arnounit of stock bas been sold
in England and in the United States, and iýt
bias been sold beca-use the inve.stment was
consi'dered a safe and profitable one, the elevators forming 'a, complete chain and being a
public uitility under the control of the Grain
A-et of 1912.
Investors relied L4pon being
protected by the provisions of tbat Act. Tbey
mnust have takcn tbat protection for granted.
At any raýte. 'they bad the riight f0 do an.
I would point niut and emphiasize the fact that
this is verv different frorn the ordinary case.
A manufacturer inve-ta bis money in the
manufacture of a certain produet. A.ltbougb
be niay be protected by the tariff to-day, it
rnay change 'to-mor-row. Tariff cbanges are
takinz place alI the time. Even in that case,
as reasonabic business men do we not consider
t'hat the investor is entitled to a certain
stb'tIs he ot entitled to ex'pet th'at no
ridical changýe will be made and that his
investment will be treated fairl v? If that is
so in the ordinary case. I submit iýt is aIl the
more desirabUe when we are deal-ing with a
public utility.
Now, wbat bave we before us? We have
two parties wbo are at loggerbeads. Tbey
are divided on one point, but satîsfied on the
other; thi-v disagree cntirely as to the effeet
of th(, law cf 1912, but eacb party is satisfled
ihiat the law was in its favour. Wnuld not the
best course be to take thern at their word?
Let us say to tbem: "You botb assert tbat you
had protection under the Grain Act of 1912.
One --- e contends that its rights have been
d
interfered witb by the Act passed last year.
The other party denies that that Act interfered wvith any rights. Gentlemen, we will
re..tore the condition existing, under the Act of
1912, and ynu will then bave no reason to
coimpiain."
If we do that. those wbo have
purchased stock in those companies will bave
no griex once.
On the other band, if we
disturb the Act cf last vear without restnr-

JULY 1, 1926
ing the clause of 1912, we are likely to hear
a complaint similar ta that which was raiseci
in England with regard to the Grand Trunk
Pacifie. Is it advisable to do that? As to the
effeet of the law prier ta 1925, each aide seems
ta be equally positive in its contention. Sa
fer as 1 arn concernecl, I have e clear opinion
on the point, but 1 arn not eelled upon ta
decide .between. the parties or even to state
what my opinion is. Our duty, I think,. ie ta
say: "You bath declare that you were protected by the Act af 1912. Well, we will put
you under that Act and yau will then have
ne reasan ta complain." If we do otherwise
we shahl be acoused either of interfering with
vested rights and jeopardizing the large
amount of capital invested, or of putting one
of the parties at the mercy of the other.
As to the effeet of the present Bill, I think
no one wha lias stuclied it ancl followed the
discussion cen deny that the passing of this
measure wouhd place the grain elevator campany entirely et the mercy of the pool. I amn
ini perfect sympathy with the pool organisatien. I thînk they are rendering service ta
the farmers and proteeting them, ancl I wish
them suecess, but I arn net disposed ta do any
injustice ta their competitors. I think that
what we as honest meni should do would be
ta adopt the suggestion macle by the henourable member from. Saltcoats yesterday, and
that is te repeal the Act of 1925 end give
the paoo1 organization the privilege o! purchasing, if they choose, one or more elevetars et
any peint, by arbitration. I think that wauld
be doing justice te bath parties andi it is the
course which should be adaptecl by this honaurable House.
Will net the honourable gentleman from
Saltcoats move a sub-emendment ta that
effect, which I woulcl gladhy second?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Hanourahie gentlemen, I have no emendrnent, prcjpazed. I
mereiy suggested. during the course of rny
rema.rks what I thouglit were the enly two
possible courses. Apperently the honourable
gentleman from De Selaberry suggests another couime, and that, is that the two .auýggestio>nsthat I have made should, be cambined; in. other worde, that clause 1 of the
Bill should be struck out, and that we should
sub.stitute for it a clause repealing the 1925
provision on the sarne matter and restoring
the clause in the Act of 1912Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Reviving it.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: That is it.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That would suit me,
and I arn prepared to vote for it. 1 have not
the amendment preparedHan. Mr. BEIQUE: The motion is easy ta
make. The honourable gentlemnan has only
to dictdte it.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I arn not quite sure
of that. I understard that we cannot simply
re-enaet the 1912 section, becau»e an amendment pMsed7 last year made some distinction
between public terminal elevators and private
terminal elevators. Just what that amendment is and what changes should be macle in
the law of 1912 1 cannet say off-handi. It would
be necessary ta look up the law. If the Committee adjouxned for fifteen minutes we might
frame an amendment, but I would not like
to do it off-band.
Hon. Mr. MoLENNAN: Let us accept the
prirnciple of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It has been clone.
Hon. 'MT. CALDER: In a discussion II hacl
ith MT. Pitblado before the clinner hour, he
told me that some sliglit amendcment ta the
law, of 1912 wauld be necessary on account.
of a change made in -the Grain Act at the
time of the general rev'ision lest, year. 1 think
the chie! point in connection with 'that is
distinction
that lest year, for the fi.st time, a 1
was clrawn between what are cal ed public
terminal eleva.torsi a.nd private terminal elevators, the private terminal being a mixing
house, a hospital elevator or something of
that kind. Thet distinction would have to be
taken care of in any new amendment that is
madle.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
gentlemen, I arn not going to answer any of
the arguments that have been adlvancecl,
thou.gh I might say something in reply; but I
want ta make an explanation.. I arn placed
în a vety embarrassing position. 1 introduced
this Bill at- the instance of it@'proponent in
the oither Hoifse, Mr. Campbell. He has gone
home and 1 arn unable to corsùilt him.
Hloa. Mr. WATSON- Bring him back.
Hon. 'Mr. WILLOUGHBY: With the exception of -Mr. Hey, whose name 'bas been
mentioned, the representatives of* the pool
have gone home. If I had întroduced the
Bill myself and ¶had, been reeeiving instructions direct from those -who, dýpsite its passâge.
I waurld not hesitate ta aet, for I neyer have
mucli hesitation in acting when I have macle
up my mind, mistaken t.hough I may be.
From what I gathered in a conversation with

408

SENAT E

Mr. Hoey to-night 1 think that although he
is pergonally agreeable in a general way to
the suggested arnendrnent move by the honourable member frorn Regina (Hon. Mr.
Laird), he feels some difficulty about taking
any authority. I mnust deal honestly with
my fellow members. Under the peculiar circumstances in which I arn placed I do not
consider that I have a right to say that I
can bind., one way or another, the people in
whose intere.st the Bill has been promc ted.
I stated my ewn views henestly, and at the
tirne considered I was acting in accordance
with instructions. 1 arn now asked to do
something else. If I were acting for a single
cornpany-for 'instance, a bank or a railway
comnpany--I could get straight and definite
instructions in a short time and make a decision, but in this case the people concernel
are not pre.sent, but are scattered over thp
Prairie Provinces, and I 'have no means of
getting in toucli with them or with the representative who originelly instructed me. With
these few words of explanation, it is my intention not te, consent to anything. So the
Hoose is et liberty te dû as it pleases. I
think that this frank statement on my part
is due to the members of the bouse. with
ivhom I hope te live for long years to corne.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: If there were ne objection we rnight take the sense of the Cornmittee on the question of restoring te the
parties the right they enjoyed under the Act
cf 1912, and of giving the pool the privilege
of purchasing elevators as was stated.Hon. Mr. CALDER: Mr.,Ohairman, I have
n suggestion'to, offer. I have made inquiries
of twe or three persons; who have been initerested in the Bill and, have been carrying
on negotiations, -more or ,less informal,
with the two parties concerned. I have
had nothing to do with those negetiations at alI, :but have kept absolutely
free fromn thern. Now, I arn told that
there is a p'ossibility that this suggestion
rnay net be acceptable to one or other of the
parties. I arn inclined to think we are corning
to a peint at which we rnay reach an agreement, but it seems tee that in arriving at an
agreernent we ebould have sernething in the
nature of an assurance that it. is reasonably
acceptable te, the two interests concerned.
If -we can get that, so rnuch -the better. - I
there any particular :reason why we should
decide this matter to-night? Se far as I can
see, on, account of the condition* in another
place. there ie -ne doubt at aI that, we shahl
sit ail day to-morrow and we shaîl have
practically nothing but this legislation te
deal with. Therefore I woul'd suggest that
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

we again rise, ie order that. those who are
interested in this legislation miay be given a
-further opportunity to bring the parties tegether. I say that in aIl seriousness. I do
not think we should hurry with this Bilh.
Everybody knowa that it is exceedingly contentious, and that there are great interests at
stake. We have two great forces te deal with.
If we possib]y enu, we should arrive et a
conclusion that would be acceptable net onîy
to the House, but te fthc two interests concerned. I would suggest thet those who are
earrying on negetiatiens should have an opportunity of centinuing thern.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:
As fer as I arn
cencerned.. I have ne objection. I had expeoted te 'leave te-Rnorrew rnorning. I have
serne very important engagements.
Hon. Mr-. CALDER: It is now twent y
minutes past ten. If henourable ýgentlemen
have ne objection, I thjnk perhaps -those
interested in the matter and carrying on negetiations 'could get together se tha-t we could
corne back with-in -an hour and settIle ýit.

Hon. Mr-. TURRIFF:
Mr. Chairman, 'I

Sal'tcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder) who has been
carry-ing on the negotiations?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Do not ask me, for
I don't know. I sirnpiy know that negoti-atiens have been carried on.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: By -Whom?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I made a statement,
and I do net intend to -disclose the narnes of
the persons, because I know only one. I
douht very nuch 'whether the House las
entitled te that information. I say that negotiations have been carried on by both
parties. There are certain lawyers and others
here who are interested in this legielation.. I
have been advised that the proposed amendment in its present form. ray net be acceptable te one of the parties. 'If that is se, it
would be very un;fortunate te biave the bouse
express an opinion forrnally and finaqly at
this otage if it is possible to give .the parties
an opportun.ity te get together.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The diffiep.lty
I see is this. The grain trade -is faitly. officially represented; it has its legal -advi.sers

He
had receiver no answers to any of themn when

Therefore I feel that we
are no farther on in our disposition of the
Bill than unfortunately we were last night. I
d-esired to present these facts to the Bouse.
I think it would be in the interests of ail
parties to adjourn until at least the afternoon,
but that is for the Bouse to say.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The staternent
is made ln that telegrarn by the honourable
membcr fron ýMoose Jaw that there is considerable opposition to the Bill as initroduced.
That is bis opinion.
It bas not been very
clearly dernonstrated to this Chamber what
is the extent of that opposition, and t.he
attitude of the grain growers of the West la
givin g their opinion upon those amendments
will nocessarily be condýitioned upon the danger
of the Bill fot passing.
I ama myself in a
similar position.
I wlll strive, oither now or
this aftcrnoon, to have the Seniate declare itself upon the Bill as it stands.
I arn mysei-f
ready to examine into the desirability of
a9cceptlng amendments if I cannot get the Bill
adopted 'by this Chamber in its present f orm;
but 1 arn not ready to accept amendments of
any kind 'before 1 know that there is not a
majority in this Chamber to pass that Bill.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: In other words, my

the political situation la this country. 1 ailowed my honourable friend (Hon. G. G.
Poster) yesterday to 9tate whoet .had taken
place in tbe Committee, but bie did flot state
that on the afternoon or evening of Tuesday,
the 22nd of June, wben we met to consider
that Bill after we had already held two sittings, a motion was made to hear the Grain
Commissioners on the flrst clause. When it
was declared by aIl the parties that we did flot
need the Grain Commissioners on that clause,
1 objected to the motion, because 1 felt that
it would make for too long a delay, whieh
would be looked upon wlth suspicion by the
country. As a matter of fact, on the Monday
ovening, when passing through Toronto, I
had seen tbat the mai ority in the Commons
would be affected by the way the Grain Art
was dealt with. I did not raise that question
hefore the Committee. On Tuesday mornmng
at half-past ten tbe honourable gentleman
from ýMiddleton (Hon. W. B. Ross) asked
that tbe Comnîittee adjourn in order that our
friends of the Conservative Party might go
into caucus. I took it for granted that tbey
wvent into caucus with the Commoners. Ia
the evcning, after that caucus, thiere seemcd
to be a desire to postpone the consideration
of this Bill. The Grain Comînîssioners were
called, althoughl both parties had declared
thiat they did not need the Grain Commissioners, and we lost three or four days. Here
we are in the throcs of a political crisis, with
this Grain Act before us. I should bave liked
the Sonate to dispose of it much earlior in
order that the suspicion might be avoided
that the Senate's action was affected by a
situation existing, elsewhore.
I had to bow
to the decis5ion of the mai ority. I recognizo
that wben, la the following wcek, my right
honourable friend (Right Hon. Sir George E.
Foster) said that on the second clause ho desired to hear 'the Grain Commissioners, the
point wvas well taken; but it was flot well
takon on the first clause on that Tuesday,
wben botb parties had declared that they did
flot need the Grain Comiisioners. 1 foît
that the Sonato would ýbe open to attack for
this dilatoriness in dealing witb the Bill wben
there wvas a criais elsewhere. And 1 desire
to tell my honourable friend that I do not
accept the imputation that 1 arn making any
political capital. I want to remind hlm of
the fact that this Bill bas come from the
Commons with the unanimous approval of
that House, his leaders supporting it and voting for it. Bore we have before us a very
simple question.
Shahl the Grain Act be
changed to what the grain growers want?
Shahl it be clarified as Mr. Justice Turgeon

JULY 2, 1926
recommended or shail it be restored to what
it was ini 1912? There 1 stop. I amrn ot going
into the merits of the question.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: May I asic my honourable friend one question? Suppose we pass
this Bill to-day-suppose we pass it right now;
«Il it get any
-what wiII happen to it?
lurther? Suppose we have a division; what
-will happen?
Hon. Mr. WATON : We have done our
part.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: It will go on Hansard, there is no doubt about that. Some wil
vote for and some against. But why does
xny honourable friend want that? For political
purposes and no other.
No.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Hon. Mr. SHARPE:- You rnay bet your
life. No doubt about that in my mind.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I declared that
1 supported the honourable gentleman front
Moose Jaw (Hon. Mr. Willoughby), who
introduced this Bill. 1 said it yesterday in
no uncertain tone. I now declare to the
Senate that I arn ready to support some
amendmentsHon. Mr. SIIARPE: But why does the
honourable gentleman want to force it now?
H1e knows it cannot become law now. H1e
iknows that as well as any other person.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No. 1 think
it will becorne law if there is a majority in
the Senate to vote for it.
Now, I rose simply to make this statement.
that before considering amendments we ought
to divide on the merits of the Bill as it is.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: I know what you
:are after.
Ho.Mr. PARDEIE: W'hat are you after?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Why should
-the honourable gentleman from MOOSe Jaw
(Hon. Mr. Willoughby) asic us to accept
amendments altering the Bill which has corne
from the Commons, before we know wbether
or not the Senate is ready to assent to the
Bill? I have not consulted the miembers of
this Chamber. I hear from, my honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Willoughby) that there is
considerahie opposition to the principle of
the Bill. -,It must not be forgotten that we
paased the, second reading without binding
ourselves to the principle.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: "Certainly.
And now we
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND;
are at the Committee stage and are about

411

to consider amendments hefore deciding upon
the principle of the Bill. I believe that we
ought to find a way to decide upon the principle and the rnerits of the Bill before attempting to arnend it. That is ail 1 intended
to say. I dislike somte -of those amendrnents.
I dislike as much this morning giving the
Governor in Council the right to stand as
arbiter hetween those two great interests.

principle of self-preservation. I refuse to do
that cowardly act of passing the buck to, the

knows to-day who is in power? It is hecaus3e
we are upon that neutral ground, because
there is no Government of this country at
the present moment, that 1 say; beware, honourable gentlernen of the Senate; beware of
giving that formidable power, that exorbitant
power, that scandalous power, te, a Government, whatever it may be, whether Liberal
or Conservative.
Hon. G. G. FOSTER: Honourable gentlemen, I dislike very rnuch to refer again, even
for one moment, to the events to which I
have alluded on two previous occasions; and
it is not pleasant for me, as a humble mcmber of this Senate, to feel obliged to asic my
honourable friend, even in the beat of ail the
-political excitement whicb surrounds himt and
hie political friends to-day, to keep as cool
as he bas done during the years past in wbîch
he has led bis party in the Senate. There
is nobody, I repeat, who has done anything
ini the Banking and Commerce Comrnittee
that was not f air, square, and abcve-.board,
and everything was done for the purpose of
dealing legitirnately with legisiation after we
had properly considered it. My honourable
frîend bas referred, in a way that does not do
hinm credit, to the fact that be was gracious
enough to aliow an adjournment of the Banking and Commerce Committee in order that
members might attend a caucus. It bas been
insinuated before, in the press and in another
place, that that caucus was a combination of
members of the two Ilouses, and thant the
Conservatives of the Senate and the Conscrvatives of the otber flouse met for the
purpose of caucusîng about this Bill. I want
to tell my honourable friend that that is
absolutely false.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I arn very glad
to hear that.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: I want to tell rny
honourable friend that for four years, owing
to insinuaions of the very character that he,
unfortunately for himself, bas made in this

SENÀTE
Chamber now, I have neyer attended a eaueus of the Gonservative Party with the members of the House of Gommons; and the eaueus that 1 did attend the other day was a
caucus of the members of the Senate to decide upon affaire on this side of the Huse.
and net for the purpose of combining with
the Conservative Party in the bouse of Cornmons as to what should be done with regard
to this legislation or for any other purpose.
I expeet that my bonourable friend will declare that hie bad not been proerly advised
and did not proper]y understand the position,
and that hie will say to those of us who have
made the sacrifice of abstaining from any part
in the caucuses in another place that it was
an unfair insinuation for him, or any other
person, or any newspaper, to make. I repeat
that the Banking and Commerce Cornmittee
in this niatter anld ini every uther, for the last
seven years, have been. as they were for years
before, above suspicion. They have n-ot played
polities; their Chairman has not played politics; and if bonourable gentlemen in the
heat of the excitement that fille this Huse
and this city to-day, forget themselves te
the point of doing an injustice to their
celleagues, 1 for -one repudiate their unfair statements and challenge their righit to
make these insinuations.
Hon. Mr. DANDIJRAND: I arn very glad,
honourable gentlemen, to hear that statement, for it wvas derlared te me, and it was
stated elsewbere and in the newspapers, that
the Conservative Senators had eaucused with
the Conservative Commoners. For my part,
since I was made a Minister, I have attended
one caucus of the Liberals in Parliament.
That was four and a haîf years ago. Sînce
then n-ot only have I flot attended any caucus,
but I have asked the whips on the other side
net te send notices to, the Senators to attend
caucuses, because I preferred that we sbould
remain away from 'the political atmosphere
of the Gommons.
Righit HIon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
My bonourable friend has alluded te, what
took ,place in the Committee prier' to the
request that, the Board of Grain Commqssioners come clown te Ottawa and 'give
evidence, but I do net think hie bas stated
aIl that took place on that special occasion,
The question was raised wbether we should
proceed te an examination of the Bill and
a conclusion upon it, or whether any fuither
evidence should be brougbt. It was suggested
that the Grain Commissioners' shoüld 'be
brougbt down, because' as te, section 1 they
were very intimately connected with the controversy, if you caîl it se, as te bow that
Hon. Mr.

FOSTEn.

originated, and, in the second place, it was
~iaterial te have their evidence on section 2,
a very important section of the Bill. W-hen
the proposition was made what rny honourable friend bas stated rcally took place. H1e
did net see the necessity for calling the Cernmissieners, and urged that it was unnecessary
to do se. Amongst ethers, I took the view
that the second section of the Bill was equally
important witb the first section, tbough of
course along different lines, and I hold that
epinien still. I said that, whilst I would net
care particularly whetber or net the Commission came te give evidence on the first
section, I did tbink it was very important
t-hat they should be present for the second
section. That is why 1 prcssed for the Grain
Commissioners' attendance, and I think it was
perfetly legitimate te do that. I arn glad
te sec that my 'honourable friend admits that
it was important te have the Commissioners
preset te give evidence on the second section
of the Bill.
Now, as regards the Jlittle political or party
flurry tbat we have h'ad bere this rnorning,
it dees net often take place in the Senate.
Ma9ybe we are slightly solemn and overdrawn
at times, and a little excitinz flurry of this
kind stirs the waters and perhaps contributes
te their ultimate purity. I arn net finding any
faîtît with that; but 1 am going te protest
against what may be an impression that party
pulitics is a gaine played in the Bankîng and
I disCommerce Comrnittee of the Senate.
tinctly sa~y that fromn my bcoming a member
of the Senate and of several of its Cernmittees, 1 have 'been rather surprised at the
very commendable absence of party spirit
amongst honourable members wben taking up
measures tbat corne from the Couinons. 'The
experience bas been, I may say, somèwhat
re-fresbing as compared with the experience in
like Cemmittees of the Commons, -wbere, I
think it is agreed, party politics do semetirnes
enter inte the consideration of their mensures.
I arn anxious that the Sonate should keep its
reputatien in respect te the manner In whieh
it deals with business that cernes before it.
As te attendance at party caucuses or meetings of that sort, it is net neeessary for me te
make a cenfession, but I have net attended a
caucus of Conservatives of the House of GomnA Senator
mons during this wbole Session.
who is a memnber of the part>' bas a right te
attend if bie se desires. Each can exercise bis
ewn judgmtent, however, as te wbether or net
it is wise to attend.
Wb,ere are we at tbis particular tirne? The
impression was strong in this Comrnittee
yesterday, and I think it js equally streng now,
that we can get througha with this incasure

SENATE

of the Bill is a cernparatively new one to me.
One who lives in the East must almost learn
another language in order to understand the
verbiage, the phrases and words, that are
iised in connection with it. The only thing
that is helpful at ail is the knewledge of
trade in other produets such as we have, on
a smaller scale, in the eastern Provinces
That rnay help a little towards understanding
about the s-hipment of grain, 'but in the East
we know practically nothing about the grain
trade. The whole matter deait wit.h in this
Bill was technical, but I think that after a
tirne 1 arrived at a point where I understood
the real difference between these parties.
Frorn the beginning to the end 1 have
considered this Bill with absolute impartiality.
For weeks while it was before Parliarnent I
had no view as te whether 1 would support
it or vote against it, and that is the position
that 1 occupy nowv. I do net care which party
it affects, but I want to get at what is the
right thing te do between these two business
conceras, which we may cail A and B. I arn
not going to be a party to passing legisiatien
te help A to hurt B, or to enable B to hurt
A. Here are two business coacerns, and there
is a good doal to be said in favour of the
view that the honourable member from De
Salab&rry (Hon. Mr. Béique) týakes of it.
His mmnd meets mine on many things that
corne up bore. After ail, it rnîght be theughit
best te keep hands off, and let this matter
go back te the parties concerned, and let
thern figýht it eut as te what their rights are.
There would ho a good deai to say for that,
but I -am not tieýd down to that position.
Sorneone may give a geed reason why wo
sheuld net de t bat.
.I doubt very much whether rny henourable
friend or any other man in this Huse can
wvork this Bill with a view te getting anything
like àpolitical support eut of it. If we adept
the Bill without qualification, or kili it witbeut qualification, wc are going te effend
sornebody. There are twe rival parties, and
tbey cannet be mixed. There are amendments suggested, but the difficulty about the
matter is that, as the mover of the Bill says,
there is new ne one who bas authori-ty te
accept or net accept thcrn. Howevcr, we are
on the eve of rcccipt of information which
will perbaps elear up that difficulty. I cannot
sec that the werld will go te pieces if this
leuse adjouras tili 3 o'cleck, by which time
there sheuld be an answer te these telegrams.

be-that rnany members who want te support
the motion for the adoption of the first clause
will be forced te accept amendments without
knowing whether there is a majority in faveur
ef the first clause. That is ail I was saying,
and I thought that such members of the
Sonate could turn that ever in their minda;
but my good friend from Manitoba (Hon.
Mr. Sharpe)-and I have a grievance against
hima-drew some heat frern me by accusing
me of playing pelitics. I regret that my
honourable friend was cute enough te areuse
me by his interjection. I regret it.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I want te say a word

JULY 2,1926

*

SAs one who has been sitting in this House
for the last 12 or 13 years, 1 wish to say
that in dealing with Bis of this nature,
affecting contending parties and the country
generally, I have flot found that the members
bere violats their obligations by upholding
political partiee. For my own part, since I
came to thîs House I have flot let political
motives interfere with my vote, one way or the
other, and 1 bave neyer been asked or. approached by any person who is in another
place to vote sither for or against any mea8urs.
As far as I kriow, the memibers on this aide
of the House are isft free to act on their own
discretion. I was very sorry to hear political
motives ascribed to any person within this
eHouse, because I do flot believe there is any
mpan on either side of the Hous who is flot
prepared to exercise bis judgment in preference ta that of any polîtical party.
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: May I just
add one more Iink to the chain of evidence
with reference to the misunderstanding that
exista in my bonourabie frisnd'a mind in reference to matters in caucus?
I happsned
ta be one of the comparatively fsw Senators
who attsnded the caucus the other day to
which hae referred, and I desire ta say to him
in ail truthfulnsss, what can be subetantiated
by others who wsrs present, that the subi ect of
the Grain Act was neyer mentioned or discussed at that meeting at ail. Other matters,
as my honourabîs friend quite weIi knows,
*were of more importance at that moment,' and
this Bill was flot mentioned, and there bas
been no discussion of it in caucus so fac as
Senators are concerned.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Honourable gentlemen, the situation is very liksly ta be cleared
up by two o'clock, and 1 would suggest that
we meet at half-past two. Prorogation may
take place this afternoon for ahl we know,
and I think by haif-past two we will have
some knowledge of what is to be done.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: The suggestion that
weshould adjourn until anme time this aftsrnon, in order that in the interval informa-

415

spect to the Grain Bill were presented respsctively hy the bonourable gentleman from
Moose Jaw (Hon. Mr. Willoughby) and the
honourabis member from Saltcoats (Hon.
Mr. Calder). This morning the honnurable
gentleman framn Moose Jaw bas given tbe
House sucb information as hie bas with reference to Vhs set of opinions for which hie is
the able apokesman in this House. The bonourable memnber fromn SaItcoats ysterday referred more t.han once ta an unnamed individual wba had expressed strong opinions
with regard to this matter, and from whom
some information or some instructions had
been rsceived. May I ask the bonourable
gentleman from SaItcoats if bie can give us
any additional information or any further instructions from this unnamed individual that
wvouId assist in charifying the situation?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: 1 am inclined Vo.
think that tbe bonourable gentleman who bas
Just spoken did not catch tbe full purpnrt
of my words. I merely stated that knowh-edge had come to me to the effect that
